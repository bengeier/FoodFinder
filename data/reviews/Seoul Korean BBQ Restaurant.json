{"text":"Tasty interactive eating with ayce bbq. It's definitely fun for a group & a good value but we came out smelling like bbq. I think they definitely should get better ventilation.  My fave was the short ribs, rib eye & beef rib. They were fantastic on a lettuce leaf with a little bit of all the sides available. YUM!   I found the chicken dry and the fried pork and pork ribs pretty unappetizing. The pork belly was ok but I preferred it well done with most of the fat melted off. it tasted pretty good with the soybean past dip.  If ur not adverse to garlic ask for some on the side and pop a few on the grill, pretty tasty with the wrap.   All in all, not a bad place to eat unless you have after dinner plans where u don't want to smell like grilled meat."}
{"text":"Ordered raw beef here and it was one of the worst prepared dishes I've ever had.   I've never heard of Korean \"yook hoi\" being prepared spicy, but perhaps it's a style some do use.   But it was so poorly made that it felt like eating pure garlic in chili sauce.  It was so overpowering that it was as if the beef wasn't there, and it makes me wonder if it was done to cover up for the poor quality of the beef.  Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is pretty good.  You can cook it yourself or they can do it for you.  Extremely large area but it does get busy so reserve a table at prime dinner time.  Bring crappy clothes because it will reek of Korean food when you're done.  I usually go straight home after this place!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I along with another couple and their son had dinner here on the 21st of January and it will be our only visit ever. The Beef Bulgio was as chewy as it get and almost uneatable. The rest of the food was only marginally better. We reapeatedly ask for a bowl of hot water to warm up a baby bottle and finally gave up after an hour. The place seems popular and is well decorated. I would suggest to come here only for the ambiance as the food and the service is a disapointment."}
{"text":"Great food, fun to cook yourself or have them cook for you. Stinkaroo is how you'll smell at the end of the night but well worth it."}
{"text":"So many choices on the menu to choose from and don't know what to eat.  If you want variety, this is the place to be.  It's not just for BBQ, so don't let the name deceive you.  Great food, large portions and the prices are reasonable.  Love the side dishes and enjoyed every last bite until all the food was gone...  Wait what happened?  Oh yeah, I ate all the food."}
{"text":"Yep this is pretty much typical Korean food.  I lived in Korea for a few years and ate BBQ galbi for almost every meal.  The prices aren't the same as Korea (usually $10 a person compared to $30 here) but this is Canada and nothing seems cheap anymore.  Go for the all u can eat and remember that you can refill the meat and sides as much as you want.  Would love it if this place served Makali.  I'll be back next time I need my Dwen-Jung-jeegae fix"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Korea restaurant. Great food great service! We like to cook the food by ourselves, but you can also ask them to do it if you want. Love their \"all you can eat\""}
{"text":"worst manager. he is rude and nonsense. he charged us 20 bucks penalty for not eating salty meat. fucking salty not eatable. worst of the worst. never going back there."}
{"text":"Seoul used to be our go to Korean restaurant.  It recently changed to all you can eat for $30, which includes a buffet which looked so horrible.  The food looked dried, over cooked and sitting all day.  We ordered our meat to be cooked in the kitchen and there was so much sauce that after each piece of meat, we had to drink a cup of tea.  Hopefully they'll go back to how things used to be and not charge $2 for lettuce."}
{"text":"It was my birthday, and we were staying practically across the street. I read the reviews, so my family and I decided to give it a try. We were almost the last people in, and the last ones out. We ordered the kalbi, which was very tasty. Quantity was good. I am not used to paying for extra rice, but we did here, and it was very good!. We are not great fans of kimchi, so no comment there. The marinated bean sprouts and tofu were good. Since we were practically the only ones in the restaurant, the service was a bit lacking. The staff was actually eating dinner in another part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing up until they changed to a buffet style. Now it's terrible and the same price. I will never recommend this place to anyone ever again. It's like they want to lose money now! Up until a couple months ago before they changed I was there a few times per week and the service was excellent. Now. Forget about it!!"}
{"text":"From winter cold season sitting near the grilling stove to keep you warm, to summer hot season sitting near the grill sizzling the steak with a nice cold bottle of Korean Beer. Seoul is one of good indoor Korean BBQ in Cowtown during all season in the past years.   When I step into the main entrance, I scent the sizzling Korean BBQ rushing through my nose. Before the host greeting us. I stomach was growing for starvation and want to order food right away. I almost said: BBQ dinner for four........ Embarrassing....  Anyways, I did order BBQ set dinner and a bottle of Korean Beer. They also serve all you can eat, but set menu is not a bad option: comes with Korean side dish aka kimchi et al, a choice of Seafood pancake or noodles, and a Korean style hot boiling mild spicy miso soup, bowl of steam rice, salad and most importantly main course of an average portion of meat and seafood (which you can choose they grill it for you or I can grill it by myself in middle of the grill table.) Since I do all the grilling, and they eat the food... aka my friend James, but the temptation of the sizzling grilling at front did increase the appetite.   Overall, I will give 3.5 stars. Price vs. food portion was a miss, as in Asian (Korean) market value it should be at least 15% lower what you pay in BBQ set dinner. I'm not sure all you can eat menu or the cost of huge place utilities etc... it should be more control by the owner/management. On Saturday night, service was good: (4 stars) our server was swamped serving table. But she and her team will monitor us when we need something: filling up water and tea to keep us hydrated, and changing the grilling plate to prevent over burn. The most interesting thing at Korean culture is that they work as a team: when the customer leave the table, at least 2 people roll over the cleaning cart, they will hurry clean and set up the table for the next customer come in. I timed average was 1min and 15 sec (at 4 table turn over). Team work motivation was impressive!    Hopefully I can come back again if the price value will be adjust aka note to management: find a better a food suppliers??? And hire more serving staff? Although, we are living in an oil and gas town with party animals, market value does sound like a bias. Sigh!"}
{"text":"This is Korean Resturant offer all you can eat or order of menus. Good value and great variety that will fulfill your tastebuds.  Lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A little disappointing. Went here with friends for a first time experience of korean hot pot. We decided on a medium size which only came with 2 cups serving of rice.... like I could not believe they were for real about that. I am not entirely sure if either our hot pot was bland itself or if it is actually served that way. The side dishes were abysmal. It felt and tasted like they were made three or so days ago. On the bright side, it's cheap! I think I will order something else next time, more on BBQ and not hot pot."}
{"text":"All you can eat buffet, 9 dishes spicy chicken, spicy pork, beef blugugi, ribs etc. $28.89 per person for the Friday night. Enjoyed it with bunch of friends. Quite popular during the night. It comes with salad, 4side dishes, rice etc..If you cannot finish your the dish, they charge about 10 dollars for the extra. First winter snow today. Service is attentive. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"AYCE BBQ with various choices for meats. Tried all the selection, some cooked on the grill ( all the beef selection) and the pork and chicken cooked in the kitchen. The marinated selections were just ok, I was was so thirsty that night. Service was very attentive by changing our grill and placing orders.  Been there done that. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! My friend and I opted out of the all-you-can-eat, but in the end it felt like we ate all we could anyway, there was so much food! We ordered 3 dishes when 2 would've been enough, and were soldiering through by the end of it. I also forgot it always comes with all the little dishes like the kimchi and bean sprouts.  The seafood pancake is pretty tasty. It's a bit more doughy than crispy or flaky here, but it wasn't overly greasy and heavy. A bit too much green onion for my liking though, it was almost like a green pancake instead. I was pretty much just picking out the green onions after a while. The small chunks of octopus/squid makes for nice chewy texture, I wish there was more or maybe even some shrimp in there too.  The jap chae is also good, you can never go wrong with glass noodles in anything really. A bit more seasoning in it would've been nice, but overall still yummy. And of course we had to get the short ribs! They were pricey, almost $30 for an average sized platter but still good. They served it with lettuce, mushrooms and onions but we just ate the ribs on their own, they're always the best part anyway.  Overall service and price were pretty good and I can't complain. Would definitely visit again but next time will make sure to bring all of my appetite to really get the full experience!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got good ratings on yelp, but either they are all fake or people have mostly low standards and expectations. If this is the best of all Korean restaurants in Calgary, then I surely won't try anymore. I was fooled into giving it a try by those ratings.  From the outside it looks dirty and abandoned. Windows have never been cleaned and shutters are down always. When we stepped inside we were greated by a yawning young man who showed us to our table while wiping his nose. The staff were nice but obviously not professional and with no training. They forgot our drinks, didn't bring plates for appetizers, and brought the main dishes 2 minutes after appetizer..eat up! They were just a bunch of young amateurs trying to keep business going while talking together continuously.  They sell chocolate bars and ice cream in near the entrance, and I'm not talking any Korean specialty stuff, but Coffee Crisp bars! I have never seen that in any non-fastfood restaurant in the country.  The whole place has a grim dark ambience, and that's not in a nice or romantic or intended way, and the food is overpriced for what it is. I didn't cook my food myself so I can't talk about that, but the food can be rated as \"ok\". I wouldn't come again though, mainly due to the grim atmosphere and unprofessional service..Koryo fast food is my Korean place to go to from now on."}
{"text":"Have never had Korean food before and this was a excellent experience. Great food matched with awesome service. Would definitely recommend and would return !!"}
{"text":"Korean food in Calgary, never imagined, but there was one.. As we walked in, banchans were welcoming us on each table. Then came pretty red thin sliced beef, then a pot of veges to dip beef. Shabushabu. Beef was good. They say Alberta beef is the best, who knew? Young waiters were serving  us efficiently. Everyone's craving for Korean food by then, it was kinda  a special treat. Some Koreans have to eat rice and kimchee always and anywhere."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Atmosphere: 2.5/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 2.5/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  eh....I dunno why people keep coming here for Korean food. It is a OK Korean restaurant but I've had better Korean food elsewhere (like Sura's, Koreana, or Dae Jang Geum). Usually with greater quantity, comes with decreased quality and Seoul is a definite representation of that.  I've come here a couple times with my friends and they usually like to get  Seoul's BBQ combination for around $69 for 2-3 people and increases with more people. The portion of meat is quite big and unless all 3 people have big appetites you will not be able to finish. Their combos are usually enough to feed what they recommend plus 1-2 people.  Their BBQ combination comes with rice; side dishes (kimchi, pickled daikon radish, bean sprouts, lovely honey-garlic glazed potatoes, and sometimes deep fried tofu); Japchae (Korean glass noodles); smoked salmon coleslaw/salad with a creamy fruity tasting dressing; a shrimp, tofu and zucchini soup; seafood pancake; shrimp, mussels, squid, and a variety of meats (pork, chicken, beef, short ribs) that can be cooked by the kitchen or yourself.   The combos are nice to get for large groups and when you want to try a little bit of everything but the overall taste and quality of the food is underwhelming, bland, and just not very good. The seafood pancake can be very salty at times, soggy, and too doughy; the dressing on their coleslaw/salad is a little off and unusual tasting. The taste of the meat can be a hit and miss, but I usually find it a miss with it tasting very bland. The marinade on the bulgogi chicken and pork is very pasty and chalky and doesn't have that unique strong chili taste associated with bulgogi. The only thing I found consistent and delicious from the BBQ combos is the japchae.  The rest of their menu is quite big, a little overwhelming for me. I've tried the Bibimbap (rice mixed with meat, vegetables, an egg, and chili pepper paste) which was bland and soggy; their Kimchi soup (spicy) had a bit of a kick but was watered down and lacked the development of a deep and rich soup base; their Yook Gae Jang (spicy beef and vegetable soup with noodles) was decent; and their seafood hotpot was kind of disappointing- just a bunch of unseasoned seafood boiled in a broth and is definitely not worth the price.  The food comes out in a very reasonably quick time, but the actual service suffers especially on busy nights (usually the weekend) where the servers would forget to refill your tea pot or side dishes. The place is ver big and because im kind of OCD i  find the lack in matching teapots and plates annoying. Expect to come out smelling like bbq because there is a lack of ventilation and everything becomes hazy.    Overall, the food at Seoul is OKAY but I would highly recommend you go elsewhere in Calgary like Koreana (further down Macleod Trail) or Sura's for more authentic Korean flavours. If it's your first time trying Korean, Seoul is definitely a bad representation of it. The only good thing going for this place is that it's big and can hold a lot of large groups, and you are able to get large portions of meat with the BBQ combos. However, like I mentioned, although the food comes out quick and there are large portions, the quality often suffers. Definitely, skip this place and save your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in Calgary. Since I left San Francisco, I crave real authentic Korean food where you cook on the table and great side dishes. This is the place where all the Calgarian asians go. They have all you can eat menu, prices and portions are good. Good ambiance and service.  The only downfall is I prefer more variety of side dishes like fishcakes, cucumbers salad... But I haven't found any korean place that offers it other than in SF."}
{"text":"I've had good Korean food in Asia for years, and therefore have come to know good Korean from mediocre or poor.  After having a Caucasian acquaintance recommend it, in anticipation I went to this BBQ place, and ordered one of my favorite dishes, gumja-tang (pork backbone soup with potato), and of course the usual Korean appetizers. What terrible drek! The taste was flat, and the portions of meat on the bone short on quantity. The appetizers were okay but also forgettable. As is often the case here in Canada, this type of place has drastically watered down flavours until they match, I guess, the palate of the average western customer. For this alone I drop this rating from 2 stars to 1. I do not like to be duped. But for those who know or want to know good Korean, head down to Bon-ga in Chinatown, and order the same dish and/or try the spicy squid and pork bulgogi. What a treat. But steer clear of this pretender..."}
{"text":"I received a gift certificate from my brother to try this place out. He suggested that my wife and I try the all-you-can-eat menu so we did.  The buildings outside appearance is run down and dated. Located off of Macleod Trail, this place definitely does not scream HEY YOU SHOULD EAT IN HERE to people driving by.   That being said, my wife and I gave it a shot. Initial impression of the interior was better than we expected. It seemed clean and it was really quite large. We got seated right away with no reservation and a server came and took our drink order right away.   Service was fast, and friendly. We ate our body weight in calbi and bulgogi, went through several plates of kimchi, rice and the other sides. We were both pleased with the food. We both had low expectations going in and left happy. I have tried quite a few of the Korean places in town and I would probably come back here if I was really hungry."}
{"text":"Great experience. The first time we came (when it very first opened), it wasn't great but we just wnt again and everything was deliciious!  Would definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best korean bbq restaurant in Calgary. I never give 5 stars on a restaurant, but they deserve it. 10/10 service 10/10 food ( the rib-eye bbq was the best )"}
{"text":"Went for the all-you-can-eat buffet for $30. You have to go up and get your own food, including the side dishes. This is a new process. I believe they started it six days ago.  There's some hot food like crispy chicken, battered shrimp, fried tofu, noodles, mussels, etc. While the selection was large, much of the hot food was cold. Shrimp still had the vein in it. The best of the bunch were the fried dumplings and glass noodles.  The selection of banchans was large, but most were not pickled or flavourful. Pretty bland. Normally this is my favourite part of Korean food.   The meats were the best part, except for the pork belly which was tasteless. I enjoyed the beef short ribs and beef the most. My husband liked the pork and lean meats.   Though you had to go get your own food, the staff were really on the ball, picking up plates, replacing the grill, answering questions, etc. If you eat a lot, I can see the appeal. The bill came to $80 after tip and a drink. I would rather spend my money on less food but more flavour."}
{"text":"Ooohhh nothing beats hot food on a cold day. Came here for there hot stone bowl dishes for lunch. We ordered the beef bulgogi and the bibimbap which both come out piping hot. The bulgogi was very flavourful it came with a side of rice but there were noodles in the soup. The bibimbap is served in the hot stone bowl making the rice on the bottom extra crispy....yum!   The service was 5/5 and there limited parking in the front but ample parking in the back of the restaurant.   They seem to be more popular for family style asian hot pot and Korean bbq. I definitely will be returning with the fam jam next time."}
{"text":"This is the first time i tried actual korean bbq place in town  other than koryo ( fast food chain).. and absolutely delicious. We went as a big group and ordered all you can eat beef ribeye, beef ribs, chicken. Food was served quickly and hot. Everyone dug in so fast and finished the food that we had to order again.It was  so good that we went again next month. We didn't get to BBQ our own both times..May be next time we will try that. Service is really good. Perfect place for a group gathering and catch up friends and families."}
{"text":"Had the all-you-can-eat option which comes with 9 diff BBQ meats & some sides. Their kalbi was pretty good but really didn't enjoy the other BBQ meats very much. When they bring out the strips of meat, it actually is a lot less than what you order..when we asked for 5, a lot of it came with just the bones and a few pieces with solid meat on it. Unfortunately with buffet style the food may not come out as quick so you end up getting fuller while waiting. I still think the AYCE option is worth it though because if your meat doesn't come with as much as you'd like, you just keep ordering!"}
{"text":"very rare I give 5 stars...  I can honestly say that over the last 5 years I've been here well over 30 times. The craze for this place started when my uncle married a lovely Korean lady and me and my new Korean aunt couldn't get enough of this place.   Since we've gone so often, the owner treats us with so much respect and kindness. The staff in general is very nice and the location and the restaurant itself is very good.  The quality of food you get is unmatched in my opinion when you combine it with the \"All you can eat\" and fast service and a very reasonable price.   Most bottomless plate restaurants do not offer much quality on via a la carte, but this restaurant does not have this problem at all with delicious variety and great Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"We went here after a tiring day from a long drive, the guy I spoke to on the phone was very accomodating. The place itself is spacious and clean. The service is really commendable and food is quality and great. We had the all you can eat and All of us were truly satisfied! We will definitely come back here when we go to Calgary again."}
{"text":"We found out about this via Yelp.  You grill your meat tableside, or the kitchen will cook it for you.  They recently started an all you can eat selection, and we went with that and opted for tableside cooking.  Sliced rib eye, shredded pork, marinated rib eye, and pork belly.  The traditional Korean accompaniments, including kimchee, spicy tofu, green beans, and Korean radishes.  It was fun, and the food was outstanding.  The servers zip around the restaurant, constantly checking on you, changing out the grill top so that you don't get a burned taste on the food, refreshing the sides, and generally paying attention to be sure you have a good experience.  One tipoff that this was a good Korean restaurant, most everyone dining there was Korean! A fun, different experience."}
{"text":"My wife love this joint! Ayce is good and the quality of food is high! I just don't like the new charge on side dishes. There's other restaurants in town that will give you refills for free."}
{"text":"Oh man, where can I start? The Korean BBQ here was absolutely delicious. I was in the mood for some authentic bugolgi and korean style ribs, and this place satisfied my appetite perfectly! I ordered the all-you-can-eat buffet for $25, and I ended up eating more than I bargained for. Of course, the restaurant management prevents customers from ordering too much and wasting meat; they control this by placing a $10 charge for any leftover meat. Luckily for my group, we ended up eating every last riblet right down to the bone.  The atmosphere is a contemporary yet traditional Korean restaurant. Ironic, huh? They have cultural decorations hanging on the wall, but they also have the steel and chrome grills on the ceiling and glossed wooden tables that were surprisingly clean, considering the number of customers eating there and the oil that sprayed out of the grill.  We decided to grill our own meat, which was a fun experience. Our waitress basically brought over a generous plate of raw meat, and we used the tongs and scissors to cook our own food. A quick tip: wear clothing that you don't mind getting infused with the tasty aroma of Korean BBQ fumes. I wore an old jacket and a school shirt. Be prepared to smell like Bugolgi upon leaving the restaurant!!  The service was great, but nothing extraordinary. Our waitress was kind, but because there was a great deal of customers (the restaurant always has a steady flow!), she sometimes took a while to get our order. However, the waiters are always quick to change the metal grill on the table - this helps make cleaning off the black char a little bit easier.   Lastly, the food was above par. Before finding this restaurant, I had been craving Korean BBQ for a long time. Correction: I had been craving TASTY Korean BBQ for a long time. The BBQ restaurants in my neighborhood are overpriced and serve cardboard on plates. This place had filling food for a semi-decent priced. It isn't too realistic to expect to find a Korean BBQ restaurant that won't suck out your wallet. In my neighborhood, good food comes with a price.  I will most definitely come back to Seoul Korean BBQ Restaurant for more delicious Bugolgi, Kimchi, and Ribs. If only I had the bank to eat here every day!! This place is as good as it gets.  Now here's a knee slapper for you: this place probably serves the best SEOUL food in the entire city!! Ha! Ha!"}
{"text":"They recently changed their layout to an all you can eat buffet style, and the overall quality has gone down by a bit. All their precooked meats and banchan's were very high and sodium and were all very spicy, which made me drink a lot of water (I don't know if they did this on purpose). The only thing that I thought tasted good was the pork ribs. The pork belly was a bit over cooked. Also, if you want lettuce you have to pay $2.00 for it?? I liked how it was before, it sucks that they changed it."}
{"text":"It's fun to get to cook your own food and catch up with friends but you use the same tongs to put raw chicken on the grill as you do to take off any cooked food. I'm always worry when it's no big deal to share the same tongs with raw meat as the cooked stuff you are about to ingest. The sushi is on par with most average restaurants and the Korean BBQ actually tastes pretty good except for the danger involved with eating it. The service can be snail slow and I suggest ordering two drinks at once because you will sit a long time without a refill otherwise. I don't go here often but overall it's not that bad. Definitely not my first choice though. If they fix the raw meat tong sharing I will consider trying it more."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Korean place in Calgary. Clean establishment and Korean staff making some amazing dishes!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday dinner with FAM here twice. It's always good and yummy. All you can eat BBQ comes with rice, kimchi, salads, and some other sides. Last night's service by our lady server ( it's a shame i didnt get her name) was great. She was friendly, fast and attended to all our needs. One tip though if you're already starving, order half of whatever you want cooked in the kitchen and half for you to cook on your table grill. So while you're grilling you're also already eating. It takes such a long time to cook by yourself LOL.   -At the end of the meal they serve you with this yakult-like drink. It's yummy!  -Washrooms are just okay, and they have Listerines to wash the mouth after eating so much bbqs !"}
{"text":"The food was so good the taste of it made me feel like I was on vacation .the owner is super friendly and nice really makes you feel important . Five stars he deserves it."}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat Korean BBQ last Friday, without a reservation I might add, but I only had to wait for about 10 minutes before getting seated. We had the choice of cooking our own meat or having the kitchen do that for us and we chose to let the kitchen take care of it! I was so hungry that if I had tried to cook anything, I might have just eaten it raw so this was a good choice haha  We ordered kalbi, beef bulgogi, spicy chicken, ribeye and pork belly. On the menu, there was also fried chicken, spicy pork and pork ribs. The portion sizes of each of these items was about a fist but its very variable because the second round of kalbi was much less. With all the side dishes that came along with our orders, this was a lot of food. The side dishes that we had was salad, potatoes, kimchi, fish cakes, and soybean sprouts. Amongst the meat - I liked the kalbi the best - it was tender and perfectly sauced. The pork belly was too fried and was hard to bite as a result. Among the side dishes, the potatoes were definitely my favourite.   The cost was $28 per person and there is a charge of $10 if any item that was ordered was not eaten. At the end, I liked that they gave us the yogurt probiotic drink to wash it all down!   Overall, I really liked this place, the servers are nice and the food was really good. I would go back just for the kalbi!"}
{"text":"Love pork belly. But the mushroom is unwashed. I have to use the water to clean it again. So many dust on it. They really should wash it before they serve it on the table. Other than this, it's all good."}
{"text":"All you can eat korean bbq is amazing! Taste awesome and the service was nice, well money spent!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has done an amazing job of upscaling the Korean BBQ restaurant to what one might see in Seoul. Not only that but it has maintained an amazing reputation, good quality, pretty good service, and a nice price to complete the package. Many of the non-Korean people I know have experienced this restaurant and I am proud to say it has become a bit of a hallmark for Korean BBQ in Calgary.  I would encourage going with a Korean friend as the service usually gets better, and they have a better idea of what to order. The BBQ combos here offer a great variety of meat and side dishes and the price tag is honestly nothing compared to the amount of food you get.  It's definitely become very popular and busy so the service isn't always spectacular (did you know on the weekends this restaurant only hires men because of the strenuous work load?) but if you don't mind taking the time to cook your own meat (and don't order much of the side dishes) then your dining experience won't be totally ruined. Also for those of you who complain about the service, in Korean restaurants servers don't come to the table unless they are called (it's a cultural difference! not that they don't care). Again my advice about taking a Korean friend will help you here!   PS. If you haven't noticed I am Korean and I'd love to be your Korean friend =) How can I refuse a free meal at Korean BBQ?"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go if you want to have your fill of Korean BBQ. There aren't a whole lot of other options available in Calgary for this type of meal. The best part of the dining experience here is that it is self-serve, even the meat, which is nice as you do not have to wait for or deal with the servers. The rest of the buffet options are decent, but some of them (such as the kimchi) were quite lacklustre."}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't had good Korean BBQ in the longest time. Time flies - it's been over two years, the last time was straight from the motherland of South Korea. Anyways, we were hankering for some all you can eat Korean BBQ goodness so we hit up Seoul Korean BBQ. A no frills, grungy from the outside looking restaurant - aka. my kind of joint.  We went on a Saturday evening and the place was busy. Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait and were seated right away. My poor sis, she couldn't eat 99% of the menu (no gluten/no egg) so she had to settler for a soft tofu dish while she watched us devour through the all you can eat (AYCE) menu ($26.95/person).  The AYCE menu consists of 9 meat selections, 4 side dishes, rice and onion salad.  The ban chan (side dishes) were decent (potato, kim chi, bean sprouts). Our favourite was definitely the marinated bean sprouts, yum.  They also bring you a small bowl of sweet Korean hot sauce and a side of lettuce wraps (if you want to make lettuce wrap sandwiches).  We tried all 9 of the different types of meat (beast mode) and my favourite was the spicy pork bulgogi and deep fried chicken. The deep fried chicken was really good - good sauce, crunchy but felt nice and light. Not your typical deep fried chicken. Pork bulgogi was nice and spicy, just the way I like it. Pork belly had so much fat on it, it was ridiculous! We were definitely disgusted by all the fat grease oozing out but that's pork belly for you!  Anyways, service was good (they came to switch out our BBQ grills several times) and food was tasty. We ended the meal with these Korean sweet mini drinks (not sure what they were called) but was a perfect way to end our meal."}
{"text":"The BBQ is of pretty good quality. I enjoy it whenever I come, which isn't too often. It gets busy on the weekends here!! Bring a garbage bag to put your jacket inside or it will smell like BBQ smoke!"}
{"text":"So we were searching for somewhere new to have lunch last weekend and found this little place on Yelp (of course) so we thought we'd give it a try. We weren't terribly hungry so we decided not to get the all-you-can-eat feature, although we made a mental note to come back with friends sometime and try it. We instead ordered dumplings for an appetizer, and how can you not have bulgogi at a Korean restaurant? The dumplings were fantastic. We had the pork and kimchi flavor, and they came out smokin' hot, slightly crispy on the outside, and a nice mild spiced flavor on the inside.  I've decided I prefer these dumplings to gyoza (the Japanese equivalent) because of the slightly fluffier dough that was lightly fried and toasted on the outside. The bulgogi was great too. We had classic beef, and it came with four side dishes and two sauces plus rice.  We opted to have the kitchen cook it, as my husband doesn't love the idea of having to cook your own food at a restaurant (even though I find that really fun to do! Perhaps next time....) Even sharing that amount of food we ended up taking home leftovers! Pleasant attentive staff, clean restaurant, and good food - what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Wow talk about amazing Korean food.  The place must have over 60 tables and on Friday night it was packed.  A good ethnic restaurant is amazing when you see people from its ethnic community in it.  Believe me there were not only Koreans here but also tons of Filipinos, Viets and Chinese.  We had a great BBQ combination for 2 to 3 people that cost 69 dollars and the value of this is amazing as we ate over 16 dishes.  I am not too familiar with Korean food so it was like travelling to another country.  First of all the place is really nice, very open and has high ceilings and great colors.  The furniture is modern and there are separated areas so you feel like you are in separate rooms.    You have the option of cooking the meal at your table and because none of us although Asian knew how to cook Korean food we choose the cooked option.  Every plate soon just came flowing out, everything was so fresh and well presented, let me outline our meal.  First you get the appetizers, the kim chee, spicy daikon, mackeral in tomato sauce and collard greens and lettuce.  I found alot of this too spicy but nonetheless I tried it anyways, and I used the lettuce kind of like a taco to eat everything.   Radish and green pepper with sweet and sour garlic sauce, soy weed soup , seafood pancake or bulgogi  japche, stir fried noodles with marinated beef, marinated beef rib, marinated beef bulgogi, marinated chicken bulgogi, marinated spicy pork bulgogi, marinated short ribs, mussels, prawns and squid.  Overall an amazing price for so much food, I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good deal. For dinner AYCE BBQ is only $30. Unlimited meat and they are so generous in the meat. I enjoyed cooking the food myself. Good food and very good service.   The menu is a bit simple for the AYCE. There are only about 9 different meat selection to choose from and for me because I don't eat spicy, I only have 5 choices. Overall, I enjoyed having dinner here.   There are free parking in front. So that is a plus. Thumbs up to this AYCE BBQ dinner buffet place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today based on what I had read on Yelp.  On the one hand, you won't go home hungry.  We were stuffed when we went home. On the other hand, the food was nothing special and the tea was mediocre.  At this price point, don't skimp on the tea!  The ribs were good and the actual BBQ items were decent. All of the sides were poor though, pickled everything.  I don't regret going but I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a BBQ lunch on Sunday to find out they recently changed to a buffet style type of restaurant. There is the option to either get the precooked bbq or the raw meat that you cook yourself at the table. I would highly recommend cooking it yourself as the meat was cold when I got it from the buffet table. I've never liked the spicy chicken here, I think it's the marinade they use; it changes the texture of the chicken too much.  There's a large selection of banchans and sides to pick from the buffet stations. Loved the cold tofu! There was a good variety of hot sides as well. Really enjoyed their dumplings, japchae, and seafood pancake.  There's also a DIY bimbimbap station and two varieties of rice to choose from (barley and regular). There was also three soups to choose from (seaweed, spicy pork, and spicy beef). Overall, not too bad for a $15 buffet lunch. Would be willing to go when I have a hankering for a large amount of korean food on a budget."}
{"text":"I just love korean bbq and when I travel it is the first restaurant I look for. Decided on this one and was a bit sad I did.  But first the good. The service was wow. I never needed for anything. The would change my grill every time i had new meat. I must say that was the first korean bbq to do that for me of all the one i went to. The ognion salad was... Just say I ordered 3 hehe. The place looked clean as i only went from the door to my table. Bit now to the not so good. The meat had no taste.  The reason i love bbq is the taste and that is where i was let down and that is why the 2*. The porc ribs tasted like it was cook in water. I will pass on this place if I am back in Calgary"}
{"text":"Great Korean buffets, the server asked me whether I want to cook the meats myself or have the kitchen cook for me. I chose to have the kitchen cooked for me. The Ribs are very tender and the beefs are very fresh, they brought me the foods less than 10 mins, amazingly fast service.  They offer me more meats, but I am full. Highly recommend to big meat eaters.  Plenty of parking at noon."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the family. Basically ordered the basics in the lunch specials, bibimbap, Kalbi, Bulgogi. Everything was ok, nothing really to complain about except that the place is LARGE and the servers seemed to be walking long distances from the kitchen and around so it makes the service a little slow at times. It's the closest Korean restaurant to me so I would stop by for convenience sake.  My first time having Korean meal in Calgary so I'm interested to see what other restaurants are out there."}
{"text":"A big fan of this place as a lunch quick and dirty @ 19.99 per person for all you can eat! Also try the onion dressing salad was actually much better than anticipated!"}
{"text":"Not the worst Korean BBQ in Calgary but also not the best.  I find their combos are quite pricey and they ran out of a usual side dish without telling us.  The service is prompt but ill informed.  When we asked if their vegetable dumplings contained any source of meat they said they would have to ask the kitchen.  They came back and said it was fine.  When we bit into the dumplings we found small pieces of meat.  Air quality (although common for a BBQ) is not that great either."}
{"text":"Seoul Korean BBQ is popular for their all you can eat menu. You have a choice of spicy chicken, LA kalbi, pork belly, pork shoulder, etc. You also get side dishes and rice with your AYCE order. I recently heard that refills on your side dishes are not free. I haven't had this problem as I have never needed refills on my side dishes. This would be a negative since all Korean restaurants I have been do free refills on their side dishes.   AYCE is pretty good, especially the kalbi and pork belly. You can ask to have the meat cooked at the back instead, if you don't want to smell like grilled meat at the end of your meal. The a la cart menu is also good, but not exceptional. They also have a set menu, that I would not recommend. We have tried it multiple times and we have always left disappointed and thinking that we should have just have the AYCE. The set menu gives you an array of dishes, but the assortes grilled seafood part of it is lacking quiet a bit and all we could taste was the residue of the seafood being frozen.   The service is good and the orders come in quickly. Although our last 2 visits out water took too long to get filled and the servers did not visit our table until almost the end of our meal.   Overall, I think Seoul Korean BBQ is good, but definitely not the best korean bbq in Calgary. I would recommend to just stick with the AYCE to get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times for lunch now, and once for ayce bbq dinner. The staff are friendly and the service is fairly quick. The menu is fairly complete with a sample from several different types of Korean cuisine. Nothing special about the atmosphere.  I've had the gamjatang (pork back bone soup), haemul sundubu jjigae (seafood soft tofu stew), beef short rib lunch box and the ayce bbq. I have to say that the BBQ here is pretty good! The beef was delicious and tender, the pork was fatty and tasty, and the chicken was good but a bit dry. Definitely some of the better Korean BBQ ayce I've had. I think my faves were the rib eye and short ribs... nom nom nom... That said, sadly the ayce is only meat and banchan. There are no options for soups or appetizers which I found a bit disappointing for over $30/person. The banchan I've had here were bean sprouts, honey potatoes, kimchi, and fish cakes. I wasn't a big fan of the potatoes personally. They're deep fried which I'd never had for the glazed potatoes before. I prefer the pan fried texture. The rest of the banchan were decent but not fabulous.  The soups are decent but lack complexity. The broth could use more time for the flavours to meld and perhaps a pinch more of the spices would help. The Asian in me loved cleaning those pork back bones which had beautifully tender meat on them and delicious fat and cartilage! I am quite thorough compared to my friends and see it as getting that full flavour you would miss otherwise!  Overall I would recommend Seoul, especially by Calgary standards and for some Korean dishes you don't see everywhere. For example, although I haven't tried them yet, they have a few cold buckwheat noodle dishes that I cant wait to sample! I'll be back to have BBQ for sure and some (sadly) expensive soju.... but I guess that's just standard here in Canada   Happy eating folks!"}
{"text":"Took my mum for Mother's Day Lunch Celebrations at Seoul.  The restaurant was quite full.  We decided to have the 4-5 persons BBQ meal.  We also decided to cook the meal ourselves.  You have the option of having the kitchen cook the meal for you.  Once the BBQ is on, the exhaust vents are on full force.  Still you do smell a bit like the BBQ when you leave, be forewarned.  The salmon salad, the side dishes (kim chee, spicy daikon, mackerel in tomato sauce, collard greens), the soup, hot bean paste, fresh garlic, onion and the basket of romaine lettuce came out.  Then, the platter of raw bulgogi beef, pork, chicken, beef short ribs, beef ribs, prawns, squid, mussels and mushrooms.  Covered hot metal bowls of rice were then served.  The waitress placed some of the raw food on the bbq and it's such a neat experience!  The bbq grill is changed throughout the meal the moment it's coated with charbroiled bits.  A pair of tongs and a large pair of scissors were given to help us cook the food.  The scissors was useful in cutting up the cooked meat after.  Let me tell you the food was well received by all!  We love Seoul's BBQ!    The service was impeccable.  Very watchful and observant.  Always asked if we wanted more side dishes.  I think we had side dishes brought round 4 times!!  No charge for extra side dishes."}
{"text":"Came into Calgary for the weekend, was recommended to come here. The service was exceptional, all the side dishes are free refills and when asked for more, it was refilled very quickly, the bulgogi beef was very flavorful. I had actually left my tail lights on, and when we asked if anyone in the store had one, the owner gave us his and our waiter actually came out to help us boost my car. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service makes this place an ideal location for a different lunch experience. There are a variety of lunch boxes to chose from and an offering of all you can eat choices as well. The food here is hot, fresh, and delicious."}
