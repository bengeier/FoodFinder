{"text":"Second time eating here! really delicious and def a plus they open late!! would recommend this place to everyone.  Hamid is a nice guy!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Quick, easy, affordable, fresh ingredients, and great service. Perfect place to grab a bite on the go. Definitely one of the best donair shops in Calgary."}
{"text":"Hamid is just the nicest, most hardworking guy ever and his shawarmas and donairs are fantastic. The shop is one of the later ones that are open on the weekends so if you want a late night shawarma and don't want to deal with the drunk people and lineups downtown then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Came here due to the food reviews and I'm quite disappointed. 
The man helping me was quite solemn and Eeyore like attitude. As I was still paying through the debit machine he already started making my two chicken shawarma. Didn't ask what I wanted on it. I don't like hummus yet it and the garlic sauce was already on both wraps. Toppings I got were tomato, onion and banana pepper. He put so many onions the wraps are not enjoyable. The tomatoes are so far from ripe they have no taste. It completely overpowers any other taste. Garlic sauce has no flavor also. Asked for sweet sauce and he started to put a reddish hue sauce on, I asked what that was and he said sweet sauce. I said I though sweet sauce was white. Apparently they have two sweet sauces, so why not say I have two which one would you like? Just felt a complete lack of customer service.
Sliced chicken off the big rotating piece then chopped it up on the flat top and basically dried it out. Not very good. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I went there tonight to try out their Donair. Just like the reviews previous to me already mentioned, the owner is a true gem and makes absolutely sure that you enjoy his food. I had the large beef Donair and found the flavors amazing!! The portion was big and definitely worth the price. I'll add some pictures to this review, but I can surely recommend this place to anyone who likes donairs or shawarma. The offering at this location has something for everyone."}
{"text":"So good. Hamid is so nice and really cares about his customers. The food is top notch."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Hamid is very kind and sweet and the donairs are made with love! He stayed open just so we can make it after we gave him a call!!"}
{"text":"Awesome and HUGE donairs! Nice variety of toppings and good quality meat. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The donair was amazing. It was thick cut meat. Proper serving on veggies and sauces in the wrap.

Also predwred a meat pie and samosa. They were both fantastic. Really really enjoyed the food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Schwarzman place. We were drawn to this place due to its high rating. It did not disappoint. Ordered a chicken and donair, Hamid took special care making both and we could tell he takes pride in his product.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place. Hamid gives you tons of fresh meat, veggies and sauce. The donairs are delicious and the prices are good. We get donairs here every time we have a craving."}
{"text":"The food is really quite good. And the service is excellent. It's wonderful."}
