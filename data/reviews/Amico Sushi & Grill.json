{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise. All the dishes were very nicely presented. The avocado tuna salad was delicious. The gyoza fresher and lighter than most places. The wakame salad was great as well.  The sweet potato roll was awesome!    It always seems empty when I go by this spot,  it was when we went in.  It's probably the best sushi in the little Italy area and I hope it stays busy because it's actually quite good."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Top quality. Excellent value! Beautiful presentation. Very good service. The decor is very well done. We will definitely be eating there again, and will be recommending Amico Sushi to our friends."}
{"text":"Top notch sushi! Beautiful interior decor and great vibe. The staff has been friendly each time I've gone and the service very good overall. You would expect a sushi place of this quality to be more expensive but the value is outstanding. The presentation and taste of the sushi is some of the best I've had in Toronto. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish, love the decoration on food. Too pretty to eat!  Like the fact that they have fresh raw fish with decent cooked food that is different from regular sushi restaurant. Great place to go with friends to share dishes and enjoy drinks. A bit too quiet, but can hear yourself think unlike some other places."}
{"text":"Nice place with great service. The waitress asked us to take a polaroid picture of us to go on their wall of happy customers. We were happy to represent the USA. Sushi sucks in upstate NY"}
{"text":"It's my first time trying at Amico! The sashimi and sushi is very fresh!!! I was very surprised of the chef's garnish presentation... Too pretty to eat lol! Waitresses were able to explain all kinds of fish and sauces for the garnish. Also sometimes they give complimentary appetizer! And it was funny that they take photo when we finished eating. To post on the wall and remember us.Definitely wanna come back here for lunch too! They have big portion of sushi and sashimi plates with very reasonable price! I will be the regular customer here! Love it so much"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place isn't as busy as it should be. Then again, who really thinks of Little Italy when it comes to sushi? You have two decent izakayas on College but only AYCE sushi (Sushi Bon, Sashimi Island, New Sushi Island) otherwise. Sometimes, you just gotta treat yourself to some...  High Quality Sashimi!   Plating is beautiful, flavours are fresh, portions are fantastic. Service is friendly and attentive! I downed several cups of water upon entry and it was ICE COLD. This is so very appreciated! Especially as a cyclist in this summer heat (feels like 32 degrees celsius...). Thanks for accommodating my massive gulps of water! And for the perfect level of AC!  Amico's video gives you a good idea of the ambiance as well! Love the wooden benches at the back - they are the perfect distance from the bar, heh. I'd say this is a very versatile space for a chill catch-up sesh with the bestie, a small birthday lunch, casual date, family dinner, food to grab before a night on the town. Come as you are.  Now onto the food; here's what we got (and what we would get again with friends):  Sushi and Sashimi for One 6 pcs of sashimi, 4 pcs of nigiri + 6 pcs of spicy roll --Not sure if they always blowtorch nigiri rolls, but this was fantastic. I would've never finished this by myself! Thank you for the melt-in-my-mouth-UNF salmon  Sea Honey Pan-fried shrimp, scallop, mussels and vegetables + honey butter --Mussels were on the small side but the SHRIMP AND SCALLOP all made up for it! We appreciated the stir-fried vegetables too. Not oily, great crunch, nom.  AMICO YOLO Panko B.B.Q eel, crab meat, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, cheese topped with spicy mixed fish, organic greens + fried leek --If you like cheese in your sushi rolls, you'll like this. There was SO MUCH sashimi in the center salad and for $18, it's superb value!  Looking forward to being back and trying the omakase!"}
{"text":"This is officially my favourite downtown sushi resto!!  Superb quality, very tasty food, beautiful presentation at a very good price! Oh I forgot mention in a very modern and inviting space.    I was very excited to try Amico seeing all the five stars reviews here.  When I opened up the menu, I couldn't believe the prices they are charging specially in a neighbourhood like little Italy!  We started with a free edamame (just check in on yelp), Oysters (love the homemade tartar dip), tako wasabi and pork Gyoza (so crispy).  All the appies were very good.  For the main, we ordered the deluxe sashimi and sushi.  The sashimi came in 21 pieces.  Some were seared while others came with special sauces on top of each fish giving it a more unique taste and complimenting the texture of the fish. I really like all the little details they put into the presentation, looks divine!  Our deluxe sushi was just equally impressive! It came with 12 pieces of nigiri and a dynamite roll for only $21!!! That's a steal in my opinion.   They also have hot dishes on their menu like bulgogi and kalbi dinners that comes with soup and salad for $12-$15.    I'm definitely coming back to try their other appies and hot dishes!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! My boyfriend & I are absolutely gobsmacked as to why this place isn't more popular, so I decided I'd help out by giving them a raving review, as they deserve more business! I first heard about this place from a BlogTO review & the pics looked amazing, so we decided to come on down. The prices are ridiculous, as in ridiculously fair, for what you're about to be blessed with?! For the great quality and freshness and be-YOO-tiful presentation, everything is a steal!!   So you have low prices, and high quality, fantastically presented food. What's NOT to love?  My BF reaaaally enjoys their Sea Honey, and I love all their sashimi trays! Oh man, I kinda want to go back tonight, now that I'm re-living my experiences... The waitresses are always very pleasant as well =)  We've already returned for a second visit! Go on, give Amico a try...you'll love it too!"}
