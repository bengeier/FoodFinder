{"text":"My daughter and I are both picky about the sushi; she loves this place hands down so we only go here when the craving for sushi hits. The food is just amazing and delicious. My daughter often orders two plates of california rolls; her fave. Rice is good and food is just right. Not over or under cooked at all. I love their good prices; not even overpriced at all. :) The waitress was very sweet and nice. Hubs asked for extra pickled ginger and got that."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend. I highly recommend it to anyone else in the area. Fast service. Fair prices. And the quality/flavor of the food is top notch."}
{"text":"My wife, My Parents and My Sister had the opportunity to visit this restaurant on opening night and despite opening night jitters, the food was excellent, the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"A good place to be in. Sushi not the best but good and the rest of the food is great. The staff is great aswell. I'm not a big fan of japanese food but this one is by far the best one in airdrie"}
{"text":"We ate here with friends tonight and I have to say I was a little apprehensive as our 22 year old whose birthday celebration this was is a very picky eater.   Everything we ordered was excellent from the sushi and gyoza to the teriyaki chicken and udon beef.  The staff were very attentive and the food arrived quickly and sizzling on skillets. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Zenbu is almost always great. I don't like their California roll recipe, but the Beebeem Bap, Bulgogi, Bento Boxes, Ton Catsu, and rolls are always great.   Fish is usually tasty."}
{"text":"I am so happy we found this place!!! We live a in Canmore and had business in Red Deer. We stopped at this place and boy what a treat. The place is so clean, great service, nice decor and great food!!! You will not be disappointed !!!!"}
{"text":"Zenbu is a nice little family run sushi restaurant in the heart of Airdrie.  The food is good, the staff are pleasant, the space is clean and open.  As usual, I ordered Edemame, Salmon Sashimi, Tuna Sashimi (white only no red!), Salmon Maki, Vegetable Maki (Avocado, Cucumber, Carrot), and a few other relatively clean maki roll variations.  Zenbu is a solid good."}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I just moved to Airdrie from Calgary, and lets just say Zenbu was a contributing factor! I'm from Vancouver and I've had my fair share of sushi and sashimi and figured anything in Alberta couldn't possibly compare...I was wrong.  The sashimi is among the best I've had. We haven't had a bad roll yet, and we've made a few return trips to try more. The inside of the restaurant is quite nice.  I was quite surprised the first time we ate there. This is our sushi restaurant now, as it easily tops any of the sushi joints we've been to in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd love Sushi until I went to Zenbu. I absolutely love their food. Have definitely found my favourite Sushi Restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm Japanese and I also like Korean foods. Overall I like this place. The raw fishes are quite good and fresh, and sushi rice is nicely steamed-cooked. so many other places even don't know how to properlyÂ cook steamed rice for sushi. Korean foods are great too as I believe most of workers there are Korean. Only thing I really could not accept is the seaweed salad with coloring that makes your tongue green eww. I hope they stop using that unnecessary coloring.  very good customer service. We'll visit again"}
{"text":"We decided to visit Zenbu after shopping around Cross Iron Mills, since it wasn't too far of a drive.  The restaurant wasn't all too busy around lunch time so we were seated quickly and orders came quickly as well.  Our server was great and personable, very refreshing! The decor ambiance of the restaurant is not too bad and the dining area was clean.  We ordered  2 orders of takoyaki, dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll, California roll, and their Dragon roll. All the rolls and appetizers we ordered were good, but nothing special. They also have Korean food in their menu(ie. Bibimbap, Korean ramen, etc.), but we opted to just try out their sushi.  I think it's a decent place to get sushi in Airdrie if you live there, but I'm not too sure I would visit all the way from Calgary to eat there again."}
{"text":"Wow, really fresh and flavourful! Nice fusion of Korean and Japanese cuisine.  This is definitely going to become my go to stop after work. Really quick service, and friendly staff. The restaurant is very clean and the atmosphere is traditional Japanese decor but absolutely not overdone."}
