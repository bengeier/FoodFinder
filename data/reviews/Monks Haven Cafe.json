{"text":"My wife called in to the Monks Haven Cafe yesterday while I climbed the 199 steps (I have been in there previously myself). The cafe is one of our regular stops when we visit Whitby. Nice location next to the little market area, pleasant staff and good service. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Very slow service, coffee very bland cake dry and short changed at payment time, at least I didn't feel guilty about not tipping"}
{"text":"Scampi & chips, with mushy peas and French dressed salad, food for the gods.
Friendly staff, with a warm welcome into cosy surroundings.
Definitely a place i'll visit again."}
