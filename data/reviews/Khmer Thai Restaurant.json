{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars. It loses 2 stars for the service we received that night (more about this below).  I ate here one evening with a friend. We went on there at a little after 8, and sadly it took a little while for someone working there to come and take our order. In fact, someone who walked in after us had his order taken before us. When we were noticed by the wait staff, the guy taking the orders did apologize.  We were both starved and ordered a special and 4 rolls, each. I was happy that the staff member offered that I could split my rolls order for 2 vegetarian and 2 chicken. The time or took from ordering to the food being on our table was pretty good. The food was great and pretty close to what I remembered from Thailand & Cambodia.  Near to their closing time one of the staff members called out that we'd only have 5 more minutes. I felt this was a little callous because others (arriving later) had their order taken before we did, and then we're being hustled out.  I would go back to this place, perhaps earlier in the evening, because the food was well prepared and tasted good. However, service within 1 hr. of closing needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Caught my eyes when passing by on the streetcar, and persuaded my friends to join me for food after a workout. It doesn't look much on the outside, but do not be fooled by the appearance of this little restaurant at the corner of the street.   The food are amazing, the tom yum goong  (shrimp) that I had perhaps is the closest to what I had in Thailand. The portions are huge, and i believe all curry/soup comes with rice. The only downside is there's only 4 shrimps in the soup, but on the bright side there's a ton of grass mushroom and enoki mushroom in the soup to add volumes to it. They do not use MSG in their cooking, and very flexible in excluding certain ingredient if you request. Also have a good vegetarian options. The menu is near the cashier area, and you paid at the cashier when you're done.  They also have this huge detailed painting of a South East Asian village in the restaurant that adds on to the charm of this small family run restaurant (and perhaps the only mention-worthy decor). I especially love the smell of the restaurant. I couldn't figure out what it is until it finally clicks after being there for 2 hrs, it's the smell of cooked rice. It's delicate and simple, yet appealing. This is the smell in most home kitchen in Asia during meal time.   The restaurant is unembellished and ever \"shady\". Do not turn your nose up and walk away just because it is not up to your \"Toronto standard\". The experience is perhaps the closest you can get, from dinning in a restaurant in South East Asia.   By far, my favourite thai food place, hands down."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Thai. Probably the most authentic Thai in the area, but you might drive past it if you didn't know any better. I always get take out because the inside of the place is nothing to write home about but it's always really really worth it. There's unfortunately no delivery, but maybe it's because it's so damn good they know we'll all come get it anyway!"}
{"text":"Golden beef, Pad Thai Sai Khai and Pork tenderloin !! So good!! I've been going here a while and haven't been disappointed.  I'm not really a fan of Thai usually and I really enjoy coming here. Their portions are large and fresh. Try Kmer Thai when you're in the neighborhood. Oh ya-it's pretty cheap too ($8-10)."}
{"text":"Love this place....  Super cheap, super delicious and huge portions. Best spring rolls in the city with huge chunks of chicken in them. I always order the Tom Goong soup and usually a curry dish.   The place tends to get busy but on weeknights its quiet and the food comes fairly quickly. They also have debit and take credit cards but no liquor license.  Great value for the price. 2 people can easily eat a huge meal with leftovers for 25/30 bucks"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant. Family owned and run with mom and pop doing the cooking and their sons basically doing everything else. I love places like these. It's screaming for a restaurant makeover, but whatevs, the food is where it's at!   I usually avoid the Pad Thai since I'm here for the Cambodiana, Gold Beef, Green Thai Curries and Tom Young Soup. I usually rotate between these on my visits. The portions are more than generous so be prepared to eat!"}
{"text":"The food here was excellent, for the price.  For 34 bucks including tax we were able to get three dishes including a very interesting Khmer Pancake dish which was quite delicious.  The guy behind the counter was very nice.  Service was a little slow due to large number of take-out orders.  Also, each of the three dishes came at different times which was kind of odd, as we got our finally entree about 20 minutes after the first one arrived.  In fact, the food was quite good, good enough that I still give the restaurant 3 stars in spite of the atrocious decor and the difficult to ignore fact that it was absolutely FREEZING inside, so cold that the cook at the grill asked the lady in charge if the heat was broken, because even he was cold!  Also, it would be great if they were licensed.    I look forward to returning, in the summer, when the heat won't matter."}
{"text":"Great place for some spicy coconut curries.  Can't say if it is authentic Cambodian, but it is delicious.  It is small and not well decorated, but the food is terrific and the staff pleasant and helpful.  Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Servings are HUGE for a reasonable price. There's about three bowls worth of rice, if rice comes with it. We requested Green Mango Salad however they had no mango tonight. What kind of Thai restaurant has no mango on a Friday night??! Ordered Green Papaya Salad instead. It was way too salty that it made my mouth burn and I couldn't taste anything but fish sauce. My tofu & eggplant green curry on rice was nice and spicy. Service was decent. Will order from them again to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I looked up Thai food in the area and the reviews looked great! Wow. I can't believe anyone thinks this place is good. The Pad Thai was full of oil and the chicken was bottom of the barrel. Don't trust the reviews. You'll be let down!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself isn't much to look at but not a big deal as I usually take out. The food however is great and their Pad Thai is killer; one of the best Toronto has to offer considering the price.  Staff are courteous and diligent. One of my favourites."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been there once a while back. Would be there more often if it's not so far from me. Location is key! I wish they have more than one location!"}
{"text":"I had Seafood(shrimp) Noodle with chow mein noodle at the store. IT WAS GOOOD! Food came out pretty fast and lots of portion(amount). I had chow mein noodle. For those who don't now the difference between chow mein and rice noodle -it was me. So i asked to waiter- is that chow mein noodle is much thinner than rice noodle. I liked the chow mein but, next time i will order rice noodle cause i like thick noodles. There was lot's of people orders by phone and picking up the foods. I should do that someday. But the store provides hot sauce that i like. Anyway! I would recommend this restaurant to people and definitely will go back to try some other menu or eat the one that i ate this time."}
{"text":"Ordered take out three times.  Food was hot and fresh, but always took longer than what was told over the phone.   No complaints about the food. But wouldn't eat in the restaurant because of the shady and outdated decor.   Great take out place!"}
{"text":"Wanna try a zippy new cuisine and eat like a pig for $15 per person? Then Khmer. Get it? \"Come here.\" Oh, I crack myself up.[1]  Not a fan of fish sauce, coconut milk or curries? Then stay home and make room for me and my feedbag.  Ten hungry Yelpers and I gathered here and ravaged half the menu.  There were some hits: E. Cambodiana soup: a green curry-based soup with chicken and enough green chiles to ignite fireworks in your mouth ($8.79, yields about 10 cup-size servings)  1. Phanaeng Kai: flavorful reddish chicken curry laced with creamy coconut milk and fragrant basil ($7.89)   11. Phanaeng Goong: same as #1 but with shrimp ($9.56)  14. Kako Khmer: another chicken curry dish--this time more yellow in color--with green papaya and sweetened with tender jack fruit ($7.89)  But also a few misses. Personally, I wasn't too crazy about: The fish cake appetizer, (too fishy), their version of phad thai (too gloppy), golden beef (dry and tough), Khmer pancake (kind of limp and meh; this is never a good thing)  Get the fried banana with ice cream for dessert. The hot-cold contrast is undeniably satisfying (even if the ice cream is some cheapo no-name brand stuff). It's only $1.99!  The place is small and bare-bones, yet manages to have a family-run charm to it. The night we went, the mom was cooking and the son was waiting tables.   I would go back but with a max of 6 people. Not that our food or service suffered too much but, I dunno, I tend to feel bad foisting large groups on tiny kitchens; especially when they were so sweet and trying hard to make us all happy. You may not care but I get weird white-guilt-like about these things. =========================== [1] Forgot to mention: No alcohol served here; that probably helped keep the total of our bill low even though we ordered several apps, main dishes, and dessert."}
{"text":"I know people who swear by this place, and a few years ago I had a couple of mediocre meals here. And one or two \"very good meals\" as well. But that was long ago. From what I gather, their soups are the best bet, since they're authentic and often quite good....but be warned that although their Cambodiana soup is tasty, avoided it if you can't handle blazing hot peppers. When they say it's hot, they mean it's hot, hot, hot.  I've given this place one star because of a a series of inconsistent service and quality over the course of a few months, followed by a \"Worst Takeout Ever\" experience. In short, the last time we went,  we ordered takeout dinner, which ended up being a \"throw-out\" because every item we ordered was simply vile. I can't remember what we got (it was at least two years ago), but the ingredients were cheap and everything was tasteless and greasy. Downright inedible. I don't know if they were having a bad night or what, or if we just ordered the worst items on the menu, but that order was a complete waste of money, and I haven't been back since. No plans to either.  (Note: If you do decide to try it, make sure you check the hours first -- they're fairly random.)"}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE this restaurant! The staff is super-friendly, the food is always delicious, and the price is ridiculously reasonable. I've been eating there for years, and there just isn't anything better that I've found. The portions are huge, and the service is always timely. I've gone with work friends for lunch, and we're always out of there in an hour. Not to mention that everything is made right when you order, so the flavours are fantastic and fresh. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai / Cambodian food in the city. Don't be distracted by the decor, the family can cook!   Recommend golden beef and red curry chicken."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book my its cover. This place is family owed and the food was delicious. I love Thai food was in TO visiting and used Yelp to direct me. Best choice I made. The staff was friendly. The food was tasty. I got the panang shrimp and steam veggies with noodles. Store front may not be 100% pleasing to the eye but as I said don't judge this book my its cover!!!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. The best Thai food in the city by far. So fresh so tasty hidden gem. Doesn't look like much from the outside but you can't judge a book by its cover. 5 stars doesn't even do it justice"}
{"text":"This has been pretty much my favourite neighbourhood restaurant ever since it first opened. I'm astonished that some people seem to have had bad experiences here, because I've certainly never been disappointed in all the years I've been going there.   Delicious food (although some of it is probably too spicy for the typical North American palate), huge portions (I usually end up taking half of it home), low prices - there's just no down side, unless you count that it's not terribly fancy looking, and occasionally they get too busy and things get slow (victims of their own popularity, I guess). Still, those are very minor considerations compared to how good it is.  A few things that are good to know:   First of all, if they warn you that something is really spicy, they mean it. The green curry in particular is not for the faint of heart. I have a pretty good heat tolerance, but that one challenges me.   Second, the soups are massive, often thick enough to be more like stews, and come with a bowl of rice as well. You can easily make a meal out of one of them, maybe two meals. This is not soup to get as an appetizer, unless you're sharing it between several people -- they're huge and hearty and very filling. I especially like the Hot & Sour Bamboo soup, but all the ones I've tried have been good.   Third, not only do they have a decent vegetarian section on the menu, but they can make many of the other dishes vegetarian on request, by substituting tofu for chicken or whatever other meat may be in them. So there are lots of options for vegetarians, as well as for meat eaters.   Fourth, a note to the person who complained about the mangoes in the GREEN mango salad being not ripe: that would be what \"green\" means. They're SUPPOSED to be that way, and many of us like the tartness.   All in all, you pretty much can't go wrong with Khmer Thai, at least if your tastes are in any way similar to mine. Obviously a few people have found it not to their liking, but everyone I know who's ever been here has loved it, and it's certainly a longtime favourite of mine."}
{"text":"My favorite place. I highly recommend the coconut lemon grass chicken special for $10 - it's amazing."}
{"text":"I got take out tonight. I have to say that this is the worst Thai food I have ever had. First the flavor was just not very good. In fact, the spicy tofu was just bad. The rice was so over cooked that it seemed like oatmeal. To make things worse the food was served on top of the rice and the rice to food ratio was 3 to 1. So even if the sauce had been edible, there would have been none to spare. I threw the entire meal out, which I have never done in my life. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I'm completely baffled by all the positive reviews. I just had take out from Khmer Thai and we ordered several dishes. The vegetarian spring rolls were tasty but the dipping sauce was watery and tasteless. That's the most positive thing I can say about this meal. The rest of the dishes (Cashew Tofu, Veg Pad Thai and Red Curry Tofu) were bland and tasteless, very oily and greasy, lacked vegetables and had way too much rice. I would never go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for many years and it is one of toronto's neighbourhood treasures, and I don't even live that area! Sometimes I just want good spicy food and Mary and her family never disappoint. I love eating  shrimps and I seem to always order the Siam Delight. My favourite soup is the Cambodiana!"}
{"text":"Probably the best thai food I've eaten since being in Thailand. Family owned and operated, food is consistent and always prepared with love! I adore (and must order every time I go) the Cambodian Soup (perfectly hot, both heat & pepper, but will make you sweat a bit!), Glass noodles with shrimp & chicken (light & slightly sweet sauce with great veg & meats) and THE GOLDEN BEEF (which is my allllll time favorite)!!! Every dish is so different and amazingly satisfying on the palette. Love the chunks and slices of fresh galangal, basil, lemon grass & kaffir lime leaves."}
{"text":"I've been ordering takeout from Khmer Thai for the past five years and the food is consistently great. Huge portions. Always fast, friendly service, too.   The restaurant itself doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that discourage you. It's definitely a don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover kind of place.  The green curry tofu is awesome. Start there and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Dear K.T.R.,   As soon as I saw your yellow awning, I felt all giddy inside! The words, 'KHMER THAI' in big letters just jumped at me! I love my Khmer people and even more-so, I love my Khmer food!. We ordered three dishes: Fish Cake and Salad, Glass Noodle, and Kako Khmer.   I'm kind of torn as to what was my favorite dish, but I think I like the Fish Cake (in Khmer, pha-hut) the best! It had the perfect amount of spices and perfect bite sized patties. As for the Glass Noodles, it had the most tender chicken and shrimp! Usually Asian places overcook them but I found them to be soooo scrumptiously good! There was also a generous amount of veggies in the dish which I loved! The Kako Khmer was smothered in a bright yellow sauce, it blended in with the walls! I usually love kako, but this one had something missing. Still can't put my finger on it, but possibly that it wasn't spicy enough.   The owner/chef came up to our table and chatted up with us a bit. She found out I was Khmer and she was so nice asking me about my family, etc. It's a family run restaurant all the way through.   I will be back to try the other yummy Khmer dishes!  Aw khoun jrun! Dreamsrey"}
{"text":"Really disappointed! I saw all the great reviews and so my husband and I ordered take out.  The restaurant looks like a little hole in the wall place- often not a bad thing when looking for genuine ethnic foods. But then the food was quite bad... We ordered vegetarian spring rolls, pad thai and spicy tofu, and it was just very bad.  Completely bland and heavy with no mix of tastes what so ever. I usually inhale thai food, and this stuff I had no interest in finishing.  So disappointing!!  Maybe they were having a bad night, or maybe they put less effort into take out? Who knows, but unfortunately, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had the best coconut chicken curry in my life at Khmer Thai!  My sister who came for dinner with me that night, (a world traveler and diner) also agrees the red curry flavour is subtle with distinct character, it is not overpowering. I found it interesting that straight coconut milk is poured over the dish giving that velvety smooth texture. The chicken breast was cut into finger strips and the dish is served with a side of rice that compliments the curry perfectly. The fragrance, the taste, was oh so delicious I can eat Phanaeng Kai for a week straight. :)  Atmosphere is casual dining affair; restaurant layout is fairly basic. Tables for four surround the counter/ kitchen. There's a big painted mural of a village scene, cactus at the window sill and the only missing was the humidity for a full Thai/Cambodian experience. :)  Seems to be a popular take out establishment with many regulars patrons picking up and having a quick chat with the staff.  Service is diner style. Order at the counter, pay at the counter dealio. Don't go in expecting someone to wait on you hand and foot. Come here for the food.   When I went up to pay I peered over to the kitchen and saw this 5 foot nothing older Asian lady cooking behind the scenes. Aha! that confirmed my suspicion.. this stuff authentic.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"There aren't any other Cambodian restaurants in the city that I know of so I have nothing to compare this to.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted and the service was very friendly and laid back. There's no question it's family owned and run. Nice atmosphere, cafeteria like, but with murals of Cambodian scenes on the wall.  I've tried both the Phanaeng Kai (Chicken curry with basil and peanuts) and the Kako Khmer (Chicken curry with eggplant and papaya). They were both very good, large portions of well cooked rice and a rich curry sauce. The food wasn't as spicy as I was expecting, but full of lemongrass and coconut flavor.  One thing that disappointed me was how simple the menu was. All the main courses seemed to be rice dishes based off curries. Having researched Cambodian food, I know there's a lot of exotic meats and seafood used (Snails, offal, fish, crab, clams, duck, frog, turtle, fermented mudfish, etc), and I would have really liked to have seen some offered."}
{"text":"Great food! Super authentic, good veggie choices and the guys that run this place are awesome!"}
{"text":"Good thai / asian food for good prices. It is completely unpretentious family business.  You're not paying for decor or fancy plating, just some good asian food with good portions.  Hours are short I believe close at 9:30, but definitely worth a visit or take out without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"My choice for cheap Thai in Toronto. The space isn't very pretty but the food is tasty. I suggest a hot curry soup (served with rice) for two to share. It's under $10 and quite a nice alternative to green curry with chicken or pad Thai plates."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I came prepared for dinner with an appetite as I only had breakfast that day.  My friend had pineapple fried rice and I had #19 Golden Beef.  You can ask for not very spicy.  This place probably used to be a greasy diner - you can see the people cooking your food.  This place was busy with many people coming for take out.  The portions are humongous, they don't skimp out on the meat and the seasonings just right!  My friend was impressed I didn't leave any leftovers."}
{"text":"The food was VERY GOOD.  Got take out.  The spring rolls were very very good.  Better then most. Some of the food was a little on the spicy side.  Overall very good!"}
{"text":"I saw good reviews, so I tired. Yes, those reviews were right. Foods were very good. Most food comes with rice. I had rice at home, so I asked them to put more food without rice. They did it for us. Inside of the restaurant was South East Asian style. Other customers seemed to be people who travel abroad a lot. Even thought they were not Asians, they seemed to be used to Asian cultures. Personally, I prefer take out to dine in."}
{"text":"The food is a five, the decor is not so great so I lowered the star rating to 4. But the Chef was very friendly and know's how to cook Thai. I'll come back for the food anytime.  The menu is large but not too complicated for those new to Thai cuisine. You can order dishes made to share with friends or select from combo's priced at $10 to $12.  This isn't a destination restaurant but if your in the area - drop in and try the Thai. I'll make a point of visiting again when I visit my friend in the nieghbourhood."}
{"text":"I love this place and its tasty comforting food!  Two dishes that I love and cannot wait to go back for more:  Spicy Shrimp with Garlic and Golden Beef.    Served with salty fried garlic and super hot green chili, the spicy fried shrimp warmed up my soul quicker that a cup of joe!    The beef with red curry-coconut base was divine.  It was so good that we had to order another one.  In terms of service, the staff was accommodating and terrific!  If you don't mind the austere décor and want some good home cooking, this is the place to come.  It's a great little joint to share yummy food with a group of friends.  At $16 per person with tips, six of us left heavier and happier."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes but I just can't see how their other dishes could justify the incredible reviews this restaurant has received.  I ordered takeout and got a mango salad, golden beef and chicken with coriander for myself and my girlfriend. My sister ordered the tofu dish (#40).   The mango salad was inedible. I'm not sure exactly what was wrong with it but it seems like the mangos were a few days from being ripe. It was stringy and wet and the flavour was completely off. Try the mango salad from Sala Thai on Eglinton if you want to taste a good one.   The chicken with coriander and golden beef were alright but nothing special. I forget which one had which but the massive chunks of tomato and pineapple were not something I especially wanted to eat in one bite. I don't understand how it would not be obvious to cut up something like that into bite-sized pieces. Also the mix of green beans and jalapenos was not something I needed. I'd rather not have to guess which is which in order to avoid an unpleasant surprise.  My sister threw out half of her tofu dish so that tells you what you need to know about it. I didn't ask her specifically how it tasted but it didn't look too visually appealing.   I really wanted to like this restaurant but it fell well short of its reputation.  UPDATE: After looking at the mango salad again, I had to downgrade my review to one star (from two). If I were a restaurant owner and I let that leave my kitchen, I would be absolutely ashamed of myself and so should the cook who made this one."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's yummy, and I've never ordered \"wrong\", because I'm pretty sure that every single thing there is delicious. My only quibble us the atmosphere, which is on the seedy side."}
{"text":"Great service, was recoomended the golden beef and was not disappointed. Serving was huge, could have served 2 people. Price was really good too. Perfect score if it was open later."}
{"text":"So delicious.  I'm almost scared to review it for fear the hipsters will come and suddenly it will be Edison bulbed and reclaimed-woodified with line ups and too-loud music, but for the time being it's great.  The food is delicious; portions are huge, service is perfunctory but kind - it seems like it's 2 guys running the place and one serves and one cooks.  They may both cook.  There's no ambiance to speak of, being a former hamburger joint, but it's never very crowded and the food was delicious and pretty cheap.  It's not your usual ketchup-laden Thai food, not an expert (though I'm sure there are many on Yelp), but I think it's Cambodian-Thai or as we've coined it, \"Cambothai\".  Delish.  But hole-in-the-wall-ish so you've been warned."}
{"text":"Best thai food in toronto. Everything on the menu is a winner but the golden beef is my fav and goto item when i cant decide what to get"}
{"text":"Really love the food here. Very authentic and delicious. My only issue was that the staff made a lot of comments about how much I was eating. Didn't feel good, I cried a lot later."}
{"text":"One of the only authentic Cambodian restaurants in Toronto. My wife is Cambodian and its homestyle food!!!  Very nice family run place. I always order the Golden Chicken, and my wife likes the Pineapple Soup with chicken and shrimp."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Family run hole-in-the-wall type of place. The place is small with about 8-10 tables with a very old-school style fast food joint type of a feel.   Service: The guys working at the counter (looked like the owner's sons) were very nice and friendly.  Product: We had two of the entree rice dishes (Kako Khmer and Siam Delight). Portions were generous and the dishes were very tasty in a home-cooked style kind of way (without the MSG taste which you would usually get in most Asian restaurants). It's like you went to a friend's house and their mom cooked you a nice meal to eat.   Overall: There doesn't seem to be too many restaurants serving Cambodian food so if you are up to trying something new instead of the usual Thai or Chinese, give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious and super fast Thai and Cambodian food. If you've experienced the legendary Wok In in Kingston and were left hanging once moving to Toronto, you'll find the same addictively good food here. #1 is a classic. Service is super friendly. Only downside is that as a small business, their hours can be sporadic, and you might find yourself with a craving and an unexpected closed sign. Definitely recommended if you walk by and it's open!"}
{"text":"The beef pad thai is delicious and really big portion. However, the decor is just monotonous so I just take out all the time."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the service was amazing! We walked in for take out, the server suggested a few dishes and we went with his suggestions! The food was very tasty! The portions are huge too! First order was shrimp fried rice! And the second was golden beef, my personal favourite was the golden beef. The total bill for both orders was around $25"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time tonight and was blown away with the flavours in their signature dish, the Golden Beef. It was without a doubt the best Thai dish I have had since visiting Thailand many years ago. Fresh Kafir lime leaves kicked this dish out of the park. Nothing fancy about the place, but if you're into food and great taste sensations, then you need to visit this restaurant. Kymer is now my go-to restaurant for Thai in TO. No place else comes close."}
{"text":"Tried their #1 Green Curry. It was a bit sweet for my taste but I think green curry is meant to be like that. LOTS of prawns given, delicious but not spicy enough.   I was expecting it to burn my mouth off with the little logo of it being spicy beside it but I guess it was toned down for the general public.  Nom nom."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a  few times and have had their vegetable dishes. All were tasty and I love my curry spicy. I really enjoyed it here. The food has an authentic taste as well. The prices are reasonable and you do get a big portion. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent find and the food is really yummy. Although my friends say the portions are big (and they are), I find I could handle a dish on my own...the best thing to do is come here with a group so you can try many different dishes.  Space is pretty small for sit-in - most people get take-out, which if I lived in the area, is what I would do. As per other reviews, number 19 (Golden Beef) was really yummy so would definitely order that. Mango Salad could have been more tart, but that with the Pad Thai was delish.  The restaurant closes pretty early so if you're dining in, beware! The one thing I didn't like was that at about 8:15 (restaurant closes at 9), the kitchen wouldn't let us order any mains (appetizers were okay) as they said it would be closing soon. Food comes relatively quickly so that was a set back. They said we could do take out though...the whole point was that they didn't want us staying and messing with their closing time. I guess that is what family run is all about.  Overall, would love to come back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Tom Yum Goong with a nearly insatiable passion.    Though the service is sometimes slow, and the small space gets packed tighter than a tin of sardines during the late week/weekend dinner rush (e.g. you may get squished into a less than ideal seat in the hallway next to the washroom), this restaurant's Tom Yum Goong is to die for.  I always ask for it EXTRA spicy, putting tons of eye-popping emphasis on the \"extra\" to get my point across.  I don't even bother with the rice, as the soup comes loaded with plump shrimp, and enoki and oyster mushrooms (unlike most other restaurants that cheap out with plain white button mushrooms).  I wish I had the willpower to try some of their other dishes, but my devotion to their Tom Yum Goong is stronger than both logic and curiosity combined.  My friend S. swears by their Tom Kha Gai, but all I can think when she orders it is: 'heh heh...more tom yum goong for me!'  I lived abroad for almost 2.5yrs and suffered such horrific tom yum goong withdrawal that I set out to make my own from scratch, right down to the homemade nam prik pao, giving me an even deeper appreciation for the beautifully balanced flavours of lemongrass, lime, coconut and prawn fat (which gives the soup its characteristic colour & flavour) achieved by Natty in the Khmer Thai kitchen.  TIP:  If you're planning to eat-in, get there right when they open at 5pm."}
{"text":"One of the places I'll miss most when I leave Toronto next month. In terms of cheap and cheerful food you really cannot get much better than this place (excluding the salads, which are not up to much, and the fact they seem to have reduced the level of spiciness on a few of their dishes in the last year or so) ...  My order picks would be #1 (Chicken Curry, Basil, Peanuts, Coconut Milk, with Rice) and special #3 (Yellow Curry chicken with eggplant, sweet potato, coconutmilk with rice)"}
{"text":"Hm maybe we ordered the wrong things. I got the pad thai and my boyfriend got a beef and broccoli chow mein. Neither of us were happy with our meals. I didn't like the taste of their pad thai and the chow mein was just really greasy. It wasn't that cheap either for this type of food and especially considering the location."}
{"text":"I would like to applaud anyone who managed to take a photo of their food. As soon as the food landed on the table, my animal instinct kicked in and I was to attack! The prey was golden beef, spicy garlic shrimp and a bottle of guava juice.  The portions are big and so are the meat and vegetable pieces. Big beef slices + big Red pepper+ big onion slices . The spicy garlic shrimp was sweet and juicy, didn't taste much garlic. I would have called this dish spicy sugar shrimp. The cucumber and tomato on the side were a good :balance to the dish and meal. Golden beef is delicious with so many great flavours bursting with spices and coconut milk. They have a flower garden on the ceiling....kinda tacky and interesting, perhaps it was the trend at one time."}
{"text":"This place is solid. The food is tasty and the price is unbeatable. I usually get two to three meals out of one dish. A great family owned restaurant. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for great tasting comfort food. Yes it's a hole in the wall with kitschy plastic flowers and vines but who cares? Nady is a sweetheart and her sons are adorable. I love the Siam delight ($9.56) with big shrimps and delicious golden gravy. The golden chicken and beef are my boyfriend's favourite. I particularly love the Cambodian soup ($8.79) which is very spicy. I get warned how spicy it is every time I order it. But it can't be beat on a cold miserable work weekday. Rich green curry soup with eggplant, mushroom and chicken. Today I tried the phanaeng Kai and wasn't disappointed. Incredibly delicious gravy and 6 large chunks of chicken breast all for ($7.89). It's too bad they don't deliver. Thankfully I'm within walking distance."}
{"text":"Came here on a terribly cold night.  It's basically a takeout counter with some tables, and a jungles' worth of plants. It was pretty dead at around 6:30pm, but quickly filled up, and about a half dozen people came in to pick up takeout orders in the hour or so we were there.  I was astounded by the humungous portions (2 entire meals. Seriously) and the incredibly flavourful sauces. I had the green tofu curry and was very very happy with it. I think I'm going to have to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"we didn't plan to go here specifically but we were craving for hot yummy food and thai food usually is hot and yummy=)   they don't have a patio and the restaurant inside looks like a cafeteria rather than a restaurant, but there are pretty paintings on the walls and lots of plants on the windows=)   the food is yummy=) a whole section for veg dishes and different levels of spiciness. tofu with pineapple was aaaaaaaaamazing! and only $9! no MSG is used in cooking as per server's comment. we were very thirsty after we left the place though....   yummy food and simple design. probably wouldn't take visiting friends to this place but might stop by for a late dinner/lunch if in the area."}
{"text":"Been there a lot of times. love their Khmer Beef. But i do think the quality is dropping...."}
{"text":"Khemer Thai... its kinda what kicked off my Yelping life.  After a couple of UYEs here it even vaulted them into the top 10 on the main screen.  Sadly, I no longer go in this direction.  But when a chance came by last week where I was heading somewhat in this vicinity I made my way over here.  I'm glad to say this place is still the same awesome family run self as it's always been.  The reviews on this place has trickled a bit since it's peak in '11, but you know what?  Maybe we can change that and put this place rightfully back on the \"best dive/hole in the wall\" in the city type places where it was a FOODIE list must.  If you haven't yet tried Cambodian, or up for Thai-like cuisine, ya gotta eat here."}
{"text":"This place would be described as a hole in the wall\"restaurant, but to me it kind of feels more like dining in someone's fluroescent yellow Cambodian kitchen. This is definitely a neighbourhood fav, last time I came in half  the patrons were on a first name basis with the owners/workers.   Although the presentation isn't fancy, they use better quality and fresher ingredients then some of the trendier thai restaurants  downtown. And the nice part is, I think there is only one thing on the menu that is over $10!   My favorite dish is the Cambodiana Soup, it's a spicy(they mean it) coconut stew with chicken, lemon grass mushroom and eggplant. Be warned the soup size is more suitable for 3 people than 1."}
{"text":"This place is amazing...seriously the best authentic thai/cambodian food I've had in the city.  We ordered the phad thai sai khai, golden beef and vegetable spring rolls.  Holy heaven.  Don't let the decor fool you!  It sucks they don't deliver, but it's worth it for us to go out of our way to come here.  Just delicious.  Prices are good and staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Cambodian in the city!! I love this little hole in the wall. Khmer Thai is a family run, ma-and-pa shop that pumps out some of the most delicious and fresh curries. My personal favourite is the green curry with tofu. I've only ever ordered take-out from this place (it's pretty ghetto inside and not the best dine-in experience) and have consistently been impressed by how fresh the food tastes by the time I get home. They load up the curry with lots of veggies and certainly know how to pack a punch (I always order my curry spicy!).   If you want real Cambodian, this is your place."}
{"text":"A a family run place. Mom & Pop place. Guess where they are originally from? Best Cambodian in Toronto!! I love this little place. They friendly, attentive people.  Eat in or take out. When I moved into hood about 16 years ago, I heard from a loyal customer a neighbour. Was locally known secret then...Even since I tasted the food, hooked on this authentic food that never disappoints. Try the soup TOM YUM GOONG and PHANAENG KAI Chicken red curry with coconut milk and basil. Very reasonable prices too. Dishes might be on spicy side for some-but I like."}
{"text":"Great staple in the neighbourhood we always have it for take out on those nights you're just too lazy to cook. Favourite dishes are the golden beef, shrimp curry, pad thai, and Tom Yum. Golden beef and shrimp   curry both served on top of rice so good.   The portions are pretty large so you get good value for your money. Have ordered from here over a dozen times and they are always on point and consistent. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"But disappointing as Yelp had it at 4 stars. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things?  Shared a green mango salad to start which was pretty average.   I had the Thai green curry with chicken. The eggplant and bamboo in it were great, but it was so spicy I could hardly taste anything. I like some spice but it was overwhelming.   My friend got the pad Thai and wasn't too impressed.   That bring said, prices are good and servings are big. Staff was also super friendly and service was fast.  I would try this place again just to make sure I didn't just catch some bad luck."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! The golden curry beef is to die for. The western style chicken is delicious. I tell myself I should try something new everytime I go but I keep ordering the same thing.  I ordered the Samlaw Khmer once and didn't really like it. I was hoping for something better since it has tamarind in it but it was fairly bland, which was really disappointing considering how tasty everything else I've had is.  Service is speedy and courteous. Portions are huge! Great value. You can get double meat on any dish for a few extra bucks, which is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Tonight's lucky Khmer Lottery numbers: 11, 15 and 22.  Those are not my all time favourites but what I picked as trial runs of my first Khmer experience with some help from friend Thai-spicy J.  However I think he made the better order on one of the dishes while letting me guesstimate what should be trialed.  Spicy Shrimp with Garlic($9.99) is my absolute favourite because of the ingredients( Fried Garlic + Hot Green Chili + Shrimp) all wok fried to perfect doneness.  Thai-spicy J. chose this one obviously.  #11 Phaneng Goong(Shrimp Curry, Basil, Peanuts and Coconut Milk with Rice) took the longest to come out and is very typical flavour of Southeast Asian Curry that I've had which was flavourful but not extremely spicy.  #15 Phad Thai Sai Khai(Fried Noodle Thai Style, Shrimp, Chicken, Bean Sprouts and Roasted Peanuts) is A-OK and that comment might simply be because I'm getting tired of Pad Thais in general.  #22 Khmer Pancake(Rice Flour, Ground Chicken & Shrimp Bean Sprout, Lettuce, Cucumber) is my 2nd fav of the evening and that is because of it's unique quality of the Pancake itself that peaked my interest.    When adding the Dipping Sauce(Fish Sauce, Ground Peanuts) it turned from slightly crispy into a different consistency and texture that I relate to Fried Chinese Fish Mousse.  #19 Golden Beef(Spicy hot Beef, Peanut, Lemon Grass, Coconut Milk, Green Bean, Chili, Onion with Rice) I'm not really feeling the love although my friend enjoyed it enough to order 2nd round.  #13 Kako Khmer(Chicken, Green Papaya, Green Jack Fruit, Green Chili, Egg Plant, Coconut Milk, Long Bean with Rice) is too Vegetarian for my taste.  I think it had to do with the Jack Fruit mostly."}
{"text":"Khmer Thai is one of the reasons I still live in the St. Clair W neighbourhood. F'real! No matter where I am I will make the trek to this place, it's worth it. Trust me.   A family-owned and humble little restaurant, they consistently serve delicious and fresh food at amazing prices. There are two brothers who work the front of the house and take the orders, both super kind and friendly. Last night I ordered my usual faves: the Cambodiana Soup and Golden Beef.   Cambodiana Soup: One of the top soups in Toronto hands down. A green curry base with chicken and an assortment of veg like eggplant, green bean, mushrooms and bamboo shoots. My fave thing about this soup is how SPICY it is. Seriously, SO SPICY.. like 'your nose is dripping and you love every second of it' kinda spicy. It also comes with a side of rice to sop up all the delicious curry flavour. It has become one of my top comfort foods.   Golden Beef: Tender strips of beef and veg that is cooked in a perfect lemongrass and peanut sauce, served on a bed of rice. They give a ton of beef with this dish, a fantastic value for like $12. This is 2 meals easily.   Their Tom Kha Goong soup with shrimp is also exceptional. It's packed with tons of coconutty, sour lemongrass flavour and a bunch of exotic mushrooms (a must if you love mushrooms, which I do!).   Go here, I promise you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This local place is as delicious as it is unpretentious.  It's family run.  An elderly couple cook the grub, and their sons provide friendly service.  Check it out if you're in the neighbourhood.  Tom Yum = awesome"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a classic hole-in-the-wall type restaurant, and one of very few places in Toronto to get Cambodian food. Here's the breakdown:   +++PROS+++  1. Real Cambodians! They do exist in Toronto.  2. Portion sizes are perfect for fat-asses like myself.  3. Fish cake app was amazing. You can really taste the galangal (think ginger on crack).  4. Really nice family atmosphere with staff who love to chat and make you feel at home.  5. They take credit cards. 6. Three words: deep fried banana.   ---CONS---  1. Location -- it's hella far for us downtowners and I don't know if it's worth the drive on a regular occurrence. I wish it was more central.  2. The Kako Khmer was a little on the sweet side -- too much coconut milk. It could have used a splash or two of fish sauce.  3. Risky parking. People park on the street in front of the restaurant but there are no official parking signs (due to recent street repairs). Even the staff did not know what the parking situation was. Park at your own risk.   A TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: $1.99 gets you a nice portion of deep fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  I've done the math and I'm sure they're losing money everytime they sell this dish."}
{"text":"I went here ages ago when my sister moved from Kingston to Toronto.  In Kingston we used to go to the Cambodian/Thai restaurants all the time and finally found a similar one outside of Kingston.  This place is similar in quality.  The golden chicken is fantastic as is the spicy tofu.  I'm a carnivore but that spicy tofu is divine.  I love the roasted rice they put on it."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai and Cambodian Food, family run restaurant.  Not a fancy place just great food for a reasonable price.  We have dined here about a dozen times and the experience has been consistently enjoyable."}
{"text":"Best Tom Yum in the city. Been going here for years. Super nice family run business."}
{"text":"I have to catch up on a few reviews for places I have recently enjoyed...  I'm always on the lookout for different types of food/restaurants, so when I saw a sign for Cambodian/Thai food from the St Clair streetcar, I decided to go back there for dinner that evening. It's a small place, seems to be family-run, nothing much to look at inside. There was only 1 other person there eating when I went back late in the evening, so the service was fast and friendly.  I have had Thai food before, so wanted something Cambodian to try, but I ended up having the Phanaeng Kai instead. It is a Thai red curry with chicken, basil leaves and coconut milk, served on rice. And it was fantastic!!! Spicy but that's okay with me, and the coconut milk taste was very noticeable. The sauce was creamy and mixed well with the rice, and the basil was in large leaves not chopped. With a drink, the bill was not even $15.  In summary, I will say again that the food was fantastic, one of best meals I have had in a long time, and I would definitely recommend Khmer Thai Restaurant to anyone looking for great Thai food. I'll have to go back again to try something Cambodian this time."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and am constantly in search for new Thai restaurants to try in the city. So when I came across this restaurant with very decent Yelp reviews, I was determined to try it. Although located on St Clair, there was plenty of street parking nearby. The restaurant is family owned and operated, which was appealing as I enjoy supporting smaller local establishments. Don't be put off by the fairly dated decor. You can tell the passion of this family as it is reflected in the wonderful flavours of the food. The young guy serving us was really friendly and happy to recommend dishes to try.  My husband and I ordered the pad Thai and the golden beef (#19) which comes with rice. The pad Thai was unlike the sickly sweet versions commonly found in many other Thai places, rather more savoury and saucy and had plenty of shrimp, chicken and bean sprouts in it. The pad Thai was not spicy even though it was served with a dollop of chilli paste on top. The cucumber and tomato salad garnishing the dish came in handy to cool my palate from the more liberally spiced (medium heat) Golden beef dish. The golden beef was reasonably tender, and the spiciness and delicious flavour kept us coming back for more. The portion sizes are very generous, and even after we had had our fill of food, we were left with enough leftovers for lunch for both of us the next day.  With the 2 dishes and a pot of tea, our meal came to about $26, which is great value for the delicious food and larger portions. This place seemed to be doing well in the way of takeout orders. My husband and I will be back as I am very interested in trying their phenang kai as I love coconut and peanut based curries."}
{"text":"I've been to many Thai restaurants and there simply isn't any better than this.  A family owned restaurant for many years offering truly authentic Thai food, bursting with flavour. Not a place to impress your date but the menu will be sure to impress your taste buds. The pad thai is sensational and the Tom Yum soup is legendary. All staff are family and are therefore caring to the satisfaction of their clients so the result is quality service. Well priced, as well.  I am a regular here."}
{"text":"I passed this place hundreds of times and finally used it thanks to their yelp reviews. We got fried rice with beef and pad thai. both were delicious and quite big portions. It was just before they closed to didnt have time to \"experiment\" with their food but I am sure to try them again for other stuff."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of Khmer Thai, and I am proud to say that it's my neighbourhood haunt and the best place to have a quick meal or to take friends. One taste from the generous menu - coupled with David & family's hospitality - and the sleepy palate will be joyously roused."}
{"text":"I visited Khmer Thai a few months ago and was impressed with their food. The restaurant is small and is fairly no frills when it comes to decorations. Service was a bit slow and not the most attentive. I had the Tom Yum soup and Phad Thai. It was my first time trying Tom Yum soup and I was glad I got to try it and would recommend splitting one as an appetizer. It also comes with rice which goes well with the soup. The Phad Thai has lots of peanut flavor, and is a decent portion size. Not my favorite phad thai but was not bad. I would return and maybe try one of the curries."}
{"text":"Guilty for not reviewing this place earlier. It is a hidden gem in Toronto. I have been coming here for years.   The soups are delicious here, such as the green curry and pineapple veggie soup. Everything on the menu is very fairly priced. It is family run and hope they never close or even expand."}
{"text":"The food here is great, although I found the service to be not amazing. I had ordered for take-away a few times, my husband had ordered the Stir Fried Chicken(#5, $11.99), and I had the Noodle Soup with Seafood(G$10.99) with rice noodles. We had this a few times and then one night we ordered and my soup came and was just noodles and no liquid. I called and told them and they didn't really seem to see this as a problem. We haven't been since. When the soup was soup it was good -- and the chicken was great, although it was a bit oil heavy. The price wasn't bad for he portion size, although I do prefer that when I order something I get what I order -- or at least that the staff cares that there was an error. I've moved out of the area and probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"The portions are ginormous... if you come here, bring friends... or share a plate... It was tasty but i was disappointed with my chicken shrimp item... giant portion, two shrimps :( Food was ok... if i'm in the area with friends and craving Thai, i'll drop by... good value..."}
{"text":"Excellent yummy Thai food. Wish they delivered, but thankfully they are close enough for pickup. It's our go-to place for Thai in the neighbourhood since Vanipha Lanna closed, and we've never been disappointed. Tasty and cheap!"}
{"text":"Good prices, good portions. It is definitely not fine dining and the decor is somewhat lacking. I would come back if I was in the neighoubood. The food was not memorable but were decent."}
{"text":"The food here was very bland, unfortunately. The dish I ordered was supposed to be \"hot\" according to the menu, with pieces of chili peppers in it. Instead it was just some rubbery chicken, with no sign of any chili at all, and no heat, spice, or flavour whatsoever."}
{"text":"I have been going to Khmer Thai Restaurant, a little hole in the wall joint on St. Claire West,  for the past couple years.  It first started as a random quick soup pick up en route to a class being held down the street.  Little did I know that my impromptu snack would evolve into a repeat customer craving.    The first soup that got me hooked was the Hot and Sour Bamboo soup with bamboo shoots, chicken, eggplant, long beans and rice.  It was unbelievably flavourful and spicy as hell.  You need the full bowl of rice to complement the peppery taste.   On subsequent returns, I have tried the Kakao Khmer with chicken, green papaya, green chilli, egg plan and beans, the Chicken with Ginger, the Spicy Tofu and a couple other dishes. The owners use fresh, simple combinations where you can actually decipher what you are eating in terms of spices/flavour.  Very little oil and reasonably priced.  It is the most authentic Thai/Cambodian food that you are going to find in Toronto, I assure you."}
{"text":"Not fine dining, but this family run resto seems to be steadily frequented by patrons. Be aware that they close at 9pm sharp so, no late night eats to be found here unfortunately.  The food is delicious and each dish has its own unique flavor. I enjoy the aromatic tastes of their curries which are served with a helping of steamed rice for good measure.   Their soups are large but perhaps a bit overpriced at around $10 each. Everything else is very reasonably priced with mains all around $10. Because each dish is so well prepared it can sometimes take a bit longer for the food to come out, but it's worth the wait.   Portions are quite large so I am always stuffed after eating, but the coconut and basil is so soothing that it calms the stomach. I really enjoy the glass noodle dish which has large shrimps, chicken, egg, and veggies in a sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Nice small spot on st Clair west. Family owned and the guy that welcome you in is funny without being funny. The food was good. Quite spicy. Portions were big. Ingredients were fresh. Specially the herbs. Diriment would come back."}
{"text":"Tonight is a zero - we spent $50 via DoorDash and it is all going in the garbage.  It is literally going in the garbage.    The Cambodian soup is so salty it is Inedible and the beef in the golden beef is tough and tastes off and the rice is overcooked mush.     It is getting two stars because we've ordered from them before and it was fine (not great)  Terrible"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We ordered three curries to share between four people:  - golden curry with beef - red curry with beef - green curry with chicken  My personal favourite was the golden curry, as it had nice big chunks of sweet potato in it as well but the other curries were flavourful and delicious as well. I'd come back again!   The only issue we had was that they took forever to make the rice (they had to make a new batch) so we got the curries with noodles instead, but didn't mind because they were tasty. Would've liked to try one of them with rice though, but will go back to do that."}
{"text":"I love this place. It looks like a total dive but the owners are so friendly and the food is fresh and tasty. I have had less steller results with the take-out. I am not sure why that makes a difference. Is it the containers? Anyway, I go over and over."}
{"text":"This simple storefront which was probably a former luncheonette serves some of the most delicious Asian food I've had in Toronto.  There are both Thai and Cambodian offerings and both are delicious.   Especially good are the golden beef and chicken, the spicy pad thai and the mango salad.  Soups come in large portions - a full meal for one or an appetizer for up to four,  All of the non-noodle main dishes include rice,  Service is friendly and homey.    As others mentioned, the portions are huge and the prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and fantastic. Clearly family run and delicious because of it. We took out two dishes, and both were flavorful and reasonably priced. Really good!!"}
{"text":"Soups E and F are the best green curry, hot and sour soup in Toronto. Tom yum is also number one. The specials are also great. This place is one of St.Clair West's best places to eat."}
{"text":"Best Thai food, friendliest service. They've raised the bar. Our usual go-tos are Khmer Fried Rice and the Red Curry Beef. Both are super flavorful and they are generous with portions. Their pad Thai is quite excellent too."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from the reviews but it was just okay."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is delicious, simple, and well priced. Service is always friendly and efficient. There's an entire section for vegetarian dishes on the back that are super tasty.  Perfect spot if you want to grab a quick and casual dinner!"}
{"text":"Tried take-out from here for the first time over the weekend.  Ordered the Cold Rolls, Phanaeng Kai (#1) and the Golden Beef (#19) which was recommended to us by the person taking our order on the phone.  We were told it would 20 minutes for our order.  Our order was ready on time.    The place itself looks rough around the edges - maybe not the best place to take someone on a date.  The food kind of also looked like the place but don't be deterred by the looks -  It tastes amazing!  The cold rolls were what we expected and maybe a bit on the sticky side (the rice paper of the rolls was making the rolls stick to each other and made it hard to separate them without ripping them apart).  The Phanaeng Kai was such a surprise.  I took a bite and looked at my husband - it's actually spicy!  I always find that when restaurants say something's spicy they mean it has a bit of pepper - this is not the case.  Whooo-eeee! I like my food spicy so I was happy.  The husband thought it was maybe a little too spicy and found it overpowered the other flavours.  The Golden Beef was by far our favourite of the 3 things we ordered.  So flavourful with a bit of spice.  It was really good.  I liked the richness of the coconut milk playing off the spice of the chili.  I wouldn't eat this every day - it's a little on the greasy side - but it's really good and we will definitely be going back.  It tasted pretty authentic Cambodian.  And the prices were good."}
{"text":"I hate to break from the pack on this one, but this place was a huge disappointment.  First of all, it takes way too long to get food here. I ordered 2 dishes to split with a friend and it took 30 minutes for the first one, and then ANOTHER 25 minutes for the second. The first was the coconut basil chicken. Nothing special. And they really cheap on the meat portions. All that talk of huge portions is utter nonsense. The second dish was the chicken with papaya. It has an almost neon yellow sauce. another \"specialty\" of theirs. I forget the exact name. Also, nothing special. And again, not a lot of meat in proportion to everything else.  I know this is a family run joint and all, but seriously it takes way too long to get food here. If you can't serve all the dishes at approximately the same time and in under 30 minutes, you are incredibly under staffed.  Another word of caution: if you get there and it's busy, (which appears to be often) avoid the tables in the back. There is no ventilation and its right next to the kitchen so you will be coughing like a madman from all the smoke coming from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! I wish they changed their (fluorescent) lighting, but otherwise, it's an incredible experience!"}
{"text":"Like a few others I'm pretty mystified about all the positive reviews. I live nearby and we've ordered takeout a few times. Friendly people but most things I've ordered were overly greasy, or disappointingly bland, or both."}
{"text":"Uhm, so my boyfriend and I were planning to make four meals out of the three main dishes we bought.. but that totally failed. It was all gone in one sitting. At one point, it was physically impossible for me to shove any more food down my throat, but for some reason, I kept doing just that.  Spicy shrimp garlic = awesome!"}
{"text":"What an absolute gem. Everything is just delicious. The owners are excellent people. The food is tasty. The price is a steal in this city. Worth the drive or the commute? You bet it is. This place is your definition of no frills - it's cheap and cheerful and delicious.   I wouldn't be rushing to bring family or a date here, but i'll be thinking of the place every time i'm in the area, and maybe detour to grab some takeout."}
{"text":"Since my initial review I've come back to Khmer Thai a couple times to try more of the dishes. On my most recent visit I brought a group of about 10 people. The group included a wide range of people: some vegetarians; a few that have travelled in Southeast Asian and know a lot about the food from the region; and a couple who are totally inexperience with Thai or Cambodian food. At the end of the night every single person was raving about the place, saying it's the best Southeast Asian food they've had in the city.  This visit also gave me an opportunity to try some of the vegetarian options. I can now say Khmer Thai gets my vegetarian friendly seal of approval.  We ordered three soups and 10 mains and our bill came out to $108 including tax. Portions are huge and all dishes come with a heap of rice. An unbelievable deal for this quality and amount of food. Our order:  Soup Thom Kai Gai ($8.79) - This soup looks like a bowl of milk, i.e. not very promising, but tastes great. A coconut not milk broth flavoured with galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and chillies. Mostly broth with a bit of chicken. Not too spicy. Cambodiana Soup ($8.79) - See previous review. Still my favourite dish. Soup Delight (8.79) - The menu says hot and sour soup but it's nothing like Chinese hot and sour soup. A light and very flavourful broth filled with vegetables and tofu. You can get it with chicken or shrimp instead of tofu. If you do order tofu they make it with a vegetarian broth. Careful, this one's more spicy than it looks.  Meat Mains Kako Khmer ($7.89) - See previous review. Worth trying for the interesting, sweet flavour. Phad Thai Sai Khai ($8.49) - Didn't try this one myself but the guy that ordered it thought it was good. Golden Beef ($7.89) - Probably the best main we had. Beef and vegetables in a delicious coconut based red sauce (not red curry though) with peanuts. I only tried the vegetables but the guy that ordered it said the meat was delicious. A little spicy. Khmer Pancake ($7.89) - Certainly the most interesting dish. A large rice flour pancake with a yellow colour like a corn tortilla was folded in half over a heap of chicken, shrimp, bean sprouts, lettuce, and cucumber. A little bland compared to the other dishes but unique.  Vegetarian Mains Tofu with Vegetable ($7.50) - Tofu with broccoli and other vegetables in a rich red curry sauce. A little spicy. The best vegetarian option for those that can't handle a lot of spice. Chow Mein Noodle with Tofu ($7.50) - As you could probably predict this was the only dish that wasn't great. Too salty and not much other flavour. Possibly a good option for those that can't handle any spice at all. Green Curry Tofu ($7.50) - Tofu with bamboo shots and deliciously sweet eggplant in a rich green curry sauce. Very spicy. The best vegetarian option if you dig the heat."}
{"text":"Favourite dish is the Golden Chicken. Spicy but makes me want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Went with some friends, we ordered golden beef, green curry and seafood noodles. Good and fast service, will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Hat off to the chef. Delicious food, Cambodiana soup was amazing and very very hot so be aware, you're gonna start sweating after first mouthful. I also had phaneng goong and it was amazing, creamy and full of flavour. Spring rolls were fresh and crispy."}
{"text":"Still really like this place, friendly service and authentic flavors. I really don't want to do this.. but.. I've felt really disappointed because the last 3 times I've gotten take out (within the last 6 months) have shown that the portion size and quality have reduced for the price. Also, as there used to be a mix of white and dark meat in the dishes, it now seems all dark meat and a lower quality, more fatty meat (a bit of which is inedible for me personally)  Where as before the dishes were about 1/2 rice, now they have consistently this past year been 3/4 or more rice in our takeout orders. We used to easily split one order of Golden Chicken, etc., and now it is barely enough for one person. I don't really even like rice, so rice with a side of meat is far from ideal. Please stop reducing your take-out quality Khmer Thai!"}
{"text":"As close to Authentic Thai food in Toronto as you can get! I love the Golden Chicken and the Red Curry Chicken!"}
{"text":"Dee-licious, cheap with large portions, which is exactly what I usually gravitate towards as far as dining goes.   Went back for a second time today and this time I got to order just what I wanted.   #13 Kako Khmer was pretty yummy. Wasn't spicy enough for my liking but tasty nonetheless. Fish cakes appetizer was decent for the price too.  I like it here but I don't love it enough to travel frequently up to St Clair and Nowhereland to visit more often. (Unless Tony F. wants to drive me) If it was close to home I would likely be a regular."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite takeout places.  It seems to me more authentic than most other Thai restaurants.  They are not as heavy on the sauces, and instead get maximum flavour with authentic ingredients, like keffir lime leaf.  All the dishes are plentiful and inexpensive.  The Tom Yum soup is absolutely delicious.  The Green Papaya salad is amazing.  It is nice and tangy compared to the sweet overly-ripe mango salad you get at other Thai restaurants.  There's a Nice heat on some of the dishes.  Some dishes do fall a little short, like the fresh rolls, or the more tame Chinese-style dishes.  The specials are a good bet."}
{"text":"I love this place, random find when I lived in the hood.  I think it was the golden beef curry I got or something  Always Awesome and spicy!"}
{"text":"I have bookmarked this place for a long time based on the fact that I have never had Cambodian food before and this place has raving reviews from many people on my Yelp follow list. This place is far from me and in a rather worrisome neighbourhood so it took a long time before i was able to find someone who is willing to venture here.  Their hours are also a little European - closing between lunch and dinner and not serving lunch three days of the week. It is a mom and pop shop after all though, so that's fair.  The front service person who takes your orders and cash is extremely nice and friendly. Having perused the menu, I wasn't sure what on the menu is thai and which is cambodian, so we asked him. He said pretty much everything is cambodian hmm...we ended up ordering the spicy pad thai with beef, and the kako khmer chicken (i pretty much figured if it says khmer then it has to be cambodian).  The pad thai was delicious, but the noodle to other ingredient ratio was a little off. A lot of vegetables and beef ad not enough noodles. It would have been fine except the beef was really jerky. The chicken came with rice and was also delicious.   Overall the food is great but I didn't feel like I was eating traditional Cambodian food. The menu felt more like a downtown thai restaurant than what i was expecting. I don't think it's really worth my almost 2 hour public transit trek to get down there."}
{"text":"Finally brought my Cambodian friend here, the food he longed for wasn't on the menu. When we asked, the server kindly offered the dish but we had to call a day ahead for \"off-the-menu\" items since he claimed everything on the menu was designed to accommodate white people. Haha. So we found another Manuchu Wok of Chinese food.   Based on the review highlights, I decided to try the garlic shrimp. For $9.99 appetizer, you get about 12 pieces of shrimp, accompanied by a bed of pickled tomato and cucumber, and a mountain of deep fried garlic and pepper.  The second dish we tried was the daily special red curry beef. The chucky peices of sweet potato was a great compliment for the red curry sauce. Never have I tried sweet potato in a mixed stew, I can't believe I've never thought of mixing the 2 in my cooking! The dish was creamy and coconutty, flavour so bold but not overwhelming. The mushy texture from the sweet potato coats the tender pieces of beef. Would definitely ask for the same thing next time.  There are not many Cambodian restaurant in Toronto. Everywhere else listed on Yelp has  pretty bad reviews. Until I find one better, this place remains as the best in Toronto. For $10 a dish , you can't go wrong !"}
{"text":"I always soft-heartedness when it comes to family runned, hole in the wall and good cheap restaurants... And Khmer Thai fits the bill!!   I have meant to give it a try for the longest time but it is really out of my way... but when a few yelpers want to go! I AM IN!   Spicy Shrimp with Garlic was so good because they put real spicy pepper inside.. not those fake ones that looks colourful but were tasteless!   The Golden Beef/Shrimp both has this great curry taste in it.. I have to say I don't usually eat rice...but those tasty rich flavoured curry sauce makes me want to keep eating more and more rice.   Phad Thai the Cambodian version is a little different but not bad.. I do prefer the Thai version more because of the more sweet and sour taste which makes me go hungry for more!   Khmer Pancake, meh for me... I don't really like the texture of the pancakes. It tasted a little blend when eating with other strong flavoured dishes... if it was served right at the beginning or as the only dish I order then it would have tasted a ok.   Kako Khmer chicken with all the veggies... is the really the only dish that loaded up with more veggie than meat itself... I find when stired frying or doing a curry dish with white meat does make the chicken a lot tougher and dry...   The friendly waiter here was so nice and smiley... He asked me at the end if the dishes are spicy enough... hey not really Thai Thai spicy.. but enough for my Canadian spicy eating fellow yelpers! I saw that little smile in his face and know next time my dishes will be extra extra hot!"}
{"text":"This place offers fresh, delicious, fulfilling, flavourful curries, stir fries and noodles, soups  with options good for winter and summer and the prices are  unbeatable for the quality and value you get. plus it's completely run by a family. The quality and taste has been consistent in my experience. I love the fragrance and taste of this food. This place is an asset for the neighbourhood and worth going out of your way to eat here"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place after living in the area for almost two years, prompting and immediate \"what took me so long!?\" response! For real, it was soooo delicious! Especially good if you like spice! The Hot & Sour soup (huge portions) was the best I've ever had. And the non spicy pad Thai was perfect for my 3 year old. The spring rolls were my least favourite thing we had.   The only cons stopping this from being a 5 star review are: no delivery available & it was a bit dirty (I know this also lends itself to the \"hole in the wall\" charm, but it could still def use a good cleaning)!"}
{"text":"I arrived late at 8:59pm, precisely 1 minute before closing, hungrier than Christian Bale on the set of The Machinist (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machinist#Production) and in no mood to make decisions. Several people in my group (who were at the dessert phase when I arrived) recommended the #37 from the extensive vegetarian menu - \"firm tofu with vegetables - red curry, coconut milk, basil leaves, broccoli and rice\" for a mere $7.50.  The staff was friendly and accommodating of my tardy arrival and didn't hesitate to whip up a dish for me. The meal finisher was a fried banana with ice cream at the rock bottom price of only $1.99. They're practically giving this food away. The portions are so massive   that even though everyone was stuffed and sore to the point of immobility, there were so many plates left over on the table! Complete carnage!! Now as you know I don't do leftovers, but I couldn't let 2/3 of my meal (I kept eating and eating without making a dent) go to waste so I took it to go and devoured it the next morning for breakfast. It held up.  Full menu's available on their website - now, I don't normally condone the use of novelty cursors to replace the standard arrow, but come on: a chopstick cursor?? Shit is rad."}
{"text":"Blown away!! Cambodiana and Tom Yum Main soups are the best! My first time here and I couldn't get enough, I ordered one to go.  Small family run restaurant, simple-modest decor and delicious food! Portions for the soups are big and served as a main dish, so come with a friend and try different ones to share or have one for yourself (you may not want to share, it's that good).  It's Cambodian food, spicier and more flavourful than any Thai restaurant in toronto."}
{"text":"I've never had much interest in the St. Cl-area, but I find myself heading here in a hangry vehicle about twice a month  One of my BFFAAs with a car lives just south of me, so when he picks me up we're heading north already and naturally migrate to this area. Desperately seeking snacks. We usually argue about where to eat, and then either end up going to Ikea (where no one ever argues!) or somewhere near here.   Last night we wandered into Khmer, and I'm glad we did. We had bamboo hot and sour and some Thai curry and they were both massive portions with a nice kick. If you're a pretty princess be aware this is your typical cheap and dirty to-go Thai joint, so don't be expecting them to roll out the red carpet   PEPPER POINTS for their silly art. Big fan."}
{"text":"Been looking for a proper Cambodian restaurant ever since I came home from Cambodia 4 years ago and now finally after moving into the area I have finally found as close to true Cambodian perfection as can be found outside Cambodia. Plus a restaurant that actually is able to make Amok the signature Cambodian dish (2 days notice for Amok orders).  Khmer Thai is a great find and must try for all that have fond memories of Cambodia and it's great food"}
