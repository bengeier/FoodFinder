{"text":"We were in the area visiting from LA and were fortunate to find this delightful eatery.  True to its name, the Paoli Bread and Brat House serves up delicious bread and brats as well tasty pastries and coffee. The scent of fresh baked bread greets you as you walk in the door.  We met Cherri, the baker, who was very friendly and explained the local sourcing and preparation of the food served at the Brat House.  As an added bonus, several flavors of Babcock Hall ice cream are available.  There are nearby shops including the adjacent cheese house and an antique store.  Great food and service!  We will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Wow, it was late in the afternoon as I just came back from flyfishing for about 10 hours.  I'm Hungry!  Stopped in and had the best homemade Brisket sandwich with homed oat bread - simply amazing. The beef came form the farm down the road, the oats and flour form an Amish-run farm.  It does not get any better than this.  Go and visit the little hamlet of Paoli.  Get a great lunch, coffee and locally made Ice Cream.  Than visit the cheese shop next door, The Alp & Dell."}
{"text":"Visited: 6-14-2015  I really want to like this place. Visited once before, when the business was still pretty new. I remember liking the food, but not being a fan of the carry-out only set-up; yes, there are plenty of picnic tables nearby, but the mosquitoes are AWFUL out there during peak outdoor-dining season. For that reason, it's taken awhile to get around to giving this place another chance.   Well, that second chance finally came up recently. Unfortunately, no food was had on the return trip.  When we first walked up, there was no room inside for us to squeeze in. A minute or two later, a couple left, making a little room. There were still two small groups already inside (two families, each with two young-ish children). Family #1 had clearly already ordered, and was waiting for their food. Family #2 hadn't yet placed an order, but was chatting with the man who was preparing the other family's food. We were not acknowledged. At all. Not a \"hey, thanks for coming in, I'll be with you shortly\" or \"the menu's over there if you wanna take a look\"; nothing. Since we weren't in much hurry, we decided to be patient. But, after several minutes of awkward standing around and never being addressed, we gave up."}
{"text":"They are always CLOSED! Despite what their hours say, which is really really frustrating. When I am going to serve brats at a party or just grab one after work I can't count on them to be open, even though their hours are posted. I asked in the cheese house next door and she said they don't follow their hours....umm, okay?? Then I was finally in there when they were open and since they \"wanted to get going\" they would only serve me ice cream. The problem: despite my 5 attempts to get brats, the one time I got them, they were DELICIOUS....damn it."}
{"text":"Love stopping here on a bike ride through Paoli for Babcock Ice Cream. If going in fall or winter, check their website or call for hours as they are more limited than summer."}
{"text":"Paoli Bread and Brat House confuses me.  I've gone twice when they claim to be open (per their advertised hours and their sign), but the door has been locked and no one is there.  The one time we did manage to go when it was actually open, it took forever.  Once we actually got the food, it was quite good - but it felt like we could've gone to the grocery store, started a fire, cooked our own brats, and done all the dishes in the time it took for them to fill our order.  I'm sad they're struggling because it's such a cute location and it seems like they could get a great synergy going with the Hop Garden, but something about it isn't working(?)  Good luck, PB&BH.  Let me know when you'll really seriously for sure be there, and I'll bike out and give you one more try!"}
{"text":"Our group of six stopped by this quaint little shop. There was one worker manning the cash register, acting cook, as well as delivery person bringing our orders to the Hop Garden.   We ordered the brats and chicken pot pie. You can taste everything is home made. The brats had great flavor throughout with balanced spices. Even the bun it came on was warm, having been toasted. Our companion remarked how perfectly cube the chicken was. Apparently this is an important trait.   They have other items on the menu such as pulled pork, brisket sandwich - all $7 and served with your choice of tortilla rounds or veggies - as well a ice cream, pies, cookies, and other desserts.   There were two tables in the cafe, otherwise there's a beautiful vistas and picnic tables, on the Sugar River behind the store.   Definitely stop by before, during our after your visit to the Hop Garden behind the brat house!"}
{"text":"Cute little place- average price, average brats. home made bread falls apart when you eat the beats as the bread is too small for the meat.   Hours are somewhat questionable, they are all approximations since this is a little mom and pop place.   My favorite thing about it was how on the beverage menu it said all of the prices for different drinks, and under milk and water, it said free. What?! You know you are in Wisconsin when the water and the MILK are free!! So precious."}
{"text":"Another buy local buy fresh eatery in Paoli. We had the brat sandwich on great fresh bread. Also highly recommend the malts, delicious!"}
{"text":"The Paoli Bread and Brat House recently did the catering for our wedding and I couldn't have asked for more memorable and delicious food!  They have delicious food all of the time!  Paoli Bread and Brat House utilizes fresh local ingredients and smokes all of their own meats.  They also have great summer music in collaboration with Hop Garden, so grab a beer, grab some great Texas BBQ from the Brat House and enjoy a day at one of the most gorgeous locations in the Madison area!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim and very glad we did. Tiny little place but great food. Had the pork sandwich and brisket sandwich.  Both were excellent.  The owner is a hoot...quite a talker.  Got a blueberry pie to go.  It was obviously made from scratch and was much less sweeter than most modern pies...a very good thing.  We'll definitely go back and try out the Friday fish fry she told us they have.  A+"}
{"text":"Great little find driving through southwest Wisconsin. Owner was very nice and seems to take a lot of pride in her business. We had the brats and the curry pasta salad which was very good. I wish the bun had a little more texture to it to hold up the brat and toppings. Still very good."}
{"text":"Fantastic local brats, breads, and ice creams! The owner is wonderfully friendly and takes real pride in her products. I dropped by on my way home to Chicago and wanted to bring some of the heavenly ice cream home. The owner went well out of her way to locate a styrofoam cooler and ice pack from the cheese shop next door."}
