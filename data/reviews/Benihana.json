{"text":"I had a 7:30 reservation on a Monday night.  I did not get seated until 8:15.  At 9:00 no chef had come to cook for us. I had already complained to the manager once and he did nothing. Finally my family had to leave as we had hungry young children.  I am so disappointed and will never go here again."}
{"text":"Very pricey and not much food for your money.  We were fed piece meal and everyone finished what food they were given before the entree was finished.  Won't go here again."}
{"text":"If I could give less than a 1 star I would. Although the food was fine. The Benihana at westgate ruined my weekend Vegas vacation by charging me a different amount than I signed for on my receipt by more than double. And when I tried to get it fixed they acted like they had no power as a manager to fix it, referred me to the hotel manager who had nothing to do with Benihanas and they kept me in a phone circle for a whole day and I have yet to be refunded the difference or offered a solution.. I will not only not recommend this place to anyone but I would say to just stay away in general. Never bringing them my money again... If I could press charges I would. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Amazingggggggg food, experience, and service. Chef Ryan was very entertaining and our food tasted phenomenal. I have to say though we received the most amazing service from Jezrey   Great memories we shared and whenever we come back I will definitely come back and visit her :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best food for this type of dining.  Our chef, Jeff, was great!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! The chef did not put on a shoe like the other chefs did. The place looked amazing when we were leaving there were fireworks on the ceiling."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and our chef was friendly and entertaining. I ordered the filet and scallops, which were both perfect! My only complaint was the noise level (the table by us had a few *very* loud customers) as well as the green tea ice cream, which wasn't as good as the kind served at sushi bars.    I was happy to receive $30 off my bill because I signed up for their email club that enables you to receive a $30 off coupon for the month of your birthday."}
{"text":"This place is fun to go to with a big group of people. Neat sights to see in restaurant, great sushi, & the best fried rice! Our waitress was the best! The cook we had was funny and talented. Our group of 7 all had a great time!"}
{"text":"Very cool! This place is huge and our chef was SUPER fun! I had the surf n turf basically and it was melt in your mouth filet mignon! Lobster was rad too! My gorgeous wife had the incredible spicy seafood pasta and it certainly had the bite! Overall highly recommend it even if you're not staying at the Westgate. We dropped a 100 and didn't even bat an eye because it was that good! Also I want to add, we didn't have any adult beverages but they were reasonably priced and the people at our table got theirs in a Buddha mug!"}
{"text":"We love Benihana!  Perfect place to celebrate.  Request James as your chef!  He's amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Nothing like the original at Westgate. This one caters to people shopping at the mall in a bind and it shows. Highly unskilled chefs, wait staff and the recipes were just off from the real Benihana."}
{"text":"I frequent Benihana quite often; this time was because my brother came in town to visit. Make sure you make reservations at least a day or two early. Sometime you can get lucky and make them the same day, but I wouldn't chance it. We made reservations for a Sunday evening at 6:30. We were running late so I called ahead to push my reservation back 30 minutes, the hostess told me they were full and they could only hold our spot for 15 minutes. We make it there at 6:47; they honored our reservation and sat us promptly.  The waitress came around and took our drink orders, she brought me out the wrong wine, but she corrected it right away. It took about 15 to 20 minutes before the chef came out and started taking orders. We all ordered the Benihana Special, which comes paired with steak and a cold water lobster tail, along with soup, salad, veggies and rice. Usually the food is amazing, this time everything came out perfect except the steak which was a bit bland. However, I still enjoyed the experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Loved to frequent here when I lived in Vegas!   Usually always crowded at dinner time and the atmosphere is fun.   chicken and steak are the way to go! :)"}
{"text":"My family and I went last night and the air conditioner was broken so it was hot and a bit uncomfortable.  The second complaint was the waitress. Nice lady but she was struggling to stay on top of it. Our soup was luke warm and she forgot to bring out the salad. I eventually asked the chef while he was cooking our rice (which was dry as hell) and she finally brought it out. Towards the end of the meal the chef had to refill our glasses  himself  because she had not come back out to do so.   I have been to many Benihana's but I was not pleased with the overall experience here. The waitress even said she felt bad for giving us the bill ($120) because it was a lousy night. We arrived at 9:15 so it was not a full house at the time. I just think we had a inexperienced waitress and the lack of air conditioning did not help AT ALL!!"}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for lunch and we were still waiting.  We walked out.  So I learned that with only 3 people in our group, we are required to wait until all other are seated and we are at the mercy of that place....   hoping to squeeze us in.     I will never step into that place again!"}
{"text":"We love it here -so much fun and the food is great. Only thing I do not like is that menus are placed on the plates when you first get there. I grabbed another plate at my table not being used and put the dirty plate under it (that had a menu on it) and moved the menu to the table. The waitress came back and moved it back on top of my plate. I had to ask for a new plate. This was last week. We went again this weekend and I noticed that this was happening again. Menus are very dirty and this procedure must change. Love your chefs and food but please make a change here. Thank you."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 845. Waited until 920 to be seated, then proceeded to sit around for another 10 minutes without so much as a drink order before I decided that I didn't want to see the poor service manifested in my food. So I left. Thanks for nothing guys."}
{"text":"Benihana is a chain restaurant, but the food is pretty good.  It can get quite expensive though, especially if you adds drinks or an appetizer such as sushi."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time here for a birthday celebration.  I highly recommend you go to their website and register for The Chef's Table on their website under Promotions.  You will get a $30 gift voucher you can use for the month of your birthday.  This makes coming here, a no brainer for the value and quality of the food you will get here.    For an appetizer we had a Specialty Sushi Las Vegas Roll - Deep fried. Salmon, avocado, cream cheese, jalape√±o, spicy sauce on top.  2 of us shared this and it was tasty and a big portion to share, so don't get this for 1 person if you expect to have room for dinner.  For dinner we the Land 'N Sea which is a filet mignon and sea scallops.  It came with vegetables as well as a ship appetizer and ice cream for desert.  Way too much food for a great price.   Everything was real tasty and with great service. We will definitely return and highly recommend coming here.  This is the best and largest Benihana I have ever seen.  Highly suggest making reservations."}
{"text":"Good quality tepanyaki food.  Our chef, Tony, was awesome.  Like the best of Southwest flight attendant meets the best of Benihana.    Dining experience, food, service all very good.    Signage externally is awful.  Its between Kona Grill and Starbucks on the ground floor facing the Wynn."}
{"text":"We rarely go for Teppanyaki, but the food at Benihana is in fact really, really good.  Silly knife show aside, all of the freshly cooked veggies, fish and meats were superior, if expensive.    It killed me to watch our tablemates have the chef cook amazing filets, NY strip steaks and chateaubriand to death - medium well on the grill.  To do this, the chef had to cut 4 inch slabs of prime meat into little pieces of overcooked morsels the size of dog food.    Our shrimp, scallops, and steak were in fact fabulous.  My only gripe is that even with LVH cards, we got no discount.  It is not right to charge extra just because we are visitorsvrather than locals."}
{"text":"We never have problems but the service tonight was awful. Didn't get our soup and salad. We had a party of four, our food came at different times. Management didn't care. I said I was allergic to mushrooms and my plate was brought out with mushrooms!"}
{"text":"We've been celebrating my husband's birthday here for the last five years and this has been our worst visit!  Our reservation was for 6:30 (Thursday) and our teppanyaki chef didn't arrive to our table until 7:15 (delayed even longer cause he didn't bring the chicken).  He was average, nothing spectacular to his performance.  Food was average.  Our waiter was terrible!  He only provided refills to our drinks one time. We waited 15 minutes for our ticket (had to ask for it) and never receieved any ice cream (by this time it was already 8:30)!  My husband shared our concerns with the manager but it seemed to have fell on deaf ears.  Unfortunately there's no team leadership and customer service skills in this establishment.  I think Benihana needs to step up their game considering the amount of money we spend in their restaurant."}
{"text":"It was really nice to see cockroaches as part of your Teppanyaki experience at Benihana's at the Westgate Resort in Vegas. Like the hotel, this place is overpriced and is crawling with critters and roaches. Seeing them crawling across the hot grill and ignored by the tired Benihana chef..made me want to leave there and run in another direction. Stir fry for $180 for two plus all the roaches you can eat. Yee Gawd! This place was awful!"}
{"text":"I came here couple days ago with 2 of my buddies and sat on one of their teppan table. I never try benihana before so I thought to give it a shot.  Let's talk about the service. The server came not to long after we sat. She smiled, tell us her name, welcomed us and give us some recommendations for drinks. Her name is vinni. The drinks come pretty fast. We order some food after. I ordered fillet with shrimp. One of my buddies got 12 oz steak and the other one order shrimp and scallop. Vinnie told us that they dont have combination shrimp and scallop only. It has calamari too. But she said she can replace the calamari with extra shrimp instead if it OK with us. The price will be cheaper than a la carte. Will do then. We also order 1 appetizer that she recommended  it's crispy tuna. Very delicious!! Don't missed the fried rice. It's so good!   We got our soup and salad, finish with our 2 rounds drinks also finish our appetizers. Where is the chef? Vinnie told us that the chef will be out soon but he didn't come. She knew that we were waiting. She offered us to order another drink while waiting and we did. Thanks to her that she didn't leave and let us wait with nothing. Excellent service!! A+  Here is the chef finally here. His name is tony. Friendly and nice guy. He started the shows and talked. We waited and waited for the food to be to be done. We were so hungry. Both of my buddies couldnt wait, they went outside and come back 30 minutes later and the food still not ready. Wow!! I wonder how long this dinner will be? He forgot couple things, not professional! Over all,we've waited for more than 1.5 hours to get all our food done to cooked.  The food taste good but the timing is awful. The chef just need to stop talking and cook faster. We had to leave before he finished clean the grill.  Come back? Maybe if I have plenty of time to eat because it will take at least 2 hours for the dinner."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I kind of thought Benihana was fictitious until we moved to Pittsburgh... and then low and behold, there was one right near where we live. The food is okay. There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF?"}
{"text":"Our chef's name was Hiro and I can not say enough good things about him. He has been there for 14 years and it shows. He knows exactly when to put on a show and also when it's time to let us enjoy our food and step back for a little and just cook. He was friendly, funny, talented, and all around made our celebration for my moms birthday an incredible and laughter filled experience. I wish I could have handed him a 100$ but I didn't have it on me. If a manager or anyone from Benihana sees this, please give him praise and let him know he made someone's night because he works very very hard."}
{"text":"Dirty place and horrible service. Disappointed because it use to be good but now it's crappy"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Look, I love a good gimmick and the founder of Benihana certainly stumbled upon a good one when he decided to make dinner a show decades ago. I've been going through a bizarre period of craving Benihana all the damn time recently and I get my fix at this location. The wait staff's service is very spotty (sometimes attentive, sometimes rushed, sometimes poor) but the teppanyaki chefs are consistently quite good. The food itself is also consistently good.   I've had a couple of incidents at this location with the way they've handled the bill but the manager is fabulously attentive and has always made it right, assuring that I will be back for more.   A lot of these reviews are pretty cynical about this joint and I'm not really sure why. No, I wouldn't come here specifically for sushi. Yes, this seems to be quite a destination for birthdays and you will hear that birthday jingle many times throughout the night. Yes, this is best suited to a special occasion given the cost but I always leave with leftovers for the next day. Yes, they cook with a lot of sodium and butter so if you're watching your figure, take heed. It's a noisy joint with a lot happening everywhere so if you're looking for a quiet place to take your sweetie, this may not be the restaurant for you.   The Chef's Table is a very good perk - they provide you with a $30 gift certificate for your birthday, hence all that singing. Kids (and kids at heart) generally get a kick out of the show - I know I do, even if it is a little silly. And quite frankly, we could ALL use a little silly in our lives."}
{"text":"When I tell you somebody needs to come and in a hurry save this Benihana's!!!!!! The bad part about it they know the service sucks, food is mediocre, and the place needs a really good cleaning. I placed a order for sauce and rice and I have to say the sauce was HORRIBLE- COME ON..... That sauce have been around for years other places try but it was a staple at Benihana's you knew you were going to get aleast good sauce but not anymore. I'm sad because the one in Columbus is excellent...... Please get new owners that care, because we do!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter's 10th Birthday dinner and the staff at Benihana made it a great experience for her-she loved it! We have great food, good service and great company(2 other couples at our table)."}
{"text":"Great food and the chefs are very entertaining to watch, always crack funny jokes. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"Interesting place to go with kids or foreign guests. The tepanyaki show is really loud, so don't expect to be able to hold a conversation here."}
{"text":"If it isn't broken please for the love of god leave it alone!! I have had the good fortune to eat at and experience some really fine restaurants around the country. So it may suprise some that locally two chains never failed to bring me back again and again. Benihana was one of them. Sometimes I ate there 4 or 5 times a month. Imagine my disappointment when twice I order my \"go to\" chicken and shrimp only to find shrimp is now colossal shrimp that had the consistency of shoe leather and mushrooms apparently don't apply. Service consisted of being scorned by an older Asian lady and told \"it will be a while\" to get my order corrected because they are busy! Then while I wait at the bar I ask about my favorite bartender I'm told oh they fired is ass! Truly more info than I needed! Especially from the new bartender with no personality that took forever (I was alone empty bar) to serve me my ten dollar gin and tonic. Looks like I'll be sampling one of the many Japanese steak houses not called benihana in the future. W h at a shame. How can someone take a restaurant that was so good and ruin it so fast? It really must take some effort. I just hate to see it. I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great food, better service. Melinda always takes care of me and offers great customer service! Even the fried rice is exceptional here! :)"}
{"text":"First time eating at Benihanas. The atmosphere is excellent (good for kids, romantic, fun). Chef was very entertaining and engaging. Food was first class and we will definitely eat here again. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Recently went on a business trip with a group of nine.  I have a huge fish allergy, which meant my meal could not be cooked on the grill at the table.  My meal was timed exactly perfect with everyone else.  Plus I know they did it right by cleaning the cooking area as I did not have any problems.  Its great to be able to trust a restaurant to get this right!"}
{"text":"My favorite place ever! For celebrations or just when I have a few extra dollars and am craving their fried rice and shrimp sauce. Mmmmm  I could eat here everyday but I'd be broke, lol.   I first encountered this hibachi steakhouse when I lived in San Diego, CA and was super excited to find out there was one in Pittsburgh, PA.   Reservations are advised to sit at the hibachi tables, which I think everyone should at least once.  If I'm going out after I usually just sit in the bar area at a regular table and skip the hibachi show.  I've NEVER had a bad experience at either location I've gone to in over 10 years.  I'm not normally a fan of fried rice, however, Beni fried rice is phenom and I always get an extra side to take home. Its worth the extra $$ and it re-heats perfectly."}
{"text":"Go there for the \"show\" (cooks making loud noises with their knives and telling cheesy jokes and then dropping food with their clumsy hands) not so much for the greasy, below-average food.   You'd be better going to Sakana, Kabuki, or even RA; that is, if you have fun friends like I do and do not need a circus freak to cook for you.  And that waitress: \"more tea?... more tea?... more tea?\" every five minutes. Here's some clues:  * It's 100 degrees outside. * I am sitting next to a grill. * I am eating spicy food. * and last, but not least: My cup is empty.  Yes, I'd like more iced tea. Please."}
{"text":"They told us to come at 4:30. That was the only availability they had. We showed up. They took our orders and then we sat there for an hour until the chef showed up. An hour. Other tables got served. And we just sat there.  I asked he hostess about it and she totally snapped at me \"I don't know. Why are you asking me?\" The server was pretty solid until we reached minute 45 and then he disappeared. IfComplete management failure."}
{"text":"I would give Benihana's 5 stars for ambiance - I loved the scenic walk to our table.  Unfortunately our server, Maria, didn't know how to replenish drinks and took forever to bring the checks at the end of the night - it drops my review all the way down to only three stars.    The food was excellent but I feel it was somewhat overpriced (especially with the lackluster service).  Maria told the table that it was her first night back from a months long vacation and that she wished she didn't have to come back.  Nice!  That's what I want to hear when we are spending a couple of hundred dollars on dinner.    Shrimp, scallops and steaks were delicious  - but felt I was being fleeced enough without being charged an extra $5.50 a piece for fried rice.   I also loved the green tea icecream!  Benihana probably does 95% tourist business so they don't care about the 5% of us that would probably visit again and again - if we felt more welcome."}
{"text":"YES!!! Everyone's complaints and comments are pretty accurate.  This place has gone down hill since last year. Honestly, I've always thought this place was over rated and more of entertainment rather than fine dining. BUT the happy hour deals and because it's close to home has always kept us coming back when we're lazy to cook. We recently were here for boyfriend's birthday and found out they changed the $30 birthday deal. Used to be towards any menu item, but now you have to order any teppanyaki meal full price and then get $30 off additional  items. Which is still not bad, but I liked old desk better."}
{"text":"This rating is purely on the service of this location.  Last night marked probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant in quite some time.  I will give you the short version.  Reservations were set for 8:00PM.  1.  We had to wait an hour to be seated.  2. The server took several minutes to get our drink orders, apps, and soup/salads.  3.  All our entr√©es were incorrect; to the point the chef had to keeping going back to the kitchen to grab ingredients.  We spent almost 4 hrs at this restaurant because of the incompetence of the staff. The manager on site was generous enough to comp one of the meals because an error but this appears to be business as usual for them.  I feel for the Chefs because they are completely blindsided and have to deal angry starving patrons.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The place is awesome, the food is delicious, the waitress is kind...the White haired manager however, should not be working in any industry that has anything to do with customer service in my personal opinion."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE Benihana. There isn't one in the area where I live so whenever I'm out of town I try and go there for lunch or dinner.   My family and I had a reservation and they were ready to seat us when we arrived. The waitress was cute and super friendly, our chef was also great. Now what everyone is waiting for, the food was EPIC! I don't know if I've ever had a better meal at Benihana.   If you're looking for an awesome meal plus good entertainment and you're willing to spend some money to treat yourself, I would definitely recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Over priced and nickled and dimed for everything.  No value anymore.  The drinking water arrived at the table and looked murky, I guess they expected us to buy bottle water in addition to the alcohol we ordered with our meal.  Seeing how it was triple digits hot outside, I think it was in extremly poor judgment to provide unpotable water.  It tasted funny too everyone acted like it was just fine, when in fact it was horrible.  I spend over 200 dollars for a meal here and was treated like a herd of cattle."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment! I have been to several Benihana's in other states and even the one in Scottsdale. The chain in Chandler had the worst service ever.   My first and last visit started with our group of 8 arriving at 5:50pm. We were told a 45 min wait. After all, we had a group large enough for one table no need to piece us with others. Finally at 7:15, I asked to speak to the manager. After complaining, we were immediately seated and given free appetizers.   I thought the night would be salvaged. NoPE!! It took them until 8pm to start the grill and 8:15 until the chef started to cook. I will not be returning to this establishment anytime in the near future.   Oh....and after that...I asked for no onions. Guess who had onions in their dish?!?!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place stays in business.  It's hard to get in, but why?  It's a typical hibachi grill, with onion volcano and spinning knives, but the interior is a mess.  The carpet was matted with years of dirt.  The walls were plain, really nothing special considering the prices.  Yes the food was good, fresh and who doesn't like to see their food prepared.  But we won't be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dining here, I asked for my steak medium rare and the chef cooked it with a nice ruby middle. I am glad that he cooked it the right way because so many people mistake brown meat for a well cooked steak. If that was the case, then there would not be a need to pay so much for steak. Everything was delicious and we were seated next to a nice couple and other than the seating being slightly close to the other tables (hibachis), it was a good time."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy going to this place I always get a great show with a tasty meal but something about this location was not right first of all the guy who cooked our food was not friendly at all he didn't put any show for us and on top of that he didn't clean the grill before cooking out shrimp and steak the day after I got food poising I was very upset  about the whole experience."}
{"text":"I went with my friend for his birthday. He ordered 12 oz New York and I ordered the 8 oz tenderloin. I knew what different cuts of meat look and taste like. I meant business when it comes to steak!!   Our cook prepped our food in front of us, I noticed how each steak has different cut, while NY was chunky and short, my tenderloin was thinner. While I turned around in middle of the conversation, the steak was served onto my plate, and the first thing I noticed was how chunky it was. After trying the first bite, I know immediately that was NOT a tenderloin. Just to make sure, I tried a piece of what was served to my friend, and I noticed my \"tenderloin\" was chewy and lean (what NY steak  normally taste like) while his \"NY steak\" was soft and fatty (what tenderloin normally taste like.)   I brought this to the manager's attention, he came over and looked at the meat and told me that my experience with tenderloin could be improved if I requested to have my steak cooked with Garlic butter. I informed the manager how each plate of steak tasted like and he insist that the fat/ garlic butter makes all the difference. (Keep in mind, my friend also didn't request the garlic butter.)  Lastly, he walked away with \"But I will see what I can do\" and never come back to the table again till everyone got their desert when they do the birthday picture for the table. I left my steak untouched simply cause I wasn't sure if they will correct my order... And end up leaving the place $40 short and hungry.   I feel I was treated like a restart and very disrespectfully.  I wasn't taken serious and my concerns were taken lightly. Though getting me what I ordered correctly would be nice (which didn't happen), an apology would be highly appreciated (which also didn't happen.)   As much as I love tepanyaki, I will NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. It was first and last time I will go there. Had to wait while the host was on the phone, then seated at a table where there was a couple with a small child needing a high chair that made the seating situation incredibly tight. Once we were seated, we had to wait another 10 minutes before our server took our drink order. Then we waited another 10 minutes before he took our order. Two other couples at the table had been sitting there for close to a half hour. Meanwhile tables that were seated after us were getting served. I was really looking forward to eating there. Guess I will find another tapinyaki restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"We were a group of 3 people & were excited to go to Benihanas for a birthday celebration. My first shock was that they charge an extra $3.55 for chicken fried rice. We asked about the price if we did not order it with chicken, as some of us plan to have chicken as the main course. The price was the same!  The shrimp appetizer was a nice touch & we enjoyed it very much. Then came the steam rice, but wait!, we had not been service any of the main entree. By the time we had, the rice was cold. They could solve this by either waiting to serve the rice fresh or serve it with a lid on it. Our Chef's name was Nico & we were the 3rd. table he had ever cooked for and it showed. I ordered the steak & lobster. He cooked up a bunch of steaks, when I noticed that they were being cooked well. He then served me the steak. I informed him that I ordered medium rare. He smiled & giggled & then acted like he did not understand me. My wife tried to let our waitress know, but she walked off, because she said she had to take care of the table next to us. I grudgely ate it, as I did not want to upset the table, due to 2 other birthdays were also being celebrated.  When Tania, our waitress came by at the end, she asked how everything was & my wife explained that for $37.00 for a steak & lobster, I should at least get it cooked the way I ordered it. She apologized & asked if she should get a manager. We said yes. Well she came back 10 minutes later with the bill & then ran off again. We got tired of waiting & just wanted to pay & get out of there."}
{"text":"First time visit was not a very good experience. Anyhow, I went there again for few times since I like Japanese food a lot. I ordered the Sushi and Sashimi Combination. The Sashimi was really good with big slices and the Sushi was very yummy. Due to this, I ordered Sashimi Combination again for my another visit.   Most people go there for the Teppanyaki. However, don't miss out their Sashimi and Sushi as well."}
{"text":"Since the changes its just awful. Shortcuts in sushi. Quality of food is just not the same. The staff is very neglecting. It's sad to see what was once a great place go downhill due to changes in management. Very sad."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi and have great sushi specials at lunch and HH. Bartenders are the best also. Marty is the man!"}
{"text":"Best Hibachi style restaurant in Cleveland . Lots of fun ...... and the food was really good! Great service all around too! Your welcome Cleveland"}
{"text":"Awful! I will never be back.  I made a reservation for a party of four for Friday night to celebrate my fiance's birthday. We were the only people at the table. We got seated and comfortable, and then we were asked to move to accommodate other people joining the table. Umm..ok.   Our waiter, Zach, was either new or inexperienced, or both. The other party had to ask for their drink three times. He forgot about my fianc√©s sushi roll that he ordered, and finally brought it out 30 minutes later..WARM! Then managed to take the wrong ice cream order that my fianc√© requested..and to top it off never took our picture (they are always supposed to). Overall, very slow and inattentive.   Our cook, Saul, was mediocre. Nothing special. Certainly did not entertain or connect with any of us at the table.   The food was also mediocre. Definitely not worth the price. Nothing comes out at the same time. Which makes absolutely no sense. Why would you cook the rice, serve it,then the veggies, meat, and then a side of onions? All were served 10+ minutes apart. Makes zero sense.   Sigh. Never again."}
{"text":"I had an amazing first time experience today. We walked in a few minutes late but the front desk was more than happy to seat us.  Allen was our chef and he was phenomenal. Great presentation and flawless execution.  Shizuka our waitress was attentive and very kind.  Lunch atmosphere was great.  Definitely worth the money.    All these hipsters with their 1 star reviews need to get off their high horses. Get your head out of your arse."}
{"text":"The updated menu at Benihana was a pleasant surprise! I tried the new vegetarian steamed vegetables. It was cooked separate on the grill in a steamer basket and was served with spicy tofu and brown rice. The chef was extra sensitive to everyone's requests. Including using little butter. Plan for at least a two hour dinner with some wait time. Will definitely return soon! :-)"}
{"text":"Food there was terrific but a little pricy. The only downside was that since its in Scottsdale, there was no shortage of snoody people who kinda made fun of the guy cooking for us. Felt kinda bad for him. :("}
{"text":"Horrible service- host and waitress barely spoke English. The hibachi chef had to clean dishes from the table as he was cooking because the waitress was nowhere to be found. We had to wait 15 minutes after asking twice for drink refills. Food was good, but overall it was a very bad dining experience. Worst hibachi joint in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"This is my 6th time at the LV location, what can I say???  Food A+++ Service A++++ Drinks A++++   and using the monorail worked out way better, their Valet sucks at the LV Hilton......"}
{"text":"It's all about Jasmine!!   Jasmine is the best waitress we have ever had.   She is really on it.   Ask to sit in her section and you will have the best experience.   Calvin was our chef and he was really great too.   Great experience over all."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Benihana! The food is very good for the price you pay, and I just love how I am able to eat a bit of everything while I'm there. We have had some great chefs too.  The only thing is that some of the servers have been a bit slow before. Otherwise, this place is great!"}
{"text":"The performance was mediocre, We had a tough time obtaining water.  The food was overpriced compared to what it was. The quality I got wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is old and needs some serious updating. The food was ok not much flavor on the chicken. If I had to say I would have rather eaten at another restaurant since the experience has worn off of it being exciting since it's the same thing being done at each table."}
{"text":"To start, I can't accurate judge this restaurant because even though making a reservation and them having my phone number, NO ONE CALLED US TO SAY THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED (because of an issue heating the building apparently). We drove all the way out there (20-ish min drive) to find out, \"Oh hey, guess we're not getting dinner here tonight.\" I was not very pleased that they didn't have the courtesy to call and give us a heads up."}
{"text":"We are at this restaurant last week and it was fantastic. Good service and excellent food. My boyfriend had the chicken and I had teppanyaki steak. Excellent"}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here last night, and now I'm calling out of work because I have food poisoning; I feel like death. Sucks because the food did taste really good."}
{"text":"We went there today for lunch food was delicious but the waitress was nice as a person but she forgot to refill our drinks, pick up our soup plates, didn't even sing happy birthday to one of the guests. Everyone in table was shocked at her customer service. The cook food was very good but he wasnt prep at the beginning either but he got it together at the end..I know their  job is not easy but maybe hire more cooks, waitress so your staff isnt stretch out so thin and this way u dont lose customers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon.  The wait was long even though we made reservations. We decided not to stay because we noticed a customer with a firearm dangling on his waist which appeared to be improperly secured. This customer walked right in and was escorted to his table despite the firearm on his waist. The restaurant does not enforce the \"no firearms\" policy. I simply don't understand the need for civilians to have firearms in places were families gather. It is safe to assume that the average civilian does not know how to use a firearm during a stressful situation , such as responding to other firearm threat. It is more likely that armed civilians accidentally shoot innocent bystanders. It has nothing to do with listening to Hollywood or the media. It's common sense. For this reason my family and I will never set foot at this establishment again."}
{"text":"What a great place to go if you are gluten free!! I have a really hard time finding places I can eat safely and I was more than pleased with our experience there! The staff was very informed and let me know which options were safe. The chef even came out to speak to me. They grilled all my food first and used gluten free tamari instead of soy sauce. Major thumbs up to the entire staff!!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Benihana since I was, I don't know, seven years old, so when my husband offered to take me I jumped on the chance.  We made a 6:30 pm reservation.   The night got off to a somewhat rocky start because by 7:15 the chef was still not at our table. We were worried because we had a show to make at the Mirage in a couple of hours, so we advised a waitress of our show time. The manager came over to confirm our show time and they were very kind and accommodating, however, I don't think the chef actually showed up until 7:20 or so. So take note, it's probably best to let them know if you have somewhere to be when you call to make your reservation.  The food was really great, if inauthentic. I had the filet mignon, which was tender and flavorful. My husband had Rocky's Choice (chicken and steak), whichw as also good, but the chicken is nothing special so if we ever go again I think he'll probably stick with the steak.   Our chef was very friendly and I have no com;plaints about the service. The restaurant itself is beautiful, too."}
{"text":"This place is 100% trash. The chicken feels and takes like rubber. When I came and wanted to try this place for the first time I had to wait for an 2 hours for a seat, even though there were empty spots. Do not eat here the food is too dry and the quality is terrible."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Apparently if you don't have a reservation on a Wednesday night you are SOL here. Hostess was very rude and unwelcoming. We, a party of 2, arrived at 730pm for my birthday dinner and were informed that the next opening they had was at 915pm. I thought it was a joke! She was serious, almost 2hrs to wait for a table when they close at 930? On a Wednesday!? I asked if they had a bar we could sit at and her answer was 'do you want to be seated at 915?' We left and took our business elsewhere. I've never been so frustrated with a hostess in my life! Tip- always have a reservation apparently, never do anything spontaneous that involves Benihanna. Happy birthday to me"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Arizona from Illinois and I've never been more disappointed in a benihana. I've never had a bad experience at any benihana in Illinois. We came to this benihana to use my birthday certificate. First we waited forever to get any appetizers or anything. When Our chef Yin finally came, he was very good and friendly. All the food was good except the chicken. No flavor at all. After everything was finished, they came to sing happy birthday. Didn't even give us a bowl of birthday ice cream. It was a bowl of whipped cream. I've always got my birthday ice cream. I was super disappointed. I'll never go back to this benihana again."}
{"text":"Sanitary conditions in the kitchen are absolutely horrid and management has no clue what they're doing. I thought about refraining from writing this but honestly it goes against everything I stand for as a cook to not warn the public because you all deserve to know the truth. Where do I start, 9-10 \"chefs\" don't even wash their hands on a regular basis, I've seen raw chicken beef and seafood cut on vegetable cutting boards directly next to veggies, food falling on the floor only to be rinsed off and immediately used, there's dried meat juices on every handle to every refrigerator, no one uses gloves when handling meat, if a chef gets a table while cutting steaks he often abandons it leaving it uncovered to oxidize, occasionally actually refrigerating it, chicken and seafood are left on counter for hours at a time with out ice on them, If you have a severe shell fish allergy don't even dare risk it as the water the shrimp are thawed in gets all over the place and prep work stations are not sanitized as they go, cut vegetables are held at room temperature uncovered in excess of 4 hours, extra butter with grill contaminants that's been out of temp all day is stored and reused the next day increasing the risk for cross contamination even more, the \"Benihana Standard\" varies from chef to chef and is often blatantly disregarded sacrificing quality for speed creating vast inconsistency in the food and the time saved still doesn't matter  because management doesn't know how to train their hosts and hostesses meaning inaccurate wait times from being seated to chef arrival, often seating twice the tables their are chefs to cook them and then the chefs often take all the blame for this, oh and they refuse to do anything about the dishwasher that well... don't wash the dishes properly, rinsing them briefly with COLD running water instead of pressurize hot water and then hoping the machine does the rest not even checking them before putting them away still wet. Management is incapable of insuring proper training and enforcing proper health code. So if you want to spend half a day to eat one meal and potentially get sick for the slightest chance you'll get a good show have at it. I quit recently for all these reasons shortly after whom I considered the best chef there quit as well... you've been warned."}
{"text":"First time eating here it was great, food tasted good the price wasn't outrageous, our cook was probably the best grill cook I've every had at any place where they cook the food in front of you he had the adults laughing and the kids were very entertained if you come eat here try an get Andres he makes the experience even better."}
{"text":"Ants on the unclean sushi bar table made for a poor start to my lunch. One waitress for about 15 tables made the \"express lunch\" super slow. The gyoza was delicious, the fried rice not too much flavor and the tempura shrimp on the only side. I might come back someday for teppanyaki but I won't come back to the restaurant side."}
{"text":"We have ate here several times and have always had good experiences.  The food may not be the absolute best you have ever had, but for a social setting this is one of the best.  We came here for my girlfriends birthday with a party of 12, and everyone had a good time.  Only complaint I can think of is that out of the 5+ times coming here we have only had a asian cook 1 time.  Its ok thou, they all do the onion volcano and make it fun."}
{"text":"Sashimi plate was delish! However I would not recommend the Hibachi Tuna Steak-it was very bland, no flavour, and it was kind of....inedible! This was served with a basic soup broth, Benihana salad(which was very basic), hibachi vegetables (bell peppers and onion sauteed) and plain steamed rice. It somewhat reminded me of the Japanese version of Olive Garden? Not traditional Japanese food, and very underwhelming.   However a photographer employed by the restaurant took some very beautiful photos of us, and we will always treasure them! A great reminder of our trip!  Cocktails are a must!  I was very underwhelmed especially after I had herd people rave about this place!"}
{"text":"Unlike any other Bennihana, this location is special.  It's bigger than a typical location with sushi and imitation fireworks.  The head chef is Toy and he has been at Bennihana for 40 years.  Not only is he a great tappanyaki chef, he is also a great Elvis impersonator.  You get great food and even better show.  I highly recommend this place and if you are lucky, ask for Chef Toy.  The experience won't be the same after."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 I would! Went with a couple of friends we had super high expectations about this place it was awful really bad service, the waiter wouldn't bring us drinks when asked about the menu was really rude in explaining... our chef was super awkward, ordered a steak  median well! We received  a burn dried steak! It was just awful night!"}
{"text":"They had a great deal going when I went; food and sake for $25! What a steal! The food was of course great! And the chef was so entertaining!  The atmosphere is great! Someone told me that this is the biggest benihana in the states.  Either way, the water fromthe ceiling and the coy pond made it that much more fun!"}
{"text":"really good food any really good cooking show I come here always when I come to Las Vegas I recommend this place"}
{"text":"We were here, last night, to celebrate a birthday. The cook was very fun and entertaining, and the food was magnificent. I had the Samurai meal with filet mignon and colossal shrimp--perfection!"}
{"text":"We were glad to find a familiar place for teppanyaki on the Strip.  It was loud, took a long time to get served.  If the food was good, I can live with it but the food was the worst we ever had.  Everything was drenched with soy sauce.   I am not kidding.  Everything, I mean everything was brown.  No one in the table, 3 groups that doesn't know each other, complained.  I think this Benihana is ran like the factory.  This is not a typical Benihana."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 because of poor attitude from the people in the front. I'm not sure if she's a host or not. But definitely not good in customer service. Food wise. It's very good! Servers and chef are very helpful!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Benihana's back when it was Samuri... I visit the Cleveland and Pittsburgh one frequently. The cleveland one is better but they are both going down hill at a very fast past. I keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed. They have changed so many things in the past year and its for the worse. The shrimp the order they give you the food, the way the cut the veggies. Im becoming a Huge fan of Itchiban both the one in robinson and cranberry, Its cheaper and you get more food for your money . I hope Beni's changes. I even e mailed them and they didnt respond ."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!   From the moment you walk in the door to when you leave it is an outstanding experience. All of the staff is very friendly and they really go the extra mile to make sure that your dining experience is perfect! The food is delicious and the lunch specials area amazing! Defiantly worth going to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I like the tatami table! The food is ok, just any kinds of sushi boats, udon, and fish."}
{"text":"Came in tonight as a request from my daughter to celebrate her 10th birthday.  Was at a table with two other birthday girls.  John was our waiter and was constantly in motion the whole night.  Johnny on the spot with refills, appetizers and desserts.  Our chef was Nick this evening.  I could tell Nick had a mastery of the food he was preparing by the way he handled things.   His showmanship could use a little work but most of that was his delivery being a little off due to being nervous.  I'll take good food done right and a mediocre show over good food prepared badly with a great show.  I'll remember the food more than the show especially if I am sick the next day.  Katie enjoyed watching the food get prepared and joking around with the chef.  When her food was served she devoured it all.  She even stole some of mine!!!  I will return in a few weeks and hope Nick is there so I can see how he has progressed."}
{"text":"Decor was nice, food was not. I have never eat this much butter in my life. They say it is authentic Japanese Experience. The Cook put butter on everything.  Shrimp with Butter,  He could have add some Garlic, little bit Rosemary and Lime grass. Meat with Butter, Couldn't even test meat.  Rice with Butter( No soy sauce)  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We attended Benihana for a double date and were very pleased with our reservation and the people we sat next to. Two people at our table ordered the steak and when they were put on the grill, they were brown looking almost already cooked. Everything seemed to be fine but halfway through dinner my friend fell ill and had to be excussed. Within 2 hours 3 of the 4 people in our party fell ill due to the food. We were shiting and throwing up all night. Very disapointed and highly dissatisfied. I hope you take your services elsewhere."}
{"text":"A visit to Benihana is a guarantee to be entertained. It's also a guarantee of some good food. It's not spectacular per say but the spectacle of watching your food get cooked in front of you is worth it. There are many simple ingredients and the recipes are straight forward. The meat and seafood are of a good standard. The dishes are classic tepanyaki/hibachi. Similar food can of course be found in smaller independent japanese and east asian places. Tasty and colorful but not necessarily novel. Their sushi and sashimi selection is good and a nice addition to their menu choices. Service is attentive and polite and the restaurant looks fine. Prices are reasonable for this type of place. All in all it's a nice place to go out to once in awhile. If you have never tried this type of dining then it's a must go at least once!"}
{"text":"I've been to Benihannas several times in a California and Arizona. I must say that there isn't any consistency with this place. The one here in chandler is not very good. I think they are surviving off of the reputation not customer service. First the girl working as the hostess needs to learn how to smile and actually act like she likes her job. Word of advice for her. If you can't smile, be cordial, have a personality then quit and find another line of work but obviously interacting with the public is not your calling.   Very long wait to eat.... The servers are slow and you have to wait forever just to get drinks and refills...  I think for $100 I can spend it elsewhere and get better service and food..."}
{"text":"Didn't even make it to a table, this restaurant was so filthy. The ventilation system was draped with dust collection (wonder how much of that ends up in the food), the floor was filthy, there was no enforcement of their posted dress code. We had a reservation for 630, arrived on time and hadn't been seated in 15 minutes. So instead of spending our money here we moved on, can't speak for the food or the cooks since we didn't experience it."}
{"text":"So we used to eat here a few times a month. That was two years ago. Recently we have tried 4 times and each time they quoted us over a hours wait. So tonight we went here knowing it may be a hours wait so we got there at 4:55 pm. They open for dinner at 5. When we walked in the place was empty and they still quoted us a hour. We waited the full hour in the bar ($57.00 for two MaiTai and 2 house wines). After the hour was up we asked how long the wait was and they said \"your Edward right?\" I replied no John and that is when they let me know they dropped us off the list. They did not know why we were no longer on the list. The only thing they could say was \" we don't know why this happens but it will now be another 35 to 45 min. I had let them know my whole party was there at 5 and we would wait the full hour in the bar.   Needless to say I'm done trying this location. I also saw 4 other parties leave as soon as they walked in and got such a long wait time quote. All of this happened when the restaurant was 65 to 75% empty!!!  Fire the hosts or manager ASAP. It really seems like the host was doing everything to keep people from filling up the restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a GREAT experience.  We went in for our anniversary so it had to be good.  First the greeters were actually friendly and accommodating.  We had our reservation but we were a bit late, so they had to wait to get a group together.  6 minutes.. not really bad wait. Our waitress, Cheryl was great.  She was friendly, efficient and just all around on the ball.  Kept our table's drinks filled constantly and made sure we all had what was needed.   The cook was Jeff.  He was fantastic. I am allergic to lemon and he remembered and cooked my food without while cooking everyone else's food.  He went overboard to give the birthday person at the table a pleasant experience.  The food was great.  Best tasting I have had in any Benihanas in a long time.  We travel a lot so we have been to a lot of them.  Can not say enough good about Jeff. When we were looking for a specific mug Cheryl actually found not one but three (one for each of us) That is hard to do since this on we have not seen in very many places.    The Bad:  IF you are not use to places like this the price could be a bit shocking.  BUT For all the food that we got and the quality, it was really worth it.  If you go in thinking you are getting cheap Japanese or Chinese food, go elsewhere because this is not that low quality.    Summary:  We have been to a lot of Benihana and this one is one of the best.  Phoenix lucky to have this one.  We have only been to one other that equals this one and it was in California.  Food was great, service was great and friendly the place had a great atmosphere.  As stated, if you want cheap fast Oriental food, this is not the place, if you want a great dining and entertainment in this type of place this is where to go.  We will return more often and hope this was not one off great experience.  For those who thought the butter is Garlic Butter.. it is not.  They make (and everyplace else does also) Makes it out of HONEY BUTTER. If you want more Butter, just ask the Chef (at least this on did) for more butter to be added, same with all dishes with butter.  If one is early for a reservation, do not expect to be seated right away, they have to plan seatings.  Best thing to do (HINT) do not tell them you have a reservation UNTIL almost time for you reservation, thus you can maybe get seated better and then cancel you reservation, if you do not then you still have your time slot.  It is just polite to not demand you be seated ahead of your time.  If you have a meeting scheduled at work, and you go early, do not expect people to be there, if you leave because you were there and they were not they will still have the meeting at the scheduled time.  This is a place of business and one should schedule the time and honor it. Politeness goes both ways. Maybe that is why our experience was better than others.  Go someplace grumpy and get bad service you get what you sow."}
{"text":"I didn't want to do this but....(i'd like to take my 3 stars down to 1)  I had visited Sunday and experienced DECENT service. So I decided to try HH to see what's its all about, nothing fancy. I arrived around 6:30 pm to plenty of space at the bar, so I sat quickly. After being seated for several minutes I was offered the opportunity to order.  Las Vegas Roll, Crunchy Shrimp Roll and a Tokyo Raspberry....Meeeh! Tasted like watery juice.  By 6:50 pm I'm ready to order, but FIRST I must have another drink. I quickly ordered a Yozu Margarita (I think thats what its called) and mom ordered another Benihana Punch.  We then proceeded to order our food. I opted for a bowl of shrimp fried rice and side salad, mom ordered the Sea Bass. After quietly waiting 20 mins with no second  beverage, I made note to one of the bartenders about our drinks. By 7:40 no food and no drinks. I watched 3 people behind the bar make drinks and clean. Where in the heck are my drinks?! When inquiring about the food, we were advised that it was almost done (someone told me that 15 mins ago). Now I'm hungry and thirsty. What makes it bad is that I ordered the drinks TWICE! At this point we're ready to go, so we ask for the food as such. 10 mins later the food arrives...Plated. I THOUGHT I ASKED FOR THIS TO GO! Why is it so difficult to get good service?  Benihana is hit or miss these days. More miss than hit."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and The cook was very entertaining. We really enjoyed our dinner and can't wait to come back The server Jasmine was excellent as well!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Now for our service...... not so much.   Our server was TERRIBLE   We dined here tonight to celebrate mine and my boyfriends birthdays. As soon as our waitress saw we had a birthday coupon she rolled her eyes and gave us a dirty look.   Our first drink order we asked 3x for limes with my boyfriends cocktail. Never received. I ordered a strawberry margarita. Received strawberry colada. Waited for My server who never even came back to see if everything was ok so we proceeded to drink our drinks as we already waited. And wanted our drinks before our meal. When she finally came back to the table I ordered another round. Asking please make sure it's a margarita this time. Received daiquiri.   So both my drinks were not even close what I ordered.  I also ordered shrimp tempura, I received vegetable tempura and was charged for a shrimp tempura.   Our teppan chef was amazing, and the only reason for a 2 star rating I wish I had cash to tip him separate from our waitress. I'm a server I never leave less than 30%, if she gave good service to the only person at the table wearing $10,000 in accessories she probably would've received a tip 10x the amount of what I left. Leaving $10 on a $150 check is not me. But I expect the service to match the bill.   She should go work fast food because service industry is not for her"}
{"text":"Pretty good but a little pricey. I liked that I got out of my comfort zone at sat at the grill table with complete strangers! I food quality was good and it was a pretty good experience. I'll return"}
{"text":"With excellent service service. Servers and chefs are real friendly and accommodating.  Would not hesitate to recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. Waiter was a little extra on the small talk but maybe a tourist would appreciate it more.  We did the 5 course. We ate Shrimp tempura and Karaage for the appetizers. The Sambal Honey sauce was poppin - comes with Karaage - dip them. So good! Soup and Salad was soup and salad- filler food. The shrimp hibachi,  scallops & lobster hibachi, vegetables   and hibachi chicken rice was POW!  POW!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Benihana for years. But this time we had a horrible experience, we made reservations, then we're told to come back in 30-40 min. When we arrived back in 35 min, our table had already been given up! So yes we did wait for another hour to be seated, and we're so frustrated with the service. I would recommend this restaurant for those who have patients& time."}
{"text":"Just open 3 weeks, they have their act together!   Brie presented a (from Torrance store) first great impression at the bar. Bubbly personality and welcoming to her \"house\"! Kui, our table host, created a very calming, friendly and attentive atmosphere. Well, then there was Chef Ryan.......he became our new BFF! Ryan capped off a birthday celebration with festive and humorous presentation!  Already planning our return."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight  and had a great time.  Shizuka was very nice  and very attentive . I highly recommend  eating here."}
{"text":"I have heard for years how great it was at Benihana's. How much better it was than other japanese steakhouses, etc. Also, I expected it to be on the high side, but BOY was I in for a surprise. 1. The menu showed $28.95 for the Hibachi steak for one. And I am sure somewhere it says the fried rice is extra, but I didn't see it. 2. I ordered the hot tea - it tasted like balsa wood. 2a. I ordered the diet coke because it was the only sugar free item on the menu. [Diabetes type II] 3. I ordered the Hibachi steak medium well, was asked if I wanted fried rice, of course! 4. The diet coke is a 14 oz glass with 10 oz of ice. 5. No choice of ginger or cream sauce [I don't like ginger on my salad.] 6. only positive so far, the soup was OK. 7. drank my 4 oz zof coke and asked for a refill 8. finally after waiting close to an hour, the chef arrives bringing his scowl with him. I didn't laugh once. He only did two 'tricks' and put no heart into it. 9. finally another good thing. grilled shrimp appetizer, about a half dozen. 10. No one is laughing however and it looks like the rice won't be that good. It isn't bad, but is lack luster. 11. Grilled vegies also nothing to write home about. 12. Where's my second 4 oz of diet coke? 13. What happened to those wonderful noodles I get at Shoguns? not here! 14. Steak is overdone and tough. not a happy camper tonight.  15. Chef leaves with the scowl he brought, but now the whole table is scowling with him. 16. Still no diet coke refill! ate all I wanted, which was not as good as Mikata, much less Shoguns. 17. Surprise. Bill is 28.95 for steak, 3.50 for the coke and a whopping 5.95 for the rice. with tax it's around 42.00. This is for ONE PERSON, no alcohol and only one softdrink.?!?!?   Guess what kind of tip I left!  Shoguns on the worst night was more fun, faster, more food and better food, and HALF the price!!! AND they don't charge extra for FRICKIN' RICE!  I will never darken the doors of Benihanas again as long as I live."}
{"text":"Good food and great customer service. Came in to get take out and grab a drink at the bar while I waited. While I was at the bar the take out employee came over and recommended that I eat in because of happy hour specials, which was so nice and rare (most restaurants just want to get the most money out of you). I decided to take out anyway, just wanted to get home. I paid for my take out and my drink and as I was leaving, two employees came running out to talk to me before I left. They informed me that my card was ran for the wrong amount but it was fixed and handed me two receipts to show they had charged me the original amount. One was a manager and he gave me his name and said to call if there were any issues with the card. So nice and considerate. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand these things happen but they really showed how much they care with how they handled it."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday evening and were told since we didn't have reservations we couldn't be served until 8 unless we wanted to eat in the sushi lounge, where supposedly the menu was the same. We chose to do that, though it did not seem to be much of a menu.  My husband ordered a steak entree and I ordered volcano shrimp, basically shrimp on greens.  His order was delivered a good fifteen minutes before mine.  What's up with that? The food was okay, but the timing sucked!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to dine. Everything on the menu is great, the service is great, and it is a fun atmosphere. I would ask that if you are looking for a quiet dining experience that you ask to not sit at a teppanyaki table. This is meant for community fun dining. My only complaint is that there is no longer swordfish on the menu. After trying everything else on the menu ( short of the tofu ), this was my go to entr√©e. I can't wait for my next chance to go enjoy some good filet mignon, shrimp, and a cool alcoholic beverage from the belly of a Buddha!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 celebrating a wedding and birthday.  First, the lady serving our table never greeted us, never smiled, and was difficult to get her attention for anything, although she was walking back and forth by our table for the entire time we were there.  The \"chef\" who prepared our food had no personality.  I have been to other Benihanas, and at least the chefs and servers were friendly and fun.  The food was ok, but nothing special.  I'm not sure why anyone would want to venture off the strip for this lackluster experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service, can't ask for more. If you do go get the fried rice with extra garlic butter!!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy Benihana - this visit was no exception.  It was our last night in Vegas and we realized we had not taken the kids to a magic show as promised.  So we convinced them that the 'dinner show' at Benihana was magic.  They just loved the onion volcano that turns into a steam train!  Anyway, the food is great and the decorating is really nice.  We had a coupon to temper the expensiveness a bit.  I don't gamble much, so when in Vegas, my number one priority is good food - this fits the bill to a tee!"}
{"text":"Eh.  It's entertaining.  You are paying for the entertainment with higher food prices for food that really isn't all that impressive.    Not sure what's changed for me.  Maybe my taste buds have gotten wiser over the last 3 years."}
{"text":"This is the best one that I have been to so far. The service was amazing. Every one was friendly. We all felt welcome. The food was great. Will definitely come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"The fish tasted like it was fresh from the ocean!  Thank you Ona, Maria, Jon and Sushi Chef Ken for an outstanding service experience.  Highly suggest the sashimi combo platter."}
{"text":"We can not express what an amazing, wonderful, happy experience we had here. From the moment we sat down, we were taken care of by multiple staff members. When our server took a second to show up at our table, we had at least 4 people Working to make sure we were happy. Our drinks were comped and the GM came over more than once to ensure the rest of the meal went well. Our chef, Frank, was funny and cooked our food to perfection. The brown sauce was much better here than other hibachi places we have been to in Pittsburgh. The cherry on top was the photo to commemorate not only our meal, but our foster son's 16th birthday and official move in date into our house. Thanks for making it a very memorable night!"}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday and had the worst experience ever. We waited a while to order food once we received drinks. The waitress  wasn't very good at explaining the menu, we then sat and waited at least a half hour before a chef arrived -only to tell us that he was taking another table and we're getting a new chef...the chicken was chewy and undercooked, and 2 people at our table didn't receive what they ordered. When it was time for checks the waitress became standoff - ish with us telling us that someone needed to pay for the food that wasn't received because she has nothing to do with the chefs. We requested the manager and explained that our chicken was undercooked. He actually ate the chicken off of a plate and told us it was fine! !!! At the end of it all, the waitress didn't even know her managers name and was bashing him to our party. Very unprofessional.  I won't eat there again, and will be sure to advise others to do the same"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from youngstown just to come here. Server sat us in the dining area, & after 10 minutes, no one had come to get our drink order, so we got up and left. On the way out, in the parking lot we saw a waitress(the only one working at the time) taking a smoke break with her boyfriend. The whole staff just honestly seemed like they didn't care about the customers at all. I would not recommend this restaurant location to anyone."}
{"text":"I think this is the nicest Benihanas I ever been to. It's all pimped out like a Japanese Village inside of the Hilton.  If you ever eaten at Bennis before you know the drill and just picture that bigger and better Vegas style!"}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday to take advantage of the $30 certificate. It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P.   Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there.   Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much.   Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal.   As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet.   At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it.   They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch.   For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at any Benihana's that I have gone to.  I have been to several in various states.  The atmosphere is great, food tastes good and the servers are very attentive.  My waitress called me \"mommy\" and was very sweet.  When I went to the other side of the restaurant she saw me walking and they had just mopped the area and she ran over to me saying \"be careful mommy\".  How cute is that?  My husband, son, his girlfriend and I went for dinner and had a great time.  They took my son's and girlfriends picture because it was a special occasion for them.  We ordered filet, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The only complaint I have is their drinks are weak and extremely pricey.  I don't mind paying more for a good drink but theirs were definitely lacking.   Their food is also overpriced but it is always a fun time having your food cooked for you as you sit around the table and are entertained by the chef.   We will be back.......................

{"text":"Take my advice...ask for Tony to be your chef! He's the best at what he does. All the years I have been going to Bennihanas, I have never had a chef as great as him! See you next time Tony! \"Heyyy she from the bay\" lol Hilarious!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed to write this review. I have been visiting this establishment since I was a child. My mother worked there when it was Samurai, and we would sometimes come with her to work when she didn't have a babysitter. My father and mother met at this place... it holds a lot of nostalgia for us. Many birthdays and other celebrations were held here. Our chef was TERRIBLE. So terrible I had to request a new chef. I was so uncomfortable with the preparation and I just knew our meal on MOTHER'S DAY would be ruined. They did switch chefs and the new one was outstanding. This was clouded though by the horrible chef we had experienced, coupled with the incredibly SLOW service by our server. Our drinks didn't come until after we finished our soups! The manager indicated he would take care of a portion of the check, and he did not. We paid in full and will likely never return to a place I have been going to for over 30 years. I pray they get new management and can turn it around. I will be visiting Wasabi from now on."}
{"text":"Great place great food any day any time... I love the lunch menu and even better is they're b day club Oh.  Yeah..."}
{"text":"I took the family for my daughters birthday, she picked the restaurant.  We arrived at 5:15 and had a reservation.  They were not terribly busy at that time, but the restaurant soon filled up, I couldn't believe it on a Monday night the place was packed in a matter of an hour..  Service was great, quick, courteous, but the chef wasn't very entertaining.  He seemed to rush through preparation and was always very busy, but he only managed to cook one thing at a time.  I have been to many hibachi bars over the years and this particular chef wasn't very well organized.    The food was ok, not very flavorful.  I had the filet mignon and shrimp, both we're good, but a little on the bland side.  I was surprised to learn that the meal came with steamed rice, and if we wanted fried rice it was an extra 3.50 per person.    In the end the meal was pricey, and we didn't order anything from the bar.  Food was on the bland side, and the chef was not very entertaining, but the service from the wait staff was fantastic.  I can't give it more than 3 stars, there are better places to go for hibachi."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Benihana in ages so tonight I made the mistake of suggesting to go here to celebrate me getting the job I wanted.  Ordered some rolls since we had sit at the bar area b/c their grills were all full.  spicy tuna, shrimp tempura roll, sashimi sampler, some salmon roll for 3 people. it was barely edible. shrimp tempura tasted like rice has gone bad and it wasn't holding all the stuff together it had a squishy texture, cold, greasy, tasted like rubber. spicy tuna tasted like red goo with no flavor or spiciness. NEVER again will I ever go here or any other Benihana location.  and to top it all off, our waiter was rude, careless, and seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. Definitely not a welcoming environment. below sub-par not worth $10 bucks to eat here let alone $70 we wasted here. serves me right to eat at the Mall location. I should've known better."}

{"text":"So this is my first time to a Teppanyaki restaurant. We came for a friend's graduation reception, large group with friends and family (I'd say about 30 people?)   It's pretty cool to see the chef cook right in the front, our chef was entertaining enough to show off some of his skills to get our laughter. The food was decent, I had the Land n' Sea (filet mignon and scallops), especially with the 'meat sauce?'. The veggies were pretty good too, but our combination had a bit too much of onions, I think.  Overall the night was fun, however, with a pre-selected menu special for the graduate, I can't tell about the prices. I might have to come back my own to know it, lol"}
{"text":"Noisy and touristic place, the food is mediocre.the Tuna diss was good, the yakisoba was not eatable.  A wiest of time, skip it and go for a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Benihana is usually pretty fun for business dinners - lotsa drinks, little onion volcanos, and scrimps flying into hats is a blast, right?  That is all dependent upon the chef though.... and the one we got at the LV hilton Benihana was , in so many words, a dud.  The decor inside is really nice - muted greens, maroons, and blacks.  Fountains, faux bamboo bridges, fountains (I know, I wrote fountains twice... there were a lot of them.) etc...  It sets the scene well and is fun to wander around in, but it doesn't make up for the bad service, the bad chefs, and the flavorless, unenthusiastically served, overpriced food.  2 stars, and they are lucky to get that."}
{"text":"My husband's family has been coming to this Samurai/Benihana for 30+ years and the service has been nothing short of outstanding.  From Al's warm greetings at the entrance to Tito's incredibly entertaining chef skills, this teppanyaki/ hibachi restaurant is the BEST in town!!!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi? At Benihana? Yeah. How to describe it? I guess the best I can come up with is \"production sushi\". Remember those documentaries that were on TV about the painting factories where people painted the same painting day in, day out tens of times a day? That's what the sushi I had at Benihana was like. Thier crab mix was dry, the eel sauce probably came directly from a bottle that said \"Yoshinoya\" in big red letters, the soft shell crab in the spider roll had obviously been cooked some time before. The sushi \"chefs\" looked somewhat bored and unhappy, and I counted 3 botched orders to tables in the 1 1/2 + hours I was there. Love good sushi? Try someplace else. Want to eat a lot of so-so sushi? Maybe this is for you. Not me, I'm trying elsewhere."}
{"text":"For years now, we have been going here on New Year's Day to bring in the new year.  We decided to visit today with some friends for lunch.  Dinner here can be a bit pricey, but if you go during the afternoon, the lunch menu is the way to go.  Prices are much lower, the selection is almost the same as dinner and portion sizes are still good.  Of course one of the best reasons for going here is to experience the meal preparations at the table.  It can become a fun performance, but they can vary depending on the chef assigned to you.  The food is usually excellent and the experience is great."}
{"text":"Love the location but service was so bad, forgot my beer poured a glass of water down my back and a cooking spatial almost my girl friend in the face. The sauces are totally different than we r use to and med rare means raw at this resturant"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time because I had a $30 gift card for my birthday from their Chef's Table Club. We went for lunch and sat at one of the grills with another group. I ordered the passion fruit lemonade which was way too sweet for my tastes, and the Benihana Excellence. My dining partner got the Lunch Sea Scallops. Both of our meals came with a \"salad\" and mine came with soup. These were incredibly disappointing and looked like something from a really cheap buffet. The salad was drenched in an unappetizing dressing and the soup tasted like salted hot water. Luckily the rest of the meal was a lot more enjoyable. The scallops came with fried rice; the scallops were great (especially for the rice) and the rice was good, although a bit on the salty side. My shrimp, and vegetables were really good and the teriyaki beef was good but it was drenched in too much sauce for me. I personally thought the food tasted better without any of their dipping sauces. At the end of the meal they gave me ice cream with a candle on it and sang happy birthday. They also took a photo of us and printed it out and put it in a little paper frame.   I definitely recommend signing up for the birthday special because it is a great deal. Also, of it's your first time go for lunch because they have a lot of reasonable lunch entrees. Not sure if I would be as pleased with the experience if I had to pay $50 for it; but for $20 it was fantastic."}
{"text":"For my dad's birthday last night my mom got all my siblings together for dinner. We had 9 in our party so we got our own table. About half of us started off with cocktails, I personally got their signature punch which was so delicious & very reasonable during hh for $5 (only at the bar though, not at the table). I don't know why they did, but my bro & mom ordered some apps for everyone, an assortment of tempura (shrimp, scallops & veggies) & edamame. Both were ok but cold, blech. Shortly after we received our soups & salads. The soup was pretty tasty but the salad was drenched in dressing. Everyone ordered something from the teppanyaki menu, except my sis who opted for sashimi & a couple sushi rolls, which she enjoyed. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but my hubby got rocky's choice (steak & chicken) & I got samurai treat (steak & shrimp).   Our chef Julio was nice enough but messed up on the tricks quite a few times, isn't that what we're paying for here? Regardless, we all had some laughs & it was fun. The food was ok. I ordered my steak med-rare & some parts were rare while others were pretty well done, not very consistent. They use so much oil & butter yet the food was flavorless, we had to use a lot of extra soy sauce & salt. I'd say the best food item was probably the fried rice, but again it needed extra soy sauce added. A couple of us ordered dessert after dinner, green tea & chocolate ice cream & banana tempura. The ice creams were ok, definitely store bought & seemed a lil old. I didn't try the banana tempura but those who had it said it was ok also. I almost forgot to mention, since it was my dad's birthday they sang to him (which he hated) & took a pic for him to take home (nice touch).  I didn't foot the bill but was informed that it was over $500 with tip! There were a few people in our party who had never been before so I'm glad they got to experience it, but when you compare the quality of the food to the price it just doesn't add up. Yes you get a show, but I care more about my food tasting good than some tricks. I would maybe come back for some of their punch during hh & fried rice, but that's about it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the world. The setting here is beyond words. It's like a little city that you travel into to eat. A stream. trees. upstairs teppan rooms or share rooms or tables that are next to the stream as you eat. I have never had a bad meal here or at any of the Benihana. If you want to impress someone or people.... this is the place.. HINT, make a reservation as far in advance as you want. these professional people will handle it. Thank you Rocky!"}
{"text":"Seems my review was filtered so I'll share my 2 cents again, this place is sad.  Awful service, awful food, and the lack of knowledge is a smack in a real Chef's face."}
{"text":"Very disappointingly Food is overpriced Portions are extremely small Food is bland and tasteless Use butter and lemon seasoning on most dishes No distinguishable difference in dishes Poor waitress service You will leave hungry"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Benihana in over a year.  Last time I went I was in a different state.  Regardless of where I was it doesn't really matter.  This place is like a high end McDonalds.  Same stuff everytime.  I had steak, scallops and fried rice.  The steak was blah. Scallops are one of my faves.  Add on lemon and butter and there really isn't a chance of  Fu#$ing these up.  My point is the scallops were great and I really like fried rice too.  The theatrics were decent but not as riveting as I remember.  Last time I went I was probably drunk or the chef cut his finger off.  I'm sure I will go again."}
{"text":"I ate here today with a group of five coworkers. We were one of maybe three tables of diners when we arrived, yet the service was the worst I can remember.   We were first told it would be a 20-minute wait for a hibachi table. None were occupied, but we accepted a different table and ordered, assuming the wait would have been based on chef availability. More than 45 minutes after we ordered we saw them cooking rice at a still-unoccupied hibachi table below us; it was for our meals, which finally arrived more an hour after ordering. It's worth noting we all ordered directly off of the lunch menu, and we were even told \"no changes or substitutions,\" making our order even simpler.   Then, we had two errors with the meals.   Aside from the long wait, our server was inattentive and brusque. Questions were sometimes ignored, sometimes answered with one word; it at times seemed like we were an irritant rather than customers, despite being a friendly and polite group that made no special requests and never attempted to flag them down despite the long waits between each stage of the meal. I'm baffled by the overall experience and will not plan to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Well, my kids like Benny-Ha-ha.....   We've eaten here several times - most recently on 2011-04-29.  We've dined at the teppanaki tables in the past, but most of the time (including our most recent visit) we just go to the sushi bar.    The happy hour menu in the sushi bar brings prices down to a reasonable level; we can order several items, have a fair meal and not feel like we'll need another mortgage.  Usually, I order the hand rolls and an assortment of appetizers or sashimi.  Quality seems to be hit-and-miss depending on who made your order - the chef or the sous-chef.  The place is obviously cutting cost; in recent visits (as in more than one), they've stopped providing complimentary edamame and the portions seem to have gotten smaller. In the past, we have tried the teppanaki tables - usually when we have a group in town.  It's a bit of a chef show (same routines almost 95% of the time), but that's what it is - a show.  The resulting food tends to be somewhat bland.  You're paying for the experience and average food; I'd rather pay for good food and live with the experience.   For now we'll stick with the happy hour sushi bar menu."}
{"text":"Benihana is enjoyably, good food and not terribly priced. The service is mediocre because the management no longer allows you to pick your sever. Which is odd since your the customer. Lunch is great here though and much more price competitive than Dinner."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and saddened ,brought a whole group to this place for a birthday -- first our server was rude and our cook spoke no English and did nothing - no tricks no show no even fire- the food was terrible - 5 of the 7 didn't even eat -I've been to many hibachi places all over the country - this by far was the worst ."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative star rating to this restaurant. The food is way over priced and the show the chef put on wasn't even average. And to top it all off my wife and I both got sick from the food. Don't think I'll be patronizing this establishment again"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! The waiter and chef were so patient with my EXTREMELY strict diet! No soy, dairy, or gluten and they handled it amazing. They helped me make choices and cooked my food first before he slathered everything with butter. My food was cooked to perfection and in line with my dietary restrictions. Carlos was so nice and patient while cooking for me and still had personality! I really appreciate the personal attention from waiter and chef and our whole family had a delicious meal!  Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. It's always fun and the mixed drinks are very very good. Try the Haiku Colada. It's delicious! Just realize that you will have to wait 30 minutes to an hour before even touching your food. Other than that it's a great experience for a first date, a regular date or a gathering of people. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"They must have no cleaning people in this town !  This was about the filthiest restaurant I have been in a long time.  Who runs this place ??  Simply disgusting."}
{"text":"Since opentable wouldn't accept my review...seemed good for group (LV for bachelorette party). Party girls would probably choose more modern ambience but was in our hotel & compared to \"in\" places in Vegas was decently priced although still expensive in our eyes. Host took group pic & printed out right there for free nice surprise! Took a while for waiter to get to us, get orders going, get refills & their antion in general. Be aware they charge extra for \"sharing\" so be very clear even if you're just putting someone's order on your check. No help for a vegetarian (other reviews said there were options but the waiter said no substitutions and no help) so had to eat only the fried veg app & edamame. Waiter upsells by letting you think things are included & is hard to understand. Show was good though we enjoyed the cook!"}
{"text":"So I couldn't really eat anything at this place. I let the lady know that I would just be sitting with my friend. She then told me that she was going to charge me to sit there. I asked if I had to pay even though I wasn't eating and she said yes. Such a stupid thing. I just said fuck it because I'm not going pay to sit there to watch people eat. What a terrible experience. They should have a disclaimer on their sign that says \"you have to pay even if you can't eat anything here.\" I'll be sure to never go to this place again. It was beautiful inside but the lady taking orders was a complete bitch."}
{"text":"I was taken here to celebrate my birthday last week and was very disappointed with my first experience! The waitress was inattentive and it was a lengthy wait for the food! I sat at a table (not the hibachi table) and when the food finally came, the meat was very cold I had to have the waitress warm it up! The food was very average, and it was disappointing that they charge extra for having fries rice with your meal, this was the first I've ever heard of a hibachi restaurant like this! I can say I will never come back nor recommend."}
{"text":"Great food the only problem is the wait times. If you want to eat here make a reservation a week in advance and do not try to walk in because on weekend your looking at 1-2hrs wait times. Other then that food is great and good entertainment"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying Hiro (our Teppanyaki Chef) made this experience a 5 star dining visit by far. He was incredible, engaging, and just so much fun.  Now for the 4 star review, our server was horrible. I went out to eat with 7 members of my family (8 total) and received a female server that I can't even remember the name of (did she ever even mention it??). She was hardly attentive, my girlfriend waited up to 15 for a refill on water, ended up getting up and grabbing the pitcher to get it herself. Then when Hiro started making our food he had to run and get the rice bowls (while our rice was cooking might I say) because our server forgot them. Needless to say Hiro was a little embarrassed, but we encouraged him we were fine. Hiro did an absolutely amazing job with our table and we all loved him. We were cracking up at his jokes and in awe with his tricks. He absolutely made our trip and I'm very grateful we had a chef of his caliber at the table.  When our server came back we asked her if we had to tip Hiro personally (because honestly we felt he deserved more of our tip than she did), and she told us no. We understood and jokingly said we wanted to give him money, and she responded with \"No, he doesn't need it.\" She then proceeded to tell us the chefs salary and they \"usually make between $100-200 a night from the servers, we need it more than they do.\" This caught all of us off guard as none of us needed to be told that information, and it felt incredibly rude to respond in that way.  All in all the experience was great, I'd rather of had Hiro as our server AND chef though! Wish I could of given this 5 stars but the service just left a bad taste in my mouth."}

{"text":"As you can probably tell by my other reviews-- I'm one of those, \"if you don't have something nice to say....yadda yadda yadda.\"  But in the spirit of Yelp and actual critical review--- I'll have to suggest steering clear of Benihana; at least until they add more spices and seasonings to their repertoire.  Yes, yes, yes, I should've known.  I'm not much of a 'chain' eater-- but this was my boyfriend's family's pick for his graduation dinner.  It seems to be a family favorite.... which I can't say I really understand.  At all.  I also should mention that this review is based entirely on their only vegetarian dinner option.    I didn't get a look at the bill, but my course was at least over $25 for far less than exemplar fare. Granted, this included a miso soup, small lettuce & carrot salad, tofu appe, egg fried rice, grilled assorted vegetables as the entree, and a scoop of rainbow sorbet for dessert-- but it reaffirms how one should rely on the old standby of quality versus quantity.  And I guess they have to charge that much to keep the Benihana salt mines open....  heaven sakes! The waitress was giggling to herself about how much water I was putting down, but I really can't imagine that this is a rare thing with their preferred method of seasoning; salting the bejesus out of everything from the pasty, ginger-esque dressing on the salad and the soggy, cold, fried tofu appe to the soy-and-butter sopping vegetables.  The only reprieve was the rainbow sorbet and a nice hot green tea closer.    Everyone else at the table had either a meat or seafood course, and were quite satisfied with their meals, so MAYBE it was just the veggie option or MAYBE I'm just a picky foodie or just MAYBE this place really needs the constructive criticism.  And yes, I also realize this place is possibly more about the show than the food...???.... but our chef, though nice, was quite lackluster and didn't have a full cashe of tricks to unveil.  Just the onion volcano.  Sigh."}
{"text":"I've been to several Benihana's locations.  The meal was excellent, well prepared and the evening was wonderful.  My Chef (Charles) was entertaining as he prepared the food.  Just seemed not up to the standard that was set at my first experience at this restaurant in another location.  All in all, a positive.  The only fault I could say was that you could easily drive by this location and not see it."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend last week. Loved the food, the chef was really personable. The other guests were equally fun to chat with. The best place to relax and just enjoy a more social type dinner. Will be back many more times for sure."}
{"text":"Just one tip: before you visit, enter on their website for their \"club\". It's one of the best restaurant deals around! For my birthday I was emailed a coupon for a free meal, worth up to $30!!! Great service. They know how to treat their guests."}
{"text":"Good dinner.  Family friendly way to spend a few hours."}
{"text":"Wow ! The atmosphere with a great group is what you get here. The food is very good , and what to expect from a Benihanas. I would have given a 5 star but there were a couple of minor things ; our waiters personality didn't match the festive and fun environment. He did a good job with our orders but didn't offer any suggestions or add to the fun. The other reason for the 4 star is the sushi rolls. They were ok , not great. Stick to the hibachi.  We will definitely go back , we love it !"}
{"text":"Great place I really like the decor feels like I'm at actual Asian little village. The food is really good and the chefs are pretty funny and know how to do awesome tricks with the food. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas however a little bit pricy"}
{"text":"After hearing so much scuttlebutt about Benihana, I had to jump at the chance to try it out for myself.  I am glad I did.  I ate dinner there in a small group, a second group of people was seated around the same hot stove.  Although our two groups did not interact much, it was evident from other tables that there was some intermingling going on.  This made for a fun, lively atmosphere.  There were many birthday celebrations being had, and by the end of the night I could sing Happy Birthday in fluent Japanese.  The cook arrived shortly after our orders were placed and put on quite the show as he prepared our food.  The meals were all oriented around some form of meat, I got the feeling that a vegetarian would not be happy here.  Portions were very large and served piping hot.  Though nobody at our table consumed any, \"adult\" beverages were available but pricey.    The filet, lobster, new york steak, and fried rice were all excellent.  Two varieties of sushi that we tried were excellent as well.  A caveat here is that if you are arriving hungry, you will be starving by the time your food is ready.  The only downside to having your food prepared before your eyes is that you are presented with wonderful aromas during the entire preparatory process.    Yes, the meals are pricey.  Yes, the wait times can be obscene.  But with a reservation for a special occasion, this is a fine place to dine out."}
{"text":"Benihana was never as good as individually owned teppan restaurants on the West Coast, but it was good.  Unfortunately, the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"Took my wife amber here and the good and service was awesome! Margarita was our server and she was attentive and had personality. Tim was our chef and he put on a great show! I say if they had 5 more Tim's that that place would be packed every night. The food was fresh and had a lot of flavor we split the filet mignon and lobster tail. I will be back for sure thank you Benihana"}
{"text":"Went here today for my birthday lunch. Hadn't been to Benihana's for years but had loved it when I was a kid. We have always gone out for hibachi quite often and have had some very good experiences -elsewhere. We should've known it wasn't going to be a good experience when we entered the restaurant and were greeted  halfheartedly by what I would laughably call the hostess. No smile or greeting, sat us and said that we should have had a reservation...for two...for  lunch. Waited a while for our server to take our order for drinks. Sat with a nice family of four who were celebrating a birthday too! When we ordered they asked if we would like the lunch or dinner portion. When the food was prepared and served it turned out there was no difference in the size of the portions - but of course we had paid more for the dinner one. They also heavily pushed the upgrade to the fried rice, chicken fried rice. It seems like that might be the only fried rice available so we got it. Four dollars a person for a cup of rice with 2 pieces of chicken and it turns out we would've gotten fried rice anyway. The server was just okay but the chef, Nick, was terrible. He was not Asian, which is OK - but he also did not have any clue on how to prepare hibachi. No sauces used, just lots of salt - tough meat, couldn't do any tricks, talked about how tired he was etc. food was NOT good. Not great quality and the chef didn't know how to cook it. Cut each piece slowly including the shrimp into small bites which makes the shrimp tough. Other tables were laughing and having fun- we just sat there and watched this guy slowly cut and cook the food poorly. At the end the server did not acknowledge the Birthday in our party.   By then the lunch was just a joke and we wanted to leave. As we left the hostess just stood at the hostess stand and did not even acknowledge our presence, say goodbye, have a happy new year, smile -anything! Benihana's in Scottsdale sucks-pure and simple. An expensive and disappointing waste of time and money  we just moved to AZ but will never return and can NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience ! Fried rice was awesome. There was some wait time that reduced a star but all in all a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"I didn't like this Benihana's at all! The cook was the only one who made my night cool. The waitress was trying to be too cool or hip. Just curious if she's that way with all of her guests? She left for about 15 minutes. When she did come back she didn't even apologize. Another waitress broke a bottle that went flying everywhere... I got up to go the bathroom and glass was in my shoe. I mentioned it to the manager on site and he brushed it off as it was no big deal. He never came over to see if anyone was injured, or if cut by flying glass... The bottle hit the back of the chair that another guest was sitting in. That entire experience made me not want to go back to Benihana's ever! Not just that one, but none! It's overrated if you ask me. That place will NEVER see me in it! Oh, and we were given some free appetizers cards for our next visit. There will be no next visit.Corporate needs to come down and have a training class on how to treat customers. Everyone is not looking for a free meal! And we still tipped the waitress... I just don't like how the manager down played that whole glass flying incident. I could've really cut myself had I not felt something poking my foot. Ok, rant over! Never again! I'll be going to Katsua, or Geisha House, hell Panda Express gives better service!"}
{"text":"Been going to Benihana for 30 years. This experience was forgettable. Very little flavor to the food. Our chef was ok, not great. The Food and the experience was not worth the money. We paid for better than we received..."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! Our Chef must have been new, he did one trick and had the personality of a rock!  We left still hungry as we did not get much of anything. The amount of fried rice was minimal at best. The highlight was seeing that there is a Chili's next door so we could actually get full!   We sat with another couple and the chef forgot to make their rice. By the time he recooked rice for them all of ours was already gone or cold for those who wanted a complete meal at once.  I'm sure our chef Carlos is a nice guy, maybe just in the wrong profession? Maybe the other chefs with more experience could so him the ropes? This was a huge let down to drive an hour for this!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but you could tell the sushi roll in my lunch boat not been made to order, instead had been premade sometime before.  My real gripe would be, being seated next to a screaming child, in the bar! There were two kids in the bar, and the one next to me was obnoxious.  I didn't even know you were allowed to sit children in the bar section, but they do. It ruined my lunch and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  Sushi can be hit or miss, especially when you live in the southwest,  but there's no reason to have to feel like you're eating in a McDonald's playground."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible visit to this restaurant. I surprised my wife and brought her here for our one year wedding anniversary. She had never been. I made a reservation at 7:00 and was not sat until after 7:00, strike one. We browse through the menu and we decide on our dishes. My wife ordered the teriyaki chicken and I ordered the Rocky's choice (chicken and steak) there were two other parties sat with us (I know this is normal and I'm not upset about this) both gentleman that were also at the table both ordered the Rocky's choice as well. As the chef was cooking, he cooked two and a half chicken breasts for the 4 meals that included chicken. I'm thinking to myself that hopefully he is going to put more on the grill. He portioned out one whole chicken breast for my wife's dish which I was pleased about because it was her first time and she was really enjoying everything. He then proceeded to cube up the remaining one and a half chicken breasts for the remaining THREE chicken dishes. Strike two. I paid for a whole portion of chicken and received about a third of a chicken breast. I am highly disappointed in this restaurant and will not be returning. I did not complain as it was my anniversary and did not want an issue, but looking back I should have mentioned it because the dishes cost way too much to be served like I was. This was supposed to be a special night for my wife and I and there was nothing special about taking her to Benihana."}
{"text":"Another one of our favorites in Vegas! Service is very good-- pricey, but portion sizes are huge & food quality is very good! Great atmosphere, great for a date night in Vegas!   If you are planning a birthday trip, sign up for the Birthday coupon $30 off your meal! It takes about a month to receive the coupon so plan ahead! Also be sure to sign up for the Hilton reward card for discounts toward your meal! There is always a monthly spcial that is \"kept secret\" so make sure to ask about the current specials!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. More family friendly than other restaurants of its type."}
{"text":"This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Benihana for 39 years.  My family spends every special occasion here and it has become a tradition.  The food is always consistent and amazing!  My daughter enjoys all the interaction with the cook and actually eats her meal which is a feat in itself!!!  If you haven't tried the Chateabriand and Sea Scallops....you must!!!! They are the best items on the menu!!!  Last experience there sent it over the top.  We had the head chef Toy and he was awesome!  He even performed for us by singing 3 Elvis songs!  Truly an experience to remember.  They better never close the Benihana in Westgate, it would be a shame."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Hibachi place my husband and I have ever been to. It is definitely pricey, but we loved the food quality! We went here on our last wedding anniversary, but next time we're thinking of going just because. Wish more places were like this one! Very entertaining as well."}
{"text":"First off the food is ok. The atmosphere is ok. The show you get while your food is being cooked is what you would expect from a place like this cheesy. But if your a local with an lvh players card and a Nevada Id you get 25% off your entire bill. So try it if your in the mood."}
{"text":"Expected more for what we payed ($30-40/plate).  Our hostess could have given better service. We were out of water for longer than we wanted, and she was not the best with her communication skills in regards to understanding what we wanted. Her accent made it hard to understand her, but I'm not knocking her for this, simply the way it was.  Interior of the restaurant could have also been better - ate in many places in Vegas, many which were priced less than this, and were kept nicer on the inside.  Our chef was very good, however. If this review were only about him, he would get 5 stars. Skilled, personable, and delivered good food.  Anyways, overall \"OK\", but for the amount paid, I would have expected more. Would not return when there are so many alternatives on the strip that better this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and had a great time. Stephanie took my reservation and was very polite on the phone. Ammon my server was excellent, and Tim the chef made the food very delicious. The staff was very kind to sing me happy birthday."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place for special occasions like birthday celebrations when I was a kid and when it was called the Samurai. Some things have definitely changed, such as the clientele, but many things have remained relatively the same - like the table-side Hibachi cooking, and the absolutely delicious shrimp sauce.   Now we only go when we get our Birthday Gift Certificates from Benihana, which is essentially free lunch for 2. Before I quit eating meat, I'd always order the steak and shrimp combo, which comes with fried rice and veggies, a small salad and soup with mushrooms and scallions. I'd always douse the meat and rice with the oh-so delicious, but oh-so incredibly unhealthy shrimp sauce. For those who know what I'm talking about, you know it's MMMMMMMMMM-good.  One thing that I don't remember having at the Samurai was Sushi, probably because in the 80's, sushi was not as common as it is now. Last time we went we ordered the California rolls, which were fresh and good.  The last 2-3 times we've gone, the service was sub-par, and we waited very long (45 minutes) to get our food. However a free lunch is a free lunch, even if it really isn't free.  Will go again when we get emailed our birthday vouchers."}
{"text":"I came here because I was standing in line at a restaurant next door and a couple people had an extra food ticket with a show, their friend was sick and couldn't make it so they invited me to eat with them. It was my first experience at a benihana, it was interesting. The food was decent, nothing special. The knife work and tricks were fun. For a free meal it was nice."}
{"text":"The food is generally pretty good not great. Kind of pricey compared to similar types of Japanese steakhouses that offer a Groupon or Living Social deal."}
{"text":"Massively over-priced hibachi dinners. They have an $8 upcharge for fried rice. $8! My bill for hibachi filet, fried rice, and a beer was over $60. On top of that, the chef didn't even know how to cook the steak properly. \"Medium rare\" does NOT mean medium on the outside, rare on the inside. The staff was friendly, but beyond that I could not have been less satisfied."}
{"text":"Made reservations at this establishment and ended up waiting well beyond the reservation time. The manger just stares with a mean and rude demeanor and you are greeted by unfriendly hostesses who have zero professionalism. Ended up leaving after reservation time came and went with no indication by the front hostess of the status of our reservation when you are literally sitting right in front of her. I would not recommend this Benihana's in Chandler at all. You will get better service at any nearby restaurant."}
{"text":"$5 for a single piece of tuna sashimi with that terrible pre-frozen texture, and minimal flavor.  This might be a good location for hibachi/teppanyaki, but stay away from their sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"I have had great sushi throughout my life, but Benihana is one of the best! The atmosphere is inviting and the staff is welcoming. I would refer someone to Benihana any day!"}
{"text":"This place is run down and will come no where near meeting your expectation of the high end reputation Benihana carries.  When I pay 25-30 a plate I expect a clean restaurant.  The hibachi chef had little personality.  The bathrooms had no soap, overflowing trash cans and used paper towels all over the place.  The carpet in the dining room was dirty and the stairs were duct taped together.  It felt very uncared for.  Do not expect a fine dining experience.  I've been to many other hibachi grills and every one was way nicer than this place and they give you more food."}
{"text":"Caleb is an excellent chef and although the AC was broken he still made our time fun and enjoyable. We will definitely be back to see him!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very average, service was average, portions were small and the food was very over priced. I would not go back. Other sushi and hibachi in the area is much better."}
{"text":"Do yourself and your party a favor and just don't go. From start to finish this place is a disaster. I made a reservation for five at 7:30 on Saturday and showed up on time. The three gentlemen at the desk could not seem to get us seated for 20 minutes. There was no explanation. We were seated at a hibachi table and then spent another 20 minutes waiting for water or a waitress. When she did show up in a hurry she was flustered, disheveled and a wreck. I made sure we got our order in since so much time had been wasted already. Then another 20 minutes go by and our chef shows up. He barely spoke in an audible voice. The one joke he told was that he was from east Cleveland not east China. I almost walked out when he started sweating profusely and wiping his face on his shirt sleeve constantly. The real disgusting part was watching the sweat fall off his brow onto the grill. The food was ok, then he, the waitress and everyone disappeared. Got the check, felt ripped off and waited for to go boxes that never came and left."}
{"text":"Nice show, but once is probably enough.  Food extremely pricey ($34) for essentially stir-fry. Way too much butter used!  Way too slow! At our table, I was in a group of 3. Two groups of 2 made up the ensemble.  We were first to be served (sea food and vegetarian).  Then beef the beef eaters, then the chicken eaters. Poor chicken guy were just being served by the time I had finished my whole meal."}
{"text":"Benihana is always a must for me whenever i go to a new city. Visited my family and didnt disappoint. Everyone was friendly. Food was great.  Thanks for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Benihana, located inside of the Las Vegas Hilton, last night. The restaurant has a visually stunning appearance with a grand entrance. The entire staff was very friendly and efficient. All of the food was simply delicious, from the calamari sautee appetizer to the steak and shrimp main course to the green tea and orange sherbert for dessert. The onion soup and house salad were very tasty as well. This is the way Japanese steakhouses should be run."}
{"text":"Reservations for 11 at 815.  Arrived at 810 and had to wait until 830 to be seated.  Then we had to split up the group because they didn't plan for the group.  I saw a bus boy sweeping around a table but never picked it up.  A menu was laying on the floor by the front door and was never picked up.  850 the waitress first came up.  930 soup finished finally got hot tea after reminding the waitress.  Food was ok but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"So this sat, my friends and I went there for dinner. We got seated pretty fast, BUT we waited more than 30 minutes for the chef to come. The chef didn't have any hibachi shows, he was just frying food in front of us and was just quiet. the server didn't bring the rice until we pretty much finished our food and he forgot a couple's order. FOOD was PLAIN and tasted bad. I have been to so many japanese steak houses. so far this is the worst i've ever been. they even ask extra money for fried rice. They are over priced with a bad service. so you want to watch the hibachi show and have good food. DO NOT GO THERE"}
{"text":"This is the worst hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh. The service was very slow and the food was not good for the price that is charged. The food was cold and everything was flavorless. The salad and steak sauce tasted like cleaner. The chicken was also extremely dry. Nakama or ichiban are way better choices in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went here on the 4th and it wasn't too pleasant. They sat us in a tiny confined booth with a family who really wanted space. So by the time we sat down we were really on top of one anthers space. The meal was ok but the friend chicken rice was TERRIBLE! That's our favorite item there and it was the worst thing we've eaten. I noticed they use a huge cube of butter while the other ones I've experienced have the butter softened in a metal bowl. The rice had absolutely no flavor what so ever. The Pina Colada was yummy! Will I eat here again? Nope not at this one."}
{"text":"Fun place. Food was okay. It's all about the show."}
{"text":"I like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups. They also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month.  I would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat. But this is a great place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Just got back from this place and it was fantastic. Our chef NICK was fabulous and did some great tricks for the grandkids.  The food is so fresh and delicious.  A great time for all.   Must try Nick!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Make sure to try the marble soda - its great! The spicy chicken is amazing, and my friend got seafood, which was also delicious. Everything is cooked in front of you and tastes fresh! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Entertaining, fun for family but they ran out of glasses and my table didn't get our drinks for a while, the food was good and the wait staff was friendly but they mixed up our checks and we had to call the waitress back to give them to the right person"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife, brother and his fiance.   Decor was nice....the whole time i was there i thought of the movie \"Memoirs of a Geisha\"...lol..  The service was horrible. Our server was not a bit, not a tad, not slightly...but VERY SLOW...not only was I upset for myself and my party, but also for the elderly woman next to me whom needed water for her medicine....but WHERE WAS OUR SERVER.....i just couldn't tell you....  Our chef did his best to turn frowns upside down, but couldn't get more than a little smirk.   Now I've been to the chain restaurant out here in Ca, but the prices made me feel  COSTRAPHOBIC...maybe cause it's Vegas..  The food was OK..nothing to rave about....  I don't think I would ever go back to this restaurant...."}
{"text":"this was by far the best experience i've ever had at any hibachi style restaurants! johnny was an awesome cook and he does very funny tricks which was very amusing!! and the server jezrey was the best she was warm and friendly!!! i highly recommend everyone to check out this location! my overall experience was amazing from the time i walked in to the time i left out! 5starsfood was great!!!!! i will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"There is quite a bit more here to review than a usual restaurant. Of course it is loud, never been to a place like this that wasn't loud. I felt the service was a little slow. They are definitely not prepared to constant service for each table like a usual restaurant. However, with that said I was considerate and more patient with the wait staff than I typically would be. Scott was our chef and he was entertaining, attentive, and the food was amazing. I've had very little food that was better. To me it was impressive how busy they were on a Monday night. Says a lot about a business that's busy 6-7 days a week. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who has never experienced it before. I tasted a little bit of several menu ideas and couldn't imagine anything on the menu that doesn't taste great."}
{"text":"If I could give this \"place\" a zero I,would do that#!!!## The entire management is NOT GOOD! They laughed at my husband and I when we asked for a table foe 2 at late lunch,,,330pm . Then after asking to speak to the management,,,,.we were directed and spoke with \"Bob\"! He is by far the most unusfullness excuse for ANYTHING in management imaginible! THIS PLACE IS BAD NEWS!!!! Go to P F Changs...at least you can eat the food there and it is GREAT AT PF CHANGS#!#"}
{"text":"I honestly love Benihana, but the problem I have is that I don't get the same level of service every time I go. There have been times where dinner has been an amazing experience and the food is very good and times where I feel like I got screwed out of 100 bucks. I think that lunch is a lot better deal than dinner, and far more reasonably priced. I made a BIG MISTAKE recently when I tried to go in with my boyfriend and there were no spots at the Teppanyaki table available. We sat down at the regular tables, but still ordered the same meals you would get from the table where you get the show. Not only did we pay a ton of money and not get the full experience, but the food was bland and horrible. I got a scallops/filet plate and there was only 1 scallop chopped up into tiny pieces in front of me. Even though we weren't able to have the normal dining experience doesn't mean we should have to get kitchen scraps if we were paying the same price. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Good place for a nice family birthday celebration sign up for their birthday club and get  a free entree. The show used to be much better or at least not all of the staff are as exciting to watch but food is good reasonable with discount and entertaining for all"}
{"text":"Thursday evening, with a 2 hour wait, my boyfriend and I sat in the bar area. I hadn't been here in about 3 years. Way, down,hill! OK, I'll admit I came here for the free birthday meal that wasn't really free, because my boyfriend paid for his meal and my sake. Anyway, the steak was kind of flavorless, the colossal shrimp was good. I had maybe two strips of zucchini wow, I used to get enough food to take home leftovers. To make matter worse, my free scoop of green tea ice cream was melting when the waitress brought it out.  I am NOT impressed."}
{"text":"Both times we have been to this restaurant, we have received horrible and unprofessional service from the management and the servers.  There have not been any issues with the hibachi chefs, but the issues with the management and the servers has made us never want to come back to this place ever again. The first time, I received my salad after the hibachi was already served. It also took us 30 minutes to get the check. The second time, our server was texting in the corner instead of providing refills and cleaning plates. She was also trying to \"sneak\" a photo of a famous person. Highly unprofessional."}
{"text":"What happened? I came here last year and the service was great. I was there today and had so many issues that I will never go back again. After I got the check I asked to see the manager. I waited over 30 minutes and the manager was no where to be seen so we left. This was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this place... great food, great service, reasonable prices and the best shrimp sauce and ginger dressing I have ever had."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was all kinds of wrong. We were seated at a table a few minutes before one right next to us. The other table got served first. At 53 minutes after our reservation time  finally we got soup. It should NEVER take as long as it did for us to get our food. We also waited for quite a while for drink refills. We were served our chicken fried rice,  then protein and then vegetables.  The zucchini was way  over cooked at that point and I was disappointed.  This was probably our 10th visit and maybe our last."}
{"text":"The food was alright. Nothing special. The making of the food was the coolest part. Sushi was not that great and way over priced. The only thing I liked honestly was the sherbet ice cream. The portions are not that big either and the order in which the make the food is kind of random. I was finished with my rice by the time my meat got to me. 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Very entertaining dinner.   Delicious shrimp and teriyaki beef.   Chef Jeff was artful, creative and extended hospitality to the entire table.   The soup and salad both very tasty!  Green tea gelato unique and good!"}
{"text":"LOVE, love, love this place.  Can't say enough good things about the food.  Make sure you have a reservation - it's often necessary.  The food is a little pricey, but well worth it to me.  You get so much of it and it's oh so good.  I've been here at least ten times and have had many different hibachi combinations, but keep going back to the hibachi chateaubriand - filet marinated in garlic butter.  Every aspect of the meal can be customized to your tastes even though the chef is cooking for the entire group at once.  Service is usually pretty good, but the rating here comes mainly from the amazing food."}
{"text":"Man oh man have I missed out all these years.  After enjoyin some good ol habachi a million other places I had thought they were all the same.  One word says it all AMBIANCE!  As you walk into this place you find yourself right smack dab in the middle of Japan.  Who knew walking through an old worn down hotel you would find yourself in a hidden jewel?!  We arrived for our 7pm reservation for 5 on Friday night for my friend's birthday.  Without hesitation we were lead to an elevator that takes you to the second level.  My friends being that they have been here several times never had been to the second level.  We were seated in kind of a quiet room with only two tables being used-out of six.  There were other rooms we walked by even bigger that were full and totally loud.  So I dont know what is worse being loud in a quiet room or screaming over people in a loud room?! LOL    The dinner was awsome.  I ordered the spicy chicken breast and the BF ordered the filet.  Both were amazing.  The chicken really wasnt all that spicy but it was still good.  Everyone else loved their food.  We asked for our fried rice extra crispy and the chef was fine with leaving it on there a little longer.  Because it was my friends bday they gave her a kids chefs hat (hehe) and let her man the food for a minute.  It was great for pics.  The chef was great and very entertaining.  The only complaint I had was the waitress wasnt picking up the empty glasses and dishes we were done with so they accumulated in the middle where there was an empty chair between us and the other party.  A little tacky I would say.  So with everyone ordering 2 drinks and a dinner each our bill was $320.00.  That didnt count the $20 we gave the chef beforehand and the total tip at the end.  Whew thats a hefty bill but the experience and food were worth it.  A great memory!  On our way out there were little secluded areas with couches where you can sit and over look the 1st level and just chill and have some drinks.  Totally cool.  Not sure if you can rent those but it would be cool to have a small party there.  So on our way out FIRE WORKS!  Yes fireworks shown on the upper walls just for us!  It was pretty cool I must say.  *Great Place for a Date, for a Group and definitely for an occasion for the price."}
{"text":"Even before you walk inside, the atmosphere is created by the exterior of the restaurant which is made to look like a Japanese-style building. When greeted with staff, you notice that they are wearing special outfits that appear to be from Japanese culture with symbols on them. This small addition adds a touch of sophistication to the restaurant, making you feel as if you're getting the full cultural experience.  At a good restaurant, there should be background music playing just loud enough to be noticed, but not loud enough to the point you have to raise your voice to speak to your friends and family.  At Benihana, there was no music playing at all. Whether that means the music was too soft of there was none at all, I would have liked more music to be playing as I was enjoying my food.   At a restaurant with good service, I expect a server who is respectful, attentive, asks how the quality of food is, and does things in a timely manner. During my experience at Benihana, the waitress was pretty attentive, coming by a decent amount of times, but when it came to quickness and accuracy of what was needed, the service was not up to par. For example, my friend asked for lemons for her water, and only after she asked three times did she receive them. While taking our food order, the waitress wasn't able to understand exactly what we wanted, and when she offered her opinion, was rude about it.  The chef was pretty cool... He also was very involved with the whole table, asking everyone what they needed and catering to what they asked. What made his service above average was that he got personal with us, getting involved in our casual conversations and giving his interesting input on whatever we were talking about. At other restaurants, they chefs can be tired, not wanting to do the usual tricks or lazy, and not interacting with the customers. This aspect of Benihana was definitely above average compared to most other teppan-style places.  Compared to other restaurants with the same style, overall Benihana is an okay restaurant that has some good qualities that make for a good dining experience. Although they need to work on some things such as music, parking, and service, I would suggest Benihana to families and couples looking for more casual yet interesting dining experience."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my all time faves! The atmosphere is amazing, the food is delish & the cooks are entertaining.  I ordered the Benihana Excellence which is cooked at the table. The meal ($42) consisted of teriyaki steak with green onions and colossal shrimp. The appetizer consisted of shrimp, mushrooms, zucchini, onions, soup, salad and I upgraded my steamed rice to chicken fried rice (additional $8). When all was done, I was served delicious vanilla ice cream. The meal was rather pricey, but definitely worth the experience!"}
{"text":"Always a great time.  I really like this chain and frequent it in many cities.    This one is only a 4 star because the Chef was very poor.  The food quality was excellent but his showmanship was not there.  Definitely a good place to take out of town guests and groups.  JT"}
{"text":"We have been to Benihana in the past for birthday celebrations and it was generally an enjoyable experience.  We went last Tuesday with a 7:30 reservation for five people.  Apparently 30+ other people had 7:30 reservations as well.  We were all grouped in the tiny lobby shoulder to shoulder and every chair was full.  Not one single table was available.  There was no management available to help.  They left two young hosts (a young man named Chris and a young lady whose name I did not get) who did an outstanding job of keeping things calm under terrible circumstances.  We were finally seated after an hour and then got no service at the table.  We finally left at 9:00 to go to another restaurant.  The managers should be fired.  They should, however, commend the young hosts who worked hard to control the situation."}
{"text":"Rocky Aioki ...genius.   The Benihana brand does not get old. It's classy, nice and clean. The lunch menu is a great deal. The staff is super friendly and nice. Scallops were great. Everything else is textbook awesomeness.   My only advice. Install a big sign that says BENIHANA! It's not that easy to locate this place even though it's in the front of the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"This place has the best veggie fried rice I've ever had. I love the green tea and the veggie sushi is to die for. As a vegetarian this place still has everything I could possibly crave for when it comes to Japanese food. I love to come here and sit at the small table section, the service is always excellent and the prices are great at happy hour."}
{"text":"I used to come to Benihana for the fresh food and the experience.  The last 2 times I've been to Benihana have been a bad experience, terrible service from our server and the chef both times. The food is expensive and over priced."}
{"text":"The one in Hawaii is the first Benihana I've ever been to. I used to always go there with my mom, my aunts and my grandma for Mother's Day. I still love the fact that they cook in front of you. The chefs are ALWAYS fun and some are hilarious. It's a great place to eat. When I moved to Las Vegas I seen that they had a Benihana here. Tried it and it's not the same as in Hawaii, but it's just as good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an enjoyable experience at Behihana, LVH.  The food was delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Then again, we love food.   I must also say our chef and waitress were very friendly and efficient. However, we have frequented many hibachi style restaurants .....all over the country and abroad and concur that the chef's presentation was not anything to write home about.   It was \"routine\" and not very engaging. We also felt \"rushed out\" once the meal was completed."}
{"text":"Ordered something and got something else (???)  We knew Benihana when it was located at the Hilton and it was always a treat to dine there. We also have one close by in Scottsdale and go there all the time.  The meal at Benihana on the strip was to be the highlight of our culinary disappointment expedition in Las Vegas. We thought to have reached rock bottom with Maggiano's and wanted to leave on a good impression. Benihana has always been good to us. Until today.  Before he started cooking, our cook explained that he personally prepared the food in the kitchen before coming to the table.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki. My chicken came with no Teriyaki. Big chunky pieces of unappetizing chicken. Gross!!! I told our cook and he said oops, I forgot. He called the waiter who brought me a little container of cold runny teriyaki sauce from the kitchen. It is not the same as when it is cooked with it!  My husband ordered the Benihana excellence with beef julienne (which he loves) and shrimp. When he was served with a piece of steak that came with a huge piece of fat (that the cook jokingly called Las Vegas bacon) my husband said this is not what he ordered. He knows what beef julienne looks like as he had ordered it many times before. We called the waiter to ask him what happened. He said this is the splash and meadow. So, not what we ordered!!  He cut us off saying, well this is meat and shrimp, this is the same thing, so what.  Before leaving, we talked to the manager (Mr Ralph Treszi) who basically did not care. He offered to make me another chicken teriyaki. What? when we are ready to leave? not interested. All he did was give me his card and tell me to call him before we go to Scottsdale next time and he'll ask the Scottsdale location \"to do something for us\". I do not care. I wanted is that he assumes the mistakes of his staff not make me act like a beggar and have another location assume his shortcoming. This is so pathetic!  Our cook made is obvious he loves to have tables of people cheering and clapping at his antics. Although we enjoy having fun, we are not cheering, screaming and clapping people and felt we were treated like 3rd world customers. Behind us there was a large table of people celebrating a birthday and he paid them more attention than our table.   This location is just plain greedy and unfriendly. We had the worse experience and I am going to contact headquarters about it."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Sometimes it's a little crowded but I enjoy the chefs and the food every time I eat here! Love the drinks as well that they serve in a Buddha or geisha glass."}
{"text":"I love the free birthday meal! Seafood Diablo for $29.95 is my ultimate favorite! Filling and entertaining. Reservations are highly recommended. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been to other Teppan-Yaki's in the past and this one was the least favorite we've been to. The restaurant was just cookie cutter like I felt like I was eating at a Denny's versus an Asian restaurant. The rice was just OK. I would recommend Ah-So or Hayashi over on the west side over this place."}
{"text":"Just an update on the previous review.  As you can see I posted the review and they responded quickly.   That is much appreciated.  I spoke with one of the managers who apologized profusely for our bad experience.  He explained about the carpets and said they were going to get to the bottom of the food issues at our table.  What I should've mentioned in the first review was that our server was great.  She was very friendly.  I have them an extra star for customer service.  I will have to wait until a later date to give more stars on an overall experience."}
{"text":"Long wait when I made reservations. Why we had to wait on a week day I don't know but seems like they just didn't have enough chefs there were plenty of open tables. The performance on the chefs part was really nothing special. Food was just ok, expensive for what we got. Cheap food that they overprice. The salad had the worse dressing already on top of it making it inedible.  Mixed up our orders. They did not acknowledge my son's birthday at all. Really only paid attention to the other family at our table. Not at all worth it.  Wasabi is a much better restaurant if you are looking for hibachi."}
{"text":"This used to be 4 stars, but last night things took a dive...  Here's why.  We've eaten at Benihanas 5 times in about the last year.   None of these times involved sharing a table with \"questionable\" people.  Let's just say they appeared to be oblivious to the fact that anyone else was in the room.  I don't want loud braggarts at my table.  I simply do not want to see fat parents let their fat kids suck down 4 sodas each.  It made me feel complicit in the poor upbringing of those kids.  There was more, but this was the first time we'd had to share a table with people we completely disliked.  There happened to also be possibly the noisiest woman on the planet in the dining room at the same time.  It made our experience less fun.    Not the restaurants fault, but it's something to consider.  Now, onto the next reason... Somehow, and for some reason, they did things out of order this time.  They served the soup, the the shrimp and fried rice, then the salad, then the entree, and finally the vegetables.  Issues with this:  (1) Mostly because I am used to soup, salad, shrimp/rice, vegetables, entree, dessert.  (2)  They didn't serve dessert.  It wasn't offered.  Nobody asked for it, so I thought maybe they took the free ice cream off the menu.  We did get ice cream because my daughter had a birthday.  I've got to check on that for future reference.  (3)  My entree, (The Trio which has Filet Mignon, chicken and shrimp) was prepared first, alongside someones lobster.  I was served all 3 of my meats before my daughter's entree was even started.  Before I was halfway done my food was cold!  This is not how it's ever been done.  Plus, I don't think I actually got a filet this time.  It was a pretty crappy cut of meat     Then there was a consistency issue between the chef we got this time than any other time.  This chef was stingy on the salt and soy sauce and butter.  Which is ok in my book, but restaurants need to keep it consistent.    Last reason, and this may have been done before and my husband never noticed, but they add a tip to your bill, even if it's just 2 of you.  And it's a small line item.  Nobody points it out.  I happened to pay in cash and they gave me the kind of change you would get if you needed to leave a tip.  Whether true or not, it appears they are trying to get extra tip out of the customer.  And that's bad.  We'll give them one more shot before we write them off entirely.  As I said,  this was pretty good before."}
{"text":"This is the original, and largest, Benihana in the USA, and beautifully decorated with pools of water. The Teppan room is upstairs, and is what you'd expect. A great show by the cook, and decent food."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Benihana before today, but upon hearing of their off the charts happy hour, we decided it to be a good time to try.  Well, the prices are amazing. 3.75 for just about every roll, 1.25 for eel nigiri, and 3 bucks for shishito peppers. They have a pleasant list of specialty drinks for five dollars each as well! I'm stoked now and ready to get my drink on and tear up some sushi.  Well, the sushi offerings were on the verge if being inedible. I'm not completely convinced that the seafood was the freshest in town at this moment, and the tempura on some of the rolls was nothing but flour and water and impossibly chewy. Nasty!  I will say one thing though, the shishito peppers were frigging amazing. Hence the  extra star, I will go back for those and some five buck hooch."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 43rd Birthday there on 9/29/16 only to wind up with food poisoning!!! Yes food poisoning called restaurant to advise manager and he said would call his DM and call me back still waiting on a call back!!! #becareful # customer service definitely not a priority"}
{"text":"The birthday certificate used to be way better. I don't like the bogo thing if your by yourself."}
{"text":"Once you sit down they ask you do you want fried rice. Rice is on the menu so when you said yes you don't realize that they are charging you an extra $8.50 because it is really chicken fried rice. The meat and lobster was not season very bland. The meal included dessert (Deluxe Treat) and when we asked for it the lady said it didn't at this point we were so disgusted we just left. Overall this restaurant is overrated and overpriced."}
{"text":"We went here, with a large party, for my friend's surprise birthday party. The hostesses were giving me a hard time when I told them that we needed to be seated before my friend (hence, the surprise) even though we had made a reservation in advance and explained this to them. They kept telling me that the entire party had to be present and I reiterated that we would be a couple people short until the birthday girl arrived with her boyfriend. I had to get slightly rude with them and tell them that I had just received a text that the birthday girl was parking and we needed to be seated NOW. Once we finally got seated, the dinner was fun, delicious and entertaining, albeit over-priced for the amount that you get to eat. I also felt like we were rushed out of there after the grill was cleaned, but I will give Benihana 3 stars because I would recommend it to people who have never been before and don't mind spending $100 for 2 dinners and a couple drinks. I don't think we will return, but it was a fun experience, mainly due to our friends making it memorable and the chef putting on a good show!"}
{"text":"Our chef, Joscalin, was the best Tappan chef I have ever had. Very entertaining and she made the food all to order. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Regarding the $30 gift certificate you'll receive for your birthday if you're signed up with Benihana's program; my birthday is in December and my husband's birthday is in February. For the fourth time in a row, our certificates have gone unused as  Benihana has put so many restrictions on redemption of the certificate, that we've not been able to use them. They are only hurting themselves with these restrictions. As an example, we have friends go with us when we go to eat there. However, the friends work and it is just not convenient for them to go out on a work night (Monday through Thursday - the only days the certificate is viable). So, there are three meals that would be purchased at full price and one meal discounted for the certificate that they are losing out on. It is far worse for my birthday in December as there are so many special holiday evenings that are not available along with the no Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays. We've also tried a few days in advance to make reservations and they are booked solid - especially in December, so planning a meal there has to be made several days to a week in advance; tough to do, especially during holiday season. Without the certificate, we find it is just too expensive to eat there, so we don't. After the second or third time, the cook's routine gets old, so we (used to) go essentially for the food. In the past few years, we've found the food and service at the Chandler location to be hit or miss - certainly not what one would expect for the prices being charged. Be prepared to spend a lot of money without assurance of a good meal or a good time should you decide to go to this establishment."}
{"text":"Five Stars for the Management, manager TJ, the Japanese \"origami lady\" waitress by the lounge and for the decor of the restaurant.  I came here to celebrate my birthday (With my bday coupon!) a few days ago and was not impressed by the food HOWEVER TJ and the waitress was really kind.  It was only Day 2 of their Grand Opening and they are still working out the systems, so I understand.  We had a great time, sat by the bar. We ordered 2 full entrees but I wish they had more of the San Francisco selection.  The entire Beni crew sang Happy Birthday to me! Posted on Yelp.  Good LUCK and all the Best to this Beni location!!  cheers!"}
{"text":"Just got back from our yearly birthday visit.  Hey, they give you a $30 gift card to use on your birthday so I'm sold.  Top notch experience throughout the night.  Over the years, we always get the same lady trying to upsell all the food and drinks.  I always go with the mojito (two or three) followed by a Kirin.  Yum Yum.    I had the filet mignon and shrimp. Awesome.  The best part, of course, is the chef.  Here, it's either hit or miss.  One year we got a Mexican woman and it just wasn't the same.  This year, we had Chu and he was excellent. (Though he told us how to say I Love You in Japanese and I pointed out that it was Chinese - he was a little surprised :-)  Also, my 6 year old came up to me during dinner and whispered, \"mommy, if you made salad like this I would eat it every night.\"  Quick, get me the recipe!!!!  Something I've always wondered is whether you're supposed to tip the chef, so I asked on the way out.  The manager told me that the chef and waitress split the tip 50/50 but the chef always appreciates something extra.  Don't we all :-)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big meat eater so I ordered hibachi chicken. It was very bland. Husband got steak chatea something and it wAs tasty for him. I LOVED the fried rice and the veggies. The onion soup is s must. Super tasty. Henry was our chef and he was super friendly and entertaining. The high prices are for the experience completely ...it was overall a decent date night restaurant."}
{"text":"The service at this new Benihana was fairly good. The place is very small, though, and it was hard for the staff to maneuver. At times I had to move my chair for them to get by.The two chefs, the one at our table an the table next to us, were pretty much butt to butt. They need to expand the place a bit if possible. The food was not bad. I have a gripe about them giving us rice in the beginning and then it getting very cold by the time everything is cooked. It's not just this Benihana's, but I noticed they do this at other teppenyaki places. Why can't they just wait until everything is cooked and then just bring the rice? Rice cools off so fast, and white rice is just not enjoyable to eat by itself. Anwyay, it wasn't bad and our server was nice. The meat was tender, and the chef at our table told us how to cook it so it's tender. I tried it at home, but, of course, I couldn't do this at home, and my meat still came out kind of dry."}
{"text":"Food here looks alright on the surface. However, something is not right with the staff and they just seem to be on to something all the time and we don't know if it is the hotel or the restaurant or both. Honestly, I had a food poisoning and went straight to the restroom before I even finish my meal. They are very friendly when they greet you but eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Came here recently and everything was fantastic, keeping with the quality of the Benihana chain name.    We had the chef's special (not on the menu) of two, 5-course habachi steak and lobster tail dinners for $66.50, which includes onion/mushroom soup, rice (steamed white or I think fried is a little extra), salad, teppanyaki veggies, steak and lobster.  Chefs were entertaining and friendly."}
{"text":"The best service I've had at any Benihana so far! And I've been to almost everyone in California ! They would refill drinks before you even bat an eyelash! My boyfriend and I spent our 6year anniversary here and thanks to their employee Nancy, we had a wonderful experience ! And our hibachi grill chef was VERY funny and had a great sense of humor :)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time at Benihana enjoying the show.   The food was very good and the service was even better."}
{"text":"I'm going to cover two issues in this review. One is the food and service and the other is the sighs tgey gave posted.   First the food and service. I ordered the hibachi Filet that came with the five courses. The soup, salad, rice, veggies, and meat. Oh, and a small amount of shrimp for an appetizer.   Now maybe I'm spoiled because I'm used to Kobe's steakhouse when I lived in FL and NY. I have yet to find another Kobe style steakhouse that's good on its own let alone as good as an actual Kobe's   This place is no exception. The soup was good.  The salad was not. The dressing had to much of a ginger taste. Obviously subjective. You might like it. The rice was very overlooked and bland. Same with the veggies and the shrimp. My wife said the same thing. It just had no taste at all.   The Filet was a different story. It was excellent. I don't know how the cook went from making everything tasteless to making the Filet perfect but he did.   Speaking of the cook on to the service. Is was very good. Our experience was a bit long (two hours) but they were busy so that's to be expected. They were professional and courteous. The cook did his part to be \"funny\". He wasn't bad.   Having said all of that I'll never go back. One, the bill for everything was $100 and like I said 90% of the food was tasteless. Our drinks were good. I'll give them that.   The other reason is their posted signs. One you see outside basically says they do checks on everyone they hire and the won't hire illegals. Only Americans and immigrants here with a work Visa. You know, the proper way to do it. Not sneak in and stick your hand out for free stuff and demand rights.   That sign was excellent. The anti gun sign was not. And that's why I'll never go back. I'm not going to bring my family into a victim zone. Criminals simply do not play by the rules. I'm baffled that anti gunners actually believe signs and gun control laws work. They don't. Criminals don't care about signs and laws.   And the only other reason not to allo guns is to not \"offend\" the anti's. I'm sorry but who cares about the feelings of people who are so naive they are basically children in grown up bodies. It's time to stop placating the children who's gun knowledge comes from Hollywood and agenda driven politicians and anti gun groups funded by Soros and Bloomberg.   The restaurants that post these signs should be held accountable if a criminal comes in with a guns and hurts people. It's not like this already doesn't occur. Restaurants have to follow rules and codes so people who visit don't get hurt. Bad food. Poor construction. Basically a restaurant can't fall into disrepair and hurt someone. So how is it different if the owners willing create a place where patrons have no defense against a bad person with a weapon?    It's time to stop supporting places that do this. It's time to punish restaurants who cater to criminals and naive \"grown ups\"."}
{"text":"even though the hilton itself isn't so great, this is a nice place to dine while staying at the hotel, or even if you are not!  i hadn't been to a benihana in ages, and it was good, fun for a big group and of course, expensed for work!!  the front bar section is good for chilling."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience.  Kyle was our Chef. The preparation, the taste and his humor are fantastic.  Marco was our server and he is awesome.  Great customer service.  Very attentive and always checking on us.  Kyle Marco and Benihana Vegas thank you so much. You guys rock"}
{"text":"It's really sad to see how far downhill this location has gone. This used to be a very nice restaurant that our extended family has enjoyed for years. It's not been great the last few times we've gone with very spotty service, servers that disappear for long periods of time, empty drinks etc. the straw that broke the camels back was our experience today. The restroom was appalling shortly after the restaurant opened, no tissue in the stalls and paper towels all over the floor. I informed the hostess while I waited for the rest of our party to arrive. 20 minutes later the bathroom still hadn't been attended to and we were informed that even though we had a 1 o'clock reservation our table wouldn't be ready for another 15 minutes.  There are too many options in this area to be treated this way including an excellent hibachi restaurant just a mile away. My family and I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Last night I was out with the family and we decided to eat here. I haven't eaten here in so long I had forgotten how wonderful it is. We ate Shrimp tempura sushi and sashimi sampler, followed by chicken yakisoba and seafood diablo . Everything was great if you haven't been in awhile it was worth going."}
{"text":"Hour wait even with reservations. We made 7:00pm reservations for a party of 2 and did not get seated until 8pm and that was after having to ask the host several times, and then finally for a manager. It took at least 15 minutes for the employees to find her. This location has just really gone down hill, I've been to many Benihanas throughout the country from locations in Atlanta, Detroit, San Diego, and this location is the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Benihana's. It looked as if they were short staffed there were at least 4 grills that were not being used. One positive experience was our chef Joseph made the food delicious and of course entertaining. The manager did seem understanding and apologized and was willing to try and make our visit better. But, still will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"If I could review the food I would go 6 stars all day. However...that isn't the case. When I arrived I checked in with the front desk girl. I let her know I had a reservation and my name. She asked me if my party was all accounted for and I let her know we were still waiting for a few. Maybe 5 minutes to by and the rest of our group show up. I go back to the same girl and let her know. She looks at me and asks me if I have a reservation...Now during this down time nobody checked in or was sat. It was a Wednesday night at 7:30 and it wasn't very busy.  After I gave her my name again she let me know my reservation was for 7:45 and we would be sat shortly. So 18 minutes go by, yes I was timing it, and she comes over to me and asks me if I have a reservation and for my name... At this point I just shake my head and ask her if she is serious. One of the other girls calls my name for the group and we go back. Unfortunately I will not visit again on a Wednesday night because of sheer incompetence that is presented as the first experience a guest receives. I wish I could move past and give a better rating but this girl has zero customer service skills and that makes me sad.  During dinner a few tables were complaining of very slow service and at one point an entire table got up and left and it was a birthday party. Sorry Benihana it just wasn't your night."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was great! My mom loves coming here for the lunch special! We had Jordan as our chef and he was amazing!! If you have kids or really want to be entertained with dinner, he definitely had all the jokes and tricks! Great cook as well! Will be coming back to see him!"}
{"text":"I wish I would be able to give them no stars at all. I came in and they were so bush they took my name and told me to come back in 2 hours. I came back in 2 hours only because I really wanted to eat here. When I returned they said they did not write my name down ... Are you kidding me . Anyways that is what I base my rate on"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 but since there's no half points I feel that to honor the truth, 3 is more accurate. The fist time I went I didn't like it at all. Lame food, lame service but a great show for my kid (the cooking at the table is pretty entertaining)  So since I had family visiting I decided to go there for the third time. The food was way better than the first time (nothing to die for, but a fair taste) and the rations were decent. Good service, good ambiance and all in all, a good place for a casual diner."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Terrific food. Chateaubriand and lobster teppanyaki style. $70. 20% employee discount."}
{"text":"We came for a birthday dinner without reservations, and they got us a table on a friday night without having to wait very long. We've been to this location twice and the food was great both times. Shizuka was amazing. We never had to wait for drinks the entire night. Jorge's food was great, but his show was the best. My wife and I have had Hibachi many times before, but his performance was outstanding. We went to the one in Scottsdale first, but the one in Chandler is much better if you get the right people. Jorge made us feel like we were at a table with friends, rather than being served. Well done, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Not worth it.   Out waitress was horrible. She forgot to bring our salad and every time we wanted refills she was no where to be found.   The chief was good and the food was good, but was small portions compared to most Japanese steak houses I have been to. Thought it was pricey too compared to similar places. What's up with having to pay extra for the fried rice, that's BS, every other place I have been that's included in the meal.   Go some where else."}
{"text":"Goodbye Benihana, old friend.  Had a reservation at 7:30pm on a Wednesday. Didn't get seated until 8:15. Brunette hostess kept saying they were understaffed, like it was my fault they didn't schedule enough workers. All of your guests have reservations, plan accordingly.  After being seated, we waited 25 minutes before our blonde waitress acknowledged our table. Again, at any other restaurant is unacceptable, at Benihana, a regularity.   Chef Dalton finally arrives at 9:10pm. The four guests with us looked to be around age 17 and celebrating a birthday, so I hoped for a good show for them. Dalton gave us absolutely no show. No knife flipping, no egg rolling, no volcano, nothing. He looked as if he was about to cry the entire time he cooked. He didn't say anything to the table. If you've had Dalton before, I'm sure you understand!  Food was fine, except they forgot the colossal shrimp my girlfriends mom ordered with her steak.  I know everyone says they go to a restaurant for years but don't mean it. We literally go to Benihana once a month for the past 7 years, and have the pictures and birthday pictures to prove it.  When we spoke to the Asian male manager as we were leaving, we expressed our disappointment with everything. He told us he didn't remember ever seeing us, and claimed he would talk to his staff. He seemed fed up with all the complaints he probably has to deal with on a nightly basis. We weren't asking for anything free since we already paid, but not even an apology!  Benihana, I have some tips for you   1. Help each other out when you see others struggling. I know you're a manager, but you can take drink orders, or take food orders. You don't have to stand around like a bouncer at a club, and only work when it's time to sing Birthday song.  2. I know ownership doesn't care, but they need to evaluate this location. We've been coming for 7 years and the service has gone down a hole in the past 2 years. Everyone seems to agree, so take action!  3. Don't just worry about singing Happy Birthday. It seems the only time the staff is organized is when they all gather to sing. Worry about your table first, before worrying about about being in tune.  Save it Lee, I don't wanna hear it.  Sapporo, hello new friend."}
{"text":"This was  the first time I have ever been to this location.  In fact it has been many years since I was at any Benihana location.  Last time was in Las Vegas. Anyway, came here with a friend for her Birthday. But, actually my Birthday was the day before hers so it was a double celebration. Benihana no longer holds the magic it did when I was a child. But, the prices are a whole lot less as well. I thought the service was very good. I would of liked to of had more green Tea, but I did have water and the show was over. You sit at a large table, that I believe sits 8. There was a party of 4, then we were 2 and there were 2 empty's, which was nice to have a little room in between strangers. Heheee. Our Chef was very nice. He made sure to explain what he was cooking as he went. They cook at your table just in case you have never been. It makes it pretty cool.  I got the seafood,which was really good. My friend got the surf and turf, She loved it! As did I. They start you off with soup and salad. If you do not like what they are serving they are fully willing to switch it out for you. Which I thought was great. The food was excellent. My friend loves the Ginger dressing. She could not get enough. So they brought her extra 2 times with no extra charge. I loved the entire event and would go back any time. Plenty of parking in the open lot. You will find it located in a shopping center on Scottsdale road. East side of the street. Bathrooms were clean.  They even sing to all the Birthday people. One song in English, and then a lovely Japanese song. Very nice outing."}
{"text":"Do not go there. Food was good don't get me wrong but our waitress after we left the restaurant reprinted out our receipt wrote a larger tip for herself then forged my girlfriends signature."}
{"text":"We went here for our valentine's family date per my 8 year old daughter request and she love it along with my son. We loved the atmosphere, the entertainment of the food preparation  (kids loved the onion volcano). Motoko and young customer service was awesome. We'll be back again :)"}
{"text":"Wow... What happened to this place I hadn't eaten in this place for about 5 years. And damn we walked In the host was not friendly . The cleanliness of the restaurant is very poor. Honestly I just felt like I was in Golden corral. That's too bad are used to really like this place."}
{"text":"Amazingly beautiful atmosphere! It felt as though I was walking through a Japanese movie set. There were Japanese house like structures, fireworks, and a beautiful fountain. The lounge areas was very comforting as well and had lots of seating.  The food was delicious and it was just fun to be there!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once or twice a month but tonight is horrible. The server never brings a refill on drink for the whole table nor salad , rice etc.... l had to go to the front and ask the manager then the manager on duty. This place has gone down hill. If l could give ZERO Stars I would."}
{"text":"I have dined at several different Benihana's around the country. This particular Benihana is by far the best I have ever eaten at. What stands out is the service. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. Food was top notch as well. Great experience!"}
{"text":"If you've had teppanyaki before, skip it in Vegas. I have been to other Benihanas and several other Hibachi establishments. This place cuts corners and the service is mediocre, at best. We had a long wait for our drinks, long wait for our chef, he skipped the show/tricks (even though we had a birthday at the table), skimped on food portions, and nickeled and dimed us on everything.  At the end of the night, all nine of us had completely cleaned our plates due to the small portions of rice and veggies served. We all paid $5.95 fees for fried rice. We all felt frustrated with our bills and the included 20% gratuity with such a lack of quality service and food."}
{"text":"The seating is very uncomfortable. It's worse then sitting on a small plane. We had to wait at our table for a very long time before the chief came to cook our food.  I definitely would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is always fun to go have dinner!  We went for a birthday party and had fun!  We started off with some sushi, which I did not order so I am not able to tell you what they are but they were good.  As for what I had, I ordered a drink called Cucumber Collins which consists of Hendrick's Gin  St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur  iichiko shochu  fresh cucumber slices.  It was light and delish.  It wasn't too overpowering with alcohol which I like my drinks that way.  As for my meal, I ordered the most poplular Teppanyaki-Rocky's Choice which includes Hibachi steak*, and chicken breast grilled to your specification.  While waiting for the chef to cook your main meal, it comes with soup and salad.  Along with grilled onions, squash and shrimp.  Include that with my main entree, Rocky's Choice I had plenty of leftovers!  The price point is a bit $$$ but if you are celebrating an occassion then I would definitely encourage a trip here.  The set-up of the restaurant is beautiful and large.  I got lost coming back from the restroom...lol!!!  But while finding my way back to our table, I notice the man-made waterfall and a small table of two which is perfect for a night should you wish to pop the question to your special lady!  =)  I encourage you to check it out!"}
{"text":"I walked in and asked for a table for one. I'm traveling on business and today, this was my treat to myself.  \"There's open seating over there with no wait or you'll have to wait for 45 minutes.\" Was the immediate response. I guess she wasn't expecting me to agree to wait because her hand was still pointing to over there. When she realized I was still standing there, she took my name to add me to the list. 10 minutes later I was being escorted to a table to sit along with 3 other parties. So much for that 45 minutes, huh?  The waiter comes around, introduces himself and takes drink orders. It takes him about 15 minutes to bring out drinks. And then it was about 15-20 minutes between soup and salad. Finally, the cool comes out an hour after we were seated. Drinks are empty, soup and salad is gone.   The cook was nice, he seemed a little bit nervous. I think he was fairly new. It took the cook 1 hours and 7 minutes to finish cooking from start to finish. As you can imagine, you had to eat your food separate unless you wanted it cold. Rice first, then shrimp appetizer, then zucchini, then the protein, finally the onion. By the time the onions made it to my plate (roughly an hour after the rice) I had no more food on my plate.   Do I even have to tell you what waiting for the check was like?  I already contacted google, FB, and your guest relations. (In case you want to ask me to contact guest relations to make it right)"}
{"text":"There are plenty of good Japanese steakhouses in Vegas, but most of them are off the Strip. If Benihana at the Fashion Show is your only option, I guess I'd recommend it, but if you can venture elsewhere, you should try Ohjah, Osaka, or one of the Valley's other options--unless you have PLENTY of time to eat!  I met a friend for lunch on a slow Wednesday during Restaurant Week. Can't beat $20 for soup, edamame, grilled shrimp, fried rice and veggies, and green tea ice cream! But it's a good thing I took the afternoon off, because my leisurely lunch turned into a two-and-a-half hour meal. (It didn't help that it took us 20 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation.)  The food was fine, and our chef was fun and personable. But I wish our hostess had been more attentive, or at least had explained why the wait was so long with so many empty tables in full view.  I probably won't return to this location, especially with so many other options closer to home. And there is another Benihana at the Westgate just in case you're itchin' for hibachi and can't get too far off the Strip. (I've been there. It's good. And we didn't have to wait...)"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, the decor and inside the restaurant are pretty awesome. Not overly cheesy or anything. Place is huge too. Walked in with out a reservation and just got sushi and drinks. Sushi was really good and friendly staff.  If im ever staying at the LV hotel, will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We like benihana but can't reach anybody to make a reservation.  Been calling since 1215pm today.  Then when u show up it's a 40 min wait if if u can get in.     Maybe they are having issues w phone service?   Michael 7035958885.   Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong for happy hour just a little bit cheaper than Kona Grill and that's always a plus. Even though there right about 50 yards away each other. Easy access as well from the garage @ the fashion show mall"}
{"text":"Reservations don't mean anything at this location!  Waited 45 minutes longer with my reservation, plus another 20 minutes to get a server!!!!  This was not even a weekend!  And the hostesses at the front were young punks who had an attitude.  The manager, Brian, seem to purposely stay away from our table knowing how unhappy our party was.  Very bad management at this location!!  I have been to the Scottsdale location many times and have never had this problem.  Will NEVER go back to this one and don't recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and managers seemed lost.  Whole place smelled like bleach.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Dinner and a show!  We really enjoyed our meal and the entertainment of our table side chef.  Started with a mango sake tini in a keepsake Buddha mug, he had a drink similar to a manhattan from their custom cocktail menu.  We took advantage of a discount our hotel offered and got the filet and lobster tail dinners.  They started us with their famous Benihana onion soup, followed by salad with a ginger dressing and shrimp appetizer.  The chef created sauces for our shrimp and steak as well.  Grilled zucchini and onions followed the shrimp.  Then our chef cooked our filets and lobster perfectly for us.  Dinner was followed by ice cream and sherbet.  Very tasty meal."}
{"text":"I was very happy with the service here! We came here on our anniversary for lunch and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes without a reservation. This place is best with a group of friends but still enjoyable at a table with strangers. If you don't like eating or socializing with people you don't know this may not be the best choice for you. The chef was highly amusing and the food was very yummy. I always enjoy a good teppanyaki grill and always smile and laugh here."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Love all the sauces that come with the teppanyaki. Love the humor. Our chef at this location even made a 'Mickey Mouse' out of the rice, per my daughters request, just one of the highlights.   I don't understand the negative comments or reviews regarding waiting to be seated unless the entire party is there, or sharing a table at teppanyaki. This is common practice at all locations I've ever been to.   I have learned this particular location is busier on the weekends, so I just call for reservation. If I need one great, if I don't, then I'm happy I checked. I have been during the week and reservations weren't needed, so it just depends.  I love their ginger dressing, it's not like anything I've ever had. Over the years I have even purchased it. I am a fan of shrimp and this restaurant has my favorite shrimp.   Our family will continue to come to Benihana's, as we have for many, many years. This is one of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Bring your own seasoning!!!! There are family owned habachi grills that are waaay better like ohjah! Didnt like this place the first time and was invited to a bday dinner this time and still was far from impressed!!! Great customer service and our chef who was a black girl was good and funny, distraction from the food flavor itsself...    All and all i wont be back here unless another special dinner occasion that i didnt pick the location for!"}
{"text":"This was a  Horrible place to eat at  Because there was a shell in  My shrimp And there was too much pepper inside the steak  And I think this place deserve a one star And also I did not like the manager  Because he had a bad attitude."}
{"text":"So, the baby daddy and I hadn't been on a date since our little one was born and we DESPERATELY needed a parent's night out.  Thankfully, he had fam in town so we were able to sneak away to Benihana for some eats. Let's be honest, you know I had some drinks, too!  He had dined there before, but I had never tried out the establishment.  I made our reservation for 5:15, but when we arrived we were informed that they were running about 15-20 minutes behind. No biggie to us, we just bellied up to the bar and enjoyed some happy hour priced bevs (a peach sangria number and a patron margarita -which wasn't a happy hour item).  Once our table was ready, we were seated with a family of 6 at a spot near the entrance.   There were quite a few options for food and we both ended up getting the filet (mine with steamed rice and his with a double order of the chicken fried rice). The server was nice and was careful to take down everyone's order correctly.  All of our meals came with onion soup to start and then a small salad with a ginger vinaigrette, followed by a shrimp appetizer. We were having a gay ole time and then our chef, Stephen, came out.  He was good at keeping us all entertained, cooking the food at a perfect pace and made our steaks gloriously medium rare!  I loved the entire meal (and so did my boo).  I wouldn't say this is a place I'd go to all of the time, but I'd definitely come here for the occasional \"dinner and a show\"."}
{"text":"The food although expensive was really good and thanks to the nice chef i scored me some free mushrooms!!! The people who we sat with at our table were total bores except for the guys who were next to us now they were hilarious! I think the dining experience has to do alot with what kind of people you get seated with. Try the green tea ice cream it is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Let me begin with our chef, ARLEN. S/o man, stellar service! On point, funny, charismatic, wonderful experience to have you cook our food and entertain us. :) this was my boyfriends first time at a hibachi, let alone a bennihanas and Arlen did not let us down.   IF YOU COME HERE: DO NOT ALLOW VIDO*** TO SERVE YOU!!!! If he introduces himself, run. Leave the restaurant and come back another night. Countless times he looked at us in the face and forgot and asked for our orders provided allergens which he ignored, and served other tables who arrived after us prior to bringing us the things we requested.   Honestly, management was receptive, Arlen was phenomenal, DO NOT ALLOW VIDO TO SERVE YOU****"}
{"text":"Yuck!! We go often and this time was the worst.  The service was aweful and I had my 7 year olds free birthday coupon.  It was a Sunday and when I tried to use it they informed me they only use them Mon-Thurs.  but that is not written on the coupon.  The waitress was so rude!!"}
{"text":"This is another one of those experience  Restaurants So we arrived about 6:30 didn't really think we need reservations but we should have got reservations because they were busy the girl that was the hostess was really having a badd day or something badge attitude giving customers a hard time with us she's kind of pista off because we didn't have reservations but she got us in like an hour and a 1/2 later So we got a table sit down for group of people they're all awesome not to talkative but still good The server sucked It was my 1st time there so had no clue what was going on Asked to go to the menu can give me a dirty look and went through it super fast could only asking my questions Then even come more of an attitude when I  didn't order  any kind drink then for hot my pot stickers   Now the chef cooking the food he was great funny fast gives little sample of smaller things I would the steak and shrimp steak was  OK shrimpers little over cook Over all it was OK glad I had the $30 birthday Money off my go back I don't know whose experience"}
{"text":"My experience at this Benihana location was outstanding!  My wife and I both went for the first time last year celebrating our birthdays, which are three days apart. We both were thrilled to have a $30 gift certificate, which Benihana offers for birthdays when you signup. This was an amazing deal, but it seems like they have changed the rules and now require you to buy an entree to be able to use the certificate.   I have found that Japanese restaurants in general seem to treat their customers really well, but the service here in Scottsdale was even better than I expected. We were really impressed with our waiter. He was on top of everything and made sure that we had fresh soda for the length of our whole meal. I really appreciated that he kept bringing us refills without even having to be asked. That seems to be a rarity when we go out to restaurants, so I have to applaud this Benihana location for their outstanding service!  As for the food it was excellent as well. My wife and I both love Teppanyaki, and I would say it met our expectations. The appetizer portion of the meal was about average for Teppanyaki restaurants, but the filet mignon was cooked to perfection. We both loved it! Our Teppanyaki Chef wasn't quite the best we had seen, but he was pretty funny and the show was entertaining. It was an amazing experience for our birthdays and it ended with a special treat. Some of the staff came and sang 'Happy Birthday' to us (both in English and Japanese) and brought us our dessert. I really loved the rainbow sherbet ice cream, although my wife didn't think much of her dessert (she was probably too full at that point). The manager also gave us a free souvenir photo, which I thought was a nice touch to what was already a great meal!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go to this restaurant for the first time Tuesday evening but ended up leaving due the hostess's attitude. Upon arriving there instead of greeting us with a welcoming \"hello\" she says \"do you have reservations?\" with a cold attitude, but being new to the restaurant we weren't aware that a reservation was necessary. She then states \"it's going to be an hour or so\" as though she didn't have time for us and wanted us to leave, which she accomplished. My husband did get a hold of the manager over the phone to complain about the hostess. The manager promised a return phone call by 5pm on Thursday but never called. So, this place is getting one star due to poor management which probably explains the lack of customer service skills. Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Tony Montana our chef was the dopest chef in the place everything on point nothing messed up loved my food we had shrimp and chicken and my boyfriend had steak and chicken loved his food as well great food and a great show to go with!!! Our server had us on every single thing we needed and my needed butt needed a lot with my drinks I couldn't make up my mind but she stayed patient and worked with me both got a tip will return back loved it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Chef Randy  and server Shizuka are a great combination. Made my first experience at Benihana exceptional...despite the other poor reviews. I will be back!!! :)  Also...please try the coconut mojito! so yummy."}
{"text":"I've been going to Benihana for years. I feel over the years the service, the workers, and the experience has gone downhill tremendously. I went just two days ago with my boyfriend, he had never been and I was a little embarrassed to experience the dinner with him considering I talked it up so much. (We both work in a fine dining steakhouse)  First we walked in, the hostess was not friendly and told us the wait would be twenty minutes when there were MANY tables open, her verbiage was very off and not professional at all. We waited. The server was not good. He forgot a fork for my boyfriend, and told me my tea was not complimentary refill. He took forever getting out soups and salads out and our whole table was not happy.  We ordered a tempura banana for dessert and it took 30 minutes just for the dessert. What got to me the most is before we even got our dessert, the staff were cleaning up to close. We understand putting things away, and simple \"closing\" duties, but they pulled out the VACCUM and he was vacuuming around our table and the whole restaurant!!! Totally unacceptable and very appalled that this happened."}
{"text":"The place is spetacular but I am sorry for the bad service. I was waiting for my drink for a very long time before I was informed that they run out of the ingrdients. The service was slow; it seemed that they don't have enough people working.   Personally I don't like the concept of benihana. You watch him cooking for a long time. The food is waiting there and by the end he is done, everything is cold and you are no longer hungary. I would think that onion volcano would impress little kids. I was impressed by the drink \"1964\" but they run out this time :("}
{"text":"The amazing shrinking SHRIMP (chilie shrimp) and the NEW so call wow roll...., trickery same #^*+ish different plate"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this location. I've been dining at Benihana's for over 25 years. The door host's were unprofessional and need customer service training. They now charge for garlic butter. My salad was very skimpy. Oh and the cook was new and did not do a good job. I will not support this location no longer!!"}
{"text":"Overrrrrrrpriced. Just go to Panda Express. It's fresher and you get all your food at the same time"}
{"text":"Went here on opening night and the food was incredible!! I have food allergies, and the chef was so accommodating. Everyone is very kind, and overall, I had excellent service."}
{"text":"Bad service. Dirty place. Sushi chief couldn't substitute imitation crab for tuna on a roll. You had to talk to 2 people to get that done.  Waiters standing talking and having fun but not working. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Wow! With $25-$50 dollar meals you'd think they would have better service.  Walked in and waited with others as the host talked on the phone.  Was seated rather quickly but then left for ten minutes before drink orders were even taken.  Then a another ten minutes before food orders were taken.  I've enjoyed other locations but this was pathetic.  Unfortunately this will be my last visit to Benihana.  A much better choice is Ah-So.  Now the entire table is complaining.  We've been here 30 minutes and not a stitch of food has graced our table and my water has been empty for fifteen minutes. At 35 minutes we got up and walked out.  The table across from ours was complaining as well. Benihana fail"}
{"text":"First time customer and not impressed. Service not good. We were told they were down bartenders and a chef. So we are told our meal will be delayed and they offered  free appetizers . Really doesn't seem like that is the customers concern. Definitely would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I love this chain and generally count on consistent and reliable service, food whenever I come here. Came here after a pool party where we enjoyed happy hour at the bar with the best bartender Jimmy! (They have happy hour on Saturdays which is a rare find!) He endured our antics and bad jokes and even let us try out a new drink he was testing. The special Jimmy Jalape√±o margarita is perfect if you want a little kick at the end without being overbearing.   Our chef, Adrian was very funny, knew more than the standard tricks of the Benihana trade and helped make our dinner very enjoyable. If you are looking for a fun bite to eat on the strip and enjoy a nice sit down meal I would recommend this Benihana as my party and I had a delightful experience."}
{"text":"Last month while in Las Vegas, we took my daughter and her boyfriend for his birthday.Since they have never been before we thought this would be a great birthday dinner. Although they both appreciated the dinner. And thought the food was great. I was disappointed in our cook and the other guest at the table.  I don't know if the people had lost money or were drunk. Our maybe I wasn't drunk enough. But it just took that spark out of the experience for us. All in all they enjoyed it, and can now say they have experienced Benihana."}
{"text":"Well, I really want to give Benihana a stellar review, but it's not happening this evening. We have been here so many times and to their credit, had some great meals. We celebrated some birthdays this evening and decided this would be a good place to go. We had to wait 30 minutes to get our table- even with a reservation. Fine I guess. At the table, we had to wait another 50 minutes before we actually ate- a little too long in my opinion. Granted, the Service was great and it was just the way the timing worked, get it. However, it was a little too long for our table and others with us. As for the food, great and always so good. The chicken, steak, and shrimp is always a winning meal for  me. And, the chef was so good- loved all of that part. The. Wait. Was. Rough. And, it was not at all busy. So, I will say this- it's a great place to eat and if you go often, you won't be disappointed. But, maybe you will encounter a glitch here and there and that's just that"}
{"text":"It was alright. I've been going to these types of Steakhouses for years. When you factor in the price it's just not worth it. Fried Rice is an additional $8. They skimp on the vegetables and you get a much smaller portion of rice than you do at other restaurants of this type. I was really disappointed with my experience.  I reccomend you choose another hibachi style restaurant.  You will get better food for less money"}
{"text":"Short labor force during high traffic lunch hours. Foods are not bad as expected. Long wait time did kill some appetite....."}
{"text":"I went here for a date night and was seated for 15 minuets before being approached by a server and got our drink orders .. which made me a little upset but the rest of the service there on out was great. Food was phenomenal! Love this place"}
{"text":"The chefs at Benihana are always amazing. The food was all kinds of delicious, but the customer service was lacking. We had made reservations for two tables, and when our party was seated we were taken to one table with 11 chairs with some chairs placed behind the first row.  When we told the hostess that this was a special occasion and we were promised two tables when booking the reservation she was not apologetic  with a quick \"OK well I'm not the one who took the reservation\". Rather than offer any kind of apology or a free round of drinks or complimentary appetizer, the staff actually seemed irritated that we wanted them to correct the mistake. Saying \"actually we normally seat 11 people at one table,\" (not possible, you couldn't have 11 oompah loompas at one table; these chairs wouldn't fit, people would have to eat with plates in their laps).   We were re-seated 10 minutes later at two tables, but I wish the situation had been handled differently because I would love to give five stars. Toshi, we loved every moment of you."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. If it wasn't for the fact that we had to seek out a manager, I really believe we would have never gotten help. Borderline discrimination whenever it comes to seating anyone that's brown. Despite the great experience and food from the chefs, it doesn't matter when you feel you're being discriminated because of the color of your skin. It's a shame the cook is so great only to have the experience ruined by crappy and discriminatory management."}
{"text":"I have never been to any Benihana before. So Mom and Dad were in town and wanted to hit it. I guess they thought it was ethnic food (and wanted to try and please me). Uh.. not.. Been to Japan and didn't seem like I was in Japan at all.. lol..   The show (throwing my food around and stuff) was okay but kinda weird. I ordered Prawns (Spicy) and steak. Was sort of weird as they cook the prawns.. throw em around.. cook up an onion.. set it on fire... then way later knock out my steak.. I ate.. onions.. shrimp.. them steak.. was like two meals.. kinda strange. I would rather they kept it in the kitchen under a heat light then served it all at once. Oh well..   So the service as in drinks was low.. not Silverton (the bench mark of crappy service read my review if u don't know that place) but not very good. I would have enjoyed getting a few drinks but instead.. i got .. 1.. lol.. oh well..   Food was pretty tasteless and super boring but there was flames.. so its worth something if your a pyromaniac like me!"}
{"text":"We were greeted as soon as we walked in with the best courtesy! Our server was okay but the chef, Tony, was the highlight of the night! Highly recommend to ask for him when you visit this location!"}
{"text":"SHITTY SERVICE. This Benihana'a is not the same as other traditional Benihana'a. The chefs are clumsy, messy, and do not season or cook as well as the other Benihana chefs. The waiter brought a salad at which I did not want, and slid my soup causing it to spill a little on me. These waiters at the Vegas strip must be high off something because they will always mess up your order or give you an extremely rude attitude. Not to mention they changed up the menu and brought up the prices for tourists. They are not personable nor knowledgeable of what their job is around here. If you want horrible bitchy rude cunt waiters, then here is perfect."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience when I got the restaurant because they said I didn't not have a reservation even if I called in the morning and made a reservation,the hostess was really rude and she didn't try to look for a table for my family. They asked us to wait and after 20 min of waiting they said that there is no table for us so we just waste time waiting there .I am so disappointed of the service in this location I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"*SHORT STORY - Kids who answer the phones have no manners or common sense.   *LONGER STORY - We have eaten at this location SO many times, but the customer service just to get in the door is dreadful anymore. Making reservations with what sounds like highschool kids isn't very smart - these guys have no people skills at all!  I can get past \"young\" and \"first job\" but rudeness and being a dimwit are unacceptable in a restaurant setting. I called for reservations for tomorrow evening and was told they didn't have anything. \"Nothing?\" I asked. \"Well, not until 8:00.\"  ???  You didn't want to atleast offer that time to me even though I used the word  'evening'? So I book the table. Then I go online to find they have reservations for 5:00 and 5:30.  ???  Those times would infact be evening (to most of the world) so I go ahead and book the 5:30 then call back to cancel the 8:00. I get a different person (another kid, no joke) and inform them that I need to cancel the 8:00 and just want to confirm that the 5:30 I have now booked is reserved AT 5:30. The guy says \"Uh, if you did it then yeah.\" I asked if he saw if there were any tables at 5:30 or if it was wrong online because the young lady I spoke with just before had stated there was nothing but 8:00. He just says \"Yeah.\"  Unbelievable. Similar experiences (though not as brain-shrinking) happened the last two times we visited this restaurant. 3 strikes, you're out."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! This place is terrible. We arrived and the hostess was already upset and arguing with the other hostess. We waited and after 20 minutes we were seated. Seriously we sat there for another 30 minutes before anyone came to talk with us. It was terrible. The waitress was obviously stressed and was overwhelmed. We finally ordered our food, they ran out of brown rice forgot to bring our salads and never followed up with drinks. This was seriously a terrible experience. Don't waste your time going here save your money and go to a better place. The manager finally came to our table and after I told him all the issues he gave us 20% off our bill. That was not enough and he still did not say they were sorry for the bad experience. It was a birthday we were celebrating and they never took our picture. Anyway the cook was ok but forgot a number if things like the bowls and shrimp. Stay away!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Benihana and they have excellent service. Every time we have a major milestone to celebrate, this is where we go.  We were graced with Kyle as our server most recently, and he was by far the most entertaining Tepan chef we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Waitress was very nice Drinks too Food was perfect I never finished my food at any Benihana but did here  After reading the bad reviews  I was very nervous but we can not complain. It's new, very clean. Only 1 con is we had to wait 35 minutes for the cook to start at the table, that's a lil bit long for a lunch service in an almost empty restaurant ( 3 tables were full)  Brendon was our cook, he was very nice , attentive and funny, entertaining . We enjoyed our lunch there. Prices r lil bit higher then in CA but still ok.  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Best place for any celebration. Always crazy busy on weekends so make sure to make reservation in advance and be patient. Despite of the busyness, our server Venny did superior job as always; I like how the manager (I was guessing she was) also got on the floor helping to make sure the customers were happy."}
{"text":"To be honest I am not a fan of hibachi but my friends are so while in Vegas we decided to try them out. The food was good, the chef was so funny, kind and made us have a good time. Would recommend this for a place to go to with large groups for a fun time."}
{"text":"Called twice to make a reservation. Was told both times it wasn't needed. Just now walked in and were told it's a half hour wait.   Me: \"But I called twice to make a reservation and was told it wasn't necessary\"  Host: \"it's not required, but there's reservations ahead of you\"    YEA. THAT'S WHY I TRIED TO MAKE A RESERVATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SIT HERE FOR HALF AN HOUR.   What the heck? Monumentally annoying and pretty unprofessional."}
{"text":"They took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  They'll make one for you especially but I always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.  Plus, this one is always really quiet.  Like, I feel guilty, like I'm troubling the staff.  And you have to drive through an apartment's parking lot to get there.  Very awkward location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm blown away by this location. Please eat here you will enjoy it, great customer service from Jezrey.  Make sure you ask for the cook Johnny, he is amazing on the grill and will keep you laughing the entire time. Watch out for his magic tricks, he has a lot of them.  Excellent place to eat if you ever are in Las Vegas.  Best Benihana I've attended."}
{"text":"For what it is, this is a solid casual dining experience for people of all ages. I was on a business trip with two younger guys who wanted to stay in our hotel for dinner. The food was good. There were three of us. I had hibachi shrimp, one of my friends had a noodle dish and another had teriyaki chicken. We all enjoyed our dishes. The chef was engaging and entertaining.   All in all, a positive experience. Certainly not the greatest dining experience in a foodie's city, but nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food. I love anything Japanese. The culture everything. I really want to go there one day. I even have my own pair of chop sticks in a fancy box. I also love Teppanyaki. I would eat just about anything cooked on a hibachi grill. I would love to have one built into a counter in my dream house. Now I know Benihana's is a corporate place but I think they are great. Are they the best ever? Probably not. I'm sure there are places out there that could cook circles around them and put on a better show. But for what it is it is pretty good. It is a little on the pricey side and definitely not a place you would go to even once a month. It is definitely a special occasion place. You can tell that from the 8 renditions of Happy Birthday that you will here while you are there. I have heard it so much I have the Japanese version they also sing memorized and I can't even speak Japanese. But I would love to learn. That is the top tip for this place by the way. Whatever you do join the Benihana Chef's Table Club. So worth it. A free $30 gift certificate for your Birthday month. How can you beat that. I have been here many times and I was here again last night with my girlfriend and a friend. It was my friend and I's last free Birthday thing. There are a lot of places that will give you free stuff on or around your Birthday. This was the last one we had and we went out with a bang. Sam was our cook and he is one of the better ones. He puts on a good show with funny jokes and is a very excellent cook. You start with a mushroom and onion soup, which I think is great, then a salad with their fantastic dressing on it, move on to shrimp appetizer, grilled onions, mushrooms and zucchini. Another tip, do yourself a favor and upgrade to the chicken fried rice. Sure it is $3.50 extra but so worth it. The little bowl looks small but you swear it never ends. So good. Love their chicken fried rice. Did I mention I love Japanese food. I ordered the steak and scallops. The steak melts in your month and the scallops are buttery good. Everything was great. I love their mustard sauce. It goes best with the steak and seafood. So good. I usually have to ask for more because I use it all up. Sam did his usual great job of cooking. My girlfriend had not been to a Benihanas in about 5 years. She thought it was good but maybe not quite worth the price. I do agree it is pricey but it is so good. In my opinion. I probably won't be back until next year but I will be back. I love Japanese food if I didn't mention that."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Benihana a few days ago for a birthday celebration. We have visited this restaurant several times in the past years and enjoy the treat of the teppanyaki. The food is always delicious and the meal is quite complete.  During this most recent visit, we were seated with a party of four and a party of 2. The party of 4 did not realize that we were all going to sit around one table. They were seated along the bench part of the table and were obviously displeased that they had to cram together so that my husband and I could also sit around the table. They were rude about this and because they made little effort to scoot together, my husband ended up being uncomfortable because he was not fully able to sit on the bench.  The meal was good although because I have an allergy, the chef said that the mushrooms would be cooked at the end. There ended up being no mushrooms cooked or served at all. In addition, the chef had forgotten to prepare my steak with the others and therefore I had to wait for it to be cooked toward the end of the meal.  I also noticed that over the years, the birthday treat has changed in value. I remember when I would get a boat made of pineapple and other fruits. Then it was simply a pineapple. Now it is simply two scoops of ice cream. While the meal itself is filling, I wonder if the economy has impacted this change.  This chef was new to cooking and while I'm glad that he is able to learn and practice, his tricks weren't as smooth and some of our food ended up cold because we were waiting to eat it with the rest of the entr√©e.  The service was wonderful and our server Junko was always prompt and willing to refill our glasses and remove dishes once we had finished each course."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Benihanas! I always get the Philly Rolls as an appetizer and the Filet and Lobster as the meal. Soup is off tha chain and the vegetables are delicious with the main dish. Lobster is always cooked perfect and tender!"}
{"text":"Benihanas we come here at least once a year when in Vegas its a tradition of ours, awesome experience. You haven't experienced a benihanas restaurant until  you been to the Benihanas at Las Vegas Hilton. Food was awesome I had the Hibachi Steak and my wife had the teriyaki chicken it was good and juicy she said. :-)"}
{"text":"First off, if you haven't signed up already, sign up for your birthday coupon. So clutch! We went for dinner one weeknight to use my birthday coupon, and the coupon makes your meal free.   We decided to sit in the bar area so we could have a conversation and it was the best decision we could make. We were able to get the same, awesome hibachi food without the table of strangers and able to have a conversation while we ate. Our waiter was seriously the best. He took extra special care of us and really just made our night. So my suggestion, if you don't want the show, but still want the deliciousness, sit at a table in the bar, you won't regret it. And get the filet with chicken with extra shrimp sauce. SO good."}
{"text":"One star for the fish bowl drink. One star for the upscale ambiance. No more stars. Happy hour is 4 until 730... But it still likely take you that long to get your food. Waited 40 minutes for a single roll. By the time it was delivered (post manager intervention) it was too late to order any more happy hour items. Wouldn't come back.  In fact we're going back to Teharu down the street now!"}
{"text":"The portion sizes are tiny, especially for what they charge.  Dinner for two cost us $80, and we had the two cheapest meals.  Didn't get very full.   The chefs were fun, but not really worth the extra expense.  And the tables were so close together (two chefs going back to back) that the waitress kept spilling on my area. Chicken fried rice is an additional $3.90 per person.  And they put barely any chicken in it (they split one breast for the 8 people) so I'm not sure why that costs so much, but it's clearly a ripoff.    Overall, we weren't very impressed.  Chefs were fun, but predictable and portions were pretty sad."}
{"text":"Benihana is the best place ever.  Keep in mind this is the kind of place that is not cheap, however there are more affordable choices if you look for them.   This location is pretty good however the waitresses are slow to refill drinks. You sometimes have to ask for refills because the waitresses are off talking to each other. Also I would suggest making reservations when you go. It is hit and miss crowded. Sometimes you go on a random Tuesday night and it's a 2 hour wait sometimes you can just walk in and sit down. If you make a reservation you aren't always seated right away, you typically have to wait at least 10 minutes, which is better than 2 hours.   The food is excellent, I recommend the seafood diablo dish and its only about 20 bucks! Its has scallops, shrimp,calamari, veggies and noodles. It is a little spicy but you can ask for them to not put on the sauce that makes it spicy.   Our chef was Scott and he happened to be the head chef. He was amazing and hilarious, unlike any chef we have had before.   To top it off, if you sign up on their website you get $30 to spend there on anything! AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Several months late but wanted to do review before I visit again in April 2017. I reserved 16 persons for my 50th birthday dinner Sept 21, 2016. We arrived on time and still had to wait for awhile which was ok with us. Tried to order a mai tai from bar but bartender was too busy making drinks for servers. Why not have a 2nd bartender management?? After waiting 15 minutes for service a manager helped me and made the worst tasting drink that was NOT a mai tai as he stated!! We finally got seated and one of my guest had to leave, she was not feeling well. We all were seated when some single female stranger came to sit with our group which was awkward. I had to tell her it was kind of weird for her to join our private group when she had other options to sit at other tables with smaller groups. The male manager told me that was too bad she was told to sit with us, I told him it was awkward and felt like walking out with our group but we were all hungry. The lady moved to another table after that. Manager was young and very rude and unprofessional. Place was pretty new and the service reflected that. We had a female cook and an African American male cook which was a first for me at any Benihana. No complaints just thought that was cool! We could tell they were both brand new in training because their skills were bad and service was slow and totally unorganized. We dealt with it and stuck to beers as all the mix drinks were messed up. Because this place was new I am willing to try it out again. We usually go to the other Benihana at Westgate in Las Vegas where they are old school and very much more professional."}
{"text":"We went this time for my wife's birthday. She got a $30 certificate from their birthday club or membership. That being said, for the two of us, we still dropped $80. The Saki Bomber with large ASHI beer was $20 in itself. The food was really flavorful, but after seeing the same chef routing more than 5 or 6 times, it loses it's luster.   It is a great place to go to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, etc if you have not been before and would like something a bit different and entertaining, give it a try."}
{"text":"This location of Benihana needs some work. The place is clean and the service was good. However, the chef (which is the while experience) left a lot on the table so to speak. He was mediocre at best and really did not appear that he even knew how to cook onions, zucchini, or mushrooms as they were all still raw when he put them on our  plates. Maybe he was still training? No idea, all I know was that this time here it was not very good. Better places in the Phoenix area for teppanyaki. Kampai!"}
{"text":"Decent food, not great. We had teppanyaki and our chef jorge was awesome! Very entertaining. I should have asked him not to cut my filet as all the juice was lost. Everyone knows a steak needs to rest at least 10 minutes. The scallops were good, shrimp was the best thing. The house fried rice was bland but I suppose they don't want to over salt it. A little soy sauce helped alot. All in all, just ok. I prefer sapporo as it is a little more high end and they have Chilean sea bass which hanas doesn't offer."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was told by a co-worker, that if you sign up for their Chef's table you'll get a $30 gift certificate send to your e-mail to be used in a certain amount of time. SOunded good and received the certificate. We went to Benihanas last night. We had been there before and the quality of sushi is good, the sake very average. So, we were going to use my certifcate and had a bunch of sushi to share. When she brought the bill, they charged us $9.75 for a large sake each. They same 'average sake' they serve in a bit smaller for $2. In the end we paid just as much as our regular bill going to Benihana's. What a rip-off that was."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 7:30 for a birthday celebration. Arrived at 7:20. At 7:50, we were still waiting for a table. There was another family waiting who had been waiting for 45 minutes. The staff could offer no explanation as to why they weren't seating anyone. There were plenty of open tables. We finally left and went to another Japanese restaurant. What is the sense of making a reservation if they don't seat you anyway? Benihana is now off of our list!"}
{"text":"I quickly remembered why it's been 10 years since we ate here! The food is okay, not the best, but far from worst I have had. The chief was good, friendly/experienced/professional yet personable. The server sucked, he sucked hard. Paid no attention to the table, almost as though he was doing us a favor. Guess I'll see you in 10 years."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely lovely. The decor is gorgeous and you really feel like you're stepping into another land when you go here, it is quite an experience.   Came here on a Saturday night past our reservation, with 3 people in our party. They told us it would be about a half hour wait, but in less than 15 minutes we were on our way upstairs to be seated with 5 other patrons.   It took a little while for us to get drink and food orders in, but about 10 minutes or so after we put in our food orders, side dishes started arriving while our chef was preparing to make our food.   I ordered the Garden Vegetable plate for $24.95 (I realize now that they forgot to give me asparagus, grr). If you're ordering a vegan item on the menu, the first thing you bring me should NOT be chicken-based soup. That was a major turn-off and I'm amazed that came with the meal, and they should have asked if I wanted it before doling it out.   The second part was a ginger salad that was really good, I loved the dressing. After this, our chef came and started making our meal. He was really funny, and did a lot of little tricks that made the dining experience almost like seeing a show too. Sometimes my veggies got a little too close to the meat on the grill for comfort, but they never mixed, although it would be nice if they could have 1/3 of the grill sectioned off for veggies. He made me zucchini, onion, and mushrooms on the grill, and he also had a LOT of veggies steaming in a separate area as well. My plate was HUGE and I didn't even finish everything, I was totally full! And the onion volcano that the chefs make is definitely must-see. It was a total blast.  I alerted the waiter that it was my friend's birthday, and they brought out a complimentary tangerine (?) topped cheesecake slice and sang to her. This cheesecake was AMAZING. It had angel food cake as the crust, and the back part was made up of nuts and some kind of frosting/fondant. The presentation was lovely and it totally made her day.  My only qualms were the pricing ($25 is a bit pricey for veggies, but I think overall it was worth it - my TWO friends got a chef's special together with steak for $34 which is ridiculous in comparison, since they got just as much food) and the fact that the grill should be sectioned off for vegetables and meat. Otherwise it was quite the enjoyable experience and I can see why this place is packed on a nightly basis. Very entertaining and I am sure I will be back again.  One last tip: Go to the Chef's Table section of the official Benihana website, and sign up. You will receive a $30 gift certificate for your birthday :) My friend used hers that night! Oh and don't lie, they ask for I.D. lol."}
{"text":"What can you say about Beni's - Not bad and not great.  I have been to Benihana in several different cities and for a chain teppan restaurant it's ok.  My fave was in San Diego, could have been the company we were with.  I would definately say they are pretty consistant everytime we have been.  The teppan is a little pricey, the sushi is consistantly good (they also offer the all you can eat sushi), and the sake selection is ok (very average).  I do get tired of hearing the birthday song 10 to 15 times while we are dining."}
{"text":"My family and I had never been to a Benihana but had heard rave reviews about the food. We decided to try it out last Tuesday night. Unfortunately, we didn't even make it past the hostess before the experience turned negative.  It started with the front hostess who was truly @!T%#. She had to be the most disrespectful and rudest person I've ever encountered in the restaurant business. Her attitude and demeanor reflected poorly on the restaurant and if I was Benihana corporate, I'd sue her for representing my company so badly.  My family and I immediately walked out and I proceeded to call the manager from my cell phone. The person who answered the phone claimed to be the manager and apologized to no end about the poor treatment we received. She took my name & number down and promised to call me back the next day in order to get my mailing address because she promised a gift certificate in response to the issue. Its been 3 days since we visited this location and still no phone call from that manager.  I am making it a point to contact their corporate office to advise them about how this location operates."}
{"text":"The roaches crawling in and out of the sauce dishes while we waited for the cook was most unsettling I would not recommend this restaurant it is filthy!"}
{"text":"To set the stage appropriately...my husband and I went in for dinner on a Saturday, already you can tell we are off to a busy and stressful start. Our server was Timothy and I could not say enough positive things about him. Timothy holds the place for the most exceptional server that I have ever dealt with in my life!!!!! You do not get that place by simply meeting needs and doing what is expected. You honestly do not even get that place by going a little above and beyond. Timothy is a reflection of the most exceptional customer service because in the face of adversity and extreme abuse from our table mates, he not only kept his cool he responded with a level of kindness that is uncommon! Timothy not only displayed phenomenal customer service he exemplified beyond what is typical leadership skills and patience. I genuinely hope that he gets the accolades that he deserves. Believe me when I say had you been at that table and witnessed the abuse and the most exemplary response to that abuse you would be asking the restaurant to be named after him. Amazing job Timothy. If they allow you to read this just remember how those people decided to treat you says far more about them then it could ever say about you."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with John as our chef.  Everything he prepared was to perfection.  There is a tendency of hibachi chefs to overcook food especially the shrimp.   This was not the case.  So happy that the shrimp was cooked perfectly for a change!  Thanks John!"}
{"text":"We tried Bar Sake for the first time inside the Village at Benihana. Very impressive! Delightful \"Robata Grill\" bites - prepared right there - are just delicious. There are happy cocktails and refreshing sake on demand. They really make you feel like the center of attention - both by the location (just over the bridge inside the main entrance where anyone walking by can see you living it up) and by the focus of the staff. They are absolutely delighted to serve you. Donna, Nancy, Janet and Ming - thanks for making us feel like we are your only priority."}
{"text":"It was one of my friends birthday and he decided to have his birthday dinner here. One of the best decisions he's made. I have never been here but I've heard a lot about the Benihana business but never had the chance to experience it. Our food was exquisite and Kevin,our chef, was friendly and knowledgeable. He interacted with us and made the experience all the more memorable. Hopefully I get a chance in the near future to return. Great job and great service"}
{"text":"Benihana is a great place to eat in any city. The teppanyaki show is more \"family friendly\" than other places in the city...but it is the most expensive. I ordered the filet mignon with fried rice ($36) and my friend ordered Splash & Meadow (steak and shrimp) with fried rice ($50). We also ordered a shrimp tempura role. ($12)  Each person is given soup, salad, veggies, and a few pieces of shrimp as an appetizer. The fried rice is absolutely delicious!!!!!!   I would recommend making a reservation because they are usually packed. If you sign up for their birthday club, you will receive a $30 certificate to use during your birthday month!"}
{"text":"Shocked by how delicious their sushi was.  The rolls are huge, the sushi is fresh and they are unbelieveably inexpensive.  I also got the whole chef show in front of me and ordered my chicken fried rice with shrimp and filet mignon."}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful dinner tonight with a fun table and awesome chef ( Daniel). Everything cooked perfectly! Jasmine our server was on top of everything and very friendly. She made everyone at ease and felt very welcoming. My husband and I did the restaurant week menu and came home with doggie bags a great deal! We had the land sea meal. Filet and scallops, yum! You'll enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Throughout the years, we've had many fun experiences at various Benihanas and celebrated many birthdays.  My wife and I decided to go to this location for my most recent birthday (May 2016).  We had made a reservation for 8:00 p.m. on a weeknight and were promptly seated.  However, a chef didn't show up to our table until 10:00 p.m.  Anybody for dinner at 10 pm lol?  The other people at our table and us kept looking at each other as our eyes glazed over and our heads began to nod off.  The waiter actually came by a few times and apologized - he asked what he could do to make it up.  I said I'd take another drink, which I assumed would be comp'd since the wait was so long.  Well, it wasn't.  My wife and I kept saying,\" Should we just leave?\" and we really were about to when a chef showed up.  So we plopped back down in our seats and our service began.  Food was good, chef was entertaining, etc...but waiting two hours for dinner wasn't much fun.  This wasn't the chef's fault.  Not the waiter's fault.  Probably the host or manager's fault, I imagine.  But don't seat people if you can't serve them for two hours.  Now it's my wife's birthday this week.  She just received her birthday coupon via email.  She has zero desire to use it"}
{"text":"We come here every year for my friends birthday dinner and every time we encounter the same problem and im not trying to get some free things for discounts but the hostess and managers thinks thats its completely a normal thing to wait additional 45 min for us to get seated at our table! We had a reservation at 7:00 pm and we were barely getting seated by 7:45pm! Im sure this happens so people will go to the bar and order drinks! Who trained these jokes? Im so tired of all these franchise companies to  get a bad rep because each location is doing their own thing and half ass the job not do what their job is supposed to be designed to make customer happy! Our chef also didn't have a personality at all and he dropped one of the cooking utensils when he was trying to show off his skills before he started cooking fried rice. How did he get hired? Makes perfect sense management is jacked up and employees are also jacked up with them. Definitely not coming back until they wake up and learn how to operate a simple restaurant business!"}
{"text":"So the Benihana manager reached out and wanted to make things right with what happen last time, so they sent gift certificates to come back so that was a good move to make things right. So I will be trying it again and I will update everyone when I do go. To Be Continued....."}
{"text":"George G.is right the place cost a grip so if you hit a jackpot go for it.Nicely decorated, quite atmosphere ,great waiters and chef very out going only two stars because cleaning the crap out of the shrimp should be done at the prep table not in front of your customers"}
{"text":"I can't even give this place 1 star. This is the slowest Benihana on earth. We came here for a birthday dinner, and it is 11 of us. We have been here for almost 3 hours and not by choice. The staff is SLOOOOWWW!!!!! Like sllllllloooooowwww!!!! And to top it off, they forgot to make food for one of the persons. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever I love Benihanas I've been to a few in California and Arizona and this has by far the worst experience we went out to celebrate for my friends 21st birthday our reservation was at 8 got there at 7:30 didn't get our food until 10:15 and it was half fast done I like to think that they hurried because the restaurant was closing. Didn't even get a dessert that was part of our 6 course meal super disappointed our server didn't even bother to apologize."}
{"text":"As far as hibachi goes, this is just okay. Not bad for a chain, but I've definitely had more flavorful and better service elsewhere.  I do think it is a fun place to go with a larger group.  The preparation of the food is an experience in and of itself."}
{"text":"My last few experiences at this location have been horrible. Last week we had the worst service I've ever had at Benihana. Our waiter kept disappearing and we had to ask him multiple times for everything. Everyone at the table complained about him, even the chef. There was a point in time where he didn't come around for at least 20 minutes.   In addition to the horrible service, the food quality wasn't up to the normal Benihana standard and taste. We spent $200 on dinner and it wasn't even worth half that. The rice had a weird taste and the steak seemed like very low quality compared to what they normally serve. On top of that, I'm wondering if this location has an issue with ventilation because you leave smelling like the restaurant and it's so strong! It was so bad this time that my eyes were burning while they were cooking. This has never happened to me at any other Benihana location.    During my visit the time before, my friend and I had to send our meals back to have them replaced because the rice had that weird taste and the steak and shrimp looked old. The manager came out and agreed that something wasn't right. The new meals looked \"normal.\"  They have inside and outside tables at this location. Their bar overlooks the strip (ground level) and has an open window type area that stretches the full length of bar."}
{"text":"In this review i will only talk about the food. Quite frankly because i love the fact that the food is served clean and natural. Not drowning in spice and soy. If i reviewed the service it would only take one star so lets pass that for now. I usually bring my daughter here for a treat every now and then and she loves the interaction ( that's of you don't have a snoozer table) the show is nice and best of all i don't feel sick and stuffed and overfed afterward. I will continue to come but really do wish they did something about the staff, they look miserable."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever going to Benihana and I was very satisfied with the food. This one was located in the Westgate hotel and casino and was spectacular  It was truly an amazing experience.  I would definitely go visit Benihana again but not this specific location.   Upon arriving we politely asked to be seated for two and were informed that it would be a 25 minute wait which we were perfectly okay with, after all we did not have reservations,  but one of the ladies said we could wait at the bar just outside, which was nice of her until she said \"but only if you're old enough to drink\" which somewhat bothered me since I am in Vegas alone with my girlfriend inside a casino resort. That isn't the main reason I am giving them 3 stars though.  As we walked in I wad made to feel as if I were underdressed when the waitress mentioned something about what I was wearing(which was attire for 90 degree weather because Vegas is in the desert after all.   This restaurant is amazing but fairly overpriced.  The price is understandable though since it is just east of the strip and in a hotel. The one thing that it lacks is great service from the waitresses. I did forget to mention our cook which was amazing.  He went out of his way to attempt to tend to everyone's needs and was great at it.  He made jokes and made us all laugh. He is was the light of our night after the not so nice waitress. The photographer lady came to our table and completely ignored us and only spoke to a group of for that was sitting at the same table.  Now I'm not saying this was a terrible thing because we weren't willing to buy a very overpriced photo but I always thought it was common courtesy to greet everyone at a table.    If you can manage to go there and get a nice waitress you'll probably have a blast.  I loved the ambience and cook. If you go try not to dress too casual as I and a few other people were.   Overall:  Waitress & photographer customer service:  2/5 Cook customer service (Leo was his name): 5/5 Food:  4/5 Decor: 5/5 Price: 3/5"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for my birthday and it was THE BEST!  Adrian put on a great teppanyaki show for us. We both enjoyed the chicken and filet mignon. Both were made perfectly and the taste was incredible! If you're going for your birthday, I recommend that you sign up on their website for their free membership...they give you a $30 voucher for your birthday. The establishment is fairly new and is conveniently located at the Las Vegas Fashion Mall. I do recommend that you make reservations ahead of time. We definitely can't wait to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for two an hour before since we stayed at Westgate and walked the strip all day. We arrived on time and waited over a half an hour to see people get seated in front of us who did not make a reservation. The chicken was undercooked and the cook packed up before my wife could ask him to put it back on the grill. This may have been an isolated incident but there is really no room to make that kind of mistake with chicken when you're paying close to $100 for two people. The waitress was great and always made sure our drinks were at least half full, which is important after walking all day in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place for hibachi! Food was delicious, especially the shrimp. Our chef was great and funny. The atmosphere was very nice and well decorated. It made it feel as if we were no longer in Vegas. Not many tricks and it took some time until there was an available chef. But it's highly recommended."}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by saying the food was good.... but the service was horrible. It was my fiance's birthday (which I stated on the reservation)... one lady at my table had food allergies and no one told the waiter so they cooked her food and we had to sit and wait. By then our rice and veggies were cold. The waitress tried but she seemed very overwhelmed. We were there a total of three hours! Then all of a sudden it was as if they wanted to kick us out. Except they forgot that it was my fiance's birthday AND desert came with our meal. I asked for a bag for our food and they bought everyone back a bag EXCEPT US. I wasn't sure if we were being discriminated against or if it was just a mistake so.... I asked to speak to the manager (as did another party at our table). It took the \"manager\" 15 minutes to come to our table. She spoke w/the other party first telling them that all she could do was give a discount while waving her hands and seemingly very annoyed.   Once she got to me I told her that I did not want a discount I wanted to give feedback on the service because we spent quite a bit of money to be treated badly. She told me that she was not the manager and that I shouldn't give her the feedback because she wasn't going to do anything with it... color me SHOCKED. There's no manager? My feedback isn't valuable? By now our ice cream had melted and we still had no check. Finally we paid and I requested the managers card. Donna if you read this please note that Amy was truly rude and should not be in customer care."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. Very expensive for what you get. The waiter was not attentive and forgot most requested items. I knew going in that it wasn't going to be cheap but I didn't realize it was not going to be worth the money. When you're paying that much, your Expectations tend to be higher. My bill was almost $200 for three people and two were children!! Very disappointed in the service and the quality of the food. The chef didn't even bother to cut off the fat from my meat which ended up being over a 1/4 of the steak. (They don't give you knives). They don't serve egg yolk sauce either but the waiter told me they had it and would bring it out. Won't be returning to this location nor this chain. Japanese Steak House is a million times better. They care about their reputation and it shows in their customer service as well as the quality of their menu items. Don't waste your time or money at Benihana/Chandler."}
{"text":"When we called to ask about reservations and wait times, the hostess refused to tell us how long the wait would be. Asked to speak to a manager, who proceeded to do the exact same thing. I guess they don't need our business, so we won't be going. Ever."}
{"text":"Had a good time at Benihana on a Saturday night.  Sat with a family with a couple of small children, with one asking questions to the chef non-stop. The chef took it all in stride which added to the entertainment. Had the Las Vegas roll sushi appetizer which was delicious.  The soup and salad were tasty. The main courses were very good as well. I would gladly go back as it did not break the bank either."}
{"text":"As you walk in you are amazed! Great atmosphere! Waterfall in the middle of the restaurant very cool even the women working there are dressed in a kimono. For your wait they have like a lounge area and they come and find you when your beeper starts going off. There's even a semi private rooms for those with bigger party. Just like any other Benihanas start with the mushroom soup then a ginger salad. With the cook cooking in front of you. It's just a process with the small show that they do so it takes a while for you to eat. I ordered the Benihana delight. That comes with shrimp and chicken. Everything seasoned really good. Totally recommend it love it.  Perfect day for Mother's Day!!!"}
{"text":"We went to our first one in Hawaii on our honeymoon and loved it. We went here on our anniversary in April. Of course the food was good and the entertainment of the guy cooking. I don't like how they sit you with other randoms though, we sat next to a couple our age (late 20's) who were really nice, and the other side of 2 older couples (50s +) that were very loud and obnoxious sipping wine talking about how rich they were. Annoying. Ill probably be back though because that was probably a one time thing :) great place to go for a special occasion. Get the fried rice!"}
{"text":"Food was good but they could have used a little less salt.    A little on the pricey side Service was outstanding"}
{"text":"1.) For more than $20 a plate I should be able to sit at my own chefs table even though I have less than 8 people in my party.   2.) If you are going to make fried rice for 8 people there should be more than a half piece of chicken breast in it.   3.) Just because the chef cooks in front of you doesn't mean the food will taste good.  4.) This is not authentic Japanese food. Sarku Japan inside the mall food court has more authentic Japanese food and Fry's Marketplace has more authentic sushi.   5.) The hibachi chicken rice is not worth the extra $3.50. Save that money for when you leave and you're still hungry.   6.) If you cook vegetables before meat then the vegetables will be cold by the time the meat is done cooking. This is common knowledge.  7.) Food is mediocre at best and I don't like being over charged for mediocre."}
{"text":"I have not been their in 10 years and if I go in another 10 years it will be too soon.  I am giving it 2 stars because the only thing good with this place was the food but don't get the miso soup.  Everyone seemed miserable working there.  The host said we had to wait till are whole party got there, we had one person stuck in traffic.  I told him that I know what she wants to order so we don't have to wait for her.  They said that they will then sit us in 5 minutes.  People kept coming in and they kept on sitting people at the hibachi tables.  We waited 30 minutes and then we got sat.  Needless to say we had a reservation.  The waitress came over never smiled ones and looked like she wanted to go home.  She took our order and then we got the soup and salad right away.  We waited another 30 minutes after we ate the soup and salad until the chef came to the table.  When the chef was cooking my son requested no mushrooms.  He did not hear him so I said it louder.  The chef looked at me and said what he can't talk for himself.  I was polite and just said I talk louder.  I was shocked with how rude he was.  We could not get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"They have no pork on menu it is  limited to chicken and steak. I would think they would have a better selection for such high prices for food items. Steam rice is standard chicken fried rice cost 8 dollars. Terrible restaurant period! First and last visit."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I went here for her Birthday our Chef was Jose, he made it a fun and interesting experience. We had the Chef Special which was the Filet Mignon with Chicken and Shrimp with Chicken fried rice.  The soup we had delicious I liked the Salad but my Girlfriend really didn't care for it Out of the entree the only thing that didn't live up to either of our likes was the shrimp even though it was seasoned in front of us it just didn't do well.   Our evening was closed off with a Vanilla Sundae and a picture of us together taken by the manager. Overall we had a GREAT Evening and would return again!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money!! The Chef we had didnt read the order right...forgot my fried rice. Gave us itty bitty portions.... Let items get cold while we were waiting for other items to be ready.  The waitress forgot that a couple of us get tea and.ice cream with our meals.  The prices for what we got and very little entertainment was definitely not worth it.  Not sure if its becuz its vegas, but they need to improve quality, portion and ambiance.  Never Again."}
{"text":"We loved the teppanyaki experience at Benihana. We had the steak and shrimp and steak and salmon and of course the scrump-delicous chicken fried rice. It was so good I can't wait to go back again to celebrate my birthday there!"}
{"text":"My first (and only) trip to Benihana's served as the reception to a friend's wedding.  We had about 25+ people in our party, but they were expecting us, so it wasn't much of a wait.  At first we all gathered in a very chill bar at the front entrance.  Plenty of chairs and low lighting make it comfortable.  We filled up three huge tables.  The service took a while, but it was a busy Saturday night and given our huge group, I give it a pass.  On to the food.  You might have heard from your friends, et al about the Benihana's gimmick.  After you place an order, a chef comes out to your table and makes it all right in front of you on tabletop grills.  Sure enough, that's what happens and the chef's also have a little standup act going to add to the showmanship.  It actually made it very fun.  Certainly beats sitting around for a half hour for your food.  I had the Chicken Hibachi.  The early courses include soup and salad (nothing special) and your choice of shrimp or veggies.  I went for the shrimp, because I'd never had shrimp before. (I know, I know)  To tell you the truth, it was kinda bland.  The chicken on the other hand was incredible.  Add a little bit of teriyaki and you'll be loving it.  The pricing is high, but not astronomical.  I paid about 30 bucks for my meal, which is among the cheaper items.  The specialty alcoholic drinks are overpriced for what you get, so maybe just stick with a coke or beer.  The motif of the restaurant is like some Japanese village, with fountains and such all around.  All in all, not a bad place to celebrate with friends, or to take a date."}
{"text":"Always love eating here but I hate coming out smelling like their food.  Service varies hit or miss"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Benihana last night. My in-laws took me there for my birthday--seriously does anyone go to Benihana for anything other than their birthday? The food was great and our chef, Jeremy, put on a great show though I did notice some of the other teppanyaki cooks were a bit more animated.  The onion soup, salad and shrimp appetizer were as good as ever and the signature Mai Tai in a Buddha mug was delicious. I ordered the Splash 'N Meadow and asked for my meat to be cooked medium rare. It was the perfect texture and temperature. The shrimp were great, too. My husband had the mango shrimp and really liked them though he did mention the sauce was a bit sweeter than he'd anticipated.   The staff was really great and made sure we all had constant refills. Our server was very attentive and helpful when ordering. Go here for your next birthday but make sure you go online and get the free birthday coupon first."}
{"text":"They treat you like royalty at this place. Benihana sushi is always excellent. I had the group sit-down dinner with a friend who is blind, and they accommodated hime very well. We both had a great time. Excellent food, entertaining staff. I seek out Benihana whenever I visit large cities. Sadly, there is not one in my home town."}
{"text":"Had such a great time tonight celebrating \"Tuesday\"  Chef ROBERTO was fantastic with all the kids at the table and he had a few tricks we haven't seen before when we have gone to other Benihana locations. Our server CHRIS(TOPHER) was friendly and funny. Even the young man that was hosting was efficient, friendly and accommodating. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I made my final visit bc still have $$ left on my gift card. Spoke with the manager prior regarding about same issues I have before. Manager (Bob) appeared annoyed and frustrated as he delivered my order. We verified my order together and it was wrong. Great! So now they have to go fix the problems. I pointed out that this happens all the time and that their team is not considerate of other people's time. The manager was happy to take the food back and shoo me out! I can't believe this is how I'm being treated when they are wrong here! I was shock and had to ask is this how this place handle their mistakes? The manager told me \"well you seem like you didn't want them\"... Is this place for real??? Then he said that it will only take them \"2 minutes\" to fix this. So I was like ok fix it. I have 2 minute. So they end my visit with charging me the higher price items on the menu then give me a discount. This will be my last visit and last yelp for this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend that I went to Vegas was craving teppan and I thought yummmm not a bad idea at all. So on our way to meeting our other friend we asked the cab driver if he could recommend a good teppan place. Why was I not surprised when he said Benihana... now we just had to talk our other friend into going... Agreed Benihana's it was. When we got there the ambiance was very nice seeing the waterfall then they walk you to the elevator and up you go and then the hostess is there to receive you.   Up until now still excited about dining here... Then here comes our server nice in a sarcastic way... I can't really explain the interaction but it wasn't that great. The bloody mary I ordered had all kinds of pulp in it so it wouldn't come through the straw and I had to keep picking the pieces out.... The soup and salad combo wasn't good the soup was very grimy and the salad didn't taste well with the usual dressing. Then we had to order I had the lobster and chicken combo and my friend ordered shrimp and gave some to me. The food was not that great and I forgot about that mustard sauce I used to like it this time it was like eating horse radish. I still did like the ginger sauce. I was full I just remember leaving disappointed.  On to the show the chef we had didn't really speak english but then again he didn't really speak at all. It was like he was just going through the motions because he does this 100x a day. No emotion or excitement to engage us and for it being in Vegas I guess I just expected a little more. I don't think I will be coming back to this location to eat again when visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy every time I went.  If you don't make a reservation and just show up expecting to be seated in more than an hour wait.  Always call ahead if you know what time you will be there or you'll be waiting forever.  Make sure you join their Chef's Table for $30 gift certification for your birthday.  They recently changed their rules, so make sure you bring someone else with you to the dinner before you can use the birthday certificate(s)."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar to get a drink and was slowly greeted by an unfriendly bar tender. The bar looked a bit grubby. I wasn't impressed by the staff at this point nor the surroundings but I was there for the show that was to come.  Luckily was sat with a table of people about my age versus the tables that had tons of kids. I almost felt like I was at a Chucky Cheese at times when I looked around.  Our teppanyaki chef seemed to be somewhat new and didn't have all the tricks and showmanship of the others around. He made a very tasty steak meal for us but I was hoping to get a bit more liveliness out of him. All in all the food was good. The fried rice was very nice. I even ate shrimp which is rare.  I was expecting a bit more out of the whole experience. I have been there a few times. It feels like this Benihana could use some better management and employees."}
{"text":"An update, Samantha from corporate called to try and give me an app gift card and  $20gift card. I refused as we will never be returning to benihana. With the horrid service and the unsympathetic nature of all their employees we would never support them again. Samantha implied that it was not their food or restaurant that gave me food poisoning. Well, since it was the only place we ate that night I don't think she is trying to save their ass. She also refused to honor my original gift certificate/coupon. I highly reccommend other places. At the extreme price  they charge for mediocre food that everyone should go elsewhere. There are other amazing places out there."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most expensive,  bad service, smallest portion, \"restaurants\" I have ever been to. I drove by a Wasabi on my way there. I should have went to it and saved the drive.   We arived early and were told to wait untill the other half of out party arrived to be seated. There were 3 people at 1 table in the entire restaurant. Once they did arrive we waited for the hostesses to get back. Then we got the \"in a minute\" thing from her because she was doing something else.   The guy cooking was just going through the motions and mumbling bad jokes. He gave the last guy half a bowl of rice and said he would make more but did not. The waiter did an ok job but brought the wrong desert order.  Food was subpar. The soup was obviously beef bullion cubes. Rice was undercooked and they did not tell us there was a up charge for fried rice. 5 eggs some choped veggies and 1 piece of chicken......came out to 28 bucks for our group. My steak was ordered medium rare and was medium well. The desert order was wrong and one person found a hair in her yum yum sauce after she finished eating. Not so yum yum. We also did not recieve green tea. Its on the menu and says its included in the meal.  Over all I would not recommend going to this place. For the 70 bucks we spent for 2 of us to eat I can make steak at home for an entire week and it would be 100 times better.  Oh yea.....the temperature outside was 12 degrees. There was no heat in the restaurant. The cook said that because the office building was closed that day the entire buildings heat was shut off because the offices were closed."}
{"text":"I came in with my fiance for a birthday dinner and had a great time.   For those of you who don't know, if you sign up on their email list, you get a certificate for $30 you can use during your birthday month.  It's a GREAT deal!  Pretty funny, but it seemed like half the people there were celebrating a birthday.  The staff is very kind here, and works very fast.  The food is delicious, and their Happy Hour goes until 7:30 PM, with great food/drink specials.  Our Chef Toshi was nice enough.  I'm sure they all have different personalities, but he did a good job.  If you haven't been here yet, sign up for the birthday coupon and come check it out.   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The original and still the best!  Quality food and the best chef ever!  Toy is a Las Vegas icon."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. I always sit at the bar with whoever I come with just because I'm in no need for the show at the tables while they cook in front of you. Every time I have come here the service is always awesome. The sushi cooks are the best and this is the only place in pittsburgh where you can get brown rice sushi. Yes they always tell me it's extra for brown rice but it is 1000% well worth it.  The bartender is always fast and great personality. Food is always above and beyond great in my eyes, that is why I'm so shocked they only have 3 stars. And I am also in the service industry so I am very harsh on service and food. 5 stars from me all the time for my visits. A must try."}
{"text":"It was a great experience going there. Though I must say that their descriptions for their sushi are very limited and I ended getting rolls that i didn't care for, much less knowing their names. The chefs are friendly and the portions were a good size."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have to ding this place 2 stars for lousy guest relations and service from the waiter on behalf of all at my table.  I arrived at the Benihana desk to inquire about dinner for 1. The lady behind the desk offered me the sushi bar (separate restaurant area) or the Asian restaurant. I knew that there was plenty of room at Benihana and replied that I came to eat at Benihana. I was given a pager and told it would be 15 minutes. Ok. Fine.  I was out front waiting for several minutes when the pager went off and I was seated at a table that already had 4 people at it. Ok. Fine. How long had they been there? Long enough to already have water.  Our waiter spoke broken English and was hard to understand. Worked through that and ordered a drink. Eventually ordered dinner.  We had a great chef who talked with us about his sharp knife, how long he had worked there and let it slip that management wasn't having the waiters tip the chefs as part of their payout anymore. If you know anything about tipping in a Japanese restaurant or sushi place, you know that it is customary to tip higher because the chef needs to be tipped. Not here. The wait staff keeps the tips, yet all they actually do is bring you drinks and the appetizers from the back. The chef does most of the work.  Easy to fix. Tip the chef in cash and reduce the tip to the wait staff accordingly. As I told the chef, two can play at this game. Now I am letting everyone know what they actually do. This is worse than pooling tips and dividing them up to everyone including lazy staff.  As I said, the chef was great and the food was excellent.  Now, about our waiter. Two people asked for more water. They got 7 up or some similar lemon lime soda instead. It had bubbles, the customer said it was sweet and it definitely wasn't water.  Yes I would go back, but it won't be because of the front desk or wait staff."}
{"text":"Do not let the three stars fool you on this place.  If you want to eat here you might want to do the following.   Make a reservation. Make a reservation.  Expect not to be seated until they can fill the chairs at the table.  You will probably sit next to strangers also.  The servers can get spread a bit thin.  Do not just sit there tell them you need something.    Where do I begin with this place.  I took a young girl who turned 13 here yesterday for her birthday dinner.  She had a great time last night.  She ordered the Trio which was chicken, shrimp and steak.  The meal came with fried rice, soup, onions, squash and shrimp.  The food was really good.  The chef did a great job and made it exciting for her too.  The server did get a little stretched thought a couple of times.  It was okay.  When I needed water I just asked the server when she was scooting around.  I ordered the Trio also and it was good.  This place is one of my favourite places to eat."}
{"text":"Never again!  I've eaten here before the economic crash and it was pretty good; not so on April 16, 2010.  The Phoenix franchise was never quite as good as Benihanas in Chicago or Florida or many other places I've tried but it was always quite acceptable.  They must now be trying to cut costs by mixing everything liquid with water.  The salad dressing has gone from tasty to untasteable...and the dipping sauces that used to be thick and delicious are now so weak that you can almost see right through them.  THis definitely was our worst dining experience of the year (since we go for the food and not the show -- which was fine.)  Forget this Benihana unless you want unseasoned processed-tasting food.  Watch the show through the windows and then go anywhere else to eat.  If you don't know how good they once were and how bad the food is now you might credibly compare it with cheap hamburg joint food but we know what it was like even just a year ago.  This establishment has definitely gone way downhill.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  My son had the \"Be the Chef\" experience. We arrived at 4pm, and the chef (Ananda, a.k.a Smile) worked with him for over 2 hours teaching him how to cook teppan style. When I arrived for dinner with the family 2 hours later, I was handed a picture, and my son was dressed in full chef clothing with the big red hat included. I was amazed that he was given so much attention.  We were escorted to our table, as it was just for us. My son came out, did his introduction and bow. He started cooking and really did a great job. His mentor stayed within earshot, but did not hover. My 16 year old had total confidence and even made a few jokes that he had been taught. The entire time, it was as though we were given person attention. I felt as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. I could not believe how much they went out of their way for us.   After dinner, we were treated with a birthday song, desert and another picture as a family. Even Ananda was in the picture. I was amazed.  You would think that this experience would be experience would be expensive. It cost no more than just dinner. For my son to be taught and cook, it was free! Amazing!  As a single parent, outdoing the last birthday is always a challenge. This was the 16th, so it was even more special. I would have to say that the team at Benihana made our day. This was a day my son will never forget. Five stars would not be enough for all that was given to us. Benihana Chandler, you are a perfect 10!"}
{"text":"Benihana trio is the way to go! Had a great time and food was great. Chef was Carlos.. great guy"}
{"text":"This is located in the fashion show mall, across the street from the Wynn resort. The food was typical teppanyaki. Overall very good. I really enjoyed the spicy chicken. Seemed like all the chefs were very entertaining. Food prices were very reasonable for lunch."}
{"text":"So have you ever watched the television show Hell's Kitchen and seen the episodes where the food service takes 3 hours or so and you're thinking, \"Good god, those poor poor people held hostage by incompetent chefs?\"  Welcome to my Benihana experience.  We had a reservation on a Friday for 8:30pm for 2. We arrive, get seated promptly at a teppanyaki table with another couple celebrating their 8th wedding anniversary and a foursome celebrating a birthday for one of the girl's in the group. Our waitress comes over, we all place drink orders, lots of Sake. I had drunken whale, a few bottles of Kiran Ichiban are purchased. All of us are here to spend money and have fun.   So at this point it's around 9. Still no chef.  our waitress takes our order. I order the Rocky's choice, filet mignon and chicken. My partner gets the Splash N' Meadows, basically surf and turf. The girl next to us orders Yakisoba noodles and scallops. The waitress starts bringing us the early courses of our meal.  Good onion soup. It disapears quickly.  Good salad, also quickly gone.  More sake is had. We've spent quite a bit on alcohol at this point.  We get a newbie chef Im assuming. Im bummed cuz while weve been waiting Ive seen 3 other teppanyaki shows and services end, so Im thinking maybe there's a snafu and thats why its taking a bit. I try to let it go. My partner goes to the bathroom for a minute the chef comes out and his knife show or what was supposed to be lasts about 10 seconds. She's like I missed it?! Mind you the table next to us, their knife show was about a few minutes long and was really cool. Ours was flip spatula 3 times ok Im in a rush since youve been waiting.  Ok, strike 1. We HAVE been waiting. Don't rush through the fun stuff just to get caught up cuz you were dicking around.  He screws up the onion volcano 3 times. Were cheering him on to get it right but seriously *I* can do this trick. But Im jumping ahead.  It takes him like half an hour to do the rice and veggies. He's clearly in the weeds where he;s cooking one thing at a time even thought there's 7 different orders. He cooks one entire groups steaks before he gets to us, all the while leaving veggies on a plate or the side of the table only mixing them in once we're like ok stop youre gonna go over. He screws up the birthday girl's steak order as well done instead of medium and puts it on her plate anyway then makes her another steak and makes the rest wait. He overcooks the girl next to us scallops til they're singed hockey pucks.  He plants butter on the table and it splashes on my arms and over the girl's chiffon blouse.  It's about 11:00pm now and he's barely finishing the girl's yakisoba.  Yes. ELEVEN PM. The restaurants closed. The cleaning people are there and our food is BARELY getting ready to serve.  My food was ok. I destroyed it because I was starving. But the rice was under seasoned and had some raw veg, the onions were overcooked and greasy. I stopped him on my steak and lucked out that it wasnt overcooked like my chicken was.  The manager then comes over and comps chiffon girl's meal, which means that their order which was close to 500-600 was on the manager. But then only offers me half of after I clearly hear her comp the guests next to us. I was spending about 150, that's chintz, pure and simple.   If youre going to comp half the guests for the same experience, then comp everyone we were all spending a lot of money. I wouldve even come back if that had happened.  So yeah we're offered half off the next group is comped and we still have a dessert course coming. Needless to say, were not going to eat one more course in a closed restaurant when its past 11pm and our reservation was at 8:30pm.  I think what sucked was the rushing through the fun stuff and then he was in the weeds after and overcooking everything for fear of making more mistakes."}
{"text":"So disappointing! Not only were the staff at the door miserable the whole atmosphere lacked. For a tepanyaki restaurant they need to change the music. They're short staffed. They did nothing for 2 birthdays at our table. The food was okay... prices are too high. Our chef Daniel wasn't very funny I found him to be okay. Very rushed, served our rice and by the time our other food was cooked the rice was cold. I will not be back."}
{"text":"No. Not part of our usual lunch rotation. Not even close. Benihana might have been hip about the time Godzilla and Bruce Lee were in their prime. A time when Japanese cuisine might have come across as exotic to most Americans so all the mystical kung fu clown aspects of the Teppanyaki restaurant food preparation process were quite the spectacle and even a reason to come to a Benihana in the first place. Nowadays nobody other than some hermit from Appalachia would find this exotic. It is, unfortunately, old hat. So when a rep from a vendor that is currently figuratively bending us over and letting us have it like we were the proverbial large minority inmate's new bitch - decided to treat us to a lunch at Benihana it almost felt like a slight. Like hey you little short bus riders - you may find this spectacle awe-inspiring and a great lunch. Either that or maybe he really didn't know any better and finds the whole thing fascinating and awesome himself like he fell out of a short bus himself. So anyway we all show up at Benihana except for our department's resident tard (you know the type - there's at least one in every group) who we had to wait for because they would not start until ALL guests arrive. They wouldn't even SEAT us until he did. Pssht. Once he finally got there we were taken to our table where we pretty much were able to order immediately. Once all our orders were taken this guy comes over to our table and begins the show. He mumbled something in what was probably Japanese really quickly as he started and began his chopsocky cutlery show. His whole schtick was adding a sauce or spice and each time he added something he would pretend it was something else when he announced what he was doing - chocolate instead of soy sauce or gasoline instead of sake and so on. He chopped all of our vegetables up and he chopped all of our vegetables down. It was an ancient Japanese art and everybody knew their part. Everybody was... quite entertained. Food? Definitely had better. Benihana is for kids, you silly rabbit! After we were done eating it felt like the staff wanted us not to linger and GTFO so they could prepare for the next wave. Probably won't be back unless some other vendor decides to treat us like their bitch and bring us here for lunch. Plenty of parking as it shares a lot with other restaurants in the restaurant row on the south side of Chandler Blvd (just north of Chandler Fashion Center)."}
{"text":"We had Behihana for Valentines. Its always a great experience. The food was excellent and just the right amount of time for the whole meal. Way to go!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my wife's birthday with a surprise dinner with a group of friends.  The atmosphere was casual and we had a good time.  The staff was pretty attentive and friendly.  Since it was our first-ever visit to Benihana, we had the old stereotype image of serious chefs tossing deadly knives in the air.  Our chef wasn't quite as aggressive, using more blunt cooking utensils, but he was really good at it, and pretty funny as well - very good entertainment.  We had a group of 12, but they wouldn't seat us until I could explain why a couple were not there and might or might now show later.  I just don't get that (anywhere, not just here).  We were at one table, so it's not like we were going to hold a table hostage and not eat if they didn't show.  Nonetheless, we had a great time and will probably go back again."}
{"text":"Great place and location there lunch here is amazing!!!!  And since the first time I've had New waiter and is very polite and the cooks are so good!"}
{"text":"I've worked in the service industry before and am very lenient with restaurants.  I know what it's like to be stuck in the weeds and feel like you're never going to catch up.  This was an average Tuesday night and did not appear to be that busy.  We were seated at our table with another couple.  Waited an hour for a cook to come to our table.  When it was apparent that no cook was coming, we asked to speak to a manager.  The manager was \"unavailable,\" so our group and the other couple left.  I personally don't mind poor service if the people appear to care about their work and check in on us; but no one even asked us if we had been taken care of.  I'm sure the situation could have been remedied if we could have spoken with a manager, but even the manager was inaccessible.    I guess this is a common occurrence at this location.  I unfortunately have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"This may sound crazy... I come for the food, not for the show. Grab a table in the lounge area for super quick service! Always super hot and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Very strange location... In the basement of an office. But other than appearance, the food is outstanding and the chefs are quality and put on a good show. Typical hibachi restaurant menu."}
{"text":"This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE RESTAURANT!!! I go every year for my birthday and as much as possible throughout the rest of the year. The food is cooked in front of your with amazing chefs that do tricks. I have been going to Benihana restaurants for over 20 years and still love it. This particular restaurant is my favorite because they are always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I was actually one of the guinea pigs that opened this place - I was a patron that sat in and let the staff do a trial run on me.  So I've been here a few times.  To be honest, I don't really care for the whole teppanyaki experience. It is a novel idea but it gets old after seeing it for every family birthday. Thanks sir, but no offense to you but I've seen the flaming volcano before.  The food is all over the board as far as quality goes. Sometimes you get a good mix and other times it is just OK. I've never had bad food at any teppanyaki restaurant, but don't expect the food to knock your socks off. This place is about the experience over the food.  The chefs are normally pretty good. If they hate their job, they they always put on a good face and put on a solid show for everyone. Good on them... or maybe I'm simply the only one that hates my job?  Is probably give this place a 3.5, but I can't do that here so I'll round up. OK food on the grill. OK sushi. Expensive (I got one roll and an adult beverage and it cost me 25) as all hell. Overall fun experience."}
{"text":"Love this place but we showed up for a Saturday lunch 10 minutes after they opened and were told by the not friendly host that we'd have to wait 45 minutes for a table. There were a few people waiting but not enough to justify 45 minutes. I guess we will not be going back unless we have dinner reservations. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I really don't know why there's quite a bit of bad reviews for this place because my experience here was great. I came here with my boyfriend; we made reservations and we waited maximum of 10 minutes to get seated. The hostess was nice, the waitress was great, and the food was DELICIOUS. Since it was our anniversary we got a cute picture and a free ice cream!   The only problem was that the chef messed up my order but he immediately apologized and served me my right order and HEY I got to keep the wrong order (free food!).   I'll totally be coming back and recommending this place."}
{"text":"Prepare to lose your cell signal when you go to this Benihana located in the basement of an old office building.  That is one of the reasons I like this place- cut off for a short while.  This is one of the better hibachi grills in the area.  They put on a decent show and you know what you are eating is at least going to taste like the delicious shrimp sauce they dole out by the gallon.  We typically go at lunch and end up stinking out the office when we return from the greasy hibachi smell that just sticks to you for hours.    Benihana serves up some sushi, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.  Stick to what is cooked in front of you, there is no reason to stray away from that.  Where they really stick it to you is the bar.  Their drinks are ridiculously expensive, so stick to beer- no mixed drinks.  They aren't strong and cost a fortune.  All told, this is a really fun place to go to every now and again."}
{"text":"Oh boy....I hate to do this but I have to.  For a table of 8 with 5 November birthdays, this would be a place NOT to come back to. The \"enticing\" $30 birthday certificate allows you the $30 off their teppan specialties with a purchase of a full price teppan dish Monday through Thursday.   Cocktail: Benihana Plum Wine - from Berkeley (me thinks) $7.50 for the glass. This is a regular plum wine.   Specialties:  6 course meals comes with: Onion and mushroom soup, salad, sauteed shrimp, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. Served with their mustard sauce and ginger sauce. Steamed rice. Hot green tea. ice cream or sorbet.   My pick: Deluxe Treat $38. - Filet mignon (medium rare) and a cooked lobster tail with garlic butter and lemon. This is a normal surf and turf meal cooked before your eyes.   The teppan chef first started with cleaning the teppan top. Oil, then made the beating heart fried rice (which is an optional for an additional $5). Next up is cooking the zucchini, mushrooms and making the onion volcano and choo-choo train. Then was the chicken, steak, filet mignon and lobster tails.   Menu books changed from the nicely bounded one to the economical thin and easily replaceable, cleanable menu books.   Overall: 0-star rating Minus a star: Server failed to provide the hot green tea.  Minus a star: Server forgot about the ice cream.  Minus a star: Server didn't take, nor offer the birthday pictures Minus a star: Server never refilled waters Minus a star: Server messed up the checks  I doubt the birthday recipients enjoyed the birthday experience. Better dine on a non-birthday."}
{"text":"I love that it comes w soup, salad, rice & shrimp.  The fried rice is my favorite (put the brown sauce on it - it's AMAZING).  My problem is with how slow they are.  Everytime I go there they seat me and I end up waiting 30 min before they take my order."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, fast service, great food and entertainment. The only thing I that was an disappointment was the drinks, they was not strong at all. Still a great experience over all"}
{"text":"Where I'm from we call this hibachi, not teppanyaki.  (Mt. Fuji I love you!)  Hibachi was always a fun option for a birthday party as a kid and it had been a while since I had gone to one.  This was my first experience at a Benihana, I've always gone to locally owned places.  I went with a rather large group and although we waited about 25 minutes after our reservation time they were able to give us two tables next to each other.  That was probably the best part of the experience.  As far as hibachi goes, it was a totally underwhelming experience.  The only \"trick\" our chef did was the onion volcano thing and it didn't even fire! It only steamed!  There was no flipping of shrimp tails, no egg trick, nothing.  It was as if we were eating at a regular restaurant.  I didn't expect the food to be stellar but I did expect a show, I mean isn't that the whole point?"}
{"text":"While on a work related trip - turned mini vacay in Vegas, I tried Benihana for the first time.  I'm a fan of a good hibachi and this one was superb! Why'd I wait so long to try them (slap me please)?  I went in March (25th actually... and reviewing this has been on a long 'to do' list).  This location is inside the Westgate Hotel & Casino, with a great Japanese decor I'm assuming all locations provide yet it seemed especially grande.  I almost felt like I was in the tourist part of the country as I crossed over the bridge.  Almost!.   FOOD  I ordered the filet mignon (cooked medium with extra garlic butter and seasoning...try it and thank me later!), and lobster tail ( might I suggest you request it sauteed in fresh squeezed lemon juice, chili garlic sauce, and garlic butter... it is sinfully delicious.)  The meal was huge as Hibachis tend to be.  It came with perfectly grilled veggies, and as a mushroom lover I was in mushroom heaven.  The shrimp appetizer was cooked perfectly and your chef may even give you left over extras after serving your table. I loved the sauces for dipping, particularly the brown colored sauce- very strong flavor...if you go for strong flavors.  I enjoyed all of the additions that come with it like salad ( I stuck to ranch dressing),  fried rice, hot tea, and the most delicious sorbet I've ever had, I wonder if they make it? Hmmm.  I stayed at Westgate Hotel for the week and  that weekend too so I had several trips there just to order a to-go sorbet, I'm sure they thought this a bit weird, but I can not deny the desire of my taste buds! Happy eating!  P.S I don't remember what I drank but it wasn't sake, I wasn't sure which one to pick so...I have to get my sake expertise badge another time."}
{"text":"If you want to save $$ going on a Vegas trip, you should stay in this off strip hotel and go spending more $$ elsewhere on the strip.  This hotel is a super-saver for those traveling on a budget.  I went to Benihana inside this hotel for this past week's Thanksgiving dinner with a friend for our Thanksgiving Vegas vacation.  It was the best idea.....this idea even beat over the last buffet we had at Rio which sucked!!!    Anyways, because we were hotel guests, we had the coupon for $25 off on two lobster+steak specials.  We were also going green for the hotel, and the hotel gave us coupons for food and beverage purchases which helped a ton.  When I ordered the lobster+steak special, my plate came out to be $21-ish including tax and tip.....can't beat this price!!!!  All of the chefs in this restaurant, so called the World's Largest Benihana, were very talented.  I was watching one of the chefs cook at one of the other tables before ours arrived.....what a great show!!  If you're looking to save up on watching a show, you should try Las Vegas Hilton's Benihana....why not?  You get dinner+cooking show!!  So....the choice is yours...."}
{"text":"First time to come and enjoyed nice lunch.  I feel like I have missed one of the great lunch time as I did not know Benihana's wonderful lunch deal.  I had a teppan steak that comes with fried rice and some vegetable. I enjoyed the Teppan performance.  The steak and vegetable were very good.  Fired rice was ok. I should try chicken fried rice next time. I want to  try shrimp and scallop next time. The downside I could not ignore was their dishes - greasy. I can see and feel it easily.  I asked the wait-person to change the dish, but unfortunately another one comes in  the same condition. I am sorry their dish washing machine is not good enough to clean up a dish.  At the same time, I am sorry their staffs are not aware of the greasy dishes. Also, we are the last customers seated at the teppan table, but we still wait for a while to the chef comes. I imagines other customers waited for such a long time..."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Benihana with the family last night.  We love hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis.  Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area, so we had not been for a while.  We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  After our party arrived, we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing.  The best part was how accommodating the staff was.  One member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredients.  We had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  After a few \"laps\" of the restaurant, without us asking, the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy.    Everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than I had remembered.  Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga, Nakama and others, but after our most recent visit, Benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff.  We visited Saga shortly after going to Benihana and just kept commenting on how much better Benihaha was."}
{"text":"We always have a great time at Benihana we always go on our birthdays  or for lunch. We always enjoy the table side service and show Depending on who's in front of you determines the quality of your experience with have always been very lucky with the chefs in front of us go for lunch the entree pricing is very reasonable average entree about $15.00 if you interact with the chefs you will enjoy your experience more."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah yeah it's Benihana, but they have a great lunch special. Think about it like $10 for so much food all straight from the hibachi... It's actually called the Teppanyaki Grill but for the white people out there I'll keep it simple.  If you go any time before 3pm the lunch special includes your choice of meat,  veggies,  fried rice and soup.  Great for when you just need a quick cheap bite"}
{"text":"Over priced more then the Benihana's anywhere else...they even charge you $3 just for spicy mayo on your food smh and $8 for fried rice...don't ever come to the benihana at west gate casino...I love Benihana's but not this place worst ever"}
{"text":"Went to benihana despite the reviews thinking how could you possibly mess up habachi. Well they sure know to mess up a good thing. The ginger dressing was basically raw ginger with some vinegar, they charge $6 extra for fried rice, and the \"noodles\" they give you look straight out a ramen packet. The saddest $134 I have ever spent."}
{"text":"I love going to Benihana, but they out did themselves in Vegas!   Of course everything in Vegas is outrageous and over the top, and that goes for expensive entertaining Japanese food too!   The chef's were hilarious with cheesy jokes and tricks, but they made it fun. I even was pulled into believing that i was going to catch a bowl of hot fried rice!!!   The place was gorgeous tho! Right next to a Japanese inspired bar/nightclub, it was really entering a Vegas Toyko, complete with waterfalls, bridges, and light shows!  All in all : Vegas Hilton - Go - Eat at Beni's - Do it!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good... The chef was very good.... However, the hosting staff here needs some major improvement! Overall, we probably would have had a decent experience had it not been for the bad tone the hostess set. With so many restaurant choices in Vegas, I would expect the front door staff to at least be friendly. These ladies couldn't have cared less nor even be bothered. We definitely were an inconvenience by coming in and interrupting her conversation with her coworker. If you don't like your job, quit... There are so many people out there that want to represent a brand with a positive attitude and work ethic..."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The price is amazing for what you get. I mean think about it. It is cooked in front of you, it is quality. You are surrounded by positive energy. I rarely have a bad experience at Benihana. They always make you feel welcome.  It is definitely worth the price in my opinion. And in Benihanas defense. People say that $35 for a plate is expensive.. Remember. for $35 you usually get some seafood. Shrimp, Hibachi rice. veggies a salad and greentea. So you get lots and lots with there $35 meal.  If you haven't gone there yet. Go!!!!!!!!! You will love it."}
{"text":"I am for sure a fan but i would suggest going during lunch time. It isnt as packed and you get better service. But if you really wanna go for dinner then try it out but it is always packed and because its so packed they tend to rush sometimes and your food isnt as good then. But i love the las vagas rolls and the food is really good when they make it just right. I have been going here for years."}
{"text":"Mom, Dad, and I ventured out for a nice meal at the new Benihana at the Chandler Fashion Center, and it was a very good choice.  Having your food cooked right in front you along with a little chef artistry entertainment, makes this meal a little more special.  The meal is hand-crafted and fresh, adding a nice touch.  I had Scallops, Calamari, and Shrimp.  Dad did as well.  We enjoyed it.  Mom went with the Filet Mignon and I was allowed a bite and mmm, mmm - delicious and tender, melted in my mouth.  I now want to go to the one in San Francisco, as every time I try to go to it there, it is always busy.  Great Service Nice Staff Good Food Nice Ambiance  Your own food, cooked right there where you see it being crafted, then dished out to your bowl was superb."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice but unskilled server. Bathrooms need cleaned and prices are too high compared to other hibachis. Service was too slow."}
{"text":"Yummm. That is all. Happy birthday to my brother. Couldn't have picked a better place"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Stay away!!! We were told that we would need to wait 30 minutes before they have enough people to open a table for us. We sat in the bar and We paid $16 for 2 glass of beer. But it was just a beginning.    Waitress accent was so hard that I though she is speaking Farsi or something.  I ordered Hibachi Supreme or they also call it Hibachi Elite, the most expensive steak for  $45. It was so tasteless, it was like eating a rubber. Our chef was total disaster.  Misou soup they brought was over salted and cold! We end up paying $125 for two. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went at 5 pm on a Sunday for my daughter's 18th birthday.  Totally enjoyed the whole experience.  Great waitress, basically stayed with us or near by the entire time,refilling drinks, taking away dishes etc.  Chef was great. Food was great, no complaints at all. Expensve but I feel for a special occasion it was worth it.  Sang happy birthday in Japanese, gave her a special sunday with candle and took a nice photo of all of us and framed it and gave it to us before leaving. I dont understand poor reviews!  We enjoyed every minute and feel we got our moneys worth for an enjoyable, memorable evening."}
{"text":"Five stars for our dinner service last night! We arrived at 6 and our wait was only about 15 minutes long, YAY! We were a party of 8 and were seated all together at one table. Once seated, our waitress came over to take our drinks and appetizer orders.  Drinks and appetizers came out quickly and we all placed our orders..   Las Vegas roll Sashimi platter   Two Benihana trios Hibachi steak Spicy hibachi steak Rockys steak and shrimp Kids steak and shrimp   The Las Vegas roll was so good! Dip it in the soy sauce and bam, party in your mouth! I kinda wanted to just eat the Vegas roll all night long!   Okay, so the food is pretty simple. You get rice, (either steamed white or chicken fried rice) and of course a protein or proteins. My Benihana trio consisted of shrimp, steak, and chicken with the chicken fried rice. It was a five course meal so we also got a soup to start with and then came the salad, then the rice, shrimp appetizer, our meats, mushrooms, and then our onions. The only ingredients they seem to use are garlic butter, garlic, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Nothing too fancy but the flavor is good.  All in all, what your really paying for is for the experience and the food is just what you get from it. We spent about $200 for a party of 8 so it can be pricey, but hey they put on a good show!"}
{"text":"I took the wife for her birthday since she's never been there. I'm glad I did she liked it. The food was good and fresh. The show the chef gave and seeing the food made right in front of you was great.  I'd go again. Get reservations if you plan on going"}
{"text":"My daughter really enjoyed her bday here. Service was exceptional slow so dine early.  They explained it was due to staffing issues. Regardless Management went above and beyond to make her bday special and recover.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This became one of my favorite spots. Starting from the decor to the food and it was even more wonderful thanks to Sachiel for being such a gem, telling us history of Benihanas and singing Happy Birthday in Japanese. She overall was great. Dan the cook also was super funny and very detailed with his tricks."}
{"text":"Never been here prior to this review. Didn't think it was worth the hype. Decided to check it out when it was a recommendation. Came here to meet a long lost cousin, the drinks were pretty good but the food was even better than I imagined especially the fried rice and the diablo sauce on our shrimp was the highlight of our tastebuds! Our chef wasn't particularly amazing but entertaining none-the-less and liked him because he was originally from where we're were from.  We really enjoyed our party and food except because of the seating arrangement was half circle it was hard to talk and hear everyone without having to turn our back on the next person... will definitely have to come back for some more of that awesome diablo sauce!"}
{"text":"I attempted to bring my family there without a reservation at 5pm.  The front gal told me she could seat us at 7!  It came off rather rude ... as if I'm going to sit there for 2 hours."}
{"text":"The food here is always great, however, the staff today was just off.  Not one member of the staff was happy or smiling! We had a huge party and were definitely spending money, which was only going to benefit the server, who hated her job! Towards the end she seemed a little better!  Was also disappointed that they were out of a ton of stuff, we ordered a roll, the oven was broke, I ordered another roll, they were out of the crunchy stuff for the top, we ordered much ultra they were out, all of the stuff was on the menu and there was no mention prior to Is ordering or even after ordering, they came back each time after 5 or so minutes to tell us, which took forever to eventually get our sushi!  All in all it wasn't terrible the food here never disappoints so we always leave full and happy !"}
{"text":"My first time experience was good our server was nice the chief was funny and the food was well cooked!"}
{"text":"One reviewer called the food fresh. Curious how fresh is defined.... Freshly frozen and partially thawed upon service.... Went with a work group for the first time and will never go back. Not worth the price. My rainbow roll had frozen white fish and salmon on it... Fresh- No, Freshly Frozen?!?  2 co workers ordered sashimi combos and they came out 30 minutes after all other hibachi and sushi were delivered and their salmon was frozen. The waitress was not apologetic and kept saying ten more minutes.  And as another reviewer mentioned holy butter and clogged arteries on the side. No wonder why America is fat. The hibachi cooks added 3-4 scopes of butter to all hibachi dishes. Not worth the price on the menu!"}
{"text":"Now, to start off, this review by no means should reflect on the cook, Titto, he was AWESOME!!! My fianc√©e and I came here for our 1 year anniversary. It was her first time. The major issue, we had a reservation at 7:30, and we didn't get seated till after 8. Just wish when you make a reservation, it's kept. We both understand there are hiccups, but please, don't tell us it will be a 5 minute wait, then proceed to just stand there and act like we aren't there. Offer a drink or something....that's just good customer service..."}
{"text":"I NEVER give 1 star reviews, you can check my cred. Out of my current 223 reviews, only 2 of them are 1 star. That should just prove how truly bad this experience was. If it wasn't for my Benihana Club $30 birthday reward, I wouldn't have even stayed to endure the pain and suffering that was this visit.   First off, they were extremely understaffed. With both servers and grill chefs. We had an 8:30 reservation, and were seated on time, but we then sat around for AN HOUR before our soup and salads even came out. It also took quite some time for our drinks to come out, then even longer to get refills.   About an hour and 30 minutes into sitting by the hibachi, our Chef rolls out. He tells us \"sorry for the wait, we're running out of this and the kitchen is slammed\" They sent me out with some stuff to get started, but we're still waiting on items to get prepped\". You're telling me that after an hour and half, you don't have the damn cart prepped for our grill?! The restaurant was maybe 60% full. There were still 4 grills that weren't sat, and the dining room of regular tables had hardly any patrons.   As our 'Chef' started cooking, he realized there weren't enough shrimp for the table. He did a count, and told the runner he needed X amount more shrimp. Then he served us up, and realized he was wrong and he was still short. Runner had to grab MORE from the back for 3rd time. Then when he was grilling veggies, he didn't have the mushrooms that accompanied the steak. Finally got those, and he portioned those out. After he portioned them out, he realized he forgot to serve a customer her share. He over salted EVERYTHING. And I'm sorry Benihana, but charged $4.50 PER PERSON up charge for 'fried rice' is ridiculous. $9 extra on my bill for some rice with a sparce amount of veggies and egg with mediocre soy sauce. This was some of the worst 'fried rice' I've had.   The chef was complaining, the servers were complaining, the food runners were complaining. It was almost comical at this point. By the time we got served our full meal, it was after 10:30, a full 2 hours since we sat down. Then our server didn't even offer up the dessert that was supposed to be included with our selections. At that point I was so annoyed that I didn't even care. I cannot recommend this to my worst enemy.  Benihana Corporate, y'all need to either shut this place down, or bring in staff to do a complete revamp because it was RIDICULOUS.  PS - forgot to mention the bathrooms were a damn MESS (pee on the floors, paper towels everywhere) & the heat was broken so it was cold as heck in the restaurant."}
{"text":"It seems that this location is a must for anyone celebrating their birthday. With that said, we went Wednesday night for my wife's birthday. I made reservations and was greeted and sat within minutes. We were seated at a table with another family who were celebrating their daughter's birthday. The food is in the $30 - $40 price range and come with soup and salad. Our orders were taken pretty quickly. The food was good but nothing fantastic. I realize that part of the cost is the \"show\". The chef seemed hurried and barely cracked a smile. The entire point of coming here is the \"show\". Once the chef started, the waitress disappeared so if you want another beer, order before the chef starts.  Once dinner was served, we were hurried along. For $110 for two people (2 entrees, 2 beers, an iced tea, and the fried rice up sell) I expected more."}
{"text":"We went with a party of 11 to celebrate a birthday.  It was most of our first time. The restaurant is beautiful! 5 stars for the building,  decor, and ambiance.  The staff & chef was very nice, professional and attentive. There were a few awkward silences he didn't have many jokes or entertainment (as I've experienced with other chefs @ different places) but he was a great cook. The food tasted great. But if I had to be honest I don't believe it was worth the $200 bill for the 2 of us. Most of the party had a $80-100 bill. Which would not have been bad if the food was worth it. I believe that we could have gone to Hikari for better food & less money.  I think you are paying for the popular name mostly.  It was a great experience,  glad we did it. Not sure I'd ever go back."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Benihana for about 5 years now. We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday.   I made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30.   We arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders.   This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations.   We decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm.   Our first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"A very horrible experience.  My 3rd time here,  haven't been here a long time and I'll tell you,  this final time it sucked.  Let me start off by saying I gave it two stars and not one because of the performance...  That's about it.  We waited 45 mins. just to get started and the food was horrid.  The shrimp was so rubbery..  How is that even possible,  the mushroom soup that came with my order (or should I say water soup)  was literally mushrooms floating on top of water. My goodness they downgraded a lot.  I will never go back to this dump.  Their prices are overrated.  Ten dollars for a dam shot..  PLEASE!  you must be joking,  your a two star restaurant.  Smh very disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! This place is awesome and always impresses me. Such a nice atmosphere. Came here for my birthday and got a free picture printed in a frame to take home. I love how the chefs cook at your table and make the experience interactive. Definitely worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Teppanyaki grill i've been to. The lighting was harsh and made me feel like I was in a mundane Las Vegas buffet. Made reservations for two and still had to wait 20+ minutes, so what's the point? Food was pretty good, but service was not up to par in my opinion.  Next time, I'll just got to Kobe for my Teppan outing."}
{"text":"Came here for the grand opening. Giving 5 stars cuz I like this place in general. Always fun and good and fresh food. I can tell that they were adjusting since it was there it's day. They forgot our soup and salad but gave us a free dessert instead. Frustrating but the good service and food compensated. Would come again!!!"}
{"text":"When the cook rhythmically chopped an onion and said \"choo choo\" as he pushed it across the grill, I felt deeply embarrassed.   Who is this guy and why is he being so cheesy? Is he insulting my intelligence? Does he know that there aren't any children at the table?!    Eh, whatever. The food was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food was good, but we had some fat, bad apples at our table and their was no escape.We got to the table last and the action started soon, so it was too late to try and bolt. These two women were rude and chatted and laughed and cackled all the way through the chef's show. I was held back from attacking them verbally by my dining companion, but I got a few shots in, not enough.      Anyway, had the birthday BOGO discount. Behihana Excellence was good, shrimp is a solid choice and teriakyi steak is usually good, all on the same plate, wow. Gotta get that chicken fried rice. Yo. Nice desert and birthday song too boot.     The restaurant needs some kind of water outside. All Benihana's have water displays."}
{"text":"Benihana is always good and that includes the Las Vegas one. We were originally booked to eat at chef Ramsey's restaurant but backed out last minute after our experience at the Eiffel Tower wasn't as good as we thought it would be. We went with a 3/4 star restaurant instead. The 5 star restaurants are just to bougie for us."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep going to Benihana, but I do.  They are great for small events like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.    The food is always and will forever be over priced and slow to get on your plate.  The chefs have dialed it back over the years, however they still put on a decent show.  Don't skip the fried rice, it's delicious.  I promise not to go back because of the over priced average food and slow wait service .... yet.... I will inevitably find myself back at the hibachi table for my grandmothers next birthday... :/"}
{"text":"My husband, my kids, and I rarely have any time altogether and we decided to dine at Benihana's Chandler tonight. The service was ok. The server was on top of things, but she had a strange, \"cocky\" attitude. Made me very uncomfortable... and it's tough to explain. Mainly sarcasm and very passive with us. Then our chef showed up, and right when he started the \"show\", he accidentally tossed a spatula into my daughters lap. From there, no tricks at all! It was a 110% boring experience.  The entire table (my husband, my 2 kids & I), and another family of 4) sat there quiet waiting for some kind of entertainment from the chef to take place. That's what Benihana is all about, right!? And to top it off, the food was under seasoned and had no flavor.  I honestly think our chef was new, and needed some training. But in that case, he shouldn't be placed on the floor on the busiest day of the week (Saturday). We paid over $220, and it was not even worth it... I'm sorry to say. :-("}
{"text":"Daniel was such a joy, he was so funny and made the experience so nice! Not to mention the food was delicious! Thanks for making my birthday a memorable one :)"}
{"text":"This place is not what it use to be,small portions of food for the money,taste not as good,place seemed like it needed a good cleaning,chief was very funny.Not sure if we will go back"}
{"text":"Good food, good entertainment and not too expensive. The only complaint is their front staff service. They were more attentive to each other (there were about 5 up there) and less attentive to the customers who were trying to get their attention for assistance."}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome atmosphere. Food and service was delicious. My only complaint is the portion sizes are a little on the small side."}
{"text":"Locating this place was a bit difficult because their sign was unnoticeable. The bartender was too slow. We also ended up waiting for an hour before we even got our soup. Everyone was pretty hungry and cranky having to wait so long to eat. Our chef Tony was great. He was funny and made a bad experience bearable. Our server was pretty terrible. He messed up our orders more than once, was slow, confused & annoyed all of us with his stupidity. Management did try to accommodate and in the end the food was good but I doubt I would want to return"}
{"text":"I know it will take some time to get a table so I made a reservation at 5 PM which is opening hour. I got there early and went in as soon as it opened. I had to wait for more than 15 min and at least 10 parties with no reservation went in before us. I reminded receptionist a few times. They looked at me like sit-down-and-wait-until-I-call-you.  Food, host and chef were all great but receptionists started us off in bad impression."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant but unfortunately the hostess is a mess. We've been going there for years to celebrate our children's birthdays. This year they messed up our reservation leaving 10 ppl with no option but to wait an hour or so to see if we could get seated. It's a good thing AH-SO is close by. We will not return to this Benihana until they can work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Still love this place!  If you sign up on their website they send you a coupon for 30.00 on your birthday.  Chefs specials are two for under 40.  Cocktails are expensive, but still love the fresh food"}
{"text":"The food was really good! However, the staff was mediocre. It took forever to get seated even though we had a reservation and we also had to wait 30 minutes after being seated to even get our soup/salad and drinks. Overall the experience was below average and I don't feel it was worth the price. It has definitely taken a downhill turn over the last year or so. It used to be a very lively place with great service, unfortunately not anymore :("}
{"text":"Used to be better. I wish they would do more to train chefs to be consistent. It is a crap shoot if you get a good one or not. This night our chef was friendly but did very very little flourish or show. Also the fried rice was a disaster, it was lumpy and did not have enough of ingredients or seasoning for the amount of white rice. We did get one of the more responsive servers tho."}
{"text":"There is no other reason to go here nowadays, except for that $30 credit for your birthday month coupon. Parlayed that $30 into the Benihana Delight and of course, the chicken fried rice. Ordered ice water and grand total with 18% tip was $6.36. This can only be accomplished by using the solo dining option, therefore avoiding any female to bump up my tab. Oh yeah, this place will never get five stars unless they bring back the bean sprouts from the 90's. Lost another star due to that weird thing on the sides of colossal shrimp not being taken off properly. Had to peel those suckers off on my own. Huge bonus though for the chef keeping my steak on the grill until the last moment for well done status. I had to ask him twice not to take it off the grill, but I am probably one of a handful of people who would request this situation.     Funniest part of night was when young dude spilled entire glass of water on another woman at the table, not in his party. Hard not to laugh. This Benihana is also pretty ugly and needs a remodel - it looks like it's been awhile.     Oh yeah, the cute (but ditzy) blonde at the table had the best line. Chef puts some garlic Butter on the rice and calls it Japanese Peanut Butter and the girl (who didn't oder the rice) says, \"i never had japanese peanut butter, wonder how it tastes\""}
{"text":"Great for entertainment, but not so much if you are super hungry. (I guess you can say I've had my turns of coming here when I'm starving). It takes a while for the cook to show up and get prepared, so if you don't have much time, don't come here.   Very nice to see that your food is cooked fresh in front of you, but it's too bad they use the same oils and sauces to cook everything in, makes it a bit bland, but not horrible. Fried rice is the best! Sushi, not so much.  Been here a couple times and secretly wish they could do maybe a slightly different version of entertainment... possibly? Don't wanna sound mean, but I know everything that they're gonna do already. Not saying that I can do any better, but it would be nice to see a new trick once in a while. Slightly pricey, but hey, it's live entertainment & meal all in one."}
{"text":"First & last time stepping in to any Benihanna.  Came here with some friends on 9/2/17 Saturday at around 8:30pm.   The hostess in the front without even giving any type of greeting just said \"we are not serving until 10:30pm.\"   2 hour wait to give business to your location? Yea not going to happen especially with a hostess that is lacking in customer service.   I'd be embarrass if she was the person responsible for greeting all my patrons at my business.   I am sure there could have been 100 other ways she could have mentioned to our party that there will be some wait time prior to being seated due to x, y, & x. She could have even offered another solution.   Will not come here again."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a picture of everything! We ordered sushi first (The Vegas roll is delicious). My wife and I ordered steak and salmon so we could try both, and it was amazing! The salmon has this avocado sauce with it that is the most amazing thing I have tasted.  The chef put on a great show and was really funny and the manager came over to make sure we were enjoying our experience.   We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Awesome atmosphere.  Nice waiters. Bad location."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in what is now the Westgate Hotel(formerly Las Vegas Hilton).  There have been some changes to Benihana's since the last time I was here.  Nothing appeared new, it just looked further tucked in the back.  Anyhow, it took nearly 30 minutes to self-park with my date on Valentine's day.  We then got to walk completely across the property to get to the restaurant.  Talk about setting the mood.  Our waitress comes to the table speaking a broken English and was very hard to understand.  The waitress had about zero personality and explained how everything you wanted to substitute on your meal was going to cost extra.(brown rice $3, fried rice $6, extra plate $10).  We were with a group of 8 others so she proceeded to tell each and every one of us the same exact thing(everyone but me wanted the fried rice).  I went for the brown rice so that's more as well.  Not quite sure why.   It seemed like we were waiting about 30 minutes at the table before the chef came over.   He was pleasant enough especially after being conditioned to the shortness from our waitress.  We asked for no onions which didn't seem to translate to the vegetable portion of our meals but they were big enough to pick out.  The food tasted good however they should trim the fat from the premium cuts a little better.  They use a lot of butter in their food preparation as well, so plan on a bit of a stomach ache if you aren't used to that much fat.  The bill was $120 for the two of us with each of us having one alcoholic drink.  For our convenience, the smug waitress added 20% tip to our bill as we were part of a 10 person party.  This policy is the obvious reason for our poor service by our waitress who was guaranteed 20% regardless of her performance.  It's a shame that Benihana corporation lets this sort of thing go on.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went to Benihanas tonight and I didn't even get to try the food. I have been to California and had the food at the Benihanas there and it's great!!! But here the service is horrible!!! We ordered drinks and they didn't even come!!! It took 30 minutes to get seated and we had called for a reservation a couple days before!!! We ordered our drinks and the guy had to deliver ice cream and other stuff and he said I would get your drinks in a minute... So we asked him realistically how long does it take to actually get a chef and we asked him to be honest and he said 30 minutes!!! We got our coats and walked out like a boss... That's why I gave this review a 1 star because this place was just horrible! Maybe next time we can actually be seated in less then 30 minutes..."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. My mother loves shrimp and this ruined her 80th birthday celebration. We arrived around 4 PM on a Saturday to avoid the crowds. The hostess did not smile or say hello and rudely told us that a teppanyaki table was not available until 10:30 PM even though there was a table open the entire 1.5 hours that we were there. She told us to sit in the corner of the dining area, but did not walk us in. There were no waiters or waitresses working in the dining room. Why have your restaurant open if you are not going to bring in wait staff? We were finally served by the manager who made us feel that we were an inconvenience to him. Terrible food presentation with cold rice, sad looking salads, dried out, room temperature shrimp, steak and chicken literally thrown onto plates with some onions on the side. The sauces came late and the hot tea was not served. Would have sent the food back or left altogether, but I had a group of five very hungry people and pre-paid tickets for an expensive event that evening. The wait staff showed up around 5 PM which was way too late to salvage this bad experience. Terrible service and tasteless, dried out food in an environment lacking any ambiance all for $30 per person. We eat out a lot and will never come back."}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for a few days and decided to eat at the Benihana at the Westgate Hotel. Very disappointing. The restaurant is big, very nicely decorated, and clean. That's the best I can say. Our server spoke very accented English, (good for him to learn our language), and he spoke very fast. It was hard to understand him. The chef was funny but not very entertaining. His skills at the table were very limited. Not really much of a show. The food was very bland. I had to add sauce to the fried rice ($8.00), mushrooms, and zucchini. I saw most everyone else do the same. I had the \"spicy chicken', It was the only thing that had flavor. Not spicy mind you but flavor.  All in all, a very expensive tasteless meal.  I have been to one other Benihana, in Florida, and I felt the same way about the food. My advice is to find a teppanyaki restaurant that is not named Benihana. I have always enjoyed those better."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday party and it was a great time.  Our chef Antonio was amazing and very entertaining.   He had us laughing and enjoying ourselves.  I had the spicy chicken and I was satisfied with it. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time my Wife and I have been here and we've experienced wonderful, \"very\" attentive service and our dinner was great.  We waited about 10 minutes and were seated. I had the soup, salad and ocean treasure with fried rice and it was super. My Wife had the Filet Mignon and I tasted some of hers we agreed it was great. With my vanilla ice cream and her green tea (excellent) ice cream we left stuffed and happy... give it a try."}
{"text":"Ryan was great! Made the experience great for my family.   The food was awesome!  Had the steak and shrimp and it was wonderful.  So flavorful.   Great service too !"}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 times now and every time disappointed. There are much better hibachi places out there. Plus the place seems dirty. I got the shrimp Hibachi and it was bland. Having to pay extra for fried rice with your dinner is insane. And not everyone likes chicken fried rice. If you whatnot great Hibachi that is much cheaper try Fang in Lawrenceville"}
{"text":"I would give a zero star if I could. I had 2 chicken hibachi rice delivered via Postmates. Trust me, I love hibachi and this one was the WORST hibachi rice I've ever had. It had no flavor with just too much garlic in it. I can cook better than that. After my first bite, I had to threw them away even though I was hungry. What a waste of money and time. WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Entertaining and Tasty  The chefs are a blast, they are really well trained and entertaining, especially Daniel...that guy is a blast. Great steak, great shrimp, all around good food. It's Benihana, the place has been around since the 60's for a reason."}
{"text":"This place has been solid for years, but I have an interesting observation about the cooking process. The chef never changes those steel spatulas, so during the chicken fried rice cooking process, he cuts the raw chicken up on the grill and then leaves it there and then immediately heads over to the rice and stirs it up with those same thongs. He goes back and forth between raw and rice and even gets those things into some veggies. So in theory, all of the chicken fried rice should be poisoned and yet somehow I have never gotten sick. For years, we are taught to keep the raw and everything else separate. We finally found the exception. OH yeah, this was a free birthday meal. Go to Benihana website and join free birthday club. You get a $30 certificate and if you order Fried Rice and Hibachi Chicke, you will pay $3.40 for full meal."}
{"text":"The restaurant is still a fun destination for family events, birthdays, etc.   The food is pricey (about $25 a person) not including drinks,  but the portions are reasonably large.  Overall the  food on its own is a little bland tasting, but sauces are provided to experiment with."}
{"text":"It was pretty good and seemed like a real Japanese guy with his sharp knives and tricks! The food did wow me, although it was pretty good and fairly entertaining.  It was way better than San Diego's Benihana..."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for family dinner. It's easy to access from the strip, or the mall. If driving, park in the Macy's parking garage next to the entrance where the escalators are. Make sure to make a reservation since they are always pretty busy. The food is always great here."}
{"text":"After 20 mins of waiting we received our soup and salad before our drinks. Food was good but the fry rice was a little under cooked.  I wont be coming back because that service was extremely horrible. I didnt even received my birthday picture nor did they sing to me :-( I also want to add how our waitress was so concerned about getting a tip from the table in front of us that she would ignore us. I asked for water then I heard someone say coke so I asked her do you have coke products and she said no only Pepsi so I said okay am fine with water. Of course she brings me a pepsi. I believe they should have some younger people working there that also understand english."}
{"text":"This place treats everyone like they are a tourist. It was not that great. Just like Las Vegas in general. If you do not like your job then just quit. Its simple."}
{"text":"we went because it was in the hotel, and we didn't want to stand in the taxi line to go somewhere.  i love benihana in general.  it was good, but not the best.  fried rice wasn't as good as at most of them.  everything else was good.  soup here was better than at any other benihana i've been to."}
{"text":"This was our first and last time here. We made reservations. We had to wait fifteen min to be seated. Another 20 for drinks. We were there for tapoyaki. There was children running and screaming between the table.  My favorite part of dinner was the soup. The salad dressing was gross. Almost looked half frozen So I didn't touch it. The sauces were not good and very watery.  The fried rice was not flavorful. The shrimp was good. The calamari was over cooked and chewy. The chicken was so over done even the sauce didn't help it.  Also didn't eat it.  The onions were undercooked."}
{"text":"Benihanas is one of my favorite restaurants but this location is dirty & the people there are not welcoming. The waitress refilled our sprite and coke glasses with water and gave us attitude when we brought it to her attention??? My purse was stolen from my chair and they refused to help us saying they only had working cameras in certain parts of the restaurant. Unfortunately not where we were seated.  Don't waste your money or time. You will be disappointed! The casino was a joke as well and WILL NOT let you review video footage either. Cameras are only there for when people steal from them! How convenient!!"}
{"text":"Place is nice but what really did it for me to dislike this place was they only had one waitress for two tables, so she was working her best to serve us all but it just wasn't going good at all.  also i noticed that it was more pricey than my local Benihana's. we were all waiting a long time for everything. don't recommend it & don't think I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"im giong to say this right up front - i am not a sushi person. i don't *not* like sushi, and (this sounds ridiculous) but the mean reason i don't eat more of it is because i *hate* trying to jam giant rolls that are just slightly bigger than my mouth into it, and try to tactfully chew around seaweed and rice that i feel i could choke on any minute.  plus. it really bothers me when people say they *love* sushi and then order a bunch of cream cheese filled crap (with a pink \"martini\" on the side). however, im not adventurous enough to just order the more traditional stuff because i have no idea what it is, how it tastes or what i would even like. however, when my boss wanted to stop for some on the way back to an event, i trusted his taste (and was not starving) so i told him to order whatever he liked and i would try anything at least once.  he is def a sushi person, and for a beni hana (i was always under the impression that this place has a ...silly? cliche?... reputation, he said this particular location served great sushi. he explained that the sushi chefs at the bar are always there, every night he comes (which is a lot) and the raw fish is pretty good for being vegas and all. we trried ahi, yellowtail and salmon. i was stoked to see they came out as simply cuts of raw fish - no cream chesse in sight. and was even more stoked that i liked it!  the service was great, and the restaurant itself is pretty impressive. located right in the hotel, you enter into an entirely new realm where the lighting is dark and there is flowing streams of water, bridges, a rainfall stream falling from the ceiling and bamboo. definitley an experience type setting. i would go back, or maybe even try a benihana in phoenix - now that i know what to order!"}
{"text":"Excellent manager that is super friendly, she should should be promoted to CEO!  Great birthday 30 dollar gift credit!  Beautiful decor!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed!!  The service was very slow. It took them 45 minutes to start the meal.  By the time I was served, most of my food was cold. I'm sorry but I can't recommend this restaurant. And the price of the meal was very high.  The only nice thing I can say is they did have my favorite wine."}
{"text":"As always, make a reservation!  We loved the interior design, it was all very clean and you really feel like youre in Japan!  This was our first time so I'll explain how it works, you sit at a table with the grill built in, theres 8 seats in total, so if you less than 8 in your party you will be sharing the table with strangers. That can be make or break for your experience right there, if the people at your table are rude that will totally suck. Our table group wasn't lively at all, so it was kinda a downer but no the fault of Benihana. You order your food and appetizers from your waiter, all entrees are cooked to order right in front of you. It takes a good amount of time from ordering to actually eating so be prepared for that. We had Mike as our chef and he was really awesome. They make jokes and do tons of tricks. The average plate is between $25-$50. So you can leave spending only around $70 if you want.   Our waiter was really good to until the end of the night,as you eat you food the other partys finish and pay, and if they don't get dessert you'll be the last ones there. Unfortunately I think the other parties didn't tip very well, cause our waiters attitude changed as soon as they had left. It kind of sucked that he has such an attitude while me and my girlfriend had our tea and ice cream. But I still feel the experience was worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, kinda confused . . . Start from the beginning, sat at the sushi bar, cause teppan had a long wait. Promptly greeted by waitress and placed a drink order. I was ready to order from the sushi chef, but he never acknowledged me or looked my way. The waitress took my full order and went from there. Received my sashimi combo and was quite pleased by the quantity, freshness and presentation. Now the confusion, I was ready to pay with some gift cards, but was told they couldn't be applied to the bill because they're not really part of Benihana per say. . . ? Huh? Just the trepan is. Huh? I've been to other Benihanas and the sushi bar is part of the restaurant. The sushi chef and the waitress both began to apologize and explain the situation, which I did understand, but still bummed I couldn't use $75 of gift cards. Good meal and service, wanted to spend that $75 on the tables . . ."}
{"text":"This is my second time dining at this location. The teppan chef was ok. I was a little disappointed considering I took my 4 year old son for the \"entertainment\", but received the minimal performance. The server and food were excellent."}
{"text":"Very slow service took one hour after seated to get chef and place was mostly empty.  Food quality was poor and I ordered most expensive lobster and filet combo!  Chef did zero entertaining such as the fire volcano.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My best friend loves this restaurant and at her urging, we made a reservation.  The food was good, the \"show\" was fun and the drinks were tasty.    Ultimately though, it's just not my thing."}
{"text":"For the interest of keeping this review short and sweet, I'm going to assume that most of the readers have been to Benihana at some other location before. You know the basic drill. We came here for a post-SEMA dinner and I was with a bunch of friends from Los Angeles. I've never been to this location, which is inside the Westgate Hotel. The moment I walked in, I was amazed how fancy and huge this place was! A two-story Benihana? Crazy. And the decor was very nice. Little asian bridges, and everything. I was thinking, this must be the biggest Benihana ever, and sure enough, the hostess mentioned that this is, in fact, the largest one in the world. Not only did I think this location was visually impressive, I truly believe that the cooks here were a notch above other locations I've visited. These guys were on their game. They were moving faster, swinging their tools like ninjas, and I had a good time watching the preparation, even though I knew what to expect. And of course the food was excellent. My only complaint was that it took forever to get started with our meal for some reason. The soup and salad portion of our meal lasted so long before our chef came out and started with the main course. Oh, and another very minor complaint...  the crew didn't sing happy birthday to one of our group members when they brought out the birthday ice cream scoop. Otherwise, fantastic. If you can, you should try this place once.  Just one point... even though this is a Japanese-themed restaurant, that doesn't mean you should try to get cute and add -san to everyone's name unless you're speaking Japanese. For some reason, a lot of people were doing that when we went, and it was contagious. Drove me nuts. Anyways, it's hard to have a bad time at any Benihanas so enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the wait is excruciating. One delay after another. Making reservations does not help. Our waiter hinted at wanting extra $ on top of the automatic 18% service charge for our party, which is funny considering how long we had to wait throughout this whole evening. The reviews here are on target."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Chandler location and it was amazing! The chef Michael was awesome and really added special touches we had not seen before. The best part of the evening, aside from the delicious food, was our server Ryan. It doesn't do it justice to say Ryan was so much fun and had us laughing the entire time! I will ask for him the next time we are in town. Awesome night!"}
{"text":"Being generous I give them one star...  Decor is to die for... and the rubber like consistency of the over salted calamari will bounce ya right back to semi-consciousness only to yet be knocked back down by a chef trying to flip greasy shrimp tails into everyone's plates.  Oops... sorry it splashed down in your $20.00 watered down drink.  Waitress was clearly upset when I asked if onion soup had a meat base as she needed to go ask. *FWIW - It has pork, chicken and MSG.  Food was way overpriced and far from gourmet and very small portions.  Lesson learned is to stick with Makino's dependability on great food at a very fair price and you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Staff was nice and service was fine. The food was not good. I barely ate anything besides my green tea ice cream, which was the best part of the meal.  I was so distracted by the disgusting smell that I lost my appetite. When I first walked in it smelled like an Applebee's or Village Inn. After being seated, all I could smell was frying oil. So gross. Drove as fast as I could home to jump in the shower. I took a whiff if my clothes before throwing them in the wash. I gagged. No lie."}
{"text":"Terrible place we walked in waited 20 minutes for someone to address U.S. and welcome us, yet no one even came and the person at the front desk just sat there and then answered the phone. We waited ten more minutes and still nothing he was very obnoxious and we didn't even get welcomed or sat at a table. This is the worst experience I have ever gotten anywhere and I do not recommend coming here unless you want a dude server that doesn't address you. I wish I could give this place 0 stars."}
{"text":"Great as always.  The best fried rice I have ever had!  Ask for Chef Weak Sauce aka Marv, he was awesome."}
{"text":"OMG..30years of going to Benihanas and this was the worst. Decided not to do Tepanyaki because the booths are a little cozier and the food is the same.. Had to call the waitress to take our order and wait for drinks..Salad and soup arrived at the same time. No dressing on the salad. Had to call her over again for salad dressing. Food came out FINALLY and we had no ginger sauce or mustard sauce AND NO rice. By the time we got sauce our food was stone cold. Asked for a manager and the only thing he offered was to remake our food..This is Vegas and I have things to do other than wait another 20 minutes for a hot meal..The manager said he was sorry and said he would give me a discount..HMMM..We paid $40 a meal and he took the price of the drinks off  A whole $14 dollars off"}
{"text":"Please request Tony, he will prepare your food to perfection and he is hilarious ! We had a great time and the food was perfect !!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for 35 years.  It's had good times and bad times, but with the recent change in management, it has descended to a new nadir.  The ambiance no longer has even a touch of Asian flavor to it.  Nor, frankly, does the food. The sauces, once their claim to fame, have been diluted with too much mayonaisse and soy sauce.  The cooking was adequate, but nothing special.    The server we had kept trying to do juggling tricks with his utensils, and kept dropping them.   I hate to write off a place I've been visiting since 1979, but that's what I'll be doing.  A great pity."}
{"text":"Pros, food was great with a very attentive chef. Cons, parking and locating benihana almost ruined the evening, decor feels like a cafeteria. I would probably go to the other location next time."}
{"text":"With a reservation at 7:30pm for a party of 8, we were not seated until 7:53pm. The host was super rude the entire time, rolling her eyes at every customer. The chef was excellent and his show was very plesent. But the food was disgusting."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Ambiance is nice. The chef did his thang, and was very professional.  FYI: If it's your birthday, don't forget to bring a coupon for the free dessert. If you don't, they will only recognize the people who brought a coupon, and leave you out (even if you let them know it's your birthday).  ****UPDATE**** After everyone received their bill, and was about to leave, I guess the waitress felt bad, and brought me a free dessert."}
{"text":"Free meal on my birthday. Nothing I love more than birthday freebies. The service was good. At these places, I prefer when I know everyone at our table, makes it more fun, but we still had a good time. They even took our picture and printed it out as a momento. Food was solid too. Most of it tastes better with sauces, though."}
{"text":"We love sushi and wanted something close to home so we came here. We came here in the evening and it was pretty empty which we loved. We were seated right away and chris was our server.  We had chicken and rice with a couple sushi rolls. Everything was good and warm. Plenty of food and nothing different than you'd expect. The food was good and there was plenty of it. Nothing really will wow you but you will be satisfied.  We would come here again because we didn't have any issues and it's close to where we live. If you are hungry for decent sushi or hibachi, this should be a good stop for you."}
{"text":"Benihana's has been a staple of Vegas for decades and my wife and I have eaten there on occasion and always had a good experience. This time was much, much different. Each portion of our hibachi meal was extremely disappointing to us both. We had the hibachi steak. The onion soup was luke  warm at best and tasted old. The ginger dressing salad tasted wrong. Our fried rice was simply OK, the same with our steaks. All in all, a poor, overly priced dinner. We will not be returning. We've eaten at the Ohjah hibachi restaurants in town and found a much better quality hibachi style dinner at half the cost."}
{"text":"This place cost a grip. The food was ACTUALLY good; I'd been to other Benihanas in the past, and the food was always so-so. This place was an exception. Its good if you have money to spend (or someone else is buying.) My brother and I split the lobster and steak combo. Pretty rad stuff, but too pricey. They also charged us a ten dollar fee for splitting the dish. Eep."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Benihara. I have mixed feelings about this place. My Chef Wu (I hope that's how you spell it) was delightful. He sure has us \"whoo-ing\" the whole time. Okay bad pun aside, he had a great humor and was very considerate to our needs. I didn't even mind that the manager rushed him to finished with my party faster so he could move on to the next table.  But the service, oh the service was not on par at all. From the moment we walked in the front desk was confusing and a bit condescending. Maybe we just had trouble understanding each other but after I made my reservation for later that evening I walked away confused. I didn't know if they wrote down my reservation, and thought I was merely asking what time dinner started. I returned an hour and a half later to re-verify my reservation. They indeed had it written down, but wrote me for a party of 5 instead of my requested 8.  Overall I don't think I'd really return unless my friend was dieing to try this place out. From the variety of food I got (Beef steak, salmon steak, seafood noodle) it all tasted average, just like my previous visit."}
{"text":"Sachie was our server and AU was our cook. It was a fun and tasty experience. The service is great and very friendly, and our cook was hilarious.. made us laugh a lot while he was cooking our dinner. I recommend this place to everyone. Employees are friendly and welcoming. Sachie was also awesome, she gave us a little history of the restaurant. Food was excellent and cooked right in front of you."}
{"text":"The coolest Benihana that I have ever been to.  Feels very much like a village.  Servers barely speak English and got our drink orders wrong 85% of the time.  She made it seem like it was our fault.  That wouldn't stop me from going back though."}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good, but this time we weren't even served for over an hour despite having a reservation. A birthday ruined, so we just walked out after 90 min. we didn't even get appetizers after 75 minutes.  Review update: after a disastrous service 2 weeks ago, the Manager personally apologized and invited us back for my wifes birthday to make up for it. Our server today was top notch, fast, friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The food was outstanding and we couldnt ask for  more. So I changed my rating to 5 stars. It's worth going there if you enjoy the table cooking experience by a Japanese cook."}
{"text":"We had visited your establishment for a Birthday party on 10-26-17 with a party of 7. I just want to Thank You for the excellent service that was provided by our Chef ( Young) and our Server ( Amy) You guys rock !!!!! Both of you were extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu. Young did a fantastic job on the grill, I was blown away. Amy was always on point keeping our beverages filled and kept the tea going. Thank You again for a wonderful experience. We will return again. :))))"}
{"text":"Gawd damn it I love Benihana. Love the food, love watching people cook & love sitting with strangers. They send you a BOGO entree every year for your birthday if you sign up to receive it. Their Englewood, Co location needs a serious update & scrub down though  that's the reason for the 3 stars."}
{"text":"love this place,went here a couple of times for my birthday and my son's birthday and they did a great job singing in japanese and english.great food! i do prefer the asain chef there though, he seemed more alive in his cooking than the hispanic one.but still good food."}
{"text":"They don't answer phones! When they do, they hang up! Bad service & will not return in future!"}
{"text":"We were in  Vegas for my husband's birthday in January and we surprised him with dinner reservations at Benihaha.  It was a great experience.  The show was fun, people sitting around us were a blast, and the drinks were great pours! Wow, I was  happy after 1 \"Buddah\".  As always, the food was excellent.  We weren't thinking about the price because it was a special occasion."}
{"text":"We were on vacation recently and decided to have lunch, ate at the sushi bar, food was great, our server was always close by in case we needed anything, definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried to book a reservation for the past three weeks for my daughter-in-law's birthday (January 31st) and have been unsuccessful in doing so. We have tried a week in advance and they could not accommodate us. Spoke with a manager too. Not very helpful.  In response to Mr. Lee C. Yes we did try open table on numerous occasions too with no results. Fortunately, we finally got in."}
{"text":"I'll give this fucked up place 1 stanking ass star don't deserve that only for the 1 star because the floors are nice. Where should I began food trash ass can oscar the muthafuckin trash can. Service was okay she was cool but a little forgetful. Are cook was hmmmmm let me see got his cooking skills out of Oscars the grouch trash can have this dude ever heard of seasoning salt nope will I be back hell no Jesus couldn't even bless this food tip of the day save your cash"}
{"text":"Great food with a flashy display. We had a great cook who was funny. The time it takes to get a cook and receive service can take a while though... But if you have time to wait, then it's worth it."}
{"text":"We usually try to stop here a few times a year on our trips. We have never been disappointed until this last trip. Thankfully the bartender Eduardo, the food and our cook Antonio were wonderful However the server Nancy was rude, short and acted like we were imposing on her.  I did speak to the manager to let him know that the rest of his staff was wonderful and hope that next time is a better experience."}
{"text":"It all depends on the chef who is performing for you . I have been here twice in last several months and felt everything was average . I have seen other chefs in different restaurants and they have put on a much better show ."}
{"text":"Spent Christmas \"08\" here for dinner , The food was good but not great.  and overpriced, you are paying for the atmosphere. I had the Filet and it was overcooked and a little dry. Didn't want to make a fuss on christmas. [ Also the cook was holding a knife].hehe"}
{"text":"We were seated pretty slowly here. The hostess wasn't very friendly or welcoming. But  that didn't stop me from looking forward to having a  great meal! I was a determined soul to have a fun anniversary dinner. We ordered our drinks and appetizer.  The appetizer was beef pot stickers. They were really good! Which was perfect while we were waiting for the chef to set up. Which is not s quick process.  A very nice family was also seated at our table. Also celebrating a anniversary.    The chef Roberto was so entertaining and  fun. He was excellent! He started with a fried chicken rice. That was delicious.  I ordered scallops and steak. My husband ordered steak and shrimp.  My scallops were delicious! And steak was also very good.  My husband said his choice was delicious,  everything was delicious! I agree! During the meal the manager came by and sang Let it go! Which was funny! Thank you for making our night! Our waitress also took a picture of us and gave it to us before we left.  Overall slow start, but it was fun and delicious! . I'd like to go back and try their sushi. They have a cute sushi area by the entrance."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go here one night because we had never been to the Hilton in Vegas, since we usually hit the newer Casinos every time we were in town. I had a thought that Benihana was cheesy and kinda silly, but actually it was really fun, we talked to other people seated with us and our chef had some great jokes and the presentation was great...  it wasn't as pricey as the trendy places I had usually been to in Vegas and we had a great time...  I still remember the guy next to me was a potato salesman from Idaho.. I mean, he contracted with restaurants to sell mass potatoes..  ha ha..  I love to meet people, so this was a good experience.. very fun..and the sake was yummy..."}
{"text":"WORST service ever. Called in to make a reservation and the host put us on hold for 10 minutes than once they got back on the phone they said that they can't accommodate us then hung up on me?! Seriously!!! Who hangs up on a parry of 10 people! Don't recommend going here!!!!"}
{"text":"So although I used to live in a condo just a few hundred yards away from fashion show mall, I never even realized Benihana was inside.  I stumbled across it on memorial day weekend when I stayed at the Encore across the street. I ate there for lunch at the semi-outdoor bar seating and then decided to go back a week later and sit inside at a grill. So I have to write this review for both.   As you may notice in many of my reviews, I often look for 'cleaner' food options. Benihana is a great place to get a macro nutrient friendly, nutrient dense meal. They provide the macro nutrients their website and even the total calorie count for each dish on the menu. These are huge bonuses for me.  When I went for lunch, I had steak and chicken, brown rice and steamed veggies. I asked that they hold any extra oil. Oddly enough, my dish took about an extra three or four minutes to come out from the kitchen because of that request. So my cousins who were with me got their meals ahead of me. That was no big deal though. The meal was delicious, and something clean just like I would prepare at home except I got to be out enjoying with family.   Following week, I went with my wife and her coworkers. We got a grill seat and the chef did a really good job. I grew up going to Hibachi style restaurants because my parents were big fans of them. Although I was skeptical based on the readings, this was the best one I have ever been to. (Based on 5 or so different hibachi style businesses visited)   The service was excellent. The food was fresh and very very tasty. The environment at these type of restaurant is always really cool and it's conducive to socializing with friends and family over a meal.   One negative I would say was the sushi roll I got for the appetizer. Six pieces at that price were absolutely not worth it. And the sushi was really average.   But other than that I highly recommend you give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely torn about this review. Benihana here has every last thing I want from a teppanyaki restaurant with one exception and that one exception was heart-rending.  My friend and I were seated on a Saturday evening with no reservations and no wait. The menu? Full of good choices. Then I see it. Singapore Sling, right on the drink menu. They made it the right way. Considering what is actually in a Singapore Sling, that is painfully uncommon. So even before the show and food, I'm already pleased.  I order the spicy chicken and much to my surprise, it is properly spicy. There's no overcompensating flavorless spice, nor is it a sauce that has a faint hint of heat. It was as spicy as it should be. It was a case of mass market appeal done right. If you're wondering about the soup and salad beforehand, I skipped the salad and the soup was pretty good but really just the standard for teppanyaki restaurants.  Like Jose G, I had the pleasure of Tuan as chef. He kept up a stream of wisecracks and terrible puns that had everyone chuckling through the performance. Definitely has the comedic chef routine down well and he read his audience just right.  So, the drink is five stars, the food is five stars, the chef is five stars, what could possibly be so tragic as to mar this otherwise amazing experience? Getting a drink refill was irritatingly difficult. Only halfway through the meal did I manage to catch the waitress. I say catch as she was clearly about to pass right on by. I wouldn't say she was unfriendly, just sadly inattentive.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll almost certainly drop by here again even if I don't stay at the LVH. I'll just have to be extra vigilant about getting that second drink before I'm halfway done. I wish I had the opportunity for a second try before giving this review, just in case it was one streak of bad luck. I hate to hold back a star for something that in the grand scheme of dinner is not a huge deal, but I just don't find nearly enough places that can serve a proper Singapore Sling and being deprived of such for so long instills me with a sense of saudade and woe.  Seriously though. Tuan rocked that grill. If you think I enjoy loquacious diatribes, you haven't seen my love for horrid puns. I don't know if Benihana actually earned the fifth star, but Tuan did and he works there so they can show it off too."}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant has improved for the better! 5 stars! Last night we dined and had a great time. Grant was our server and Hiro was our cook! They both were amazing! Now I have dined with Benihana for 25 years and this was one of the best times we've had in years. Grant was super nice and really cared that we enjoyed our dining experience at his table. He has great customer service skills and not once was I trying to search for our waiter because he was very attentive to refilling drinks, getting plates out of the way, etc. He has a great attitude and would love to sit in his section again. Our cook was Hiro. He had some excellent tricks and impressed me and my family with them. He interacted with the entire table while cooking. Even though there was more than one group he made sure we all enjoyed his cooking and that no one was left out. Holy cow Benihana has some new chef tricks. Which are awesome and safe!!!! Hands down he is an excellent chef. He cooked everything perfect. Who seriously eats all their zucchini?! Yeah I did. Lol that's how amazing the food was. Even though i order the same thing every time I go. It was perfection! We had called in a little later for our reservation and they got us in at the time we wanted! The girl who answered the phone was so nice and patient while we tried to figure out what time to go. Every year for my birthday we come to Benihana and they make it special. I get sang to, ice cream, and the best part is the birthday picture. Now to some they might overlook this, bot not me.  we have years and years of birthday pictures from Benihana. So it's a tradition. But what's even better than a tradition? When you get great service and great food with it."}
{"text":"This is the granddaddy of Americanized hibachi joints! I've been here over five times now and have never been disappointed. If you've ever been to a hibachi place, you know the drill: chefs twirling knives, tossing shrimp to you, making volcanoes out of onions, the whole bit. There are two stories of hibachi stations which are seemingly always filled with people celebrating a birthday, wedding, or anniversary or business travelers staying in the hotel because it's adjoined to the convention center. It's a little on the pricey side with the cheapest entree being around $30 but I feel like that price point is to be expected for a celebration-type event. If this type of food/experience is your thing, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here for our 7 year anniversary and it was absolutely amazing ! Our waitress was very sweet and very attentive. Our chef Daniel was so hilarious and kept the table laughing. The food was absolutely amazing. We both got the steak and lobster tails with chicken fried rice holy moly !!!!! Food was fresh and seasoned perfectly. When we finished our dinner the waiters came to our table and sang their love song to us and brought us complimentary ice cream !!! They truly made our anniversary unforgettable. Thank you so much benihana !!!!!"}
{"text":"Good show, But NO SHRIMP SAUCE!! They have a \"mushroom sauce\"... very weird. We wouldn't have eaten here if we knew that... sigh.. food was DECENT --not our fix :("}
{"text":"Still waiting for chef to table..one hour, 15 min. Being told he's coming..hmm still waiting. Other tables waiting. Not enough chefs. I won't return. Too bad."}
{"text":"The experience would  have not been as great had we not had Tony as our grill master.  Awesome chef. Funny. Great entertainer. Made my first time to benihanas more than perfect. Definitely an asset to your establishment. A happy employee provides more than perfect service!"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. Made a reservation for 3 say there until 4 before chef showed up. Not once did a manager come over and acknowledge the table or offer an apology or discount.. now son and I are running to the bathroom. Horrible experience, never again go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This place was an utter disappointment compared to the ones I've been to in San Francisco & Dallas.  Wow.  The d√©cor is 5 stars alone.  It is simply breathtaking in here.  The waterfall, the two-story atmosphere, the feeling of being in a little Japanese village.  Superb.  I went here for my mom's birthday dinner last weekend.  My fianc√© and I were meeting up with them so I went to the podium and told them what the reservation should be under and the time.  It took 3 of them to search for several minutes before asking what the last name was.  I gave it, thinking it was odd to ask for that, and they said they didn't have a reservation but I could look around.  Uh, OK...  Mind you, my mother made a reservation several days ago.  Whatever.  They ended up being in the bar and then we checked in and waited to get sat, which was another several-minute process with several people.  Didn't know this was so intense.  Our chef, Tommy, was good.  Nice personality, chatty, funny.  The service was terrible, the food made my fianc√© and I sick for DAYS after (but at the time it was BARELY above-average tasting) and I probably would NOT go back for the outrageous prices alone.  Find another hibachi-type place, I'm sure they're out there."}
{"text":"So good! Made a reservation for 8 on a Sunday. We got there about an hour and a half early because we were really hungry and decided to take a chance. Luckily they were able to seat us early. The service was excellent. Food was delicious and plentiful. We got salmon, chicken, filet. That came with shrimp, lots of veggies, soup, salad, rice. The experience is nice for kids and families. The waitress wrote on the kids togo boxes in Japanese and spelled their names. Very cute touch and the kids really got a kick out of it.. I will come back here again when in the area."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my sister for My Mom's birthday. Our waitress was on her ish and had a lot of spunk and personality. I appreciate that these days...   The food was delicious and all of us ordered something different to all sample as one. I had Steak and Shrimp along with the Spicy Hibachi Chicken. My mom had colossal shrimp and my sister had the seaside trio.   It can get pricey if you just order what looks good w/o looking at its price, however sometimes you have to spend a little to EAT GOOD! lol.  The fried rice and our chefs vegetables also hit the spot ! Overall really impressive place to eat for a birthday or special occasion.  4 STARS"}
{"text":"This Benihana is located in side of the Westgate Resort. I have been to a lot of Benihana's around the country and this is by far my favorite one. It is themed beyond belief. It looks as if you are in a small Japanese Village. The food is always amazing at Benihana. If you enjoy Japanese steakhouses this is a must see when you visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my boyfriend took me to Benihanas for the first time and we had a good time. Our chef, Kevin was so entertaining and funny! We loved him and plan on coming back with my family and requesting him as our chef! Thumbs up to this place!!"}
{"text":"Tim did a great job as chef. Food was great! Don't know how it could have been better!"}
{"text":"It been while since had teppanyaki style but only have good memories the few times I have gone. I went with my family too celebrate my nieces birthday. They still do the whole birthday that you get free ice cream comes with candle, you get extra attention from the chef being star or sometimes have multi stars since fill each table (since in all have six people in our group had whole table too ourselves), and kids still give you the benihana hat. I always remember so nice knowing that certain things about Benihana always the same. They give you free birthday pic with your group.  Our teppanyaki chef was very funny and my nieces enjoyed the show. It always adds another element having dinner teppanyaki style. The food was good. I had the hibachi spicy chicken that was good. It not over spicy but had nice kick too it. I also had a spicy tuna roll start my meal. Good. Sushi Benihana mot one of those places would recommend but since there had sushi itch like why not. It was good. The menu is pretty diverse from steaks, chicken, and seafood. The drinks menu is pretty diverse too.   In all would say if want mix it up one night almost free entertainment with the teppanyaki chef and good food. Benihana great choice!"}
{"text":"We didn't have a chance to eat. Our party was 8 people but 3 was going to arrive later. They seat us in a table for 5 and said that the table for the other 3 will be arrange when they arrived. We been working all day long on the trade show and some people will come straight from there and eat. We was going to order food for a lot of people and also take away. Horrible service. Horrible hostesses super rude. Made us wait for 30 minutes for later tell us we was not going to be seated. Anyways. Price and I can't tell anything about the food. Never got a chance to eat."}
{"text":"I typically love these places.  I ordered lunch to go, the restaurant took a while to run my gift card, then after waiting for 15 minutes, and having 3 people say my card had $0 balance the original associate says it just took a while for it to run, then they gave me my order which was incorrect.  I asked for a shrimp tempora roll, and they gave me shrimp tempora.  It's understandable how an error can occur...but then it took more time for the correction to be made and my bill wasn't corrected to the lower price, as the roll costs less.  Then I asked if the roll should come with eel sauce (as it does in every other restaurant) and I was just told no.  The service was just lacking...and again I've been there before and really enjoyed it...maybe its a place that you can sit down and eat, but I will never order out again."}
{"text":"It was our last night in town, we drove 20 minutes to get to this place. Made a reservation for 8:45pm , the hostess mentioned the manager would not allow her to seat anyone. Finally got seated at 9:20. Sat around for maybe 5 more minutes. The host was kind enough to bring me water. Never met our waiter or cook. It was my first visit to Benihanas and it was very disappointing. No stars."}
{"text":"Today was my friends 20th birthday. Me and 3 other girls came and we all make decent money, however the bill at Benni Hanna is on average 50-60 per person. The waitress flat out ignored most of the people at the table. I said I didn't want a drink she brought me water. I set it on the corner of the table so they would take it away. They come back and ask if I ordered a drink, so I asked if they have dr pepper, no, so I said nothing. She brings a coke and I said I don't want this. I wasn't going to pay for things I didn't ask for. I asked for the tempura shrimp app, she argued about it with me and kept telling me it wasn't apart of the meal, I kept telling her I know. They bring it out and I paid $13 for 2 pieces of shrimp and then vegetable tempura which I didn't want. I said specifically I didn't want any of the appetizers but they still tried to give me the soup and salad and the vegetables. They gave me such a small portion of chicken. And the waitress blatantly ignored the dirty glasses Etc on our table. The waitress didn't even break my change and apparently expected me to tip her in 10's and 20's. I barely tipped her. I spend $60 on a mediocre meal with awful service. Even the other two couples at our table seemed upset. One of the men flat out didn't eat his food and pushed it away with the napkin on top. My friend had a really bad birthday and we will never go to any Benni Hanna again."}
{"text":"Mediocre. And this restaurant really needs a good cleaning. Carpet dirty, bathrooms really needed attention and are not nice. They needed attention in every way. The tables even had a greasy film. I had hibachi chicken and it was excellent.  The vegetables were not edible. the first batch of fried rice had absolutely no eggs or vegetables in it. Waitress was awesomeshe went and had it remade and it was super good when It came back out. tempera and other sushi rolls were really good. But it just is it somewhere I would ever go again especially at that cost."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Benni.  Walking into the restaurant it is totally themed with a bridge and rainfall. The food and flavors are consistent.  The servers are sweet and attentive.  The lady that served us did some magic tricks for the kids. It was cute and entertaining.  I will never get sick of the onion volcanos!   I order rib eye because of the fat.  I always make sure my chef keeps the fat to cook for me.  Extra butter on everything yumm!!!  Green tea ice cream!   I even think that the fake fireworks are super cool."}
{"text":"The whole experience was over 3 hours! Service was horrendous. Was charged for items that we ordered and never received. Definitely understaffed!!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, Benihana has always been one of my favorite restaurants. I've been to so many locations in 3 different states (CO, CA, AZ)   Tonight's experience was extra special because of the waiter, Michael and chef, Colton. Michael was very attentive and polite, there were 2 kids at our tables around 10-12 years old and he had the perfect attitude for them! Nobody was ever without a drink and he went to each male at our table when we were eating and very politely and quietly asked if our parties were satisfied. He was raised to respect women and it was very obvious.   Colton was amazing! So many reviews about it not being a show and I've been to some Benihana where all you see is a beating heart of rice and an onion volcano. Not with Colton, he incorporated a show with everything he put onto the grill. A personal favorite, \"who ordered the egg roll\" as he rolled the egg off his tool onto the table. I'm sure he was a little extra for the kids but he had me giggling the whole time.   I've always been one to recommend Benihana but I would recommend this dynamic duo as well. Thank you for making our date night perfect Michael & Colton."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly at our reservation time. The server greeted us and took a drink order. We started with water as we had already had drinks from bar from our early arrival.  We placed food order and served did not come back for an extended time period although my wife wanted another cocktail.  The chef, Toshi was very entertaining and the food was fantastic. When it was time for the bill we had an extra drink on it that we never ordered. The server apologized and removed it."}
{"text":"I used to go to Benihana quite a few years ago and it was way better it seems like they kind of just gave up on a few things. The food is ok,  nothing special a bit bland, the drinks had virtually no alcohol in them I had three Mai Tai's and not even the slightest little buzz my girlfriend had their house drink and again no alcohol.      The main reason people come to this place is to be entertained while they eat well the last couple chefs seemed like they couldn't stand being there they had bad attitudes and did nothing special at all their favorite thing to do is pour salt on everything and say high sodium low sodium, there was no flipping of food or tossing of utensils that you would expect from a place like this. They all had little train whistles our guy was so lazy he didn't even pull his out he just tapped his spatula on the grill and said Choo Choo. Hope you don't sit next to a loud drunk tourist spewing profanity and making a scene because the staff will do nothing about it.     The only reason this review is not a 1 is because it really is a nice place and was the best in vegas at what they do and if you're not stuck next to screaming throwing up people it's not so bad, the atmosphere is really cool and if they stepped the chefs game up a bit it could be a really great restaurant again."}
{"text":"They lost me as a customer. The Las Vegas restaurant has lost it charm. My husband asked for a blended margarita and they brought it on the rocks. We said that was not what we ordered and the waiter said they don't make blended margaritas. It would have been helpful to know before hand.  Then my husband said he wanted chicken fried rice instead of regular fried rice and the waiter said its $8 and only ordered as a side. Wait what?! Ok. Then I ordered fried rice for my meal and he said it'll be $8, I told him I don't want chicken he said its $8 anyway. You get steamed rice that's only choice he said it used to be $1.50 to up charge to upgrade. They increased it X7! That's outrageous. I cancelled and ordered Salmon roll instead because I felt taken advantage of. My husband ordered his 5 course chicken meal  It was ok, my salmon roll tasted like mayo and cream cheese roll. Little bit of salmon, $16 for this . I would expect more salmon. Won't be returning. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I love Benihana just for the fact that its not your typical dinner. When we go for dinner we always sit at the teppanyaki tables and then sit back and enjoy the show. Now while some of the chefs are better than others they are all pretty good in my book. Make sure you upgrade to the chicken fried rice its well worth the $3 extra. Every month they have a different special for two and its usually a good deal. This last time we went it was the chicken and steak for two and it was tasty. Make sure to ask for garlic butter on your entree if you like garlic because in my book it makes everything taste better. Overall we enjoy going to Benihana but not too often because it can get expensive quick lol... be sure to sign up for their email club and they will send you a $30 gift certificate for your birthday!"}
{"text":"We went for a birthday. Being a local, We usually go to the Benihana at Westgate (the old Hilton) and love it but thought we would try the new one at fashion show mall. HUGE MISTAKE! First of all it is very cramped. It must have been at least 90 degrees inside the restaurant. Service was extremely slow. We waited an hour before we had a chef come to our table. I ended up not eating my main course (lobster) it was horrible  over cooked and no flavor. We will definitely be sticking to the other Benihana at westgate. Much better service and food."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour menu!   Good selection!  1/2 off sushi!  My wife and I split a huge tropical drink (I forget the name of it) that was blue and then we filled up on sushi.   We got out of there for less than $35.  We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"No. NO. Run, don't walk, AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  I went there on a random weekday night for a birthday dinner (not mine, thank God). First off just getting into the place was a trial. The \"front\" entrance shares property with a high-rise condominium building, so if you can find your way in, all of the parking at the front is permit-only, and the \"back\" entrance is a super-steep road that leaves you thinking, \"Oh shit, am I going to get trapped in some random dead-end\" right until you hit the crest of an ugly parking lot with broke-down asphalt. Also, the front doors face the back, so it shares a wall with its dumpsters, which is just weird and not appetizing.   When I got there I had to fight my way through a group of people at the front doors smoking (seriously, in 2017). Stepping into the restaurant, the first thing I was hit with was a thick, greasy haze in the air. It was smokier inside than out, and for a moment I had a flashback to the '80s, when smoking was still allowed inside the restaurant. Clearly they just have really crappy fryer vents that probably haven't been updated since the '80s. I started looking around for windows, desperate to crack one. I would have left if I hadn't been there with other people.  I LEGITIMATELY HAD TO GO HOME AND TAKE A SHOWER AFTERWARDS. That's how gross it was.  So we're sitting there, bathing in the greasy air, sharing a table with a bunch of other random people, like you usually do at hibachi places. The people that work at this run-down Benihana were an interesting mix. Our waitress had a deadpan nasal tone and while she was perfectly nice, I half-expected her to snap her gum in my face and ask if \"that was all I needed, sugar.\" Honestly, I would have appreciated her more at a diner where I was only paying $10 for a milkshake and a burger. Ditto for the \"hibachi chef\" who did an acceptable, perfunctory job of cooking everything up. He looked and acted like a short-order cook they'd pulled out of the back in a pinch.  The whole menu is essentially a rip-off. There are 20 or 30 different menu items, and they have exotic names like \"Treasure of the Ocean\" or \"Benihana Special Delight\" but it's ridiculous because they are all the SAME. EXACT. THING. It's just different meats mixed together in random combinations and then seared in front of you to eventually make what looks like a stirfry on your plate. Yes, that's right, ONE BASIC STIRFRY is just about the whole menu. They have two different \"dipping sauces\" - one mayo-based for poultry and beef and one ginger-based for seafood - and that's it. For the price I was paying, I might as well have gone to a local Chinese restaurant, where they actually have a slew of 5 or 6 basic sauces in the back and can make a real stirfry.  Oh, and the menu makes a big deal about the \"5-course\" or \"6-course\" meals. The \"courses\" start with a tiny bowl of light broth and a tiny bowl of shredded iceberg salad, which is pretty standard when you go out to eat at a sushi place. Then the other \"courses \"are a random bit of shrimp that they fry up for you at the beginning of the hibachi grilling session (seriously, how is this a whole appetizer?) and then \"mushrooms.\" Literally just \"mushrooms\" is what the menu says. We eventually figured out that means they add mushrooms to your hibachi meal. Annoyingly, the waitress and cook kept asking if we wanted these \"courses\" added to our plates, like it was optional instead of standard. They also upcharge $3.40 for fried rice, and $3.80 for noodles. Only white rice is included.  Oh, and then the \"courses\" are capped off by a terrible dessert dish of something frozen they called ice cream. I could buy better ice cream from Breyer's at the grocery store. I honestly only ate the ice cream because I was so pissed at that point that I wanted to get my money's worth. The whole menu was literally like 1987 with 2017 pricing - and I want my $35 back.  The only reason there is more than one star is because the meats and veggies they served were of a good quality. When they are cooking everything right in front of you its easy to tell if beef or shrimp is low-quality, and that wasn't the case here.  Oh, and let me just say that when I left the restaurant, thankful to be gone, I took a wrong turn and found their additional lower parking lot.  Turns out the whole restaurant's foundation, because it's on a hillside, doesn't actually rest on the ground. Nope, the whole place is propped up on cement posts with parking underneath the place. I had to back my car up to get out from under there, and when I looked up I saw that the \"roof\" of the lot was an indoor dropped ceiling (office-style), with the rectangular plastic tiles peeling and dangling. I could not leave fast enough.  Honestly, they should just raze this place, sell it to the condominiums and turn it into additional parking for the residents. And that's the nicest thing I can think of to say about my experience at Benihana. Never again."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience. Not just a meal. What you are paying here is for the food, one on one with the chef and a close knit dinner with laughs, oohs and awes. The customer service was on point.   Reservation highly recommended   Food was fresh tasting. Cooked to perfection. Scallops, shrimp and lobster were mouthwatering in lemon and butter. It was cool to see all the food cooked right in front of you.   Onion soup was simple and had delicious broth. The salad was also simple but the dressing was thick and tasty. A different variation on French onion.The chicken breast and filet mignon were great! I love my filet mignon medium rare and it couldn't have been anymore mouthwatering. Melt in your mouth. Perfect portions. You won't over eat. Pricy but where else can you have your chef doing spins and tricks. Flipping shrimp tails and cracking thrown eggs?! Telling amazingly cheesy jokes that you can't get enough of. The drinks just kept coming and the food never stopped   Everyone should come here for the experience of hibachi if you've never experience it before because there's nothing else as personal and awesome as it"}
{"text":"We were expecting a 40 minute wait for dinner on New Years eve but only had to wait 5 minutes! And our serving chef, Daryl, was the best! He had his own routine and was so entertaining!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, new! Beautiful layout, excellent food and ambiance. Street-side at Fashion Show Mall, offers great sushi and Japanese dishes...onion soup is light, delicate, tasty...sushi is expertly done and lunch portion plates are quite filling; try a Lunch Duet with choices of two meats..I enjoyed scallops and filet mignon while Grace had scallops and chicken. Gotta typ it!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is this place needs to start selling the butter they use to cook everything. Extra butter on errythangg."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible experience beware!! Came on Memorial Day this place is definitely poor managed waited an hour then was seated then was told it would be another hour wait before food would be an additional hour or 2! Unbelievable very poorly managed"}
{"text":"The 5 star rating is based purely on their happy hour sushi menu.  We go and sit in the bar area and get the happy hour sushi.  It is so cheap and good.  Also great service.  I recommend the hand rolls and philly rolls.  I usually get 2 hand rolls and a philly, and it costs less than 10$ and is pretty filling! The fish tastes fresh and they use the best seaweed and rice.  Sometimes I will also get some nigri if I am extra hungry.  Best of all, dont forget the free hot green tea."}
{"text":"Great experience!! We had Chef Heath who was outstanding! He took the time to really season the food to perfection, awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"My server his name was Tony and he was wonderful this is my first time ever going to Benihana's and I loved it he made the experience great and I will come back just for him but I do have to say the food was amazing and I love every bit of it"}
{"text":"One star is too much. It was a terrible place for vegetarians.The waitress seemed like she didn't care much and was a terrible communicator. She forgot to bring my friends order out and we didn't realize we were getting two entrees.  Even though we were charged for these things we didnt get the soup or shrimp because they weren't vegetarian. The waitress wouldn't allow us to make any replacements for these meat-based items and when the food came out there were some sloppy vegetables and Ramen like noodles. I could have done better in my own kitchen. The scorpion fruit drink wasn't bad but after we found out that the drink and our two incomplete orders came to 97 dollars with added gratuity we wish we had stayed home. Don't let the fancy decor fool you, next time a friends asks you to go there for a birthday (since b-day meals are free) DONT GO!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this location and the service was terrible and it was a Friday night. The server messed up my order the cook slash chef was not entertaining and hardly spoke a word. My steak and Seafood combo was terrible and usually the food is good here but it has gone downhill along with management because I meant as you're never came by when I complained. My steak was chewy my lobster taste it off and was rubbery along with being tasteless my fried rice was not how it used to be back in Chicago there was no teriyaki sauce as to I requested. The sushi I ordered was a bit tainted tasting along with still being a bit Frozen and tasteless. I feel that I should get some kind of credit because I spent a lot of money here"}
{"text":"Food and chef were great but we sat at our table waiting for a chef for a ridiculous hour and fifteen minutes."}
{"text":"The only downside for me is how pricey it is. But I love teppanyaki and this is really the only good one around. My husband and I have been here a few times and always leave very satisfied. The food is incredible. I love the soup, salad, garlic fried rice, steak, veggies, and complementary shrimp that come with it. So good! The chefs are always so entertaining and different each time. I also had their 'Benihana Punch' (alcoholic fruity drink) and it was really good! We went on my birthday this last time and they always give you an ice cream dessert and take a picture of you and your family which they print out and give back to you. Such great service. Totally worth the money but wish it was cheaper so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"This was good.  The price is a little high, but you actually get a LOT to eat.  There were 6 of us and we all left stuffed.  I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Walked in and walked right back out.  I'm a long time customer who used to eat here 1-2 times a month but the hostess and management don't seem to care.  Tired of being treated poorly."}
{"text":"Meh. We have been here several times over the last few months. We have come both with our kids and without - we always sit in the lounge/sushi area even though we never order sushi and always order hibachi (those of you with small children can appreciate this). The food is just average and the portions are a bit on the small side for the price. I appreciate that they allow me to substitute my salad for extra soup. The service here can be a bit slow. I can consistently expect them to bring out my fried rice far before my entree...yep, my rice is always cold by the time my entree arrives. There can be quite a wait at times, especially at the grills- I suggest looking on Open Table for a reservation. Overall, I prefer my local Japanese steakhouse in my home town (not chain affiliated) but this hasn't and probably won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch and was Glad I did. Seated quickly. Ordered box lunch which consisted of 4 pieces of tuna (albacore and yellowfin), 4 California rolls, small salad, miso soup, a piece of teriyaki salmon, 2 shrimp tempura, 4 vegetable tempura, and rice! Wow!! Oh and edamame...ridiculous portion! Everything was really good. Salmon was cooked and portioned well. Teriyaki not bad. Shrimp good, well everything was surprisingly good and all for $10....that's right $10....the price for the portions and taste was deserving of 3.5 to 4 stars..service was also excellent..."}
{"text":"The manager and reception girl are rude , plus we've wait about 20 min and more!!!! No one ask us anything or tell us when we can have a table ..Me and my husband and two year son come on Monday around 4 pm and there is no rush at all empty tables still waiting .. the manger came to us yelling cause my son was walking around he got bored from waiting how you are a manger or owner treat customers like this.... i wish there is zero stars i wont be back and i wont recommend anyone to stop there. The girl kept looking at computer not give us any attention or tell us if they going to serve us or no...  so rude and bad customer service i never felt like this"}
{"text":"Oh Yeah. Free $30 on Benihana for my birthday now I'm living. Signup for their Chef's Table free program at Benihana.com and they'll email you a $30 certificate every bday. I highly recommend setting up a reservation ahead of time waiting could be a few hours.   Definitely love the decorations. There was a water feature but don't remember if it was a waterfall.  Also don't remember if there were koi fish but it really felt like there should be.  The dining experience was pretty cool, fun and entertaining. Went with the Teriyaki Steak Teppanyaki.  It comes with everything you need.  Started with a bowl of Benihana onion soup, it wasn't that bad but I was very hungry and savoring every bite of it. Next came the Benihana salad, it had a good taste but became watery towards the end of eating.    Once the chef came out I was happy because now the real food came out. He started with laying some zucchini and onions on the cooking area. When he starting building the onion volcano, it had my full attention.  When it was lit a small flame and smoke started, I thought \"boo. that was it\" but all of a sudden eruption \"kilauea!!!\" the table was engulfed with smoke.  Next he started making some shrimp apps showing off his lightning fast knife skills.  I almost cleared my plate as fast as he made them.  His flipping skill might need a little work.  He dropped the lime twice and missed his hat while tossing the shrimp ends away but still cool.   He then started making my Teriyaki Steak dish.  By that time I already forgot what I ordered.  There was steak and chicken cooking. Once he dropped the steak into my plate I started to eat.  Later he added mushrooms \"sweet it comes with mushrooms too\".  I then stopped and waited to see what else I was getting. Nothing else just the bowl of steam rice.   Overall a good experience and some good food.  I might have been short changed on some hot green tea that was also suppose to be served with my meal but its OK the free $30 covered it."}
{"text":"Dined here last night and enjoyed our meal very much. Charlie was a fantastic chef and very personable. Extremely affordable spot if you are looking for a nice meal and a lot of food."}
{"text":"I really like this place - so kitschy and old school 60's and 70's - the art of the cooking performance.  You can be guaranteed to hear the same jokes and see the same shtick every time - reliable and fun.  Eating here is a bit pricey for what you get, but always a good time."}
{"text":"This place was beautiful upon walking in and the food was absolutely amazing. The filet minon was so tender and juicy, and paired with the steak sauce it was to die for. However, the reason they only got 4 stars was because we had reservations for 7:30 and yet our chef didn't even come until 8:30. We waited an hour and actually had a couple leave because of the wait. The waitress was very unhelpful and forgot to get many things. The chef was great though and the food was amazing. I might come here again, but maybe not sometime too soon."}
{"text":"We were on vacation for my birthday and came here with my $30 birthday coupon. (if you haven't signed up for this, do it!)  We normally go to the one in Sacramento so this was a big change. The ambiance was so nice, with the plants and fountains. The one is Sacramento seems like a tiny whole in the wall in comparison.  Our chef was older but still more entertaining than the same grumpy guy we normally get back home. the food was excellent as always.  I do like their birthday dessert better (a ice cream sundae) but I wish they took a pic of you like they do at our place. Overall, a great birthday dinner and we met some nice people celebrating birthdays and anniversaries."}
{"text":"I was at the fashion show mall in Las Vegas this past weekend and received very disrespectful service by the manager at the time, Ralph. My party and I had reservations and had promptly arrived 5 minutes before our reservation but we're refused to be sat down until 100% of our party was there. We had 90% of the party but were just waiting on 1 last person but Ralph refused and threatened to take our name off the waitlist if they weren't there in the next 15 minutes.   I understand Las Vegas is a heavily populated city and there must be annoyingly drunk people to deal with all the time, but Ralph has no right to disrespect and reject our business as he did. Also, I heard him say behind my back that if I were to go back and ask to be seated without the last person he would take our name off and ask us to leave the restaurant and refuse our services completely. I believe, whoever is in charge of Ralph, should have a conversation with him and advise him not to be rude to his customers. I go to Bennihana in Anaheim often and have never recieved service this bad"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but frankly not as good as Kobe's which unfortunately, Vegas does not have any of.  However, the decor is spot on and themed perfectly with type of food served.  Hosts and cook were all very friendly.  A bit on the pricey side for what you get and for where the restaurant is but overall we had a very enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Brand new with the vents by the grill so you don't smell like smoke anymore. Great staff with Shay and our chef Aaron. Best service :)"}
{"text":"I've never been in a restaurant for nearly three hours and have come out hungrier than I went in.  Maybe it was what we ordered. I don't know. But we sat along time waiting for the cook to come out and start his show at the hot plate. By the time was all said and done food was getting cold some of the food was under cooked and others way over cooked. It's a fun concept but that's all it is. Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend last Saturday and I had an amazing chef, food was amazing, service (until the end) was great. Now let me explain. Throughout my time there, I overheard one of the employees (I'm guessing as she was cleaning up plates and going into the back a lot...she was a young Hispanic girl) speak about someone named Ralph who I'm guessing is another employee there. She was speaking in Spanish about how he's \"stupid and an asshole\" and trying to come with ways to get him fired. Now this is very unprofessional to hear while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. And then I go to the restroom and come back to see that my half eaten meal that i was still working on was cleared. I was sitting in the corner so i understand it could have been mistaken as it was pushed to the side needing to be cleared. However my boyfriend said he tried to tell her that I was still eating, says she looked at him like she didn't understand what he was saying and proceeded to take my plate. I will return, however this ridiculous. I asked my chef what her name is and he told me Marilyn. So Benihana, please try to do better than to hire young ladies like this."}
{"text":"Went with family and had a good time. Food was good and service was good. Our waitress was funny & helpful. Our chef was wonderful & entertaining. Great place to go with a group"}
{"text":"I took my fianc√©e to Benihana for her birthday. The food was yummy and the chef was entertaining. We made reservations but made last minute changes and they were very accommodating. I would not dine there very often because of the prices, but I will be there for special occasions."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice in food. I ordered the Tuna Steak. It seemed a little heavy on the rice wine vinegar, but it was cooked perfect and the rest of the meal was wonderful. Thanks to the chef, Ju, for a meal well made. Our waitress was on the spot with drinks. Overall this was a good experience."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and all of my appetizers were tasty and came out piping hot. We sat at the grill and had a pretty good dinner. Service was great."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered a lunch boat. Wow it was very tasty. Just the right amount of food. And  what a way to showcase the food. Love their sushi. We come frequently for dinner but will certainly return for lunch or appetizers in the bar."}
{"text":"Food and cooking show was ok.  This rest of this hotel & casino is run down or closed.  It looks like they are trying to turn it into condos or something.  Worst part was my wife ordered the decaf green tea on the menu.  The waiter apologized saying they don't have that anymore as the management wants all caffeine drinks to get people to stay and gamble longer.  No plans to go back ever."}
{"text":"By far the worst service I've experienced. It started by seating down and waiting approximately 10 minutes to be asked what I would like to drink. Then another 10 minutes for the drink to arrive. Once the drink arrived I figured I just place my order hoping that would cut down on the time. Well I was told to hold on,  Which I absolutely didn't and walked out without touching the drink.. Definitely not returning to this place..."}
{"text":"Probably got to be one of the worse experiences I've had in a long time. Went for a business dinner. Its was for a party of about 20 or so. For starters, drinks took about 45 minutes to get to the table. Food came out speratically.  And to top it off, my boss who was paying for this whole bill  never got his food. Worse customer  service I ever seen!!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my wife's birthday and the Benihana's staff made it extra special! The food was delicious! Tony the chef was fantastic! Highly recommend Benihanas at the Fashion Show Mall!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this one, did not disappoint. Will definitely come back next time in town. Chef told me the one in Westgate may close since it's franchise and this one is corporate. I'm okay with that...we went early so it was not crowded. Still recommend reservations for late lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"We had 10 family member for our granddaughter 13th birthday and had the worst experience ever at any restaurant dining experience at this Benihana restaurant in Chandler, Az.   We had reservations and was told if we didn't arrive early our reservation would be cane led.   We waited one hour after our reservation time to be seated.   Upon being seated, it took 30 minutes to get our orders for drinks.   Another 40 minutes before cook arrived at our table to prepare food.  Not only was the food flavorless and dry, it was terrible.  The cook was had no personally and was very boring during the preparation of the food.  In addition to poor service and very poor quality of food the manager / general manager wouldn't except the birthday coupon for our grand daughter and was exceptionally rude to us about the quality of service and food.  Three hours later we left needless to say very sad we made decision to dine at Benihana.  We will tell all our friends."}
{"text":"We took our daughter for her birthday to the Chandler location...the food was nothing to brag about, the chef was o.k., but not too entertaining...over priced for what it is.  We ordered the hibachi chicken and steak for two for $45.00, which came with soup, salad, shrimp, chicken fried rice and some veggies.  The soup, was a basic broth with a couple of fried onions and green onions thrown in...the salad was iceberg lettuce with some grape tomatoes, shredded carrot, shredded purple cabbage and a dressing that was a bit bland.  Then we watched the chef grill up some shrimp, it was fine but nothing fancy there.  The chicken fried rice was prepared first, I ate it when given to me so I could eat it hot.  Then the chicken and steak was cooked up, with only salt and pepper, so pretty bland there...we were also given grilled onions and zucchini, also bland...so I won't be going back...perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing, but it wasn't too exciting for the price."}
{"text":"Well the food was great but the experience was very unprofessional. Our waitress was working hard doing her thang when our fellow table diners decided to give her a hard time. After a discussion with the manager the other diners were able to figure things out. Well I felt that it was very unprofessional that the chef \"Kyle\" I believe was down talking his fellow coworkers to the guests at out table. To me this is very unprofessional especially since the girl was clearly having a bad time with this guest yet he decided to play on the blame game and get bad talk his coworkers. Horrible experience at this place. There should be no exception of talking bad about your coworkers to customers especially."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a Grown Up Date Night. Our Chef was great! He kept it interesting and is laughing. We drank, laughed, and ate so much so I feel like I'm going to burst! It's easy to get a $100 check here but for the good time it's ok.  The Chicken Fried Rice is always spot on with that Garlic Butter! Nam nam!   Would come back. I had a reservation and were sat within 10 min of arriving. Not bad. It was packed though so make sure you have a reservation!"}
{"text":"Very Good , love the dinner and the show theme, can't go wrong with Land and sea , fillet minion plus scallops.  Wanted the Misso but they gave onion soup! Still great"}
{"text":"Food was good. Chef was great. The location is hard to get to for someone with limited mobility. Which was our case."}
{"text":"This place is famous for a reason. Great food and friendly chefs. We went on a Saturday night without a reservation and only had to wait  about ten minutes for a table. Of course the saki is always tasty!"}
{"text":"So Im going to write this review with the hope that it will help Benihana turn things around at this location.   So Benihana has been a yearly birthday trip for me and my family for the past maybe 20 years I go for my Birthday is what I mean to say. We never use the discount birthday coupon or whatever they give us its not about the money its about the experience and it usually is very pleasant. At least in the Bay Area it was. I went to this Benihana earlier this month on the 5th and the food was good but the service was terrible. I mean like where did my server go ? Did they leave ? They basically took our order and didn't come back. The chef was nice and did a good job but this isn't some fast food joint where you can just go \"I guess you get what you pay for\" Its like $ 30 something a person and its supposed to be good. I left very unimpressed but again didn't think to write a review at the time.   Now this is absolutely 100% true. I drive for Lyft and in the last two weeks I have picked up 3 separate groups all leaving Benihana and they all said the same thing. \"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER\" I thought \"no way\" and asked about what happened. They all said the service was terrible and two of the the three said they tried to order food at the bar because the wait so so long and the Bartender just said \"I don't know what that is\" and just stared at them like they were crazy.  Like she did not even try to figure it out...Ok how about you learn the menu or something or ask someone. The older couple said they giggled and thought that she was joking but she wasn't.  Now the practice with Benihana is GET YOU IN...GET YOU OUT. It has always been like this even since I was in my teens. I get it... you gotta get the people who are blabbing and wasting time after dinner the heck out of there so they can seat the next group of people yada yada but to NOT take orders or not come back to the table and refill drinks is terrible. Its actually unacceptable to be honest and the fact that 3 different groups of people on different nights have the same bad experience means you are clearly not doing something right. Also all three asked to talk to the manager and either the manager didn't show up or sent the same terrible server back to the table to talk to the customers. Now I don't work in the restaurant business but even I know that is not how you handle an issue. Sorry for the drama but I do love this place as it made my birthday special for so many years and Im sure there are good locations around the country but THIS LOCATION needs a good shakeup.   Miss you Benihana hope you get well soon.   J.G."}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place five stars. It is a great experience with delicious food.   It cost my girlfriend and I about $100. Would I have paid that for the food alone? No. But the experience made it worth the money.   The chefs are hit or miss. We had a great chef, but as we looked around the room, some of the others were better. The atmosphere is one of the coolest I've seen in Vegas.   I definitely recommend the chateaubriand!!!! It was amazing!! I didn't try any seafood aside from the shrimp appetizer. That being said, be careful as they do cook seafood on the same surface as your food. I'm not sure if/how they accommodate allergies."}
{"text":"Benihana's @ the Hilton LV:  Saturday April 23, 2011 Four Stars  The Vegas Benihana's is located inside the Hilton Hotel.   The Tram stops at the Hilton which made it very convenient to get to.  $5 each way.  While we waited 30 minutes to get a table, we decided to get a couple of Beers at the bar, but the bartender moved like molasses on a cold winter day.  Entire quarter of Denver-Oklahoma game went on before we got our drinks.  The atmosphere of this place is great.  It actually feels like a little Japanese village.  We had to wait another 1 hour before the chef came to actually cook our food.  The food and the show were great.  Their house blend sake was delicious.  A great way of spending $60 over 3 hours."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Tried calling in a to go order of fried rice and a side salad at 8:00pm on a Thursday night - was told that the wait was going to be one hour. A one hour wait for two sides is crazy! The waitress on the phone told me that they already had ONE to go order so that is why it was going to take so long....."}
{"text":"The absolute WORST Benihana I have ever been to. The service was beyond the worst I have ever experienced at ANY restaurant.  If I could give zero stars I would. I love The Benihana chain but this one is by FAR the absolute pits.   I'm seven months pregnant, they decided to seat us in a section that was so close I could hardly move. There were other seats available but they were not offered. We waited for 30 mins for other parties to join our table and no one ever did. The waitress brought by 3 different people and none of them would sit. We, however we're never offered another table. When they finally did take our order, it wasn't exactly right. The only reason we stayed was because we promised our boys they could see the onion volcano. Steak wasn't cooked to our request, chicken was extremely dry. I could go on but it's not worth the characters. Our tab was close the $200, we could have gone to the grocery store and made our own meal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...one of my favorites.  Good food, but pricey.  Great fun for the whole family.  Located in LV Hilton.  Chefs are fun and entertaining, especially with kids or special occasions.  I would recommend when in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's a neat place. They're not that busy. I've been to a lot of hibachi place and I can say this place is just OK. The food is OK. They don't serve a lot compare to other hibachi places I've been to. Make sure that you eat during lunch time unless you want to pay a lot.i've paid 100+ for the two of us.   They serve a little slow and I felt like they're rushing us when I ate here.  I'll try the one in chandler as they do have a lot of positive review"}
{"text":"First I must disclose that I'm coming from a vegetarian stand point, and would have never chosen this restaurant if it was up to me.  This night, it wasn't up to me so I joined a group of 6 on a Friday night around 7pm.  It was packed and we had about a 20 minute wait.  We were sat with 2 strangers at the community table, which seemed kind of awkward.  As a vegetarian, I saw one large slab of grill? skillet? and could only think of meat juices touching my noodles.  Sure, I get it, my grilled cheese at another restaurant may be made on the same surface as a burger....but at least I don't have to see it!    Anywho, my edamame and noodles were tasty for what they were.  The service was pretty attentive and the cook was somewhat engaging (could've been better).    Overall, it just wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I love Benihana. We went for my birthday and first they said it would be a while to get us a table. 5 min later we were sitted. our chef was excellent! We had my 1 year old with us and even she had fun during dinner. the food was fantastic as alwayas and I got complementary ice cream."}
{"text":"So, our reservation was for 6:00 pm.  We were not seated until 6:15 pm and that really is not a big deal, however, we did not see any drinks until almost 7 pm.  Our food order was taken about 7:10 pm.  I sat and watched my tiny little yellowtail roll die in the window for almost 30 minutes while the waiter was missing in action.  He would disappear for a minimum of 15 minutes at a time.  The soup and salad finally came.  The soup was barely luke warm.  It was so full of fried onion strips that I could not force it down.  The broth was very bland and the mushrooms were raw due to the cold temperature. The salad dressing was terrible, as well.  It was like cold shredded ginger root with a dash of sugar and vinegar.  Our teppan chef was a big dud.  He was very robotic and disinterested.  The food was only mediocre.  Nothing like what Benihana used to be.  I ordered the Land and Sea, which is filet mignon and scallops.  The dish was just over $38 and I received 5 tiny little scallops no bigger around than a quarter.  I was very disappointed as was my dining companion.  I will not make the mistake of going to this place again.  It was over $100 for two people for very mediocre food and terrible service.  We did not get out of the place until after 8:30 pm."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing atmosphere. Entertainment was priceless!"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my husbands birthday and we had a wonderful time! Yan was our chef and he was so entertaining and did not skip a beat! Our waitress was on top of drinks, plates, and desert... this is our second time here and we will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We have always loved this location and chose this over the Scottsdale one all the time Unfortunately last night would Have been a bust if it hadn't been for Carlos our chef. We had reservations and and the girl up front really didn't want to talk to anyone I stood up there feeling like and idiot finally she acknowledged my existence. Other people Came in without reservations and they were sat before us wow!!! Our waitress was new she was very friendly but rather slow as my husband said this is the first time we have sat down and a 1/2 later nothing in front of us so we opted out to preserve an appetizer.  Then the saving grace, Carlos come to cook our meals.  What a joy he was. So attentive, funny, friendly and just did a wonderful job having us all at the table so happy.  Would I come back here? Only if Carlos is working but if the girl at the front is there we will leave and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Benihana has fallen hard from the iconic Japanese eatery my family had loved. The new location had poor service, chef that got all the orders wrong, could only make 1 meal at a time as the others over cooked and overall ruined my family birthday celebration. I'll never return"}
{"text":"My wife got me the BEST GIFT EVER for my birthday - the Master Teppanyaki Chef Experience (www.benihana.com/bethechef)!  I love teppanyaki probably more than I should and definitely more than anyone in my family so I don't get to go as often as I would like.  I mean it's dinner AND a show!  How can it NOT be awesome with fancy food tricks, fried rice, shrimp, and steak?  Mix in some saki bombers and you can't go wrong.  For the Master Chef Experience you are trained at the fine art of teppanyaki then are able to bring your friends/family in for dinner that you cook.  Training is held Monday through Thursday at 1:00ish which I guess is understandable because they don't want you messing around with knives and hot food in the midst of the lunch or dinner rush.  It still pisses me off though because I work during normal business hours.  I guess it is a small price to pay to hopefully make a fire volcano and fling some shrimp at my wife.  The training was awesome.  My personal teppanyaki chef/teacher (Hideo) and I pretty much had the place to ourselves so I would not be embarrassed if I sprayed rice everywhere.  The training took about 30 minutes and my teacher pretty much went over everything.  He taught me some tricks, some jokes and of course some safety stuff that went in one ear and out the other.  The whole thing was a blast.  On the day of the big even where I would cook for my family they gave me an apron and chefs hat so I looked pretty legit.  Everything went off without a hitch and I made some awesome teppanayaki.  My technique still needs some work but I did excellent for my first time.  Anyway, the whole experience was a blast and I would recommend it to anyone.  The manager (I don't have his name) and Hideo were awesome and really did make the whole thing special throughout my training and main event."}
{"text":"I understand the inflated prices on the entrees surely factor in the \"entertainment\" factor, but I still can't help but be underwhelmed by the food at the end.  Our server and chef were great, but I would have felt differently about spending $35+ for my meal had it not been for the birthday voucher."}
{"text":"Probably the nicest - and best - Benihana I've been to.  It is Vegas, after all!  Normally I am usually \"meh\" when it comes to Benihana, along with my wallet getting very noticeably skinnier because of it being so damn expensive... but it's Vegas baby!    And... because it's Vegas, if you don't have a reservation expect a looooooong wait.  Especially if you just show up on a Saturday night, like we did.  (Hey, we're spontaneous.)  Actually what happened, we were playing Blackjack at the New York-New York all day and befriended some fellow players who told us they were going to Benihana and just like the Guinness commercial, \"Brilliant!\" was the response that came in my head.    Anyway... so yeah, our wait was close to 2 hours without that reservation, which was ok because the casino is not too far and we played Blackjack, won some money, got some free drinks, all good stuff.  No need to get into any other details - it is Benihana, after all.  The food was all spot on, the meat cooked perfectly, great table entertainment, awesome service.  Wished all their restaurants were like this."}
{"text":"In all my years eating at Benihana's i have never had as much fun as i did  this last weekend for Greg's birthday. We had dinner at 10:30pm and had the funniest chef ever! It was a long day for all of us and i know i was starvin like marvin. The servers name was Hideo and he was too fun. A little x-rated but not too. He was so subliminal he had all of us rolling. The  server was also gracious and quick. She had us served up very fast. Brought out the delicious miso soup and ginger salad after serving up our drinks. Charles and I had the hot sake, Brian & Greg each had the Asahi beer, i think the ladies had grey goose and soda. Our food was all over the menu. Brian had the Shrimp, Chicken & Filet Mignon while i had the Lobster, & Filet Mignon, Greg had the Shrimp & Chicken, Kristine the same and Charles the Filet Mignon while Tiffany had the Mango Chicken and Alondra the Filet mignon i think as well. Everyone raved about their food. My lobster was divine. The Fillet Mignon was cooked medium rare to perfection! The Benihana vegetables are always my favorite and i totally wish i knew how to order extra! The chef had many more tricks up his sleeve than most Tepan Yaki chefs around town, so i was still captivated by the twirl of his knife. One thing i miss from the NJ Tepan Yaki spot we frequented was the sake in the season bottle slung at us from the other side of the grill. Never the less i love this place and 6 months in between each visit is toooo long! Luckily we had 8 of us in our party because we took over half of the grill. The manager took a photo of our  group for Gregs birthday so you should be able to find it online ^_~."}
{"text":"I just can't get into Benihana, you know?  It's just so gimmicky and the food really isn't that good.  Everything is a little bland and, if not bland, too salty.  The Office got it right when Michael Scott called it 'Asian Hooters.'  The decor at this one is beautiful though.  For that it gets a thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have been to Benihana before and I am mad at myself for going back again!  My husband and I opted to eat in the bar area.  Our waiter-Kase started out very good.  He was smiling and happy.  My husband told him, and looked at him in his eyes, and spoke very slowly---we did not want to be rushed.  We wanted time between our soup and salad, and salad and main entree.  Kase said he was really good with the timing.  Well.......our soup came immediately and the salad the minute I put my spoon down.  I literally had 3 bites of the salad when the dinner came.  I said to the server (not Kase)-\"that had better NOT be our dinner.\"  At which time he put the dinner down.  The steak was ordered medium and it was WELL DONE.  The chicken fried rice was dry. I was so mad that it ruined the night.  My husband always tips 25%  He left a 10% tip. We were in and out, including drinks in 45 minutes.  It will be a long, long time before we go back. On a side note,  this was the first time that the restaurant  was not packed.  Maybe others have had a bad experience also !!!"}
{"text":"This place has always been our Mother's Day choice for dinner for the past 5 years and today was probably the worst experience ever. I made reservations approximately 2 weeks ago to ensure we get a table on this special day. I made the reservation for 6 pm and arrive here at 5:45 and checked in with the front desk. We kept noticing people walking in after us being seated and we were just curious as to why they were getting seated and we haven't even been called upon. I gave them several minutes assuming since it was Mother's Day they might have just been a bit backed up. But once 6:30 hit I started to make my way to the desks and asked what was going on. The lady asked what my name was an she looks at her screen and leans to the other girl next to her and asked why hadn't we been seated yet. Needles to say they over looked my name and never called us, with that being said they squeezed other people in our place. So after we waited another while so they could find us a table, we didn't get seated till 6:40. Once we sat down we didn't see the waiter till 6:54 to ask us about drinks. I'm still here sitting patiently waiting on our drinks parched as can be. I guess we will see what happens next. Just figured I'd write about my experience while I'm sitting here waiting......................"}
{"text":"Food was good the ambience was decent but the service was outstanding.  Venessa was our server and she was awesome very on top of everything. Keep the water full and the plates cleared. Sam was a vet good cook he put on a great show but didn't over cook anything, all the food was done very well. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just went back for my wife's birthday again. Couldn't have been a more perfect night.  Best waitress we've ever had there, and we have had some good ones.  The nicest thing is we had a great table of people with us. Made the evening even more enjoyable.  Food was excellent. My wife had the scallops and I had the tuna steak. So much food we took 1/2 home for the next night.  Have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Why did it feel like I was the only person that has NOT eaten at Benihana?  Probably because I was.  Anyway, I am a huge fan of teppanyaki and have been to several other places around the valley who do it quite well.  I mean how can you not love flaming onion volcanoes, shrimp acrobatics and other food awesomeness?  It's like a circ du solei of food!  Yet I didn't listen to almost everyone I know or 2/3rds of the Yelp reviews saying this place isn't all that wonderful.  Ok, ok - one point Yelp and my friends; zero points Jason.  Benihana isn't in fact all that great.  Benihana is however good at making a teppanyaki place that runs like a well oiled machine or at least a ride at Disney Land.  They shuffle you in, wait until your table is full, put on a little show, charge you way too much then shuffle you out the door to make room for the next group.  Aside from the food being waaaaay overpriced, the service is excellent and meals tasty.  The \"show\" isn't bad either.  Except now they aren't allowed to do any of the cool stuff because people were apparently getting hurt from flying shrimp and flaming onion volcanoes.  And Benihana being a corporate chain behemoth decided they better do away with the \"dangerous\" stuff.  Bummer!  In my option the food and service is on par with just about any other teppanyaki place around.  So, if you have a hankering for the stuff you are probably better off going to Ichi Bahn or some other place that may be cheaper, not feel like a Disney ride, and do cooler food tricks n' stuff.  But, if you must go, sign up for Benihana's birthday club thing because they will give you a $30 gift certificate which is pretty solid and the reason why I went."}
{"text":"First of all this location's atmosphere is way better than the one at Westgate. Westgate is a little dated and this Benihana is a lot more modern and cool. We had the pleasure of having Jezray and Kyle serving us. Jezray was so sweet and had an awesome personality. She made sure to keep our drinks filled and that we weren't without anything. Kyle was awesome as well! He was a funny guy and kept my whole table laughing. As did Jezray. Overall this has been the best Benihana experience I've ever had. Thanks Jezray and Kyle! Hope to see you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"Benihana's is a great place to go if you're a first timer for Teppanyaki/Hibachi style cooking as the decor is beautiful and the cooking style is very entertaining. But as an avid fan of Japanese food (and being Japanese myself) Benihana's just isn't very good.   We booked a reservation for 4 at 9:30pm Saturday night and waited near the koi pond for about 15 minutes to be seated. Due to the amount of Hibachi grills shoved into a single room it was impossible for the 4 of us to talk to each other because it was so loud. Once we ordered I was shocked fried rice was extra but ordered it anyways as white rice with Teppanyaki is boring.   Order and review of food appearance:   1. Soup - I really enjoy the onion soup so to start the meal with it was great! 2. Salad - This was ultimately iceburg lettuce with a bland ginger salad with an awkward texture -Chef began cooking- 3. Shrimp, veggies, fried rice, steak, mushrooms - they were all flavored with their \"garlic butter\" and it was BLAND. Although the meal was served with dipping sauces, it shouldn't rely on the sauces to make the meal, just enhance it. I was highly disappointed in the lack of flavors for the price of this joint.   If you're looking for good Teppanyaki/Hibachi, make your way to Gesha as they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting Benihana recently. The hibachi experience was okay but nothing special. The food was just okay but over salted. I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to see their food flying in the air??!!  This is the second time I've been to this Benihana at the Hilton and I have no complaints.  My coworkers and I went after our trade show and they were very accommodating for us.  We had 27 people!  Anywho, my chicken was delicious especially with the dipping sauce.  I couldn't have been a happier camper.  It also helped I had my tall Sapporo."}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughter's 12th Birthday at Benihana on 10/16/14.  The food was delicious and the chef was very talented and entertaining!  He did things with the food on the Hibachi we hadn't seen before...a big heart made out of fried rice and made it \"beat\" using the spatula.        The only negative was when it came time for them to sing Happy Birthday our waitress was the only one around so our poor waitress was stuck doing the birthday songs by herself So we joined in to help her.  No wonder our waitress seemed so unhappy with her job.     I was happy that we had the option of brown rice and not just white or fried rice."}
{"text":"Benihana.  It's just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?  No, unfortunately not.at.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?  Tuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \"I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\"  Upon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.    Our chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \"waiting for the rice.\"  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.    Two hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.    My final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come..."}
{"text":"The chef was wonderful we (party of 2) enjoyed his presentation and the preparation of the food. The waitress was ok had to be called over by the chef. The down fall for us was the other part of 6. I guess you have no choice in your dining companions. But the others were a group of 5 men and one woman. I am NO prude. But these men were rude, loud, and gross. I can not fault the restaurant but I do fault my fellow humans for their lack of table manners and more.....for ruining our evening. But the restaurant employees should have recognized the displeasure by the fact that we left as soon as the chef finished and said something to us instead we were ignored like when we entered the man at the front desk was on the phone asleep!"}
{"text":"My kids fav b-day eatery request....... It's not the best, but it is consistent. I  guess that is what you can expect for Chain Restaurants like this....   For the various times we have gone, wait has not been bad and service has been good.   For the food..... Again consistent - not great but not bad. If you order the specialty section, you get soup, salad, appetizer (shrimp), main dish, rice (fried - extra cost or steamed), veggies(lots of onions and zucchini), and dessert (your choice of ice cream).   The chicken fried rice has butter, butter, and more butter some salt, pepper, and soy for seasonings. I like simple food preparation, but the amount of butter used is way too much.   I typically get the steak/seafood combo and these are cook to order and most of the time are cooked correctly for my taste (especially last Friday night).   Entertainment wise (seriously this is the reason why you go to a place like this, right?) is a joke. Most of the chefs we have had need to practice their routines. Or at the very least be funny if you drop stuff.   Atmosphere is good, can't complain. Great for b-day picture taking with some of the art on the walls.   We will continue to go as along as our kids like this place."}
{"text":"Dirty. Expensive for what you could get at a regular Japanese restaurant in Chinatown. Trash in the fountain pool. Service ok. They would not seat our party of 10 until the last person arrived."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was really good I always get the spicy chicken YUM!!"}
{"text":"They're lunch prices are awesome. The amount of food you get for $10-15 is great. You can get just chicken or steak and shrimp and still not break $20 after tax and tip."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location has such low ratings.  I went to Benihana for my annual birthday meal.  (If you don't subscribe to the birthday club you need to, free $30 credit every year!)  I made a reservation in advance for 7pm and I was seated at approximately 7:10pm.  The restaurant was waiting for an open chef table so this was not an issue.  Once we were seated, the waitress instantly came and explained the menu and went over the specials and her favorites.  Afterwards, she took drink orders and gave everyone time to review their menu.  After drinks arrived we began to get our appetizers.. soups, salad, etc.  From the time we first interacted with the waitress until the time the chef came it was probably about 15-20 minutes.  Again, not an issue at all which is why they give you appetizers.  The chef was pleasant and entertaining.  He was interactive with each of us.  The food was cooked to perfection and each part was placed out in order, first rice, then vegetables, then meats.  Of course with any Benihana meal, by the time you get your entr√©e your rice and veggies won't be as warm as they are.  (I wonder can this ever change in the future)  All in all, great experience and great service!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that I am giving this place 3 stars since I really do like Benihana. When we walked in the host looked at us funny, I think it was because we were underdressed but I didn't think it mattered since there was only one other table there. It was a friday at 9:30pm. She proceeded to ask if we wanted to sit in a booth since the table where they cook the food would take a really long time. (WHO COMES TO BENIHANA TO SIT AT A BOOTH) Anyways I took the hint since we were underdressed she didn't want to sit us at the table. So we sat in the booth and ordered the usual, the food was HORRIBLE. I know it would have tasted better if we had gotten the food cooked in front of us. The server was nice though."}
{"text":"The food was excellent,  the ventilation was poor. We left smelling like a smoky teppanyaki grill, but otherwise wll worth the price."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. We missed the first quarter of the Cavs Finals game because of the terrible service at this restaurant.   When I first walked in, the hostess seemed confused as to why we there. She said there would be a small wait, so my boyfriend and I went to the bar until a spot opened up for us. The bartender ignored us for around 5 minutes, and then finally gave us OLD menus and said we couldn't order those drinks.   10 minutes later, we were seated. I asked the server if we could finally order our bar drinks we originally wanted. I had to ask this waitress twice to come back with my drinks! (It was just sake!) During this time, the couple next to us sat without water for around 15 minutes.  The chef came around 45 minutes later. He served everyone at the table fried rice except us. Even though we ordered the rice like everyone else. He was clearly very irate with the server. My boyfriend then asked for the manager. It had been an hour and we haven't even eaten any food yet. He reassured us all the issues would be resolved but we should have just left then!!  Another waitress took over our table, but she clearly seemed annoyed by it. It made the atmosphere very uncomfortable. The chef wasn't entertaining, although he was the only person there putting in any effort. We go to hibachi restaurants in the area (Wasabi & Fugi) to be entertained. Here, there was only anger.   The manager took $10 off and asked us to give the place another chance. We missed Lebron and Kyrie. There's no going back."}
{"text":"Loved it.  The food was good.  Husband always wanted to come to one. I would recommend for groups and family but not for a date since you share you table."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a special shout out to \"Tony To Much\" cook. He absolutely made our experience a great one. He was through with our food requests, he made it entertaining and had us all in laughs and smiles. Thank you for making a delicious meal for us and reminding of us why we will be back. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"After my previous review of Benihana, Donna a employee of Benihana invited me back to see if they could improve on my previous dinner.  And I must say they certainly did.  I can't say enough about the service and the chef.  From the hostess who seated us, the waiter Hau who couldn't do enough for us and the fabulous and entertaining Chef Max.  The soup was much better this time and so was the salad dressing and my dinner was outstanding I definitely will go back to Benihana at the Westgate in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We go here every year for my cousins birthday, and each year this place is even better. The service is excellent, along with the staff and food. Our chef had a great sense of humor, and made sure our food was done exactly how we liked it. My whole family and I thought the food was delicious. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a celebration for anything, or maybe even just a dinner out of the house."}
{"text":"The food was good and priced about the same or lower than other Hibachi style restaurants,  but even with reservations it took us one hour from sitting down for our meal to begin.  I find that to be entirely too long."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Food was great! First time here husband and I enjoyed the great food and entertainment from the chef will be coming back whenever we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Behold the world's largest and fanciest Bennie's! This is the only Bennie's in Las Vegas so pay close attention -  Located inside of the old school Westgate Hotel, on the Casino floor, once you arrive you will be surprised by this unexpected restaurant oasis! If you choose to do self-parking, make sure to park closest to the \"Sports Book\" which will give you a straight forward, short walk to the restaurant.  This is the most luxurious location I have ever been to. They are boasted as the largest Bennie's in the world and designed to replicate a small indoor village! They have 2 stories, fitted with separate \"chef's table\" dining rooms and also lounges with access to gorgeous views of custom rooftops on faux buildings. Upon leaving the dining rooms, you're immersed in an indoor Japanese garden; the entire space is adorned with a variety of eye-catching props such as: dangling red lanterns, shutters, bridges and my favorite LED fireworks dancing on the backsplash of the town. They even go as far as incorporating a dramatic waterfall and a rock garden creek. It's truly a random casino getaway. So peaceful!  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and say it - I like Benihana's and I'm not embarrassed about it! I actually enjoy dining at the clich√© \"chef's table\" and the food isn't as terrible as most people make it out to be! Granted, you have to know what to order and stick to it! Once you venture off to uncharted menu territory - you're on your own bland journey.  I'll give you tips based on trial and error: Stick to the steaks (New York or filet mignon) and the colossal shrimp is always winning! I always order the Splash & Meadow combo $39.50, it comes with a small grilled shrimp appetizer and also a small side of grilled sweet onion & zucchini. The combo also comes with a side salad with house miso dressing and an onion broth soup that is cooked for 6 hours - Intense! Make sure to get your steak medium, since it tends to come out well - but if you like your meat bloody like I do, ask for it rare and it will get to you medium (there's a small percentage of it actually getting to you rare.) *shrugs* - don't forget to add a chicken & egg fried rice for $6. The fried rice is super simple but the garlic butter they use could make a boot taste amazing - I love the fried rice! $6 is expensive for a small bowl, but it makes me happy! If you're ballsy, demand that the chef add more butter! I'm sure the rest of the table won't mind. More is more!  Don't bother with the hibachi chicken combos or sushi! I've had both and they are extremely disappointing. The spicy chicken hibachi combo for $25.95 looked pretty good, but the spicy sauce is bland and the chicken is somehow always overcooked to smithereens and dry as cardboard. The sushi is lacking thought; I recall the rolls having lots of rice and being horribly dry!  If you like it saucy like I do, make sure to get extra miso salad dressing on the side and use that as a dip for your steak and shrimp - delicious! It's so much better than their other 2 standard dipping sauces. Also for the spice advocates, ask for a side of the diablo sauce which is their house spicy mayo with a real kick! I love dabbing a little bit on my protein, it wakes up all of the flavors wonderfully!  They will forever do the same onion volcano, train, shrimp and heart fried rice trick; true, the hibachi show may be played out, but I always get a kick out of it and think about Chris Farley as a Hibachi Chef in Beverly Hills Ninja! Freaking hilarious! THE BEST MOVIE SCENE ever!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raIdZiSZ970   Sure, the chef's table is always crammed and it's totally awkward sitting with a table full of strangers - but it's Vegas! Why not spark conversation with people from all around the world - don't be shy! It's fun learning about where people are from, their Vegas itinerary, and also partaking in other bizarre topics of discussion. Don't be that guy whose face planted in his (delicious) fried rice and not a smile to be seen even when everyone is having fun and engaging him! Yeah. That guy? He's having a terrible time AND he sucks.  PRO TIP: sign up for their email club to get your $30 birthday credit! Not to sound like a cheapo or anything, but that's the only way to dine here! It also comes with a complimentary birthday ice-cream and if you're lucky, maybe even a cringing birthday song dedicated to you from your table companions!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour M-F 3-6PM  This is a great strip happy hour.  They have tons of drink specials from a $3 sake to a $16 fishbowl.  All their HH food specials are under $7.  We ordered a couple rolls, Gyoza and Karaage Chicken along with a Blue Ocean Punch Bowl, White Peach Sake Sangria and Lychee Blossom.  Food and drinks were delicious.  Service was great although I do wish our bartender would have let us know she was leaving at shift change.  She disappeared and we didn't know she was gone for the day.  I would have liked to close our tab before she left.    The main downfall of this happy hour for me is they will only let you order the fishbowl for 2.  That's pretty lame, especially in Vegas.  You can get fishbowls up and down the strip so not sure why they are so uptight about it.  It is not particularly strong either.  The bartender said it was and told stories about people drinking half and disappearing into the bathroom they were so wasted.  Maybe if you are a rookie or weigh 80lbs.  I drank the whole thing and got buzzed but wasn't wasted by a long shot.  The bartender did end up letting me order the fishbowl and my friend order another cocktail but it took some persuading and the promise of acting like we were sharing if a manager came by."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was pretty delicious too; I have no complaints about either. However the chairs we sat in were extremely uncomfortable with almost no padding whatsoever. I bruised my tailbone due to this; it has now been 4 days since we were there and it is still tender and difficult to sit on."}
{"text":"For all family birthdays we always go here to celebrate. We usually have at least one child with us. Tonight we had 3 with us and what a wonderful Chef that we had. His name is Roberto and is by far the most entertaining. Not only did he cook and tell jokes, but he also did magic tricks. We were all very entertained. The kids loved him. You can tell he truly loves children and enjoys what he does. Our waitress was also very good and very attentive. Unfortunately,  I can't remember her name, but I do know the combination of the two made a very enjoyable evening for our family."}
{"text":"Ok, I am a Benihana fanatic! I order double fried rice and the filet mignon medium rare with shrimp.  My friend and I came here for dinner last week and had the pleasure of our meal cooked by Tony. This guy is a rockstar. Hilarious, immaculate chef (best Benihana cooked meal by far, hands down!), entertaining and engaged his table. Truly an extra bonus to the perfectly cooked steak, veggies, seafood, rice & atmosphere.  We had a reservation for 7pm and were sat around 7:10pm. Everything was ordered and delivered promptly. Tony took roughly an hour and 15 minutes with our table. It was nice to not feel rushed. He multi-tasked like a champ. It was also apparent that he made his \"show\" age appropriate, but his personality was still able to shine through.   When I return to this location, I will only request Tony!  \"TONY- TO NEW YORK\" \"SAVANNAH OOOOH NAH NAH\"  We love you Tony, much love!"}
{"text":"a filthy restaurant.  that carpet is probably there for a decade.  never have seen benihana in such a bad shape before.  judging from its price, this is supposed to be a 'high-end' restaurant, yet the chef's performance was pretty bad (he tried to show off but just sucked at everything, and it seemed he did not care at all), and he did not know how to treat my supreme food ingredients properly.   the only barely acceptable thing was the server's attitude - but I wasn't there for the server.  I was there to have my food first.  Benihana has been steadily spiraling down, that I know.  Yet as long as they still charge people a hefty price for the benihana experience, the headquarter has a responsibility to make sure each franchise maintain a certain  standard.  benihana cleveland (actually beachwood, OH) is clearly a failure/shame/disgrace to the benihana brand."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time ever at Benihana. With all the talk, I expected the great show of food preparation, but I had an expectation that the food would be tasty. I felt it was very mediocre. The food didn't have much flavor and lacked salt. Of course, there is no salt on the table.  My favorite part of steak anywhere is the steak sauce. They have no steak sauce. None. Period. Finally they serve Pepsi products and I'm a Coke fan. Just wasn't at all what I expected. The chef was fun, entertaining and funny, but we just paid $175 for four people to have dinner!"}
{"text":"We had been to Benihana 2 times to celebrate our birthdays. Even though you make an appointment and reach 5-10 mins late they still make you wait longer. Both the times we did not get a table on time and had to wait for atleast 15 mins. But once we are seated the service was excellant. The cooking table is a real good experience especially if it is your first time.  The servers were fast and the chefs are so energetic and funny that they will create a laughter riot throughout the cooking session. The food is cooked in front of you so you know exactly what goes into your stomach.   I am a vegetarian so I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING DIFFERENT SPATULAS FOR VEGETARIANS which is not the case. Just one used for anything and everything from prawns to tofus.    My husband is a lover of the chicken fried rice which he says is a must try. Quantify is very very minimal for the meal portions so be prepared for a huge bill. The meal comes with a complimentary ice cream and a birthday song sung by all the servers.  Overall a good experience and a must try place but with a lot of flaws."}
{"text":"I have been a fan and customer of Benihana for many years, which makes this review so sad to write.  I was totally unimpressed with our meal.  The chef at the table just went through the motions and it was nothing too special.  He under cooked my wife's shrimp and did not even cut my steak good.  There are better options available if you would like to dine out for Teppanyaki.  So Sad..."}
{"text":"Great food especially the fried rice. The chefs cook right in front of you and it is awesome to watch them. I would say that this is a good place to bring your kids too."}
{"text":"Nice place, shrimp was great as well as the noodles and the kids loved the tricks and jokes. The chef definitely made it enjoyable. The juices and drinks were a bit pricy, maybe because it is Vegas."}
{"text":"I could just copy and paste Kristin S' review since we were a part of the same group that went. Kudos for giving our large group of girls two tables together but BOOO for making us wait so long. Not only was it a half hour after our reservation time but people got there early to warn them of our partys arrival. Our reservation had been down at least a week in advance, it could have been better planned on their part but anyway. The food here is crap... unless you like everything flavored with nothing but soy sauce, don't bother going. I always loved Benihana as a kid and either I grew up and learned what good food really is or this place seriously went to crap. The show sucked, the drinks were weak and expensive and the food was bland. I took my leftovers home to my husband who said \"I thought you went to benihana, this tastes like ****\" and that was promptly followed by the \"did we just grow up because I thought it used to be good conversation.\""}
{"text":"What a nice location. With great prices. Just left and food and service was great. Happy to see this beautiful rest. Jose was server was very nice."}
{"text":"I've just moved to Phoenix and I attempted to use my chef's table birthday certificate that is a yearly tradition for me. This year, I was unable to use it because I was dining alone and apparently I needed to order 2 entrees to use my certificate. The certificate does not clearly state that 2 meals need to be purchased. So not only did I have to pay for my meal (which I didnt expect), but i left my entire entree at the restaurant because I had to get to work. They offered to hold it for me, but i didnt have time to get back there. So basically I paid $35 for an entree I did not receive. So frustrating. Guess I will have to find a new tradition.   On a happier note our chef, Kyle, was fantastic. It was the best show I'd seen yet. Thanks Kyle!"}
{"text":"Clean & newer modeled for a Benihana. Delicious food. Big portions. Terrible service at this location. Took over 30 minutes for the waitress to take our order."}
{"text":"A huge disappointment! I made reservations here at 6:30 for my daughter's 16th Birthday. We had tickets to see Britney Spears that evening and had flown in from Kansas City. We were seated immediately, but it was over 30 minutes before the chef showed up to the table. An employee was having a large celebration that evening and 5 chefs were at the employee 's table. So even though we had reservations - the employee's table got service and we did not! Because they were so late to our table, we barely were able to eat our entree's, much less get our dessert or have the Birthday song sung to my daughter. We had to run out to make it to our show in time! This is not how you treat customers! This was very stressful for my daughter on a day that was supposed to be special. We spent a lot of money on tickets, airfare and hotel and instead of having a fun evening at Benihana's all we got was poor treatment and stress. I will never return to a Benihana restaurant and I would not recommend that you eat here if you have any other plans for the evening."}
{"text":"Just showed up at Benihana for my wife's birthday. Party of six. We had a reservation. We went to the bar area to wait for all of our party because they wouldn't seat us without everyone. I get that. We ordered drinks and my 17 year old daughter asked for coffee. They didn't have any. How about hot tea? They didn't have any. We were served our drinks while my daughter went next door to Starbucks and got a coffee to go. She was stopped at the door and told she couldn't bring the coffee in. We reminded them that we couldn't purchase it from them. The hostess told us it was policy that no water or drinks could be brought in. We left."}
{"text":"This is a joke.......unreal we sat @ 9:15pm it's now 11:43 & I'm now leaving & the cook had just 3 days on the job!!! Sorry but don't put a new cook on the Job by himself on a Friday night!!!   Five days later I received a response from Benihana  stating that they apologize for the unfortunate experience. I do appreciate that and for getting back to us maybe this was just a night that was just not going their way. I will be back and give it a try I do believe in second chances!!!"}
{"text":"Getting some Chinese in Las Vegas! Happy Hour!Saki! Doing some shopping and eats! Great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Pretty boring cook here , food bland , can't really give it much more than an ok.Sauces aren't as good as other places. I wouldn't send anyone here, won't be back myself . My experiences with hibachi has always been much better and more entertaining . Thank you for the reply , I did bring it to the attention of the waitress , no compensation or replacement  was offered"}
{"text":"On all special occasions relating to ME (eg. fathers day, birthdays), I choose this place for the all you can eat sushi lovers menu.  Sushi quality is certainly as good as any place I've ever been.  It's a bit pricey, but if you do it right, you'll win every time.    One tip.....do the all you can eat sushi special with a friend who can pound it as hard as you can.  That way you can order a good variety and not have to eat entire rolls by yourself."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good!  But, for some reason they did not take our MasterCard!  It is embarrassing and was a good thing we had some cash on it s!  This was for a birthday dinner and the waiter said they have a problem with Madtercsrds!??  Would be nice if they had said something in their website so we would have known before we got there!!!!"}
{"text":"Cook was hilarious. Great showmanship. He made every one at our table feel special, was skilled and was very nice.  The food.... MEH..... little to no flavors. He did salt , pepper, soy everything, just bland... onions were great, who doesn't appreciate grilled onions or mushrooms? I had the hibachi steak. Cooked correctly, but unfortunately bland. This dish comes with shrimp, which is only half deveined= nothing on the top but a big ole vein of special shrimp surprise on the under.... ew. I gave this place a three for ambiance, theatrics and quality service. If it were rated on food alone, one and a half or a two at the most.They are very pricey for the quantity and quality of the food . My companion ordered the fried rice, for which they charge 5.99 . It was a small bowl and not at all worth the cost. Stingy there too.  I ordered a green tea, the ice tasted as if some one working a grill had handled it to put in my glass. It was gross. I didn't say anything, just ordered a sprite---- no ice...LOL. Waitress was nice. Gave me an extra set of chopsticks to take home. Keep in mind, they seat you family style so you sit with strangers. It was nice as we met some fun folks who didn't mind us either. This could be risky.... you know the crazy drunk best man or the unhappy bridesmaid in a Vegas trip gone bad situation...LOL"}
{"text":"The best Benihana ever! This place is visually stunning! It has that indoor/outdoor design that Vegas is soo fond of. You know when you're indoors but looks like your outside(kinda). What is that called? Anyways imagine your in a Japanese tea garden...at night. There is a pink, orange and purple sunset and the occasional fireworks display. A stream, bridge and lots of cherry blossom trees. The actual dining area  is inside of a house which is inside of the inside/outside tea garden, overlooking the stream. A hostess dressed in full kimono attire escorts you to your table. Other than all that, it's just a regular old Benihana..."}
{"text":"Loved coming here! Bailey was entertaining, the food was great, I'm glad we chose to come here for our anniversary dinner!"}
{"text":"I decided to have my birthday dinner here..party of 15..they failed to mention they did not have a table that could accommodate this big of a group without being separate..after debating with the rude hostess Laura who had an attitude and a lot to say..we spoke to the manager and he fixed our issue..Joscaline the cook and our other cook and waiter who I didn't catch the name were all amazing..food was amazing ofcourse..we spent about 1,000 all together and being a known place in a great location..the first faces the customer see and the first vibe we get is like \"Laura's\" I would have had my dinner elsewhwre."}
{"text":"We dine at Benihana regularly and normally have a great experience.  While the food was good, the ventilation was terrible.  Once we arrived home, we had to put our clothes in the garage to air them out.  It was most disappointing."}
{"text":"Our chef Scott was very cool. He was fun, skillful, and entertaining. The highlight of our evening. The server in the bar area was super friendly and helpful. And the (California Poppers) appetizer we ordered while waiting for out table was pretty tasty. Cheap (both meanings) sake during happy hour too. However, everything else about our experience was \"meh\" at best.  The dour-faced greeters didn't do much to foreshadow a good evening. And their \"lackluster\" temperament is the word I would use to describe most of our experience that night at Benihana.  The bartender was content to stare blankly into the distance; and the selection of beers was equally as drab as her personality. If I had it my way we would have walked out already. I could just tell from the attitude of the staff that this isn't an establishment that prides itself on...much anything at all. If the staff isn't excited (or even trying to fake it), then that speaks volumes about the quality of everything the restaurant does.  The food was edible. That's about it. Not very flavorful. Boring. They give you dipping sauces, but even these weren't fantastic. The \"show\" of our food being cooked was nice, and Scott was great, but the food was not. I've had better meals at national family restaurant chains...and at less than a quarter of the price.  What's the point of this Benihana? Is it supposed to be a place you try once to see the show? Cool. Done. No need to come back. Or is supposed to be a place where the food and service is so great that I can't wait to return? If so, they've got some serious work to do."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and you can't beat this place to take your friends or family when they are in town!"}
{"text":"The new Benihana is on the strip at Fashion Show mall. The decor is very modern but the food is not as good as it is here. This place is truly authentic with amazing Japanese themed decor. And all the food is great. There's usually a short wait but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Update from previous review. ..... Someone asked me what if they sat me (and they mix tables up. .. doubt that they were all full) and reservations came in? then they would have five upset people because they didn't keep their reservation.    Well I was explaining on my review earlier, that I was upset that they booked so many reservations that they couldn't seat any walk ins for an hour and half.   Think about it.   No one was waiting in lobby.   People were walking out.   You don't overbook reservations like that.   You always make sure to have room for the walk ins.   Doesn't matter how busy or popular your restaurant is.  That is bad for business.   Unless it's Valentines or Mothers day.  You don't see that kind of response from a restaurant.    They have tons of tables.   And they were all full with reservations???? And the fact that my group was just two.   And they mix tables.   Hello???"}
{"text":"You have to appreciate the humor in how sh###y this place is.  We had a reservation for 10.  Showed up 15 minutes early.  We were told that until the 10th person showed up we can not be seated.  With 9 people.  So we sat at the bar and had a drink.  Time went by.  15 minutes past our reservation time.  So I politely asked the hostess if we could finally be seated.  Angrypuss rolled her eyes, shrugged her shoulders and said \"I doubt it\".  WTF!?  3 hostess tween terrors perusing their iPhones and we can't even get a seat.  Let's cut this short.  The inside looks like a 70's porn shoot, the people are awful, the food is D minus at best.  Go ANYWHERE else! But not here.  I'd eat Burger King before this place any day.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Been to  Benihana's a couple of times, but this last visit was a complete disaster.  The table next to us was seated 10 minutes after we were, and they got their drinks, soup, salad, and food before us.  They also left 40 minutes before our table did.  Our waiter apparently failed at being a chef, and decided to try his luck serving.  He didn't know the menu, he asked me three times about the Salmon Nigiri that I ordered, twice confusing it for sake.  It's a Japanese restaurant, you'd think he'd have basic sushi nailed down.    Instead of serving his single table, he was singing happy birthday to a few other groups.  The fried rice was literally....fried.  Afterwards I spoke with the Manager.  I'm usually not one to complain, and I wasn't rude or anything, but just wanted to bring up the situation to management.  He wasn't surprised at all, and even told me that he knew this particular server was lagging...horribly.  For the life of me I can't figure out why NO ONE stepped in to help the poor guy throughout our 2 HOUR dinner fiasco.  No trainer, no help, nada.  I can tell you I won't be back until I get my free birthday meal, but even then, for the price I'll pay just for my spouse's meal, I'll consider a number of places before stopping here again."}
{"text":"This place has the weirdest entrance ever. Just be prepared.   Came for my sons 5th birthday last night. He's a little foodie. The restaurant itself is nice and we were seated pretty quickly.  Our waitress showed up 2 seconds later to take drink orders and appetizer/sushi orders. I just asked for water and some time to actually look at the menu. several min later out waitress came back with drinks and asked to take orders. I ordered chicken and steak along with a cranberry mojito. Quickly after taking orders our waitress brought out our soup. I liked it but it lacked salt. Before I even finished the salad course came out. I was able to enjoy both before the chef came out to prepare our meal. What did bother me was all the dishes in our area. I can't stand a dirty table and I wish our waitress would have removed them sooner. Our chef Penny wasn't the best hibachi chef I've seen but she was great with my son and he really enjoyed watching her. She was honestly a lot of fun. The hibachi itself was pretty good. I liked the fried rice which is an up charge. The steak was good and so was the chicken. I honestly don't think it was anything special. Dessert was ice cream also nothing special.   So to sum it up our waitress seemed overwhelmed and managed to make me feel rushed even though I feel she could have visited our table a few more times then she did. That along with being overpriced is why only the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Would be a five star, but the ambience is all wrong here. In other Benihanas I have been to the lighting has been much lower. Here we kind of felt as if we were in a spot light all night (hibachi tables). Our server was great, our hibachi cook was very entertaining, and they made our five year anniversary one to remember. For that, we will be back, but turn down the dang lights!"}
{"text":"For my friend's birthday, we went to Benihana to celebrate. Honestly, the only time I have ever been to Benihana has been for birthdays. As many yelpers noted- their parking lot is VERY odd. Be prepared.  I wanted to try some items that I never had at Benihana before, so I decided I would be adventurous and try some sushi....vegetable sushi that is (I am not a seafood lover). The vegetable roll consisted of: green leaf, avocado, cucumber, tomato, red cabbage and yamagobo. I dipped it in some soy sauce and added a small dab of wasabi to each bite. I didn't love it- I think sushi just all around is not something that I enjoy the taste of.   For my meal, I ordered the hibachi chicken. My boyfriend ordered the spicy hibachi chicken. The first course was soup. It was a light, chicken broth based mushroom and green onion soup and it was decent, nothing crazy or packed with flavor. The salad came shortly after- ice berg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced radishes and ginger dressing. I loved the dressing! I wasn't a fan of the mediocre choice of greens and vegetables though.   The main portion of the Benihana/hibachi experience, is the show. Our chef was very nice and very talented. He recognized the birthday girl at our table and gave her a special chef's hat, haha. He prepared our vegetables, shrimp appetizer and main entrees in front of us. The vegetables consisted of zucchini and onions. I agree with other yelpers- the vegetables could be improved. The portion isn't very large and more variety could be added. Having said that, they were delicious. The shrimp was also very tasty.   My entire table ordered the fried rice with their meal and I HIGHLY recommend doing so, rather than ordering the white rice. The fried rice is made fresh right in front of you and is very good! The yum-yum sauce, of course, is the icing on the cake... SO GOOD. It went perfectly with the rice, chicken, veggies and shrimp. My whole table asked for additional sauce to go and the staff was very friendly and super accommodating! The hibachi chicken was very good and came with saut√©ed mushrooms. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's spicy hibachi chicken- the sauce was wonderful.    At the end of the meal, everyone had a choice of sorbet. I had the rainbow sorbet- it was the perfect ending to a delicious meal. The staff also took our picture and printed a copy for the birthday girl.  Benihana is not my favorite place to eat at all, but they are a great place to go for a birthday. The staff was wonderful, the food was good and we all had a great time. Oh and a side note- their Shirley temple's are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Benihana in the USA First of all it smell like old food everywhere there is no exhaustion system above the cooking tables.. Long wait until someone comes to your table. I had a bad experience at this location."}
{"text":"Went to Benihana tonight.  The sushi was falling apart, the cocktails lacked any flavor of alcohol, the entrees were bland and I was charged incorrectly for my food.  When I tried to correct the issue, the server didn't consult the manager and said there was nothing she could do.  Never again Benihana and I won't recommend you to friends or family."}
{"text":"Wow. The sushi bar is terrible. Tourist rolls and madly overpriced. The fish is far from quality and the rice couldn't be less inspiring. The Las Vegas hotel and all it's amenities are a ghost town. The sushi bar was the only thing open at 9:30. It was downright odd."}
{"text":"Decided to try out the new location for my girlfriend's birthday, assuming they had settled in by now, boy was I wrong. I ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and the server brought out an ice bucket and put it on ice, which confused me, I thought perhaps their wine was a little warm so that's why, until the server came back and said the bartender informed him that you're not supposed to ice red wine...duh?  Then I ordered the Benihana Delight (chicken and shrimp) for my gf and the server asked how I would like it cooked...lol what?    Our chef came out and started preparing our food with so many slip ups and mistakes that it was hard to ignore. I've had a hibachi chef before who was barely 18 and he made less mistakes. As I looked around the room I noticed the other chefs were much more skilled so clearly we just got the short end of the stick.     The food was definitely the saving grace, everything was delicious, from the chicken fried rice to the scallops. However, my filet mignon was a little undercooked and bland.     I definitely wish we would've gone to the Westgate location instead, it's much nicer and bigger, with a more seasoned staff."}
{"text":"Service was slow, had to ask for water refill! Food was tasty even if not authentic and well prepared but pricey. Strongly suggest reservations and going with a group! Table seats 8 and our felllow diners were no fun if they were even alive!"}
{"text":"I requested take out and when arrive was told order was not place yet. The manager really stepped up and made sure I received my food in a timely manner"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill over the past several years, and today was the worst ever. Ate at the sushi bar, and the server was very nice but the place was FILTHY, tables not bussed, counters dirty, trays with food on them on many tables, floor had food bits all over. The boat sushi meal was sloppily prepared and the sashimi tasted like a refrigerator, meaning it was not wrapped or stored properly. I actually spit it out on the plate. It was truly a disgusting dining experience.  The exhaust fans were not working correctly and the entire place was filled with fumes. There are too many other good Japanese restaurants in the Scottsdale area for me to waste my time and money here. When I complained to the manager he offered me a free meal, a completely useless gesture as I will never return to a dirty restaurant with poorly prepared and bad tasting food. Do yourself a favor and stay away."}
{"text":"We ate at the Benihana on the strip.  The food was delicious and our chef was top notch.  We all ordered Teriyaki Steak and we all enjoyed our meal.  As we entered the restaurant we were quickly seated.  We did not have to wait long for our order because the staff from the front desk to our waiters were \"Johnny on the spot.\"   The chef made a pac man out of the rice, way cool!   He also made a minion while he was cooking our meal.  Actually, I thought it was C3PO my bad.  All in all this is a great restaurant.  You ask why only a 4 star.  We did not like the dressing they used on their salad.  Other than that it was a very pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"I definitely would not recommend this place to anybody, they tell you have to wait an hour before they can seat you and you look around in the place is empty. And I was here on a Wednesday night at 5 o'clock. How to give this place no stars at all if I could."}
{"text":"I don't get why there are so many haters of Benihana! If you are looking for good teppanyaki japanese cooking, this is a very good place for it. I have tried many things here but you know what they don't get enough credit for? Their sushi! The Vegas roll at Benihana is the best vegas roll I have ever had and might actually be my favorite sushi roll ever! Now, onto their regular food, I have tried many menu items and all have been good. That includes: teriyaki steak, hibachi chicken, hibachi shrimp, spicy hibachi chicken, and colossal mango shrimp. However, the best dishes I ordered here in addition to their Vegas Roll are the yakisoba and the hibachi scallops. These are both delicious and some of the better values on the menu I felt. The fried rice is 1.25 more to add on and although tasty, I don't feel that its worth it to pay extra. It is fun to watch them make it though. Here's the weird thing: my favorite part of the meal (next to the Vegas roll) is their vegi's. The zucchini and onions taste sooo good with all the butter in them!!! Of course, everything is better with butter! Another good thing about the meals is you get soup and salad so you feel like the price is a little more reasonable. The soup is very brothy but has a great onion flavor to it. The salad on the other hand has a ginger dressing that I am not a fan of. All in all, benihana, although a little overpriced, has some terrific food and its a great place to take a date. The show the chefs put on it very fun, however, it doesnt change much from chef to chef if you have been more than once. Oh one other understated item: their tempura banana's for dessert. Delectable! Everyone should try Benihana and their dam Vegas Roll at least once in their lives. A final tip: If you expect great service, do not sit in the bar to have dinner. We made the mistake of doing that once and had to wait forever for everything! Sit at the tables if you are planning to have more than drinks. WORD!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to the Benihana's, the one in Ontario California, and I have to say this Benihana's is absolutely horrid. The service is crap and the menu is missing some items ( beef and shrimp yakisoba). They are also only open for dinner. Never ever coming back."}
{"text":"Benihana. Never waivers when it comes to quality!!! Always a great show with a great presentation with an amazing chef. This location has only been open for about 5months, it's a little smaller than what I am familiar with but that's ok, I still enjoy the show around the grill. It's always an amazing place to meet new people. Everyone had a glass of hot green tea, onion soup with mushrooms and little onion as well is a fresh salad with ginger dressing.   My main course, I had grilled shrimp, with fried chicken rice full of garlic butter and when I say full I mean hoooooked up with garlic butter, I also enjoyed teriyaki chicken with a plate full of vegetables. So much food, well seasoned and flavorful, I love Benihana and enjoy the show with every meal. Since it was my birthday, they sang happy birthday and gave me a ice cream Sunday (green tea flavor). I recommend that you join the Benihana's club as I did you will get a meal voucher on your birthday for $30 off you meal. So in the end my meal only came out to $3.00   Great place to take your family for a dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to Benihana many times before all over the country. This was my worst experience yet... the reason I gave it more than 1 star was because the food was great. What you pay for at Hibachi restaurants is the food and show that goes along with it. Our chef was a Spanish speaker and that's not a problem with me, but he did not engage with anyone at the table except for the other Spanish speakers at the table. He barely did a show too... he slipped the cooking utensils at the beginning and at the end he did the onion volcano but that was it... pretty pathetic show if you ask me and the fact that he paid absolutely no attention to my boyfriend and I and the other family across from us is why I am giving it 2 stars. He blatantly ignored us and spoke in Spanish to the Spanish speakers the entire time."}
{"text":"The Benihana at the LVH is one of our company's traditions while in town for any occasion. This location, which is actually HUGE on the inside is always very clean, and has lots of eager staff to help.  We always have a big group and eat in the back rooms where the cook in front of you. On this visit I started with a tempura sushi roll then ordered the half chicken and half streak teriyaki...AMAZING. I was disappointed with our chef, who didn't do many of the tricks but we were having a great time and i've seen them before. We all were drinking Sapporo beer and our waitress was excellent.  I would HIGHLY recommend this table cooking style hidden gem to any business group, family or couple looking for lots of great food and a fun night."}
{"text":"I was at the Fashion Show mall Benihana corporate store on Wednesday, May 23, 2018.  The manager was totally disrespectful to me and my guest. The server said they had NO HOT WATER for tea. I asked them to boil water on the stove to bring hot water for the tea, they said they didn't have a pot to make it. What Japanese restaurant doesn't serve hot tea?!! **after reading numerous reviews (Candice T and Nan80) stated that they've also been told the hot water machine was broken, R E A L L Y?  This machine has not been replaced with even a Mr. Coffee machine that can make hot water? Don't you think a manager could have done something to get a new machine, coffee carafe or T-Fal to boil hot water meanwhile the hot water machine was being built in China and sent by pony express to his restaurant? Maybe he could have called Sparkletts to order a hot water dispenser unit with the 5 gallon hot water bottle on top. Being a manager he can't even manage water! This must be a scam this restaurant is pulling just so they won't have to provide free hot tea. They would prefer that you PAY for a drink.  The server brought some lemon wedges that  I requested. They were heaped on top of a soggy paper bar napkin- instead of using a small bowl. The lemons looked slimy and bent/used. The server delivered them from her hand without a plate under the lemons. I didn't use any of the lemons because I knew I would be sick. My guest asked the server to get a plate for the lemons. She said, \"we don't have plates.\"  The family who was seated at our table were extremely loud. After bringing these issues to the manager's attention, he said I was \"harassing him!\" Rather than deal with and fix the small problems, he immediately threatened to kick me out. I told him he didn't know what the word \"harass\" meant and that he should look it up in the dictionary. He called the mall security officers to remove us from the restaurant. This manager doesn't have any public relations skills nor is he respectful with guests.  The manager went to the table where we were seated and stood in front of this family yelling out loud to this family and others in the restaurant that I said they were loud. Everybody stopped talking to hear what he had to say. He intended to and did embarrass us. We were shamed as we left the restaurant with every guest staring at us as the security officers escorted us out. My guest never spoke to the manager to have any reason to be thrown out! The security officer told me that this manager has kicked out many guests in the past and also said he is not a nice person.  There are better restaurants in Las Vegas where you can get respectable service and the hot water you need. Neither my guest nor I consume alcohol to be accused of being kicked out for that reason.  I do NOT ever plan on dining at Benihana's again, you lost my business and that of my family and friends as I have already told them what happened.  Benihana doesn't care if a guest is publicly shamed or kicked out for doing nothing wrong. This manager is on a power trip. I suspect he threatened his employees not to say what happened when and if corporate investigates. They don't want to lose their jobs but they know that this manager bullies the guests by kicking them out by force. If you want to take a chance of being kicked out come to the Fashion Show Benihana, otherwise, enjoy a more peaceful restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually have a decent experience when I eat here. This rating is based on doing pick up orders. I have ordered food for pick up a few times and they seem to struggle with it. I've gotten wrong soup and over charged before. Tonight I was put on hold for over 15 minutes trying to put my order in. Whenever I've had an issue and bring it to their attention they act like it's not much of a concern to them. They need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"We've been to other Benihana's and this one is by far above the others. It's like straight out of a Jackie Chan movie. You walk up, the waitress takes you through a dimly lit walkway and foot bridge over a koi pond and past a fountain from the ceiling, up a small rickety, glass window elevator and into the seating area. The rest is normal Benihana! Great food with great service!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation 2 days in advance and still waited for 35 minutes. Wait staff and hostesses weren't a ball of sunshine either."}
{"text":"Good food but they need to change things up a bit. Been coming here for years and if I see the chefs do the onion choo choo or the beating rice heart one more time I'm gonna rip my eyes out. Last time one of our party of 7 was late and the hostess wouldn't sit us. After talking to the hostess I asked her to just change the reservation to 6 and sit him with us when he got here. She said she couldn't guarantee but looked like plenty of open seats at other tables. They quickly sat two people at our table even though they could have sat them elsewhere knowing our situation. My brother showed up 5 min later and was not able to sit with us. We usually come for my wife's birthday with my 4 children and drop about $300.00 for 6 of us."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, SLOW service. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because, well, I'm too nice. I rarely, if ever, complain in restaurants, preferring to rant afterwards to my fellow diners. But I just couldn't let it go this time. The second star was earned because the manager acknowledged waiting over an hour to get our food was unacceptable and discounted a portion of the meal. It was a shame the experience sucked because my dad was looking forward to seeing his visiting grandchildren get a kick out of the teppanyaki chef."}
{"text":"If you want ok food and a good time, this is the place to go.  If you want real Japanese food, go someplace else.  This is an overpriced place to get dinner.  My wife and I split 2 sushi rolls and the Hibachi Steak, it did fill us up and the sushi was okay, but the main entree that was $25, was very bland.    The service started off great from our waitress and then it just went down hill.  Maybe due to her not being seen for most of our meal time.    Would we go back for the sushi, no, any other reason, no.    If you go I hope you enjoy and have better than us.... Great potential at this place, it just didn't work for us."}
{"text":"Repeat customer.  Food is very very good.  Chef was entertaining and knowledge.  Fun to watch and interact with.  The drinks server was a little slow and had to be asked for refills and extra items.  The food was delicious and filling.  Overall an enjoyable experience even with the couple of missteps"}
{"text":"First, only those who absolutely love the tappenyaki experience would seek out this highly expensive place. They have shoved as many tables in this restaurant they could. You could hear the table next to you chewing their rice. Aside from being loud, they have made it nearly impossible for a family of four to have dinner. At least not the average salary earning family. And at these prices you should at least walk away full. Not even close.   I gave it 3 stars because the food is palatable, and the cook was funny."}
{"text":"Amazing food and conveniently located across the street from the Palazzo/Venetian Or if your staying at the Wynn its right next to that too and is located on the outside of the Las Vegas Fashion show mall"}
{"text":"Honestly, a negative star rating would appropriately rate this place.  When you go through the trouble of planning for an event, making a reservation, you would expect at the very least that a table would be ready when you arrive at the designated time with your party. Not the case.  And, the hostess lacks customer service skills.  No eye contact, no caring attitude.  And, really, why do all of the employees congregate at the hostess stand?  In this case probably because of the complete incompetence of the hostess, certainly not because of her warm demeanor.  After being pushed aside and ignored for 20 minutes, we left.  Don't waste your time here, it us as enjoyable as being stuck in a traffic jam."}
{"text":"We come here for birthdays every year. This last time was absolutely horrible. The service was terrible from start to finish. Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Benihana's when I took my girlfriend, we walked In and weren't even greeted. I had to walk up to tell them I had a reservation and the hostess almost looked at me In disgust for saying that. So immediately we were given terrible customer service, they called my name when I got up the hostess laughed \"haha not you so soon sorry\" It was quite embarrassing. Maybe she should have specified which David she was calling.   Now let's get cracking on the food side... I ordered the hibachi chicken which I heard was great! So I was excited to start eating and thought maybe the food would out weigh the horrendous customer service, I was wrong. The onion soup was as if someone crumbled up a bag of funions and went to the local pond for the broth and just mixed It together. My chicken was absolutely flavorless and let's not forget chewy... I couldn't finish It. It was like the chef was focusing on his comedy routine more than making sure the Sam and Ella was cooked out of my chicken. I just wanted to leave as soon as we could, terrible experience and highly disappointed. (They also didn't offer any green tea at the end of dinner like they said they would on the menu)"}
{"text":"The food and service at Benihana's is top notch. Definitely worth the price tag of about $35-50 a person depending on what you order.  The chef's offer great fun with the amazing food cooked in front of you and the service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"They have lunch prices even on the weekends. They food always taste good. You can sit in the bar and get the same food as at the tables. If you don't want to sit at the tables. Service is always good as well."}
{"text":"We came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We made 6pm reservations and got there a little early. The restaurant is set up into almost 2 different dinning experiences. One side is pretty basic dining and the other side is  set up with several chefs tables where you will be entertained by the chef and possibly be sitting with complete strangers. It was only the 2 of us, so after we were seated, the  hostess sat two more parties of 2 people. Each table accommodates 8 guests total. The show is fun, chefs are playing with your food while they cook it, and everyone gets to watch. We ordered the steak and chicken and the shrimp and chicken. Both entrees were part of a 5 course dining, including soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, main course white rice, vegetables and hot tea to finish. You have the option to substitute your rice for fried rice, and I highly recommend it! Best fried rice I've ever had!  At the end of our dining all of the servers gathered around and sang happy birthday in Japanese and then in English. They also offered a small dessert too. The prices are extremely reasonable here and the service team really exceeded our expectations. It is a great way to celebrate a birthday or any occasion."}
{"text":"Very poor experience and the staff are ridiculous I had to go get my own refills my reservations was 1:00 and I never got seated til 1:30 and never ordered my food til 2:00 it wasn't busy at all the manager don't care I told him politely and he just had a bad attitude I will definitely take my money somewhere else and they will be glad to serve me and will appreciate my presence very bad choice my fault NEVER Agian when I come with my family for spring break"}
{"text":"It's okay for me. I don't love it but I don't hate it either. The sushi and hibachi were good but nothing to be crazy over, imo.  Went here on a weekend so it was really busy so we sat in the bar seats instead."}
{"text":"i've been here approximately 4 times over the past year.  whereas i do wish the place was a bit nicer in terms of appearance, cleanliness is borderline acceptable (and that's putting it nicely), i have found the service to be fairly courteous.  what keeps the rating up for me is the food.  it's always prepared exactly the way i like it."}
{"text":"I love Benihanas, but this location was so nasty I couldn't even believe it. I'm turned off Benihanas for a while... the restaurant looks new and the cooks do too. The cook got our orders wrong, we had to switch plates with people we didn't know. The drinks was watered down. When the chef was cooking our food, food was falling off grill onto table and he would scoop it back into the grill.! I didn't wanna hurt the chef feelings due to the fact he look like this was his first job & that he just got out of training..."}
{"text":"Great hibachi grill. Better for lunch than dinner, but the food is always good and the entertainment is always spot on with friendly staff. This is also good for groups."}
{"text":"DH & I went to Benihana on friday night.  All of the food had too much butter and salt, which were the only seasoning used. We were crowded on our table, service was ok. Food could have had more taste. We had the chicken and shrimp entree with ice cream.  The hibachi at Sapporo was a lot better!"}
{"text":"Last night went to Benihana's for dinner at the Westgate Casino, the front desk hostesses are not too friendly but efficient. Our reservations were for 7pm but had to wait to have enough people to fill the table.  We were finally seated at 7:30pm.  The hostess was friendly, quick and very attentive.  She took our drink orders immediately and throughout our dinner, we never had to ask to have a refill, she just seemed to be there as soon as we needed another drink. The meal, as usual was delicious, but the highlight of the evening was our Japanese Chef, \"Antonio\". He was friendly, witty, funny, and very charming.  He did all the usual tricks, the volcano, the egg roll but the best was when he threw an egg in the air and it landed on his knife, split with no mess!!  The food was tasty, cooked well and plentiful.  The evening would have been a 5 star had it not been for the picture takers, there were 2, one very brassy and loud older woman, who is the Saleswoman, and the young brunette who actually takes the pictures.  We had barely been seated, when in they come, and they really hate to take no for answer!  When we explained we were locals and came often to the restaurant, the brassy one said to the young one,Well, we won't make money off of them.  The other 2 couples also felt that the older woman just didn't quit.  So ok, one couple decided to take their pictures, and right when the Chef is bringing in his cart,  brassy woman comes in again, giving her pitch for one picture $25, 2 pictures $40.  Of course, we all had to wait while the couple looked over the pictures in order to select the one they liked.  How about the picture taker stay outside the restaurant, since the pictures did not show the restaurant background anyway.  All in all, once that was over with, the evening progressed well, our table had fun and the meal was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is not for foodies. If you don't mind overpaying greatly for protein and vegetables with butter and oil and virtually no seasoning, you might not mind the ridiculous prices. The only reason I give it more than one star, is I see that it could be fun to bring a kid. But if you are coming to eat a good meal, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Our chef, Charlie made an extra effort to make sure we were all entertained and satisfied. I have been to several different Benihannas and she made this experience stand out from the others. The server, Jana was also very helpful and attended us regularly. I would definitely recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for her birthday, and received excellent service. And the food tasted really good,and we had a great time. And than a few hours later everything changed. All 4 of,us started experiencing bad stomach pains and spent the next several hours in agony. We have ate at this location several times in the past and have always experienced great service and food. So you can imagine that after this time,and all 4 of being ill, how the past experiences have dimmed into this one bad time. Not sure if you changed something in your food, or of we were served something bad. Only thing we had in,common was the shrimp appetizer, and the chickem fried rice. Sad that our fun turned into a awful stomach experience. Not sure if we will ever return now. Very sad, but can't feel this way ever again. The thing that makes me most mad is It cost about 200 dollars for this meal for my daughter's 18th birthday and it turned out to be a disaster. On other thing, used the restroom on way out. It was so dirty, and the whole floor was sticky. Like glue almost."}
{"text":"Dined at Benihana on the Vegas Strip for lunch. I was seated immediately and staff was extremely accommodating. I dined in a booth in the bar area of the restaurant.   Items ordered: Chili Shrimp Roll- consisted of crab, cream cheese, tempura shrimp (in buffalo sauce), garnished with jalape√±os and cilantro (this item was just okay, would not order again or recommend)  Lunch Duet: Hibachi Shrimp + Chicken Filet + Sea Scallops  Both lunch entrees were fabulous!   Quick dining experience when seated in the bar area. I would return and recommend."}
{"text":"This place has been mine and my family's favorite restaurant since it was the Samurai back in the 90s. Over the past 20 years or so that we've been coming here, I haven't had a single bad experience. Yes, sometimes you meet some \"unique\" people at your table, but I think that's part of the fun. Whatever you do, don't be that person who sits there with other people and never says hello. Doesn't mean you have to be BFFs the whole meal, but it makes it really uncomfortable if you don't at least try and be a little friendly. The staff here who have worked here for years (like Heidi), are some of the nicest people around, and if you are a good customer, they definitely appreciate it. The shrimp sauce here is far better than Ichiban, Saga, or Nakama. They don't do noodles and rice, but for me that is too many starches anyways. They recently switched to the jumbo shrimp, but if you want the regular size, just ask. They will also still do the \"Samurai Triple\" if you want it, though it isn't on the menu. Overall, they're very accommodating. It's pricey, but the quality is worth it. Also, sign up for the birthday club for a free meal on your birthday!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Benihana throughout the country and this location is the best so far. I love the scenic walk to the table with waterfalls, red bridges and flowers brought a serenity to my mind. The scents however, brought an aching in my stomach for seafood, fried rice and green tea ice cream. However, since I'm gluten-free, I knew that I would be limited to what food I could eat, just like every time I have been to Benihana in the past. This time, the magical waitress put a smile on my face that did not leave throughout the entire meal.  Benihana has finally gone gluten-free! Not only have they gone GF, but they have also trained their chefs how to avoid cross-contamination! JOY TO THE WORLD! For the first time in YEARS I finally had zucchini and onions with GF Tamari soy sauce, chicken fried rice with a steak and shrimp dinner. I had a salad without dressing (both of them have soy sauce) and no soup, but hey, I was OVERJOYED to FINALLY eat a traditional Benihana meal!  Not only was the food exactly how I remembered from before I was gluten-free, but the show the chef put on was great and the service was PERFECT. Our server was friendly, understood my allergy, was cautious, educative and such a good advocate for me.   The food was exactly the same as it is in other states. Even though it is nothing out of this world that will change your life forever, it is a good meal with a fun show, some laughter and plenty of hot sake keeping piping hot on the table griddle in front of you. All around it is always a good time.  P.S. If you are a local, get a player's card for the Hilton, show your NV ID and you will get 25% off your bill every time. Also, sign up for their emails and you will get a complimentary meal (up to $30, not including alcohol)the month of your birthday!"}
{"text":"I've come here for 12 years in a row.  Every time has been good until Saturday night Feb 6th,2016.  Son was asking if he could do the shrimp toss...and the cook threw a shrimp tail AT my son.  Spoke to the manager...he went and got another manager...spoke to him...then ANOTHER manager and chef came up to us.  Explained what happened again and they suggested the chef said it fell out of his hat.  WRONG!  Now I bring the table into our un-fun conversation.  Now the table is bothered.  They all explain that he threw the shrimp tail at my son.  Wanted an easy fun night...was willing to drop good money.  For the issue they covered our drinks.  IMO they should have covered the meal.  With all the good restaurants in Vegas not sure if I'll be returning.  We all left very unhappy with our experience.  I come to have fun and leave HAPPY.....this was not a happy experience.  If we go back I'll post another review."}
{"text":"Hibachi is my favorite and my go-to spot has always been Sapporo Scottsdale. However, now that I have a toddler I come here because it's extremely accommodating - especially for kids. As always, Benihana is entertaining and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I like coming here on my birthday because online they give you the coupon for the $30 off. I hate that the fried rice is extra so we only come if we have a coupon. We always have a good experience here and the food is great like every other hibachi place. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Great food, great show... What else can you expect? I have no idea why Benihana has as low a rating as it does."}
{"text":"Let's face it--Benihana isn't a fine dining experience and we didn't go for the first time in a decade for an otherworldly date night.  We did, however, go to reminisce on this sort of restaurant, and expected a decent well-priced meal with a fun atmosphere.   While the filet was delightful (shockingly so), and the yellowtail sashimi sufficient for our expectations, the Las Vegas roll was severely lacking, and the rest of the meal was served after apparently sitting around for a while.  Lukewarm food just doesn't cut it.  While we had hoped to enjoy the visit, there were just too many reminders why we haven't been in nearly ten years.  Nor will we return."}
{"text":"Love this place. We went with someone with a shell fish allergy and they did everything to ensure that no shell fish would touch her food.   The service was on point and they were all very pleasant. The table wasn't the funnest as there was some quite couples and ourselves. The cool did everything to try and pull some laughs out of them. I enjoyed her show this evening.   I love everything about this place and would go anytime I can."}
{"text":"At one point the chef tried to sell us a mixtape. He served our filet mignon to the person next to us,  then realized his mistake and instead of making more steak,  reaches onto the strangers plate that she had been eating from and took back the steak and served it to my girlfriend. Embarrassing. Will probably not dine here again. One star for yummy yummy sauce."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because my expectations were so low that I really liked this place. Hadn't been to one of these in probably ten years and didn't remember loving it then. I figured an old chain restaurant like this would be resting on it's laurels and really crummy. What a surprise!   It's a four star \"experience\" with three star food and fun/interestig/good service.   Food - It's fresh and nicely cooked but that's it. This is not a foodie restaurant. But if you are a foodie and you don't want to eat crappy food, this is a nice substitute.   Service- Very congenial, prompt and FUN. We sat at a cook table, and why else would you go here? We were seated with a young couple who had two tiny kids who were rambunctious and loud. And again.. that's the kind of place this is. So be prepared to actually deal with other people. if you want quiet go somewhere else.   Our cook chef was amazing. Really talented and charming. Made the experience wonderful.   It's different and fun, with nice people, nice service and decent food."}
{"text":"i would give it 5 stars because of the service and all the friendly workers,but the food i ate was not mouthwatering.i didnt go out of there happy for the taste of the food.none of it had any flavor.the steak and chicken was blah.sesame seeds and salt dont cut it for me.all i tasted was blood from my med.steak.i asked for spicy sauce on my chicken and it was so hot,it made my mouth and lips numb.the cook made me a new one but it had no flavor.it was my anniversary and i should have went to capital grill.maybe happy hour would be better just for a small lunch."}
{"text":"Great communication by general manager after difficulty using my birthday voucher. Turned a bad experience into a good one"}
{"text":"Oh the sorrow...   What can I say, I was expecting more. I had gone to another Benihana's in New Jersey, but we only went to the Teppanyaki part of it. I signed up online to get alerts for specials and such, so I got a $30 certificate for my birthday.   Went here Friday, with the hubster, because I called to see when their all you can eat sushi was. Luckily its everyday! Couldn't wait to have our massage and sushi date night!   Now, we've been to Japan, have had awesome sushi, love 202 Crazy Fish Sushi in Tempe and decided to try Benihana's...big mistake. I should've learned after we had gone to Kabuki, knowing that it's a chain and that the sushi is, well, bad. The variety was good, the fish wasn't its freshest fish and who puts mayo on their sushi? Why does this happen at chains? The sushi chef was Japanese, as was our waitress, so we talked to her a bit abt our visit to Japan, my sister in law, etc. But the sushi was warm, fell apart and the fish, bland...I'll just stickl w/ Crazy Fish, who does his sushi with love and knows what my husband and I like."}
{"text":"We RSVP for 4pm, got there nobody was around. Had to stop one of the guys that was working there going to the restroom. He went to back to get someone and 10 mins later the host came out she did not greet us or acknowledge us at all. (Very rude) Then another guest came in they went straight to the host (she was on the comp) asked for seats.  Then more guests came in she took care of them (they all waited to be seated) then the host came up to us, apologized and seated everybody. I was already annoyed. For a high end teppanyaki restaurant food was ok kind of bland and service was alright. I had better service and food was better at other places."}
{"text":"Hey it is all show, but at the end of the day the food is excellent with ample portions. Dare I say it is an American (Japanese) institution now."}
{"text":"Benihana is fantastic.  This location really takes it to another level with the decor and the kimono's. We have never had a bad visit. Everything is super fresh, from the soup, salad, veggies ,meat and seafood. The drinks are all incredible and they don't skimp on the alcohol. I always eat Rocky's choice which is chicken and steak and it's always perfect. My mom and husband eat Ocean Treasure which is shrimp,scallops and lobster and they are never disappointed. The show could use some updates,  it's been years since they changed that."}
{"text":"WORST! Dirty, got drinks spilled all over me. I cannot express how bad this was. The guy who dumped a platter of drinks, was like \"oh did it get on your shoes\"? Ummmm YES and my pants. I searched many months for my shoes, and to have a platter of drinks dumped all over me,  not a good time. Before you say  it, yes accidents happen, but No apology, nothing. When I asked our waitress for a towel to wipe up, she continued to take everyone's order and when i told my husband that I was going to go ask the manager for a towel, she finally stopped taking orders to get me a towel. My husband still went to talk to the manager and he never came over at all.  Poor, poor service and just NASTY!"}
{"text":"Came here last night. Real cozy clean place. Food  was freshly made. Had a chance to meet the owner.. I love it.. My food was amazing.. Drinks went up. The Chef is an amazing cook. Thanks Babe"}
{"text":"A friend and I came to Benihanas to celebrate our birthdays, we didn't let anyone know it was our birthday because we don't like being sang to but our chef Tito was awesome! We had a little kid sitting at our table that was really excited about watching the fire, etc. Tito did an amazing job at entertaining, not only the little kid, but the rest of our table as well. I even made a statement of how I had wished my parents brought me here as a child. A side from his awesome performance, I always love the food! Hits the spot and I would recommend this place for anyone!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience like always. The manager, Brian, is very friendly and customer service based. 10/10 would recommend :)"}
{"text":"pretty good, service was great, but the food tasted different from the bennihannas in the bayarea becuase they dont have garlic butter???"}
{"text":"The only difference between this Benihana and any other is that's it's really pretty inside. They have a lovely zen like waiting area with waterfalls a bridge and calming colors of red and gold and black..  Now the service and food is the same at any other and WAY overpriced for not even enough food to fill me up but it was a special occasion so it's always fun to see the \"performance\" of the meal preparations.  I use to enjoy sitting with strangers but I think now as I get older seating across from a more then PDA couple and offering me her I didn't finish my fried rice would you like it? faze has passed me."}
{"text":"My whole family was rushing to the bathroom after leaving this place. Even my 2 year old had diarrhea. The belly ache was the worst part. But on top of that, they had no hot tea (which comes with your entree) due to the hot water machine being broke. And they were OUT OF THE WHITE SAUCE! The food doesn't even taste good without the sauce. My sides were ice cold before I received my meat. I left smelling like smoke or the grill or some weird smell from there. The servers were friendly and the cook was entertaining, but I will never, ever, ever go back there."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed this place! I chose the Benihana Trio with filet mignon, chicken breast, and colossal shrimp. Amazing combo of some of my favorite plates! Our server was creative and fun! My friends and I really enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"We headed over to Benihana Chandler for a pre-birthday celebration for me.  It was a Thursday night and I was sure glad we had reservations.  I was delighted that we were seated at a chef table with another group who were also celebrating birthdays.  It turned out to be an awesome evening.  We all had so much fun.  The Chef was friendly and really did a wonderful job.  The little touches like a mickey mouse shaped pile of rice was excellent.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I had the chicken and shrimp which was wonderful.  I also tried spicy tuna sushi (for the first time) and loved it.  They were very organized and attentive to our every need.  We were so full and got so much more food than I had expected (my entree included a soup, appetizer of shrimp and a salad that was excellent).  I was happy to use my birthday coupon they sent to me via email.  It saved me 30.00 off the bill.  This is a fun place for a special night, lots of energy going on in the room.  I cannot wait to go back.  I also noticed they had a huge drink list.  I did not drink any alcoholic beverage that evening but when I go back I plan to try one of their fun tropical drinks.  One of them was a huge \"fish bowl\" type glass. It seemed the entire place was celebrating birthdays.  Oh they also sing to you and give you a free ice cream if it's your birthday. All around fun."}
{"text":"Over priced for the service and quality of food. If your paying for the experience the chefs at this location fall very short from being entertaining. The servers were pretty much non existent, so our table was piled with soup and salad dishes and our glasses were empty the whole time. I would not visit another Benihana based on the experience at this location. I'm still not sure why our meal was so expensive because it was pretty equal to anything I could halve gotten at Panda Express.  We should have known this wasn't going to be the best experience when the hostesses were confused by our reservation. We were trying to be understanding since we had made the reservation online, but being sat almost an hour after our reserved time was unnecessary."}
{"text":"If you want to sit on the toilet for a few days come here.   I came here for my birthday in hopes of having a great dinner. Boy was I wrong.   First of all it was nearly empty on a Saturday night. That should've been a clue.   The service was mediocre. It nearly took 2 hours to eat. The more time that passed the more aggravated I got I just wanted to get up and leave. The chef ended up burning our food and barely put enough seasoning so the food came out bland and burnt. My shrimp was undercooked.   Very pricey for shitty food. I won't be back.   As soon as I finished eating I wanted to throw up. I come to Benihana all of the time but this location disappointed me. The stomach ache I had to the last few days of my birthday trip disappointed me too."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group for lunch, and we all ordered Teppanyaki. It was pretty cool to watch the chef cook! (although we also realized how much butter/cream goes into the food haha)   Unfortunately, our group of 11 might have been a little too big for the table, since it took a while to get all of our food cooked, and we all ended up eating our meat at different times. The portions are also rather small, but the lunch deal is still a fair price. The food was nothing special, but the show and service was great!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! At $2.50 per slice of sashimi, I expected a lot better than a recently defrosted and grainy slice of tuna. Also, do not get the Lobster Roll...it tastes like shrimp tempura that costs $27.   The service was also bad. The manager knew we had a large party (we made reservations) and assigned a new waitress to handle the table by herself. We got through half of the meal before getting our beers, and it took 30 min (not exaggerating) to get our bill. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Benihana's has been around for such a long time, I wouldn't think I would leave out there feeling 'meh'.  Customer service was great, our hibachi chef was nice but the food not so much. Never had yum yum sauce taste like bland mayo. Never had ginger sauce taste like soy sauce. And they give you gallons of it at the table. I had a small plate of fried rice, tofu and vegetables. Overall, Benihana's still does good hibachi, but not as good as other hibachi restaurants in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food , most times I'm In here. This place use to be hit or miss but lately they have been consistent   3 stars for the service.  They have been going through to many servers recently."}
{"text":"What happen to the service here? Our group wasn't greeted right away and the servers seemed to not be there. We use to love this location. Maybe we went in on a bad night but some of the staff need to be retrained on hospitality because they seem really disinterested in anything we were inquiring about.  The quality of the food was still the same that was the only plus part about our dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago . I recamen go sime where els n eat"}
{"text":"I had an excellent time here 2 weekends ago, and experienced great customer service and ate like a king of yore. The staff were attentive, helpful, and always there when you needed them. Will be heading back here soon, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The front of the house was very unprofessional and not very accommodating. For the amount of money spent, I was not impressed by the food either.  All around, just a bad experience. Super disappointed because I was really looking forward to it..."}
{"text":"This far and beyond other hibachi in the area as far as taste and consistency.   We had David who was great. Very entertaining and very well attentive chef. Everything was done properly. We had a party of 10 which was a little cramped but it all worked fine.   We had a reservation for 8:30 and it was very close to the time we got seated. Not bad for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is always great.  We made reservations for a date here. We got sat right away.  The service is always fast and very entertaining. Somehow the chefs always have a way of making their show entertaining and unique to them.  So we were very pleased with the entertainment! It is exciting to see your meal cooked right in front of you.  Our guy made a heart and made it beat which was awesome!  The food is guaranteed good. Always love the soup and salad to start. The chicken and rice I got was excellent as well.  I was very happy with this Benihana's. I have been to other locations as well. They are always great!"}
{"text":"Experience at Benihana or on the strip was very condescending and non-Caring. I hate today society when they pass the buck and nobody's knows anything. I picked up order to go  and I waited 10 minutes before anybody would even wait on me and then I still got it wrong I would not recommend this at all."}
{"text":"So I go to Benihana's frequently enough that I know all the tricks and the scene but this one really surprised me.  I chose this restaurant to have a family dinner because it is loved by most of my family.  I went here thinking I knew already how the night was going to be played out.  I was caught off guard the second I walked in the door.  The inside takes you to a land far far away...filled with bamboo, little creeks with running water, and hostesses in full Kimono gear.  There are plenty of nice lounge chairs to sit and wait for your table...I was so used to getting crammed into the tiny waiting area or packed into the miniature bar were I can basically blow my wad right there...  I was soooo excited to see our little buzzer light up because now I get to go up their lil' hut inspired elevator to the second floor where all the tables are set up.  I was pleasantly surprised to see all the chefs were actually Japanese! Say wha!  Where are the Mexicans!!!  I am soo used to them talking in a language that I do not understand to my husband that is of the bean persuasion.  Now, for the first time, my husband and I will both not know what is being said.  They have different tricks while cooking too!  Not the same ole stuff like at all the other ones.  It is truly stunning here...a nice fun meal for a family.  Beautiful d√©cor.  They had this bitchy old lady that got all pissy when I didn't want to buy the picture she took of me and the family though...boooooo"}

{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE for lunch if you got less than 2hours lunch break. We came in 11:45, there was only 2 other table at the time.  we got our water at 12:15, took our order at 12:25, chief finally came at 12:39. The soup was bitter, salad was plain, no taste at all. Over all it was hour and half experience waiting for food."}
{"text":"Ok so after I was invited back by management, I wanted to update my review a bit. I still am not a huge fan of this place as the experience versus the price is not worth it. We received better service from both our waiter and our teppanyaki cook this second time around. However, it should not take a poor experience to receive a good one. I believe and always have that there is ok such thing as a VIP table/ guest as everyone deserves star treatment when they decide to go out and pawns their money on not just good food but a memorable experience. Thank you to the manager and staff for attending to us and making sure it was done right but please remember that it should be like that every time."}
{"text":"Benihana is usually a good time, but our most recent visit fell short. After being seating almost 30 minutes after our reservation time, we waited another 45 minutes for the chef. The food was great, but our waiter seemed to be struggling. He forgot several things on the chef's cart (which annoyed the chef), failed to bring the complimentary dessert (ice cream) to everyone at our table, and seemed frantic and rushed the entire meal. When it came time to check out, he returned our booklet without returning the credit card used for payment. We got up to look for the waiter and found the credit card on the ground, under another table across the restaurant. Overall, our Sunday night out turned into a frustrating, three-hour endeavor. Disappointing visit at this location."}
{"text":"The management of this restaurant is AWFUL. Had a 6:30 reservation tonight (a Wednesday). Showed up at 6:25, our entire party of 8 was present. Half the restaurant was empty and they said those tables were only for lunch (umm what?!). We finally got seated at 7:00. We placed our order immediately upon being seated. Soup and salads came out fairly quickly...8:00 and still no chef. Management kept telling us the chef was coming now, and nothing. I finally went into the kitchen, and had every single Prep cook and chef come out and tell me why we had no food on our table. They were all super nice and apologetic. Clearly the issue is with management. I should have known when I saw a server fighting with the manager when we walked in over the way he was seating tables. Finally, we ended up walking out without eating, as we had 3 kids under the age of 4 who were all antsy and hungry. It's too bad, this was one of my favorite hibachi restaurants but I will NEVER go back as long as it remains under this management. I'll also be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option, I'd go with that. This is my second attempt here. First time took us two hours to get out of here with four kids under six years old.  Tonight?  We're at the 90 minute mark with four kids and the chef hasn't arrived at the table. This place SUCKS!!!  Never again. The manager has been to our table four times promising something will happen. Nada."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I have been coming here for my birthday for the past 4 years but new to this specific location. This one stands out of all the rest (in a better way) because of the great atmosphere. It has more of a traditional feel. But still overpriced. I also got my picture taken here which was great but they need to update their camera. The quality is from a camera that looked like it was at least 15 years old. It would have been nice to get a good picture."}
{"text":"Love Tony! Best chef ever. So accommodating and made the experience so amazing. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Came here at 5:00 on a Friday and absolutely loved it! To begin our server Kim was helpful and super friendly she suggested great items and would love to come visit her again! For starters we started with a seaweed salad,salmon roll and I finished with the seared ahi which was divine. This location is definitely a more modern take then it's counterpart at the Westin. I really would love to come back and have the lychee martini! Definitely give this place another visit!"}
{"text":"I used to go to benihana in Burlingame CA, probably 20 times and I liked it but it's not one of my favorite places.  This one was worse, the cook sucked and they cut corners by doing things like already having the fried rice cooked and just heated it on the grill and added the egg.  Not a fan, go to P.F Changs down on paradise or at planet hollywood if you want a nice atmosphere and some \"americanized\" asian food to please a group for less dough.  Better yet drive east on spring mountain and try something interesting and authentic for half the price."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Was told to avoid hour and a half wait to go in the lounge. Sat at a dirty table (only one available) and was totally ignored for 15 minutes so we left. Never again."}
{"text":"Freaking good!  It's inside the Hilton, but once you go through the maze and pass by all of the casino areas, you'll find the Benihana.  Walking in, it was beautiful.  You go by a walkway with twinkly lights and a tall waterfall and a zen garden.  After getting seated with people that we didn't know, we ordered and the chef came.  His jokes were really cheesy, but it was really fun because he was so interactive.  I got the Habachi steak and BF got the filet mignon.  I really should have gotten what he got.  His steak was cooked perfectly and was not chewy at all (unlike mine).  All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences of dining. My family and I wanted to celebrate my nieces birthday by taking her to one of her favorite restaurants \"Benihana\". I called 3 hours prior to our arrival to book our reservation of 11. We arrive promptly on time and the host informs me he cannot find our reservation. Skip ahead 20 minutes and the whole host staff was able to find the reservation but it had been canceled in error. The host that canceled it admitted fault but they had no available tables. Naturally, I argued that we shouldn't have to suffer due to their error. The host girl said \"well, at least you don't have to wait an hour, be grateful.\" I was so appalled at the disrespect and awful customer service. Luckily we were able to find another establishment \"Osaka Japanese\" and they were able to seat us immediately and my niece had a great rest of her birthday. Please seek other restaurants other then Benihana."}
{"text":"2 words... LUNCH SPECIALS. I used to think that Benihana food was only for special occasions and the day you get your tax return, but with their lunch specials - I can have delicious, fantastic, fresh, beautiful food for lunch at around 10-12 bucks!  I went with a friend and we were in and out under 45 minutes - I ordered the lunch boat for $12.50. It started with Miso Soup, followed by a fresh salad with ginger dressing, then my main course came - From left to right, orange slices, edamame, 8 pieces of California roll, Tempura (2 Shrimp, 1 sweet potato slice, 1 onion ring, 1 cucumber slice, large bowl of rice, and Julienne Beef with teriyaki sauce.   The food was on par with Benihana quality - even though it wasn't cooked in front of me Teppan style, I could still tell it was fresh - and for a fraction of the price that I would have paid for dinner - I am certain to go back once or twice a week now!"}
{"text":"Everything was burnt!.....Dried out, over salted with soy sauce.....So disappointed, we came for a celebration (This is our go to place)......**Our server was great as usual (Chong)!....The two stars are for the grilled food"}
{"text":"Good food and good show! The kids loved it and the wait was minimal. Not sure why the rating is pretty low. The lady who sat us down seemed pretty rushed but after that everyone was great, including our servers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant however today as I was eating my shrimp I noticed the poop shoot was still on the shrimp yuck."}
{"text":"If your restaurant closes at 10 pm then why can't I order fried rice TOGO at 9:30?!! That's absolutely ridiculous, I work in the industry and we would NEVER turn away business because \"we are getting ready to close\". Extremely rude job hostess!!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order today for lunch and grabbed it on my way home. I was so excited for my chicken and shrimp lunch selection but when I got home and opened the box-I swear this is the kid's lunch portion? For $17-I was expecting more than 4 pieces of shrimp and a few bites of chicken. Now I'm out $17 AND I'm Hangry."}
{"text":"I pretty much just like eating sushi here and its not all that great here. I dont ever pick this place by choice its always someone's birthday or something and they have never been so we all end up here like other's have said. They do have good drinks here I think they discontinued their specialty sangria though that was my fav. Teppanyaki is always fun but you will pay handsomely for the ambiance here. Go if you have $ to spare, or have never been!! It is fun for groups and or special events, great for kid's. Last time I went I saw nothing but High School kids in prom dresses."}
{"text":"Ok. It started out as a rough night . 40 minutes late honoring our reservation, lack of communication from management. Slow service once we did get seated. Our 8:30 reservation was not met with any food until at least 9:30. Really crazy. However, it was made alllll better by our chef, Tito. When we go back and we *will* go back -- we will ask for Tito.  Is he Japanese? No, but he is awesome.   To apologize the manager did comp our entire meal... We were a party of 10 -- and we took good care of our servers...it really wasn't their fault. Happy Xmas eve Tito you know how to do it right. Thanks."}
{"text":"What a great experience! I often go to this chain of restaurants in the LA area and thought I had seen some of the best chefs. Well I was blown away by this location. We went for lunch and as soon as we arrived we were greeted by a nice gentleman, we were seated right away. The waitress was on it when it came to getting anything we needed. Our chef was Hans and I must say he was amazing. He was joking around with the kids at the table, was great taking count that one of the table mates was allergic to shrimp and made the best scallops we had tasted. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience at this place tonight. We wanted to celebrate my mother-in-law's 89th birthday with a special night out. Had reservations for 7 people at 7:15pm. Arrived there at 6:45 and were told our table would be ready in just a few minutes. We had drinks at the bar while waiting and the bartender was in a bad mood and let it show. After waiting for 45 minutes, our table still was not ready. We finally walked out after waiting for over 50 minutes for our reserved table.  Never, never going back there again!"}
{"text":"cocktails are amazing love soup service sucks been here almost an hour theyre still not cooking"}
{"text":"I've dined here plenty of times, but before reviewing this fine dining establishment, a slight \"correction\" needs to be made.  The hotel where it is located is no longer the Las Vegas \"Hilton.\"  Today, the letters LVH now stand for the Las Vegas \"Hotel.\"  But, this elegant and happy eating place is still there, and the food is still terrific.  But, every great place sometimes has a \"negative,\" or two...  For example, one gets used to seeing a friendly, smiling Japanese male coming to your table, bowing deeply and speaking to you with a delightful, \"broken English\" Japanese accent (even if it is an \"act\").  Those days are gone, unfortunately, because Equal Employment Opportunity Laws in the USA mandate that ANYONE can cook your meal for you at your table, as I discovered when a non-Japanese person arrived with our food, a few years ago.  Personally, I don't really care about the gender and/or the race of the person cooking our food, but having a non-Japanese performing that task (and he did it FLAWLESSLY, by the way) is akin to having a non-Vulcan as a Science Officer aboard the USS Enterprise.  It's like meeting TARZAN in person, and discovering that he's not wearing a loincloth.  But, that aside, I urge you to patronize Benihana as often as you can, because the food really is meticulously prepared, and the staff are most cordial and professional.  I have no hesitation about recommending them, and I enjoy their cuisine, whenever possible.  All of the food preparers have a Black Belt in Cooking, regardless of ethnicity."}
{"text":"Good food service was a lil to long but everything else was cool.I love there crunchy rolls was full ass hell."}
{"text":"For a place w only 3 stars you'd think they would have more availability. I've tried to eat here twice now and have been turned away twice. I don't think I'll ever try again.   Once, we went in and despite what looked like an empty dining area we were told that they had no availability for 5 hours.   The second time I called for a reservation (on a WEDNESDAY) a few hours from the time we wanted to celebrate my mom's birthday (a 5:30 pm time). I was told there is no availability at all from 4:45 to 8 pm.  I guess this is good for the Cheesecake factory nearby. Haha. Party of 8 coming at ya Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Benihana is pretty pricey. We spent 15o$ Lobster with shrimp/ scallop 50$ Steak & shrimp $ 30 something can't recall exactly  3 chicken fried rice 24$ ( 8$ each)  I feel Benihana is a scam when it comes to the rice Your food is suppose to come with a rice  But the charge you a extra $8 for a side of chicken rice but wait WHERE IS YOUR ORIGINAL RICE YOUR ENTITLED TO ????? You must ask for it you won't get it.  Also bought one alcohol beverage $14   Honestly I think Benihana food is good the experience of the CHEF IS GOOD BUT SITTING IN AWKWARD SILENCE WITH AWKWARD PEOPLE CAN BE STRANGE EVERYONE ACTS TO SCARED TO TALK.   Ps  Make reservations"}
{"text":"This was the final destination of all the hibachi places in Pittsburgh that I visited and it was by far the least appealing and most expensive. Paid $35 for \"filet\" and scallops. I will say the scallops were good, but the \"filet\" was pathetic. I am not sure of the exact cut of meat, but it was unlike any filet I've ever had. Almost seemed like stew meat (photo included). Upon ordering, the waitress asked if you'd like white or fried rice, but never mentions there is a $4 up-charge for the fried until the bill comes. For $39 I could have had a far superior meal elsewhere. To top it off, we applied a coupon to the meal and it came off the post-tax amount. Guessing they just pocket the difference. Upon leaving the place, our clothes had a very strong smell of grease. Honestly would have rather paid $10 for food court style Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day and the food was mediocre, the service was TERRIBLE and the bathrooms were filthy. It was a huge disappointment on Mother's Day, we will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Been to Benehana's multiple times. Our host was Loren. This guy was great. The food is always good but, when you get a great host cooking for you it makes it even better. He was engaging, great with kids, and funny. Got the steak and shrimp. The steak was cook to a perfect medium. Great experience and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but it's a great discomfort when you sit at a table with perfect strangers.  At first, you are not sure where to put your eyes and when to stop fake-smiling.  The conversations are so far and few in between and sound unnatural. And you are finally relieved when the chef shows up to break up the silence. I said all that to say...BUT once you get past the awkward moments, the evening at a Benihana's table for a teppanyaki meal becomes entertaining, relaxing and fun.  But it's best when you bring your own cool crew, but you probably knew that.  The food was okay for my taste, but a meal always tastes better when shared among good company. I'm just sayin..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for rude customer service, look no further. I reserved a table for 3 through Open Table for 7:30, upon arriving I wasn't sure what name our reservation was under so I asked the hostess. She seemed bothered with her heavy sigh and eye roll that I would even ask such a question. She said it was under my name, then said \"come talk to me when it's closer to 7:30.\" Befuddled, I just gave her a blank expression. I then cancelled our reservation and walked right out. I don't have time to tolerate rude unprovoked behavior like that.  Peace Benihana. I guess I'll never know what deliciousness you have to offer."}
{"text":"Horrible when I arrived  they said they are sold out but they could squeeze is in in 20 min when I looked around two thirds of the tables were empty I asked one of the people that worked here and they stated they don't have enough chefs and how short staffed  The 20 minute wait has turned into 45 minute wait and we are still not seated Update they seated us it is now over two hours and we still have not had someone cook food very disappointed never coming back here again"}
{"text":"What's the deal with NO Shrimp sauce?   This makes or breaks it for us.  We went a few weeks ago for the first time since moving to AZ and discovered they don't have shrimp sauce.  Please let us know if they decided to make the smart decision to have shrimp sauce."}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the one in San Diego several times and I have never had a bad time.  My food always comes out pretty good and the service is great.  The only thing I dislike is the wait on busy nights. Benihana+good company+Benihana version of a Long Island Iced Tea=good times!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 7 pm. They told us the wait will be 15 minutes. What good is a reservation if you can't honor it?"}
{"text":"Birthday signup we got the $30 gift card and went over mid week.  Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.   But the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade."}
{"text":"Look. I have never had a positive Benihana experience but per previous posts my daughter loves this place. So I suck it up.  We are 40min into seating and have not even placed an order. Mom always said if you do not have anything good to say ...  First update. manager blamed server . Unbelievable   Second update. Made the whole order chicken fried rice. I wanted vegi  Unbelievable part is that the manager threw his staff under the bus. Seems to be re occurring per staff   Staff is great. Manager not so much   End result two + hour service   I'd say I'd never Benihana again"}
{"text":"What?? A Benihana where the chef,s are actually Japanese??? That's right!! A totally authentic experience. Everything is typical Benihana, but this particular restaurant has a large koi pond inside with a waterfall and bridge to walk over it which makes for a very nice ambiance. There was also a photographer (works for an outside company) taking souvenir photos. Overall this was a nice experience and I will probably go back if I'm staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"Super good. Fun area the food was amazing. Good service. Overall solid 4 or 5. We had a group of 11 and had an great time."}
{"text":"If I could give this location a 0 I definitely would, but don't  get me wrong but I love Benihana, but for some reason this location is horrible. Upon arrival we had to make reservations, so once we got there for our reservation we had to wait an additional 30 minutes to be seated which is absurd because of the simple fact that we made a reservation prior. So finally we are seated with a party of 2 and we started to look at the menu. The waitress had no type of etiquette and didn't bother to ask if we wanted water or even bring us water. She was very impatient and not knowledgeable about dining in. One of my girlfriends from our dinner party had a $30 coupon to use if an adult entree was purchased but apparently we read that wrong since the waitress and the manager came to the table saying we needed to order two adult entrees when the coupon said in fine bold print that only one entree is needed to use the coupon. The entire experience from the restaurant was ridiculous and wish I would've had a better experience."}
{"text":"This Benihana location is pretty great, I must say. We eat there a few times a year, but most recently for my daughter's 10th birthday. She wanted the Beni shrimp, and she had such a good time! Our waitress Minsook was so sweet and attentive to our party, I can't say enough about her.   The thing I don't like about hibachi is waiting for a table, so I definitely recommend making a reservation (can be done on their website) and going on a weeknight. I also don't like crowds and I was surprised at the fact that it wasn't very busy on a Thursday night. The wait time for our table was surprisingly very fast, too! We had 6 in our party and I appreciate that they didn't throw 2 strangers at our table.   I deducted one star because since we've eaten hibachi so many times, the 'show' is starting to get a little boring. The onion volcano and zucchini boat are great but give us more!"}
{"text":"I starting coming to Benihana in 2010 and would consistently visit until 2014. That year I had a rather unpleasant birthday experience that left me not wanting to return.   ::cue flashback::  I had made a reservation for a set amount of people but had a few additional friends show up as a surprise for my birthday. This upset the manager at the time and he chastised me in front of all my guests for being unaware that there was going to be extra people. An honest mistake but the manager made such a huge deal about it being a safety issue that some of my friends left to appease him. However, throughout the meal that followed, other restaurant guests (not from our table) were walking directly behind our chef while his knives were out and in use. If safety was such an issue you'd think something like that would not happen or the manager would do something about it. Nope!  ::end flashback::   Needless to say, I swore off Benihana until this year, when I decided to give them another try...or two, to be exact.    Both visits were around 7:45/8:00pm. Both times we were early for our reservation. Both times we had to wait passed our reservation time to be seated and guests without reservations were sat before us. Why even make a reservation at all? Perhaps as a courteous to the restaurant so they can attempt to staff properly? Thanks?  Teppanyaki is communal dining around a grill so you will be sat with others you don't know. If that bothers you, I suggest gathering enough of your friends and family together that your group will take up a whole table. The other guests we were sat with during this year's visits have been great so no issues there.   Visit A: Friendly and entertaining chef, plenty of drink refills, great commemorative birthday photo, and very accommodating of dietary restrictions.   Visit B: Felt bad for the chef who seem overwhelmed, issues with multiple orders, lacked drink refills, not a great photo and special requests were ignored.   Both times dinner took us until closing time (10pm). Two hours for a meal seems a bit long to me and the younger kids at the table during Visit A were practically asleep by the time the check arrived.    Also, green tea is offered as part of the dining experience. The first time I accept it and stayed up WAYYYYYYYY too late that evening. The second time, I declined. Maybe a decaffeinated option could be offered later in the day?  During both visits the bathroom was gross. Three stalls and each had issues: gross, messy, unflushed, and no toilet paper. Dirty bathrooms make you think dirty kitchen. Yuck-O!   Thank goodness for their genius marketing with the $30 birthday coupon or I doubt they'd have as much business as they do. Both visits, almost every table was sung \"Happy Birthday\". We are now pros at joining along with the song set to the tune of \"If You Are Happy and You Know it Clap Your Hands\"...Which seems like a subtle subliminal messaging now that I think about it. Touch√©, Benihana, touch√©."}
{"text":"One of the best Benihana locations I've tried. Chef Eric was great with the show and food were perfect. Three stars because Jana, the server wasn't that friendly and her service seemed more fitting for Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I have been to Benihana many times over the years. Beverly Hills, San Diego etc.... I read a bunch of negative online reviews about the location in Vegas. The fact that my wife and I share very close birthdays brought us to the Vegas Benihana. They gave us a $30 credit EACH. $60 bucks! I have enjoyed my experiences in the past so I figured, how bad could a Benihana be? Especially with a $60 credit!   This location is the nicest I have seen. Gorgeous. Trees, waterfalls, elevators....When we checked in at the front desk, they took a birthday photo of us. I thought, oh here it comes, they will want $20 for the picture. Nope! They handed us a free birthday photo! How cool is that! I also expected the food pricing to be higher than any other Benihana as stated in other reviews. It was not.   This is NOT an inexpensive place and some would say you are being over charged, but it is a Benihana. You are paying MORE for the experience of knives and food flying dangerously close to your face.   I had 2 drinks and the wife had one. We had the Teriyaki steak and the Filet Mignon. The cost was less than I have spent at most steakhouses. ESPECIALLY with the $60 credit! (THANK YOU BENIHANA for the birthday gift! More than I can say for my buddy Bob. Wait, did I just say that? Sorry Bob, I am kidding)  Look, this place is a Benihana. No more, no less. All the negative reviews seem strange to me. Not sure what they were expecting. Every single cook was actually Japanese! Felt very authentic. Super friendly staff and very attentive. If you are on the fence, don't be. Just go with friends and have a good time. They have $8.95 drinks! Go most places and you are lucky to pay less than $12!   The only real negative is the seating arrangement. Unless you go with a group of friends that fill up the seats, they seat you with strangers. Kinda like a Club Med Benihana experience. Cool for Club Med, not cool for dinner in Vegas unless you are in that type of \"wanna meet new people\" mood. I was not."}
{"text":"So we sat at Table 5 and our chef was Aaron , our server was Jasmine ticket #40023. So everything started out well, we received our table in the time we reserved. Our server started us out with water as we placed our drinks/sushi/and food orders. Our sushi came late, like after our soup. And only one of the two rolls came. We had to inquire about the 2nd roll. The second roll came after our chef had began serving the rice and stuff. (We rejected the second roll, it was already time to eat the main meal). There were times we had to ask for our waitress to find out where our regular steam rice was, or for refills, or for another fork. Seemed once the chef came it was a total disregard for the table.   So as we were talking about our service and another table enlightened us to the fact that the chefs don't get none of the tips at the end of the night that you give to the server. You have to tip the chef independently in order for them to receive any tips. In my opinion I think that's total crap, the chefs are the personalities that everybody gets to meet in deal with not the server. That policy should be reversed where all tips go to the chef, if you want to tip the waitress then do so.  Aaron was a great chef and a good personality! We def be back to see HIM"}
{"text":"Sometimes i get a craving for teppanyaki. And that is the first thing that happened when we got to Las Vegas. So i asked my dad if he could take us to the Hilton for some Benihanas.   All the performances are the same, maybe cliche, but the food is always great. But still, i dont think it's worth the money, too expensive. I don't need to see my food get cooked, i just want to eat it. Especially if the performances are always the same, whether i eat at Benihanas in Las Vegas or in San Francisco."}
{"text":"I got a coupon for this place, so decided to give it a try.  Seating is family style, so we sat next to another family.  We order the meat and other ingredients and then a cook comes and cooks the food in front of us.  In the process, he puts on a little performance.    The food was very average.  My meat was on the salty side, but everything else lacked flavor. It seems that the cook was trained to cook a certain way, as I look around and they're all doing the same thing. I would probably not come here again for the food.    Service was decent. Our waitress came over a few times to check up on us.  If you haven't been to this type of place, then I'd recommend it just to check it out."}
{"text":"I definitely would have given four stars at least in the past, but now Benihana only warrants 1 star in my book, (which is unfortunate given how amazing their yum yum sauce is.) We arrived on a Friday night and anticipated a wait given that we didn't have the foresight to make a reservation in advance. Tonight, however, was ridiculous. The host initially said that reservations were made for the entire restaurant but later slipped and mentioned that they only had two chefs on staff and were severely understaffed. The latter of the two reasons I can understand; the initial excuse, however, was ridiculous. In the years that I've visited this location, this has never been the case. A wait, yes, I can live with that.   At any rate, we had the option of sitting in the lounge which I was fine with. (Ecstatic no, but like I said, that yum yum sauce... I guess I can pass up the live entertainment.) We were told the wait for the lounge area was five minutes, which is acceptable in my book. I figured that this would be the perfect time to use the restroom and began my trek to the back of the restaurant. 1. The evidence of the \"short staff situation\" was proven by the state of the bathrooms. Horrendous! 2. There was no one seated throughout the restaurant except for one lonely couple in the lounge. Besides the three small parties that were waiting for a table, the place was a ghost town.   After 20 minutes of waiting for a table in the lounge we left. It's clear that over the past few years that the establishment has slowly been going into decline, but this just solidifies what I assumed during my last few visits - this place is probably not going to bounce back.   I'm breaking up with you Benihana. If I wanted long wait times, offensive bathroom conditions and poor service I would have went to Perkins."}
{"text":"So we found out why people hate this place.  We were cut off after probably drinking enough cocktails, but that is not the bad part.  I understand when a restaurant thinks someone has had enough to drink and they say no more.    The crazy part is they also cut us off from eating....What???  Awkward and embarrassing,  won't be back :-("}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. Horrible waitstaff and manager. Went here on my birthday with an email of $30 dollars off. First off, they sat us 20 minutes after our reservation, service was slow, and waitress lied to us. They wouldn't let us use the gift certificate they sent to us in email because we didn't physically print it. Then the waitress told us that we could come in with the physical printout and they would credit us back. Well we went back in and the manager said she couldn't do that. Talk about lack of customer service, absolutely absurd. We also shared a table with other people who had the same certificate and they gave them a hard time as well. Don't bother wasting your money on mediocre food."}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day and had reservations. It's a busy day overall in the restaurant industry but they were not shy to hurry everything along. My irritations are as follows; they ran out out of chocolate ice cream, they had no miso soup, didn't offer us the lunch menu and sushi menu at all. I also had to hunt down the manager in order to get our picture done as our server just disappeared. I think we won't be back as the amount of money spent for this type of establishment just isn't worth it when competitors like Ah-So, Osaka, etc are popping up. I do prefer the Chandler location over this one. **Note to Management- invest money into your bathrooms please! Soap dispensers don't work and it's in need of some attention cosmetically!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a great review unfortunately I can't. We had reservations for 10, it took our waitress at least 30 min before she gave us drinks. Then it took an hour and a half for the chef to finally come and cook for us! We were there for 3 hours! There was a photographer who took our pictures and at then end of dinner when she came back around to show us the pics to see if we wanted to buy any she was able to sell us on one pic. She walked away with a salty attitude and told us in a very short way \"thanks, have a great day.\" Listen people are here to have dinner not to be bothered with some photographer trying to sell us on something else. Menu says $35 for an entree and $5 extra for a side of fried rice. Rice came in a small rice bowl. Then we quickly found that if you wanted to split an entree you had to pay an extra $10. This place is is ridiculously expensive. The food is good but my money has been better spent on better food and better service with better prices. I will never go back to any benihanas. It is such a rip off!! Money hungry restaurants who only care about making money off of you instead of providing quality service so that you will come back! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"So extremely disappointed! We had dinner here for my daughters 9th birthday the staff is horrible the girls are so rude , they sang happy birthday & one girl was so upset she was singing to my child idk if she was having a bad day or wtf the issue was but it's very upsetting having my daughter point her out when she's looking at her pictures & videos! NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN! The one star is all to our waiter because she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. The food was really good including sushi.  It's cool to watch your food being cooked by a chef with jokes!! The inside is beautiful. Pricey but worth the experience!!"}
{"text":"Loved our food being cooked in front of us! The chef was exceptional with his tricks. Awesome shrimp and chicken,"}
{"text":"Located inside the Westgate casino and resort, Benihana is a very family friendly atmosphere and such a breath of fresh air compared to the smoky casino that you have to walk through to get there.   We were seated immediately since we got there shortly after opening. We orders hibachi steak, seafood Diablo, mango shrimp and Philadelphia rolls. The waitress was very attentive, and the chef was your typical hibachi chef, with the same \"volcano, choo choo train, and egg flying tricks\".  It seems these tricks with the food are standard across the US.  I will add that the chef was very accommodating, when my boys dumped the whole bottle of soy sauce in their rice. He went to the back and brought out more fried rice for them, and get this...... it had chicken.   The reason why I left out a star was because while the food was excellent, the portion sizes were way smaller than your typical Japanese steak house and the prices were a lot higher.   Overall we had a great experience, but I was still a little hungry. I may have been the smallest one in our group, but I sure do eat like my husband."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever gotten. We made a reservation for a birthday party and everyone showed up on time; however, the hostess made us wait another 30 minutes because she mistakenly thought we need a table for 24 (the reservation was for 12). We finally got seated, only to find out 10 minutes later that 3 complete strangers would be sitting with us (after we specifically asked for them not to do that). Then, only 1 of our servers for our 2 tables came over and proceeded to take drinks orders only for the first table. When we asked her if she could take our drink orders for the second table (one of whom was a child), she refused because \"it's not my table.\" 45 more minutes go by before our second server finally came over to take our drink order. Honestly, the only reason I gave them 1 star is because I can't give 0. Once we finally got the food, they'd mixed up our orders and it was insanely overpriced. I will never be returning to this restaurant and I suggest you dine anywhere else but here!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke it took 30 min for our chef to show up don't know why the place was empty. And our host was rude. When the chef finally got there he poured a ton of oil on the grill and let it get to hot and of course burned our food if you like charred rice chicken and shrimp rude staff this is ur place. Thanks for ruining my birthday dinner and thanks GREG the (New) General Manager for not correcting this will be trying wasabi i here the food and service there is better and they actually have customers"}
{"text":"This is the lowest score I have ever given restaurant.  I've been to a Benihana restaurant in California and back home in Hawaii, the service was impeccable and the food was amazing.  Here, my first time visiting this place was an epic tragedy.  As I walked in, the hostess was smiling and had a bubbly personality and was cordial. I was told it was self seating, so I found a nice little table all to myself.  My waitress is a whole other story.   She didn't greet me or ask how I was doing, instead she dropped to different menus and asked, \"Just you?\"  \"Yes.\"  She took away the other place setting and walked away.  No smile. It looked like she was pissed. Perhaps it was permanent resting B---- face.  She came back and quickly asked what I would like to drink. Tea of course.  Tea came out and then the big question, \"you want to order now?\"  Good news, I'm in a really good mood and I wasn't going to let this persons mood get to me.  I ordered for the lunch menu and asked that my steak be rare.  Soup arrived, it was good. Nothing that blew my palette. I did asked for a little wasabi and added a little piece of it to add a slight kick to the broth.  When my plate arrived, I saw immediately that the beef was fully cooked.   I did not bother the waitress to have it sent back (yes, I'm that nice of a customer and not petty).  Even the manager came to ask how was everything, I didn't have the heart to tell him that my waitress forgot to bring her personality with her to work.  Now, the table next to me, I have to say, made me a little jealous. Their waitress was smiling, she attentive, and anticipated her guests needs like bringing extra napkins, took away the chopstick wrappers off the table, etc...  Overall, the food was not what I remembered, it was just okay.  Ultimately, the service with my waitress was a horrible experience. I still tipped her and have her feedback, I let her know she didn't even look at my steak to notice that it was fully cooked - not rare, and still proceeded to serve it to me. I also said it would help if you smiled at your customers. Besides myself, she had three other tables and she was the same with them.  You may have a different encounter than I did, I will say, customer service here is like. Roulette game!  #GoodLuck! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to many different Benihana locations from Hawaii, California, and Arizona, but I've never been to one that was so extravagant as this location.  When you enter into this restaurant, you'll leave the world behind you and enter into this amazing Japanese themed environment.  From the water falls, the wooden walk ways and bridges. Dragons in the skyline and red lanterns everywhere.  The waitstaff are dressed in modern kimonos and lead you and your guests to your table.  We asked for the teppanyaki table where the chefs cooks directly in front of you.  Note: you can request a reservation but they will not seat you until your whole party has arrived. Reason being is you may be seated with other people. Which is kewl because you can always use this opportunity to make new friends!  The chefs are trained well to cook amazing food with an entertaining showmanship performance that will keep you smiling. While enjoying your food!  I would definitely choose this place for groups or for couples!  It's the perfect venue and If you have never been here, I would definitely recommend you come here and try it out!  :)"}
{"text":"This Restaurant have a nice Teppanyaki Chef cooking for you at ur front and the foods is so nice also the drink too. For drink I order Lychee Blossom. For the foods I order some seafood ,chicken and spicy chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Good Japanese style  steak and seafood spot. Prices put this off for people on a budget but the food and presentation are good.  The chefs cook in front of you and everything is good here.   This place is usually jam packed with people so MAKE A RESERVATION!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but we reserved a table for 8:30 for a birthday and we weren't seated untill almost 9 pm... no one was happy about it and looked like no one cares about it..."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Great place for groups and small families alike.  I went there with the in-laws along with my 15 mth old son and we all enjoyed it!  My son was in awe of the performance by that teppenyaki cook as were we!  Wonderful food and great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Say at the bar for Happy Hour yesterday and the food and drinks were amazing! The only thing better was the excellent service we received from our bartender"}
{"text":"I would give two and half stars because the food was good.   Despite notifying and reminding the waiter, chef and manager on multiple occasions, my daughter's birthday was ignored while another child, who was at our table, birthday was the focus of the entire meal. The other family even pointed out that there were two kids with birthdays at the table. That was a bummer - so much for going to Benihana for special occasions.   Also, the carpet is very dirty which makes you feel that other things may be neglected. That being said when you are sitting at the cooktop and the chef is doing a good job obeying all the food-handling regulations you worry less.   I ordered Seafood Diablo and several of the ingredients listed on the menu were missing. I asked for this spicy dish extra-spicy. My dish was cooked last (no big deal) but then when it was served and others were finishing, our waiter started working another table and I couldn't get a drink to save my life.    Also, I know the chefs have to learn but our chef was noticeably less skilled compared to the other chefs on shift this evening. That's just bad luck of the draw, but seemed to be the way this night was going. All in all, it was a very bad experience."}
{"text":"We went to Benihana's with six friends for my fiance's 30th birthday party last night. For the first 30 minutes our chef whined about how much he disliked his job. It was terrible and we were literally trying to change the topic of conversation to happier discussion. You come to be entertained and he really was killing the mood.  We will not be coming back here again and we were all taken aback by the poor service."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour on the strip! $7 mojitos with three flavors to choose from; original, exotic, and coconut. Tried all three and they were all good. The exotic was a little bit too sweet for me to enjoy the entire thing but regardless it was good. $6 beers too. You can sit at the bar and people watch. Great place to stop and wait for your party to be done shopping at the mall. Lol"}
{"text":"Hibachi was ok. Need more seasoning and they do not offer/ask how do you want it - saltier, no salt or soy sauce, etc. I've been to other hibachi restaurants and I had higher expectations on this restaurant but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Benihana's for special occasions.  We went in on Tuesday 11/28/2017 to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  I was in the least not impressed this time.  The food was ok but not that great and the service was ok but not that great.  What bothered me the most was our order got messed up and our food was put back on the grill because our party ordered some of the same things then the other party and I felt bad cause it was their 1st time.  I will never go back to this location as I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing date at Benihana last night. We had Japanese beer that was very light and tasted pretty good. I think I will stick to Bud Light if I want a light beer though. We opted to do the chef's special which was filet mignon and chicken for two people. We received soup and salad before the hibachi chef got to our table. I really enjoyed the soup and ate just a bit of my salad. I usually like the ginger dressing to be more creamy rather than chunky ( I am from the south).  Our hibachi chef -Michael was very talented and gave us more than plenty to eat. He of course made a volcano - but oddly no fire was lit (maybe safety regulations) all in all he was very entertaining.  We got fried rice, a shrimp appetizer, veggies, and of course chicken and meat. It came with two sauces- one spicy/chili like and the other was a mustard based sauce. I asked the server if I could have some Shrimp sauce (yummy yummy sauce). He said they did not have any- it isn't out in this region. He told me it was more Midwestern and southern. I don't think Arizonians know what they are missing. The sauce MAKES fried rice taste even better than it already is. I don't get why any hibachi restaurant doesn't have it out here.  Anyways, our meal was delicious. I had a wonderful time and leftovers to eat. I plan on going back for special occasions  or with my 30 dollar gift certificate you get for your birthday."}
{"text":"The coolest Benihana I've ever been to.  Had no idea how large the restaurant space was.  We got to eat upstairs and had the best waitress.  Super friendly and accommodating.  One minus was that they ran out of 'Demon Slayer' but... she recovered by offering an excellent alternative.  Love it for an off-strip dining experience :)"}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend to Benihana this past week with a 7 PM weekday reservation (made on the OpenTable app).  Though we arrived a few minutes earlier than that, we knew that groups of 7-8 people would be seated at a time.  What we didn't expect was to have to wait for about a half hour (seated at 7:27 PM) due to staffing difficulties.    Though we were disappointed for having to wait so long with a reservation, the moment we sat down, the experience quickly turned around.  The server was very attentive, and the chef was very entertaining.  I've been to Benihana several times before, and each server typically uses many of the same routines while cooking food right in front of you.  This server (Nick) had his own spin on his cooking, and we were certainly entertained while watching him working his cooking magic!  For those who haven't had Teppanyaki, food is broiled on a steel grill right in front of us.  I first saw Teppanyaki watching the movie Police Academy 2 when the Commandant brought his goldfish in a bowl and placed both the bowl and his brother's hand on the grill.  Both are big mistakes!!    Back to my experience...we enjoyed getting to know the two other groups who were sitting with us.  While I did not order a drink, others enjoyed a fun beverage and appetizers while we waited for the main courses to be cooked.  Then again, all of us ordered 5 or 6 course meals that include soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, vegetables, dipping sauces, steamed rice, hot green tea, entree, and for those with a 6 course meal, ice cream (green tea, vanilla, chocolate, or rainbow sherbert).  I highly recommend ordering fried rice (delicious but an extra charge).  I ordered the Rocky's Choice specialty 6 course meal (hibachi steak and chicken) while my girlfriend ordered the Teriyaki Chicken 5 course combo meal.  Both were delicious as we were stuffed afterwards!  They are also known for their birthday club called the Chef's Table.  Sign up here (http://profile.benihana.com/registration) for a $30 gift certificate for the month following your birthday when you dine with someone else.  A free meal!!  They will also bring you an extra dessert and a group photo (and sing to you!).  There is also a kids' club called Kabuki Kids, which involves children's birthdays (http://www.benihana.com/promotions/kabuki-kids).  They also have great happy hour specials and lunch specials!    Moral of the story...don't burn people's hands on the stove or bring your pet goldfish to Benihana!"}
{"text":"Not my best experience. The host did not ask if we wanted hibachi or fast lunch. We were seated with a full group at the hibachi table. Then given the menus for both lunches only to find out that at the hibachi table the fast lunch menu could not be ordered from. The waitresses did not know what edamame was when ordered, our drinks were not refilled until we all sat with empty glasses and had to ask for more water. We sat waiting for the chef and our food an excessive amount of time. The restaurant only had two full tables and one with two people at it. When the chef came he read out the hibachi orders and was not sure about the lunch boat orders. Half of the table had ordered lunch boats and it was not explained that this was prepared separately. The chef did a very good job (the only reason for getting a star at all) but he did not have backup from kitchen. He had to ask for the scallops several times. The people with the lunch boat did not get soy sauce for the sushi so the chef had to share his. The table next to us was empty but left with dishes and dirty the hole time we were there. The floor was littered with shrimp tails and trash. The bathrooms were dirty. The waitress never gave us her name, thanked us for coming, no pins to sign our check. She just handed out the checks, left, came back to pick them up and left. Both times we tried to say something to her but could not because she was gone. The salmon on the fish boat was half raw and the chef let us put it on the grill to cook more. Next time we will be going some where else."}
{"text":"We had our first experience at Benihana over the weekend and it will definitely be our last. We walked in at 3 pm on a Saturday so the place was not busy, and we were ignored by all 3 people standing at the host stand. When they finally decided to greet us, we were sat at the bar as we had requested. Everything went downhill from there. The bartender, \"DelBetty\" as she was named on the receipt was less than pleasant. She deliberately ignored us for a few minutes before greeting us by saying \"are you waiting for a table\"? We were the only people in the bar, so you would think she would have been happy to have some customers. Her attitude and lack of personality couldn't have pushed us out sooner. To top it off the food sucked too. BYE Benihana.   Overall rating = D, for DON'T eat here."}
{"text":"Not the worst hibachi but definitely not the best.    Food was good EXCEPT chicken fried riced needed a little more work.  (Clumped portions of the rice still solid white after cooking-this should not happen).   Key things that need to be improved upon:  Mediocre service: 1.  The waiter seemed nice but I had to step away from the Hibachi table and go to the bar for a 2nd refill on a soft drink because waiter continuously forgot.    Lack of preparation 2. Cook had to leave the grill unattended (x2)because the ingredients needed was not on the food cart.  One of those times the grill was on.    Cross contamination 3. There were mixed groups sitting at the grill and while serving the  food, the cook's instrumentation would make contact with some of the guest plates, which they had already been eating on.  (hopefully nobody was ill/or had a virus).   Would give 3 stars but the cross contamination is a health hazard."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, all enjoyed the night out.  Our server was not all that personable and could have checked on us more frequently, hence the 4 stars vs 5."}
{"text":"I'm giving Benihana 3 stars, why? Let's see why.  For the chef's entertainment I'd give a 5 Star, he was great! However I didn't enjoy the fact that while he's cooking your entire self is now smelling like a kitchen just as bad. The prices are very expensive, I think with that kinda money you can really enjoy something so much better.  For example our bill for 2, came out to be $170!!!  We could've gone to Fogo de Ch√£o which is an amazing Brazilian steakhouse and it'd be cheaper.  Just think that the prices are a bit outrageous for what's offered.  The entertainment was great. Prolly won't be going back to this restaurant, it was my first time there ever."}
{"text":"This was terrible! Worst hibachi experience I've ever had. Our chef was the worst,  we paid 50+ dollars per person, expecting a nice show with our meal. We received no show, our chef barely spoke a word to us, gave me the wrong order of food as well. Never have I seen a hibachi restaurant that charged extra for fried rice! So I'm paying 50+ dollars for piece of cheap steak some onions and four little pieces of zucchini?!.... Never will I return again."}
{"text":"The decor at this Benihana is really cool, especially if you have children with you.  The food was excellent, and our cook was very entertaining.  The prices are a bit high, but you get a lot included with the meal, and if you sign up for their club you get a $30 gift certificate good during the month of your birthday (but only Monday-Thursday).  The staff was very nice, even running to catch up with us and return my wife's phone after she left it at the table at the end of our meal.  I left very full and happy, and the kids absolutely loved both the food and the show."}
{"text":"I have been to the Benihana's in Anaheim, San Diego, and Carlsbad... and this Benihana absolutely blows them all out of the water. The Carlsbad location is realllyyy nice though in case you're wondering.   To me, customer service is everything and they sure don't drop the ball here...   Our chef, Tuan, was THE BEST! He had allll of the skills and jokes that every other chef has had, and a bunch more. He seriously had me laughing the whole time and it made the overall experience absolutely amazing.   If you are celebrating your birthday, they will actually offer to take your picture... most other Benihana's offer regardless, but I guess this one is a little different. Make sure to call in and make a reservation beforehand to be safe and also sign up for the Chef's table to receive a $30 credit on your birthday month!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Wynn and were stoked to find that a new Benihana had opened up within walking distance literally right across the street from us. I think at the time they had been open for two months, and everything inside was really clean and well put together.   Our chef was John... and not sure if he was new or just nervous, but unfortunately he was a little sloppy in his presentation and dropped his utensils a few times. Otherwise, the rest of the night was great and the food was fantastic.   There's definitely a lot of steakhouse options available along the strip, but Benihana's is always a favorite and I'm much happier with this strip location over the Westgate location."}
{"text":"The sooner you know the gimmick / premise that is Benihana, the more tolerable it will be. No one in their right mind would ever come here for \"authentic Japanese cuisine\" but like any cheesy reality show, it's all about the experience. It is alive and well for the now Las Vegas Hotel (formally HIlton) establishment, with full on displays of in your face cooking and awe-inspiring food play (#1).   For those not in the know, Benihana is a chain of faux Japanese stirfry, where folks sit around a giant grill, where a chef cooks the meal in front of the guests, serving it fresh off the grill. Due to a height in popularity and a lack of Japanese US people, it's usually a non-Japanese person doing the cooking. One thing different about this Benihana is LVH's ability to slot in actual Japanese people or Asian actors with an impossibly good Japanese accent. Either way, it keeps the facade going and the customers happy. (#2)  From the tacky Japanese decor that makes me feel like I'm on a boat to the wait staff dressed in what appears to be uncomfortable kimonos, it baffles me how this is considered a \"fine dining\" restaurant for casino standards. The prices certainly match it, most of the hibachi grilled meats will run anyone from $23-32. Throw in seafood and the price nearly doubles. You know you're an expensive place when the cheapest thing offered on the menu are sushi rolls ($8-12), along with dessert.  The food isn't a total fail but it's far from a total win. Sadly overpriced, it's the reality of most casino establishments any way. When in Vegas, try to let someone who had a good day in the casino take the bill, or get it comp'd off. I think Benihana works best as a general group dining restaurant, one where the experience will likely trump the food. ________ (#1) Not to mention smelly clothes and a potential food porn grease facial. (#2) I still feel bad for the guy behind the grill."}
{"text":"Okay, let's take a timeout on all the weird bad reviews here. This place is great! I was totally skeptical coming here with my family because of all the bad reviews and come on... it's Benihana... it'll be the same ol' tricks that you've seen, right? Wrong!! It was impressive and Tony was so entertaining. The boy has skills and has some new tricks up his sleeve plus he made us feel so welcomed. Great show... I was pleasantly surprised. Plus the ambience is great here. It's not stuffy like most teppanyaki places. It's open and lots of room! Had a good experience and don't let the negative nay Sayers stir you away."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to one of these places where the food is actually cooked in front of you.  Ultimately, it allows you to really get into how this restaurant works, but it kind of backfires:  I know enough to cook Japanese-style now for about 1/10th the price.     The layout here is kind of weird.  Forget anything intimate--I was kind of fearing the placement of our largely dysfunctional get together near the rather normal couple, but it worked out well enough.   Problems arise in the layout of the place--everybody faces out a window with the majority having their backs to the entrances (I hate that).  The \"view\" is a massive parking lot bookended by a La-Z-Boy store and a Chili's.  Switching the layout of the place might have been a small salvation.    What you're really getting is the cooking show, worthy of a sixth star:  our chef was extremely friendly and we had a great time as our food was cooked.    But it's not a grand luxury, it's just Eastern efficiency.  You don't wait for your food, they don't have to hire expos, and they need less kitchen infrastructure.  As soon as the food is done, it's on your plate--the tradeoff of the show as I would have liked to have it all out at the same time.   Something is slightly taken away from it when the other chef on the other table does the train sound again with his butcher knife; It feels like a pre-programmed repertoire to go with the pre-programmed food.  This is why chains leave me bitter, even good ones like Benihana.     The ingredients are nothing special--for a table of 7 they bust out a few zucchinis, a couple handfuls of generic white mushrooms, a couple white onions, small slabs of steak and chicken, etc.  What really gives this place its Denny's-plus quality was immediately apparent in the side salad--a bag of store bought mix and a couple tomatoes.  It appears to add up to a lot of food, but I've spent less at other restaurants and usually bring home a box.    The sauces they use are what saves the place food wise, but they're all clearly pre-made elsewhere for a generic nationwide palette--the hot mustard just wasn't hot, at all.  On the other hand, the two ginger sauces, a red one in the meat and a yellow one in the salad were absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, this place severely loses on price and service.  The server was basically gone the whole time.  Fuck her.  She splits her tip with the awesome chef and drags his performance down.    At one point I got up and went back to the front end to ask for the bathroom, waiting impatiently for the hostess to finish chatting with a friend who came in with another table.  What the hell?  The bathroom itself was a sticky-floored mess--something I would expect at Veterans Memorial Coliseum or some douchebag bar, not a place that charges this much for dinner.  Drinks were extremely expensive, charging $9 for a 22-oz bottle of beer.     The magic here is the presentation, the sauce, and the overall delivery, but it's severely hampered by food quality, prices, and poor service.  It would have been two stars, but I couldn't be angry at the place after having such wonderful ice cream and a picture (scantly offered as it were) at the end.    Overall, Benihana is worth the one-time experience but needs significant improvement to happily lure me back as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I just wanna say thank you! To our chef his name was Miguel he was really nice, friendly and the food he prepare for us was amazing especially the show he did. I really recommend this restaurant ask for Miguel I will be back for him"}
{"text":"Great for the entertainment value, less so for the food itself of course.  But the chefs are real performers- a combination of comedian, juggler, and magician."}
{"text":"Hibachi. The guy was very talented and very entertaining. Food was ample and delicious. I had the spicy hibachi chicken along with the chicken fried rice. They were both satisfying. The overall setting is very nice along with the welcoming staff. Would definitely come back. If you lile hibachi, come here."}
{"text":"Been comming to Benihanas in numerous states. By far this is the worst service ive ever experienced starting from being seated 1 hour after ourreservation time which was at 7 pm. We finally had salad and soup served after numerous drink mistakes at 910 pm. Needless to say this assholes ruined our moms 80th bday. I will never come back to Benihanas in Chandler Az."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go to a Benihana for a while now. Considering Benihana is Asian and I'm Asian, I'm shocked I've never been.  Definitely fun because of the \"show\". Luckily, our chef had a personality and was chatting up a storm with us. But I can imagine how quiet dinner would have been if our chef was all show and no talk. He did a number of tricks throughout dinner. My favorite was the onion ring volcano.  The food itself was pretty good. First some a bowl of soup (simple but it had a good base), salad (too much dressing), then some shrimp for everyone. One side order of fried rice for two is a good amount to share if you're not trying to completely stuff your face. So the fried rice... Dang they put a lot of butter, but it's okay because it's \"Japanese butter\" so our chef said jokingly. I mean it was good but obviously that's the #1 thing everyone talks about from here and definitely overrated in my opinion. However, I don't like that different components of the meal came at different times. As in, a bunch of onions and zucchini in the beginning then a bunch of steak or chicken or scallops in my case at the end. Seemed weird to me that they just gave us a bunch of onion pieces...  Overall, 100% worth trying if you have never been. But it's pricey and it's not as cool as you imagined."}
{"text":"Nice, small wedding reception dinner for an Aunt and new Uncle.   Staff was exceptional, food was wonderful although a tad pricey for my steak salad.   Very memorable night -thank you!"}
{"text":"Great flavors. Shrimp and chicken were fresh and the atmosphere was fun! \"Harry\" our chef was funny and made it a great experience. We got there at 5:30 and I would recommend the earlier the better, as waiting for a hibachi table can be a pain."}
{"text":"This Benihana is our favorite. The decor is modern and the floor plan is very open. I love the style. We've eaten at this location probably 2-3 times a year since it opened. We went for Valentines Day last week and I was a little underwhelmed by our chef, Carlos. Firstly, let me say his cooking was perfect, so no complaints there at all. He just seemed a little green to me. He didn't have the Benihana flair yet and he's very soft spoken. Hard to hear him over the grill and noise of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We were seated on time with 6 other people. Our soup and salad were brought to us on time, however we ended up waiting almost 45 minutes from that point until our chef came out.  While normally a wait like that would not be acceptable, the staff did an amazing job doing their best to take care of us. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and our chef - Calvin - was entertaining and did a great job on the food.  The manager on duty went above and beyond for us, going so far as to comp the meals for our whole table.  Thank you guys, for a great dinner and superb customer service!"}
{"text":"This may sound terrible, and I apologize in advance. But ever since all of the Japanese people left, this place hasn't been the same.  Years ago, this place was incredible!!!!  And don't get me wrong, I still eat here religiously. I mean, who doesn't love the shrimp sauce?!?!?!  But I feel like the atmosphere has changed drastically. I miss that authentic feel."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this is one of, if not the best.  Grew up going to the original in NYC, so I may be biased, but I have never not had a good meal here.  Whether you sit down at one of the hibachi tables, or head to the sushi bar in front, the food is always good.  The service is friendly and attentive, and of course you get that great little cutlery show during dinner preparation at the Hibachi bar.  Average prices, you can go casual, or get a little dressed up and not feel out of place..."}
{"text":"Wow first time here and I will define back we had the pleasure of being served by Franco excellent customer service very talkative funny great cook everything was on point. I will definitely make reservations at this location again and I recommend everyone who comes to eat to ask for him. He personalized our dinner as far as the way he was talking to us and shared about himself with us as well."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at some of the lackluster reviews. Sometimes when I read yelp reviews I get the feeling some reviewers feel chain restaurants can do no right! How unfair!  I believe Benihana is one such place. If you're coming for the show, great - I've seen it. You may enjoy it.  I come for the food and service.  I have been consistently impressed with both.  Steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, sashimi, sushi, sushi rolls, the onion soup, the vegetable tempura, and so on.  I have infrequently had issues with the food. I told them it was unacceptable and it was whisked away to be replaced with more than acceptable food. No grumbling, fussing, evil looks, or exasperated sighs - just a quick fix of the issue.  I have never had any issue with the wait staff.   We had an issue with one chef once. He simply couldn't get things right, he even dropped his knife. We didn't even say anything, but the manager showed up, brought us desert AND comped our entire meal. That speaks to the watchfulness of the management and their commitment to quality.   My spouse can be a very particular eater. Yet we have returned time and again here because they get it right.  The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars are the hours (they're closed between 2pm and 5pm right in the middle of MY lunch time), and they can be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went there for my birthday for the first time and had an exceptional experience. If your birthday is coming up, make sure to join their birthday club and they will e-mail you a $30 coupon!! The teriyaki steak is delicious, as well as the chicken fried rice. You have to pay extra to get chicken fried rice but it is worth it!! Make sure to try their green tea ice cream, it is the best!!"}
{"text":"I used to love Benihanas! The experience was amazing, the view of the restaurant seems so refreshing. I've gone a few times, time and time again but I recently went for my birthday and it was a disaster. If this place had a time limit between 5mins to none... You've got a winner. You order your food, sits there, right as you're devouring your amazing meal that was just cooked for you.. They want to come by the moment you stick a fork in your mouth. Asking if we need a box to go or if we are done with our food.   So obnoxious!!   I had a party of 6, mind you/ one of my friends was in the parking lot trying to find a place to park, they said they couldn't hold her seat. As if she couldn't join me for my dinner. I was so devastated this place was so rude and completely unacceptable for customer service. I would NEVER Go back to a place I'm spending $50s on one plate and get rushed out."}
{"text":"So we went here Friday night and I enjoyed it but my hubby did not. He got filet and lobster and said the filet has. I flavor. We did sushi as an app and the rolls were very good but I didn't understand why they didn't have a rainbow roll :(. The soup was very good but the salad was nasty. The chef did a lot of tricks and kept us laughing. I'm giving it 3 stars because lack of taste on the meat, the waiter was ok a little slow. We waited about 30 minutes which wasn't that bad because we could gamble some more. I'd def come here again but my husband wouldn't!"}
{"text":"Our first time at a Benihana, OMG, excellent food, drinks, service, chef and entertainment for our dinner.  16 people in our group of friends, with 16 completely satisfied diners!  We couldn't have been any happier or satisfied!  We will definitely go back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Happy hour is pretty dang good here, though jalapenos seem to be a favorite topping on their sushi.  The sashimi ceviche is quite delish as well as their other sashimi dishes.  Definetly worth the trip."}
{"text":"Food was amazing , the chef wa really good and entertained our group, however the server was not that great which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars but overall this place is 1 of the best Japanese steak houses I been too"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience with my 3 kids. Our chef, Tony, was so phenomenal that my kids asked to talk to the manager. He had all the usual tricks plus pop culture references, an amazing sense of humor and some great dance moves. Request him if you go with kids, or without!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience as always. The shrimp was great, and the steak was cooked perfectly my friend had the land and sea, and he said that scallops were melt-in-your-mouth."}
{"text":"Had a large party of 15. We were split into 2 tables as expected but we also waited 1 hour for our tables to be ready despite making a reservation. The tables were sticky probably from one of the cocktails and not cleaned well. Our waitress was great but the other party's waitress was slacking. Our waitress had to pick up for the other waitress' slack.   The soup was good though. The salad was good too.   We actually ended up leaving without getting our food. About 2 hours into us being at the restaurant, I approached the wait staff and spoke with the manager. The manager apologized and told us that the chefs would be out in 10 minutes but that the other chef would be coming about 10 minutes later. Honestly, if we would have waited we would have been at the restaurant for at least 4 hours.   I will not recommend coming here. They need more chefs and wait staff. They are spread too thin"}
{"text":"Went last night for my son's birthday (by the way the little $30 chefs table birthday certificate never \"processed\" in time to print - I emailed their corporate office and didn't hear back, then printed what DID come and asked about it at the restaurant and the hostess was really rude to me about it... must be a common problem though, because she had a card for the corporate office ready to go).  The hostess was not friendly, we waited a while to be seated, even with a reservation. The server was a little more friendly and became gradually more attentive (I think because she realized everyone at our table was getting frustrated), but never really hit the service mark. It took an unreasonable amount of time for the drink orders, and for courses to begin coming.   Then the chef. God bless him. He was new, not Asian, exhausted, and really slow. He kept misreading the ticket, kept serving food we'd ordered to the strangers at the table with us, he missed about every little \"trick\" he tried, and he was clearly nervous (and apparently gets chatty when he's nervous). He was sweating over our food profusely.... until the server came over and turned the vent on 3/4 of the way through the little show. The meal was served so slowly that it was cold and you couldn't enjoy your food. Portions were small and the flavor was bland... I had the hibachi chicken and it was overcooked.... the veggies were burned on bottom and zucchini was slimy on top.... There was so much to be appalled at that when the lady came and asked how our meal was, we just said \"fine\" so we could leave quicker and never return.  I'm pretty sure if we'd complained we'd have just gotten another card for corporate... We were very disappointed and I felt really bad for the experience my son DIDN'T get to have for his special day. You can't have that moment back, you know...  but I wish I could. I would definitely have chosen more wisely.  It was not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Best place to eat steak or seafood!!! The show is great and the food will make your mouth water!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun. Our chef was very nice and entertaining. The filet was excellent.  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste.  Over all it was a great time. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our Cook was really funny. Dinner was great. Loved the shrimp and steak. Next time gonna go with more people. Benihanas is definetly a place to go with a group. Me and my girl were sitting with total strangers."}
{"text":"OK, I know Benni's is more known for their Teppanyaki but for an uppity Japanese place you'd expect the sushi to be equally as good right? Meh. Not only did it suck, but the selection was limited, they were 'out' of many items, and it was overpriced. I don't recommend it. The company at our table included a young couple celebrating a birthday and an extremely douchey, divorced father/daughter duo that did not stop arguing the ENTIRE time. The girl was huffing and whining about her mercedes not being the model she had hoped for, elbows all over the table. The dad was talking very loud and using profanity, blaming the mom and calling her and the girl insulting names. It took everything in my power not to walk over and politely ask the guy to leave our table because I know it would have escalated. So after a bit the guy picked up on the rest of us at the table looking perturbed and he apologized, but still kept arguing, only a little quieter now. Enter chef: a Mexican fellow with an exotic Latin romance novel name I can't remember. He introduced himself and Julie jokingly asked if his name was Japanese. He laughed and was actually a good sport about it, injecting little bits of hispanic humor throughout the cooking experience...and offered to serve Julie her chicken open-faced or wrapped in a burrito if she preferred :) He wasn't all that impressive with his knife work and tossing tricks which we didn't really care about but it's still expected, especially for the kids (and the price). The food however was cooked to perfection and more than made up for the sub par sushi. He made it a point to give the arguing d-bags sample pieces first so they'd have something to occupy their mouths, and winked at the rest of us which was pretty cool. All in all it was a fairly entertaining evening, and aside from the sushi the rest of the food was awesome. The Saki and Kirin helped take the edge off and toward the end the whole table was talking and being friendly, and we even got to bomb the birthday girl's photo op haha. Btw, if birthday girl or someone that knows her reads this, we would like a copy of that photo!! We tried to download it from the Benihana website but of course they were having 'technical difficulties' with it that night. Hmm I wonder if their sushi chef doubles as their web developer?"}
{"text":"Went for a last minute late night dinner with a party of 16. The wait was pretty lengthy, but once we were seated it was a great time.  Shrimp, steak, and chicken were all delicious and the chef and wait staff were all friendly and accommodating.  Only downfall was having no available seating at one table for our entire group, so we split into two groups of 8."}
{"text":"Love the food, but we get take out to the office and every time its a bit of an ordeal.    Eat in.  If you're planning on take out make it simple."}
{"text":"Great night! Our Chef was really funny and entertaining. The food was tasty. The only problem with big parties is the lack of table space! I had a corner seat and no room!"}
{"text":"Had a 5:30 reservation on 10/21/16 and we were seated on time.  We had to wait a little for our chef to finish up at another table. Our server gave us free edamame appetizer for the wait which I thought was not necessary but I did appreciate him letting us know the reason for the wait. I ordered the Ocean Treasure (lobster, scallops, and shrimps), my husband got the Hibachi Tuna Steak, my mom got the hibachi chicken and my dad the filet mignon. The soup was really good and the salad fresh. We all enjoyed our meals and the friendliness of our lady chef. She was very engaging and not just concerned with her performance/show. Our server and assistant was very attentive. He was always refilling our drinks and asking if we need anything. Service was top notch! My seafood dish all tasted heavenly. Everything was cooked to perfection. My dad's filet was perfectly medium and my husband's ahi was perfectly seared. I tried the hubby's tuna and it was so flavorful and lovely. My mom did not finish her food (got full from the appetizer, soup, and salad) and had it to go. I tried it a couple of days later and it was still really good. The chicken and steak meal came with ice cream which was a good way to end a great experience. Oh and the Mango Lemonade was AWESOME!!! It also has free refills :-)  We enjoyed our time at this Benihana because of the extra care of our server and chef. My parents have been here 4 times since they opened and they plan to come back again. We will definitely visit again when we are in town."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. Celebrated my birthday and was disappointed. Slow service, rude management, and decent food."}
{"text":"Not the most life-changing meal I've ever had.  I have always wanted to eat at Benihana and had high expectations that definitely needed to be lowered.  Between the 115-degree temps in Las Vegas and sitting in front of the hibachi, it was a very hot experience.  The cook set an onion on fire once which was pretty cool.  I ordered the mango shrimp which turned out to be surprisingly bland.  The waitress at the end entertained us with a magic trick she knew and ended up pulling a scarf out of my sleeve -she was quite endearing.  Overall it wasn't a bad experience, but given the price, one experience here was enough for me.  Probably wouldn't go back to any Benihana (not just here at LVH)."}
{"text":"If your in the area and want an entertainment style dinner. This has to be your go to spot. The staff is always amazing and friendly. We had made a reservation and arrived a little early so we grabbed a few cocktails at the bar.   Drinks were perfect, and then dinner started. The wait staff was happy and throwing off positive vibes. The seating arrangement is 8 people around a cooking station. The chef Nathan aka Nate had us rolling in laughter the whole time he was cooking.  This last visit was probably one of my favorite visits.   We had the chicken and steak meal and the shrimp and steak meal. And it was all cooked perfectly. This place is not super cheap so make sure it's a good celebratory occasion to make it worth while.   We will definitely come back to this location I recommend that you try it out if you like Asian cuisine. You will have a great time."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! I wish I could've tipped our the cook separate from the server because our sever Tania was horrible . I made reservations for 730 on a Wednesday night for a table of 8 . It was a birthday get-together . When we arrived we had to wait 30mins to get a table & another 30mins for our server after being seated . I understand if the restaurant was busy but it wasn't . Our server first asked if there were any birthdays & we replied yes . She said happy birthday & took our orders . It took about another 15mins for our cook to arrive . Our cook, Juan was amazing & the food was good . I enjoyed the food but I felt like the server wasn't very attentive . After our cooked arrived & he started on the chicken fried rice he had to run all the way back to the kitchen because our server forgot the rice bowls . While, eating I was wondering why we didn't get a happy birthday song at our table because everyone else seemed to be having a birthday . After eating it was time to pay . We asked Tania, our server to split our checks & she asked everyone if there was anything else we needed . We simply replied no because we were all stuffed . When it was time to pay, I handed her a coupon & she had an attitude and said \" that's why I asked \" but she didn't ask us anything about coupons she jst asked if we needed anything else . So I was very confused . She had an attitude but Ignored it and paid my bill . Upon leaving our server says to the birthday girl \" happy early birthday! \" & that's why we didn't get a birthday song because the server thought it was an early birthday dinner . Overall, my first experience there was HORRIBLE & I highly doubt I will be back ."}
{"text":"So disappointed! The food was mediocre and the chef serving us was a new trainee. It took an hour before my food was served. Nothing special here."}
{"text":"We recently ate here with our kids after our visit to the Arabian Horse show!  Our kids LOVED the show and the food.  The onion soup appetizer is so fragrant and delicious.  The salad is fresh with a punchy ginger dressing.  I wish the shrimp were deveined.  That kind of grosses me out.  But the steak and chicken were cooked perfectly and the fried rice is crunchy and soft and delicious.  Our kids thought this was the coolest experience and had a blast!  Thanks Benihana!"}
{"text":"I had reservations for three late on a Friday afternoon, and figured it would be a breeze at that time of the day.  Upon checking in with our host, we were told to sit down and wait.  We waited for over 20 minutes!  Not cool when your restaurant is empty, and I had a reservation.  The hostess offered zero explanation or apology for the delay either.  Upon being sat, we did have an overall pretty terrific waiter.  He helped us to choose one of the most delicious cocktails I've ever had, a Coconut Mojito.  Very Tasty!  We started with a sushi roll appetizer which was also very very good.  The only feedback for the waiter would be that he was trying to sell us on upgrading to a better cut of steak, but in the process basically explained that their standard steak cut was crap.  I get an upsell, but don't completely chastise the other product in the process.  The food was terrific, and our chef did a very nice job.  You could tell he was probably new, but it makes sense to have the less experienced guys during the slower hours until they are pros.  Overall this was a great experience!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. Don't hate on Benihana. This place has been entertaining people for decades. The food is decent and prices are reasonable. Our chef was fun and made my 5 year laugh and most importantly eat her veggies. Definitely coming back and bringing her with me again. She loved it."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here last night for some sushi, we ordered a California roll, spicy tuna roll, eel roll and the sumo roll. Before the food came I ordered one of their new specialty drinks (baby Mount Fuji) and it was absolutely disgusting.The only thing we enjoyed was the spicy tuna roll. The seaweed was not holding the sushi together and every bite was a struggle. We watched the sushi chef finish two rolls and it sat there for 15 minutes before the waiter remembered to take it to his table. I can say with confidence that I will not be returning to Benihana."}
{"text":"Finally this location is open with the lunch menu!! Habachi is always good but I can never finish so the lunch portions are affordable and you can eat all your food.  I am not into habachi left overs although the flavor is good enough to eat at home!!  I got chicken and shrimp with a side of scallops this time but normally the filet and the seafood combo is my favorite and always to die for"}
{"text":"I was in a bit of a hurry so I sat at the bar. John and josh were the bartenders and they did an awesome job! I ordered the Alaskan roll (perfection) and tried one of their new drinks (I think it's called emperors Bellini?) anyways it was super good. I think when most people think of Bellinis they get nervous that it will be too sweet, but this one was fantastic."}
{"text":"The manager phoned me apologizing and assuring me that refraining would be done and sent us $60 in gift cards to make good. Thank you Benihana for following up."}
{"text":"Good service with excellent food. Delicious. It's kinda expensive. I was a group of 4 the bill was close to $200."}
{"text":"The slowest service of all time. Wanted to enjoy our meal but the service was so bad we couldn't. Wow Benihana, what happened to you?"}
{"text":"My very first visit to Benihana was for my free birthday meal. I arrived at about 5:45pm and since I didn't have a reservation I had to wait until about 6:30pm for the next hibachi table that had room. No biggie I went to the bar, had glass of Cabernet and order the dragon roll. I mean it was happy hour and all and it was pretty reasonable so I had no problem waiting.   Well lucky me gets seated with a family of 5 1/2. I say that because it was the two adults, three boys (the oldest was celebrating his 14th birthday) and a newborn baby girl, hence the 1/2. The father looked like a George Bush Jr clone, I KID YOU NOT! I had to do a double take that is how much this man resembled him. Let me just say that this family loves them so sushi. They ordered a ton of it along with their man courses. My kind of family! They were pretty comical that's for sure.   Our server (who's name I never got until I got the bill) was friendly enough but I kinda felt like and after thought as she seemed to be more focused on the family. No biggie but even though my meal was \"free\" doesn't mean you have to treat me any different. I say \"free\" as it was free up to the first $30 and anything over you had to cover. Again no biggie.   I ordered the Splash and Meadow which was steak and colossal shrimp. We started off with the miso soup which was really good, especially since it had fried onions and scallions mixed in the broth and wasn't overly salty like some miso soups can be. We received our salads very late, like we were in the middle of our hibachi presentation when we received them. I must say I was disappointed in the salad dressing as it was just blech. Almost like it was missing something and believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to my salad. Oh well.   The fried rice cost extra and I didn't know it and had I realized it, I would have just ordered regular white rice. It is mixed with some chicken, vegetables, etc, which I understand the extra cost but honestly it tasted as if the rice was undercooked. It was still hard. Another disappointed but oh well. Now the shrimp appetizer along with the all the vegetables and the colossal shrimp that came with my meal were very good. The chef was generous with the shrimp because two of the kids didn't want any. I think they were pretty full from all the sushi that they ate. Now onto my steak. I was a little disappointed because I wanted it medium rare and it was medium done but still not too bad. By the time everything was actually ready, I was full as I had had that dragon roll while waiting for my table and had tasted everything as it was prepared. So needless to say I ended up taking my entire meal home. I spent about $20 total at the bar and for dinner including tip. I will probably be back again someday soon.   Side note, I did notice that they have a sign for all you can eat sushi for $26.95 Sunday thru Thursday. I may have to go back and try that one day."}
{"text":"I have been spending the last week dining at places with birthday deals, lol. Benihana is no exception. They offer one of the best ones.   My bf and I decided to dine in after he found out that there was one in Pgh. He is from florida where Benihana has its headquarters and thought it was only in that state. He was surprised to find this location didn't include all glass windows while on the beach, but hey whatever. its Pittsburgh man!  For you birthday, Benihana emails you a $30 coupon. (valid Mon-Thurs) It is a great coupon considering the basic hibachi dishes are $19 and the entrees with 2 meats costs about $25-40 depending on what you get. I ordered the Benihana Delight-- chicken & shrimp. It was a '6 course meal'-- soup, salad, veggies, rice, chicken+shrimp & ice cream. My boyfriend with the chefs special, steak & lobster.  Our hibachi table only had one other couple at it, so it was very nice. Bob did the cooking for us. He was kind & friendly. We made casual conversation. He didn't do any special tricks but that was probably because there were only 4 (adults) at the table. When kids are there, they seem to do more.   Everything tasted really good. For dessert, I went with green tea ice cream. It was delicious. I expected a heavy flavor and to actually not like it, but it wasn't overpowering & heavy... more like refreshing.   Our server disappeared during our meal despite needing refills. Eventually she did come over but then took awhile for boxes and checks. Also 2 people (including me) were celebrating birthdays and no one sang to us lol. which is a good thing but they went around to every other table. We noticed severs on their phones at a table near the door. Managers should hide them a little better lol. at least it explained where she was most of the time...  I would rate 3.5 stars but I rounded up to 4 :)"}
{"text":"Seated within 15 minutes. Service was quick. Cook was fun and entertaining. Food was cooked as asked and very good. Would recommend for any occassion."}
{"text":"Our chef tonight Daniel was hands down AMAZING! He made jokes and got us laughing all the way through dinner. We had a vegetarian, and we had allergies to sea food. He went above and beyond to accommodate both of these things. If you go to this location ask for DANIEL. He has been moved around from one Benihana to another and it's because he's an AMAZING chef!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  The is the LARGEST BENIHANA IN THE WORLD!   We made dinner reservations for 2 early same day. When we arrived at 6 p.m. and it was already hopping!  It was like a beautiful city inside. Dim lighting, the first part as you walk in is the sushi. So through this little city we went, past a small bridge over some water, with rain like water falling from above.   You want to impress the ladies, bring them here!  We ordered Shrimp Tempura for the appetizer and for dinner, the Chicken & Shrimp plate and Steak & Shrimp plate.  Before our chef came out, we were served a mushroom soup and salad. We also received our shrimp tempura plate.  For $12.95, you only get 3 pieces of shrimp and vegetables with it. :-/ Kind of a joke with only 3 pieces of shrimp. Not worth $12.95, that's for sure. It was plain and the sauce was bland. The veggies were good, but it just wasn't what we ordered. A little misleading.  When our chef came out, he introduced himself. His name was Sheyan. He joked as he cooked. It made everything a good & fun show. He was very fast with his cuts, made everything look beautiful. He did the amazing fire volcano, the children at the table loved that....I can be a kid at times, so I loved it too. I had ordered my steak cooked meduim rare and he did great with that. The cut of steak was tender. Delicious. I got to try my husband's chicken and it was nice & juicy. Mine was juicy too, but I think it's harder to cook chicken and he did a great job keeping it moist. Dinner also came with ice cream for dessert. We ordered chocolate, it was very sweet & delicious.   We had a blast, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"As my first time eating here, I was really excited to try a teppanyaki style and get the experience of having a chef prepare the food in front of you. We couldn't get a reservation until 9pm on a Saturday so by the time we sat down, we were all starving. And, since we were only a group of 4, we had to wait about 10 minutes until another party of 3 was seated with us. Next time, I will be sure to bring 8 so we can all sit with people we know.  The waitress was very attentive, getting our drinks and re-fills quickly. We were served a soup and salad before the chef came over to prepare our dinner entrees. In my opinion, I wasn't a fan of either the soup or salad. The soup flavor was bland to me and the salad dressing was sour tasting. The chef came over, introduced himself and began cooking our food. He was pretty quiet, which surprised me because I thought the chefs were supposed to put on more of a show. Oh well, he was nice enough.  Then, when I went to excuse myself to the ladies room, I was appalled at how unclean they were! For such an expensive restaurant, you would think the bathrooms would be really nice and attended for...I literally walked in and two of the three stalls were backed up. And, on top of that, there was a mushroom floating in one of the toilets! EWW! If I didn't have to go so bad, I would have held it. Not okay!  When I returned to my seat, the chef cooked our meals and a few \"appetizers\" including hibachi shrimp and cooked veggies of mushrooms, zucchini and onions. We also ordered chicken fried rice, which was to die for! I really enjoyed watching the chef prepare everything...in my opinion the real reason to go here. For our entree, we ordered filet and scallops. We asked for the filet to be cooked medium rare and it was way overcooked! I would say more well done if anything. I also found that the meat was really under seasoned...but they do provide a couple sauces to go with the meals. They do give a lot of food to you....and after dinner, we got green tea and ice cream. I'm glad I shared everything because it really was a lot of food!   All in all, this place was fun. There were a lot of birthdays going on and this would be a place I would return to have a celebration or just a fun night out with a lot of people. But, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. Plus, the price is steep so not somewhere I can go often. So, I would return but it's not going on my top 10 favorite restaurants list."}
{"text":"I've been to Benihana a couple times before but never to this location. I received my $30 off birthday coupon so we came in on a Thursday night. I actually have to use my birthday coupon early because it expires before my actual birthday! What a riot..   Service was slow but our server was very nice- our chef was really disappointing to be completely honest. You could barely understand him- he really wasn't a showman at all and couldn't cook the food well! The scallops were torched, meats were overcooked. The best thing I ate that night was the Rainbow Roll- which was very fresh! The white peach saki sangria was also tasty! We decided to leave before dessert (take it to go) because I ended up not feeling well half way through the night.   Oh and on top of a $30 off coupon, we still didn't get out of there without spending close to $100. Medicore food for a very expensive price tag.  I think I'm done with Benihana."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3 stars  More modern / commercial not as traditional & dim as Las Vegas first location   Location : 4 stars  Great addition to fashion show mall   Food & service : 5 stars  Rosie was the absolute sweetest !  Attentive and polite    I've been coming to Benihana every years for my birthday since my 13th birthday . Today was my 24th my chef was josclin* and she was AWESOME my food was nothing short of delicious and delightful . Great personality & sense of humor"}
{"text":"\"That's not my table\"... When someone asked a server to get more water... Only to walk around and help several other tables. This describes the lack of teamwork in the restaurant and hostility towards the customers.  If this restaurant wants to improve, the management team needs to change the way customers are taken care of."}
{"text":"A star was taken away for service and price.  Yes it is more food and better quality than your standard hibachi restaurant but the price is pretty ridiculous in comparison.  The server had to argue about doom alcohol on separate receipt since we were using a gov't credit card.  Don't get the sushi since it is way overpriced and not comparable to a sushi restaurant.  Unlike other Beni's this one does not offer a full sushi lineup, probably b/c there is a sushi bar next door."}
{"text":"Host chef wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be for my birthday. Had to keep asking for water."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. The cooks are entertaining, had everybody in our party laughing. I Had the lobster and shrimp hibachi... Kinda expected more for the price put overall a good experience.  This place is more for the experience then the food."}
{"text":"One word...Amazing!! Our first time at Benihana and I am wondering why I have never tried this place before! The atmosphere is fun, it's dinner and a show! It was my wife's birthday and she got a $30 coupon, it was really good, our table chef Geoff was funny and explained everything to us as we went along. It was fun watching him cook the fresh food in front of us. They seat you with other couples which was fun because I felt like we we made some new friends. We will be back on my birthday!"}
{"text":"This Benihana is even better then the San Diego one(witch is really good) our server was great  our cook Robert was epiiiiiiic!!!! He did a crazy magic trick with sugar lol!!!! We've been to this location quite a few times and it keeps getting better and better!!  All the bad reviews you guys sound like cry babies    I'll be back next week! Just because!!!!  Also for everyone who complains about the time, being sat at this time served at this time shut up and order a drink and learn about the fun experience of Benihana!!! Enjoy talking to your friends and remember Benihana won't rush you out the building!   Stop crying!"}
{"text":"As the definition of a 3 star yelp rating states: this place is A-OK! I have always only gone for birthdays. They offer a great birthday coupon deal of a certificate of $30 off your meal. The food is very good, but for the price without the coupon it is a bit high. The teppan chefs have a good show but it has literally been the SAME show for about 5 years now."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food and I was expecting a better show from the chef, but was disappointed.  The service was exceptional."}
{"text":"I think it had been a solid 5 months since my last visit to Benihana... and I still stand by my 3 star review.  It was just as I remembered - same waitress and all!  I took my BF's sister for dinner there on a Sunday night.  We each ordered a Benihana salad (I do love that dressing) and a miso soup.  I think they gave us a different kind of soup but we ate it anyways...  We shared a Las Vegas roll, a spicy tuna roll, and then each had our own selections of nigiri (I had ikura and she had eel) and handrolls (I had spicy scallop and she had eel).  It was all edible but not spectacular.  I recommend against ordering the Las Vegas roll - it has way too much cream cheese and sauce on it.  Other than that, go to Benihana for a quick sushi dinner that is decent quality and price for sushi but no atmosphere - don't say i didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"I've come here so many times and generally had awesome experiences. Yesterday my wife and I decided to see if we could get in for teppanyaki. We knew there would probably be a wait, and we were about 20 minutes away. The girl who answered the phone said they couldn't take reservations for less than an hour's notice. I was fine with that and asked if it was busy and she said \"there's only two people in the lobby, but that can change any minute.\" I said we'll be there in 20 and hope to beat the rush, and we hung up. When we go there they said the wait was 2 hours! I asked them why they they didn't say that when I called and they first said I must have called the wrong location. I hit redial on my cell and it rang right to their front desk. So I said obviously I called the right place. Then they RUDELY said they never said that to me on the phone and asked who I talked to. I said it was a girl and they said there were only 2 girls answering the phone, but neither wanted to admit it. Then, one eventually admitted it, and I said \"so you did answer my call, then?! Why didn't you tell me how long the wait was when I asked instead of misleading me by saying there was only 2 people in the lobby?\" She only halfway said she was sorry and the manager was literally standing right there. I basically left because they made no attempt to make it right. Apparently they are willing to lose customers. Way unprofessional, and the decrease in their Yelp ratings over the last year shows I'm not the only one."}
{"text":"My older brother is special needs and has some personal dietary restrictions. He lives in a care home a few hours away, so when he visited us in Pittsburgh a little while back, I really thought it would be fun for him to experience Hibachi for the first time. I had read some rave reviews about how accommodating Benihana had been in other locations, so we decided to visit Benihana in Greentree. My brother was so excited.  It was almost 10 pm, so we called first to see if they were still seating. They said yes. The place was completely empty. Our waitress was lovely. We told her we wanted to try and make sure my brother had the closest Hibachi experience he could with his dietary limits. One part of my brother's disability is that he only eats the same foods every day and cannot deviate.   I asked if we could substitute chicken for shrimp for the appetizer (assuming there would probably be a small up-charge). We also asked that instead of rice or noodles, if, with his steak dinner, he could just have extra vegetables (again, assuming that there may be a small up-charge). Our waitress was very understanding, but said that she had to check with the manager first. She came back and said the manager said they couldn't accommodate.  I asked to see manager. Directly in front of my brother, the manager said that they weren't able to accommodate and crassly explained that if \"he\" \"wanted\" a chicken appetizer instead of shrimp, we would have to buy a whole chicken dinner and if \"he\" \"wanted\" extra vegetables instead of rice or noodles, we would just have to buy another dinner. I was mortified, my boyfriend was mortified, the waitress looked mortified. My brother was uncomfortable and embarrassed and just kept staring down.  This was not the experience I was hoping my brother to have ... a gross display of disgusting and careless discrimination that has made me hurt for him his entire life. He shouldn't have been put in that position.  In case there was any confusion, I calmly made one last ditch effort to privately explain to the manager about my brother, but it was to no avail. I was livid. We paid for our one round of drinks, tipped the waitress - whose compassion touched my heart - and left.  I have to admit, I contemplated escalating this.   Shame on you Benihana. If that manager still has his job, I would suggest some kind of training on how to be a decent human being and not make others feel like they are a second class citizen just because they may be a little different from you. It's 2016. Get with the program.  ***Also, in case you're wondering, my brother has since been back to Pittsburgh for a visit and did get to have his first Hibachi at Saga in Robinson. They were wonderful, accommodating and respectful."}
{"text":"We tried to make a reservation and was placed on hold so long that we drove to the restaurant and when we informed the hostess, she giggled and said \"0h.\"  No apology, so we walked away and did not celebrate our birthday there."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at Benihana and had an amazing time.  Our waiter Alex was outstanding and was on top of everything we needed.  Carlos was our chef and did an amazing job cooking for us.   Bar area is nice as well and there's an outside patio area that looks right on The Strip.  It was too chilly the night we went to sit out there but on teh right evening it would be great.   I will say it's rather loud so if you're looking for a quiet restaurant this isn't the one.    Food was really good and fresh."}
{"text":"Used to be our go to birthday location when the kids where young.  The sushi is good and the grill stations are fun.  Again kids love it!  You have to go at least once and make a reservation."}
{"text":"We went with friends and their two little kids.  While the food was okay, a little bland for my taste.  I've been to Benihana's before and this was probably a little below expectations.  However, our chef is what inspired me to give this one five stars.  It was the two kids first experience to a teppan restaurant and our chef definitely played to them.  It was an awesome experience for the kids which made all the adults happy.  My favorite part was when our chef asked the little boy in our group to cook the chicken gave him a spatula and kept asking if he remembered to flip the chicken.  Priceless moments!  Thanks Benihana!"}
{"text":"We used to go to this Benihana when I was a kid and they had a show out front.  I was a little bummed out that the show is gone.  It reminded me of Chuck E Cheese.  Anyhow, we had a short wait to get seated even though we had a reservation (we did arrive early).  Our sushi chef was good, but not awesome.  I got the shrimp and scallops and absolutely loved the scallops.  I've been to other Benihana's, but I think I got more food and it was cooked better here then any of the others.  Definitely exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Zack Zack Zack!!!!  This BEST!!!!!!!!!! COOK!!!!!!!! Zack came frm the Arcadia CA location and I use to always visit him. Hes the best behanina cook I've ever ever ever had! Thank u zack for an amazing show and amazing food. You are one of a kind cook. Thank u!"}
{"text":"This Benihana location is not what it used to be the food does not taste the way it used to taste the sushi taste very bland all the chefs are not Asian Japanese or Chinese so if you're going for an authentic feel you won't find it here it is a lot more pricier than the competitors but unfortunately Benihana is a thing of the past at least in Beachwood I would highly recommend going to Wasabi's on Rockside Road or Fiji Japan in Macedonia if I woulda wrote this review 2 years ago it would have been 5 stars but this place is really gone bad I know them when they used to be the samurai and the samurai was 100 times better than benihanas but Benihana was good I guess for the last 15 years but now it's just terrible the food didn't even taste like Japanese food to me. And to top it all off it was my wife's birthday and I told the manager and our chef and our server and when the time came to leave they didn't even want to sing happy birthday for us or bring a dessert and told us we're very short staffed right now but meanwhile the tables next to us had people that work at the restaurant singing happy birthday and taking pictures of them very unpleasant service we received that is very expensive for nothing."}
{"text":"I came here for the Happy Hour. Awesome deal here and it's Benihana! Some say I have Benihana issues but I don't think it's a problem unless you don't like good food.  Our chef was awesome. Did all the tricks and was very entertaining and funny to watch. Our waitress was very kind and refills were quick. I am gonna come here again for the happy hour.   This place is great for groups or even flying solo dolo. Non happy hour prices are a little pricey but the quality is solid!"}
{"text":"I love going to a good teppen restaurant, but was disappointed by Bennihana.  I've heard people here and there talk about Bennihana and how good it is.    When visiting here I had just started not eating meat and ordered the tofu dinner.  $22.50 for tofu!   I also ordered the novelty drink served in a ceramic maneki neko cat.  The drink of course was all sweetness and no alcohol.  Super novelty restaurant with mediocre food ... maybe it's because I ordered tofu and don't like seafood?  However, I was out with my friends so overall, I had a good time.  Loved the d√©cor!  Upon entering the restaurant I felt like I was walking into a ride at Disneyland!"}
{"text":"Last night a group of us visited Benihana in The Westgate Resort.  My first impression was not pleasant.  The hostesses were rude and grouchy. However, once we were seated, the level of customer service was amazing.  Sachee (spelling may be wrong) and David were so accommodating and fun.   The food was pretty good though though not worth the price we paid."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant. We've eaten in many but this is, by far, the best!"}
{"text":"Today is my birthday! I had the pleasure of having Arelis as my chef. She was great! My food tastes sooooo delicious. Like I eat at Benihana so often that my boyfriend calls it McDonalds. Kim was my server and very helpful and courteous. Definitely look forward to visiting again thanks to the best customer service from Kim & Arelis. Thank you guys again!"}
{"text":"Well, we had a 4:45 pm reservation we had 7 of our 10 people waiting 10 mins ahead of schedule and they wouldn't seat the party until everyone had arrived. The remaining 3 people arrived at 4:48 pm. By 5:15 - 5:20 we were still waiting to be seated. We were here for a birthday celebration and I was extremely surprised that with more than 1/2 of our party and time to spare that they wouldn't seat us. We had a few small kids, a baby in a carrier, an 89 year old woman and they made us wait long afterward to be seated.   This was my first visit to Benihana and I wasn't completely impressed with the start of our visit. However, by the time we were seated things eased up a little bit. Although, interesting that no one made any mention of the hold up or the reasoning for the hold up since our table was open that entire time. Our chef was awesome! I wish I could recall his name because I actually saw him mentioned on here and was super excited when he was assigned to our table.   He did a stupendous job of impressing the kids and was very enjoyable to watch. I had the Yakisoba, the salad and the miso soup. Yes. it was amazingly good. I had bites of everyone's dish and they were all good. Really really good. I couldn't finish my entire dish so I ended up taking it home and upon reheating it, it was still very very good.   I wasn't responsible for paying the tab but from what I hear it really is expensive. So, as long as someone else is covering dinner I am totally in. HA! Seriously though, it's worth the experience even if it isn't a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"Very bad experience ! Yes I can in and we didn't have a reservation but they gave me a 20 mins min... we waiting a hour and a half to be seated ! Then half of our meals came out some of my family members ate and some didn't then we still have to wait another 30 mins for the rest of the food to come out! Customer services really sucked ! I have visited other Benihana's never have i been this disappointed !"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is terrible.  We have to wait for over 30 mins before the Teppanyaki chef shows up.  He then forgot to cook my chicken until I remind him.  The server then give me the wrong check and over charge me.  When I ask him to correct it, he said he need the manager need to override and actually he does not know how to do it and need another serve to help.  The teppanki chef is over worked."}
{"text":"The food is average. Have had better sushis at other places. The ambience and theatrics of the chefs are a good treat. They take a loooong time to get started though. Service is mediocre. Overall its good to experience something different but wouldn't try this frequently."}
{"text":"What a joke.   Benihana.com has a $39 special on the home page .   It says nothing about participating locations!   Guess what ?   No specialls allowed here the server says.   \"We don't onna dat\" she says in broken English ."}
{"text":"This is theeeeee absolute worst beni ever I only left a tip in hopes that they could buy some customer service it was my sisters first time she hated it after all I did was praise Benihana on excellence they turned me into a liar oh and fix the air conditioner even the chef had an attitude because it was so cold maybe that's why our food tasted like shxt?"}
{"text":"Great time. Staff was exceptional and nice.  Very family friendly.  A little slow but super fun atmosphere so it was awesome experience"}
{"text":"Upon walking into the restaurant there was a gentleman standing right outside smoking a cigarette, wearing baggy shorts with flip flops with a firearm on his waist. I am pro gun rights but seriously?! Please secure your weapon. Benihana's has a dress code which this man was obviously not adhering to but his gun flopping around on his hip made our family (with young children) feel very unsafe. I am surprised they allow firearms in their establishment. We went in regardless. Made a reservation for our family but Waited 10+ minutes to be seated with another family. Unfortunately we were seated with the man carrying the gun so we decided to leave.  I support your right to open carry but please be responsible and to Benihana's I would suggest enforcing some safety codes along with that dress code you don't seem to care much about."}
{"text":"Went for bday with the certificate. My son had a great time. Our chef, John, was fabulous! My scallops were cooked to perfection as was my calamari steak and shrimp. He also was amazing at the tricks and didn't even bat an eye when my 2 year old threw a shrimp back on the grill!   My mom had the tuna steak (also seared perfectly) and a coconut mojito which she said was pretty good.   Overall good experience but the chef made the night, thanks John!"}
{"text":"Benihana goes beyond just food.  Dining here is an experience.   Arelis was our chef, and she kept us entertained with her juggled spatulas even as she served amazing melt-in-your mouth scallops, and tender and tasty steak.    The rest of the staff was knowledgeable and attentive.  I couldn't be happier with my meal here, and I look forward to visiting again as soon as I can."}
{"text":"This place is just bizarre. It's  like your bipolar ex friend , you never know what is going to happen. Went here with family.  This joint managed to piss  my brother in law off. He is a freaking tolerant individual. They made our party wait 30 minutes even though he had reservations. I just went to see my nephews and did not really eat much, and asked for a separate bill. I let the server know i needed to leave early. I asked for my bill. Once I  was handed the bill I  did not see the server . I went to the front of the house and tried to pay my bill . 10 minutes later no server. I then asked to speak with the manager and he gave my bill to another server and 10 more minutes passed, before I got my bill.  I should have walked out. Just horrible service for extremely overpriced bland average food."}
{"text":"Flaming Volcanos?  Shrimp flip into the hat?  How much more can you handle?  We have been to other Benihana restaurants before, enjoying both the grill side and the sushi bar side.  The hubby-to-be and I went to eat more sushi.  The sushi bar was totally dead, and the chefs didn't really talk to us except to ask if the sushi was good.  I lied a little, because they were a little on the warm side, and they fell apart when picked up.  We had the typical warm edamame minus salt?!?!?  How can you eat edamame without salt?  I guess you have to ask for it to be salted.  We decided to take a trip around the country and ordered a CA roll, Phili roll, Alaskan roll, Boston roll and added the Shrimp lovers roll.    The server missed our empty iced tea glasses on a few occasions (it is darn hot here in AZ and we were thirsty!) and she wasn't the most pleasant person.    If you have a group of people in town, this is a great place for food entertainment.  Make sure you budget your time, as the \"show\" and eating can last a couple hours.    They have their own parking lot, and lots of indoor seating when there is a long wait (make reservations on the weekends!)"}
{"text":"It was my 1st time to Benihana's and it was a free meal for my birthday day! I went with my friends on a Thursday night, we had 6:30 pm reservations, we got their early so we hit the bar for happy hour, let me tell you I think I have found me a new drink!! The Mango Saketini!! Ohh mmmyy goodnesss its sooo yummy! Had me about 3 of them that night, man why is it that Thursday nights always feel like it should be a Friday,,,I don't get it.  We got to our table and come to find out their where 2 other birthday girls! So 3 at one table! Leos rule I say!   Our chef for the night was Roberto, he was cute and put on a good show, our servers I didn't catch their names, one was nice eye candy, ladies let me tell you Benihana's has some nice looking eye candy!  Of course our server kept calling me ma'am must have had my grandma gear on haha.  But about the food, let me tell you!! I ordered  1/2 rolls of the Boston & Philly sushi rolls, both where delish and so fresh, the salmon and tuna was soo dang good made me wish I ordered full rolls.  For dinner I ordered the hibachi steak, my friends ordered the Land n Sea and Deluxe Treat, now let me tell you  on the land n sea the scallops where buttery good and the shrimp appetizer, I don't even like shrimp, but was very sad to see mine was all gone, it was that good.  The lobster on the deluxe treat wasn't that good to me, it was fishy. The veggies where very fresh and grilled just right, I didn't care for the dipping sauce for the veggies, it was a little too salty for me.   But overall the place and the food were great! I'm guessing Benihana's from what I saw is the type of place you goto for a special occasion and the place had a great vibe and great staff, can't wait until I get to help celebrate a friend's birthday or whatever reason that brings me back to Benihana's...Shoot might just goto Happy Hour to get that dang Mango Saketini!"}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to have a nice dinner to celebrate my sister's graduation. We decided on Benihana for their fame of having an amazing teppanyaki experience. When we initially arrived to the restaurant it looked completely empty but don't let that fool you. Once we got inside we were directed to the elevator that took us to the second floor where they have several tables with many chiefs cooking all at the same time. One of my main complaints would have to be how hot it was. There are many chiefs cooking at the same time and the entire second floor was significantly warmer than the first floor of the restaurant. With the scorching heat of Vegas the last thing I need is to be uncomfortably hot while I eat. Also, this was not my first time having a teppanyaki style dinner and I was surprised with the lack of privacy. All the tables are relatively close and it was hard to focus one our chef while he was cooking in front of us while there was 2 chefs in front and to the side of our table being just as loud.   Prior to your main course they serve you a salad and a mushroom soup. The salad had a really good tangy dressing but the soup tasted like salted water with a couple slices of mushrooms. As my main course I ordered chicken with fried rice. The chicken was really juicy and the fried rice was impressive as well. At the end of the meal they also give you hot tea. I only had a sip of the tea because I was so hot on the second floor. I didn't miss out on much because the tea was very diluted and the water tasted like it came from a faucet.   When our dinner was over and we were handed to bill our server made sure that we understood that our bill did not already include the tip. I don't know about you but it bothers me when people make me feel obligated to tip. I usually tip well when warranted so I hate it when people make me feel obligated to tip when I am already going to tip you pretty well.   Overall, I would probably never go back unless I had to."}
{"text":"This Benihana is located inside the LVH. Thank goodness for it, too.  On Wednesday night, my dad took some of his customers out to eat here. It's 2 stories, and it's actually a VERY nice set up. Very Asian-esque, and..it was just really pretty. They have this \"firework\" show that they do as well.   Anyway, I went to meet up with my dad with my sister and her bf, and they had a little patio outside from where my dad was sat. It was set up like it was outside. With birds chirping and all. It also had a cigarette stand with about 20 buds. You would think that you could smoke out there then....right?  So, my dad smoked. The manager came stomping in and said, \"NO SMOKING!!\" -_- DAFCK. Lol. Why are you going to have that in there with used cigs and say no smoking! They didn't know it was there. -_-_-   Thursday night, since there's really nowhere else to eat, my dad took us out to eat here. The manager saw my dad and immediately say, \"Don't smoke in here again!\" Don't be rude about it brah. But, as the manager was seating us, he ended up being a super funny guy. He had jokes on him..I like dat.   We ended up getting the same cook my dad had the night before, and he was AWESOME. His name is James, so if you guys ever go there..I hope you get him! He's so funny. Our waitress was named Mokoto, and she was the sweetest gal ever. Always so happy!   The thing I liked most about this Benihana, is that everyone is mainly Japanese/Asian. It's way more authentic than the Torrance location, because everyone there..all the cooks are Hispanic. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it just doesn't feel authentic. At this location, it did.   Since I've been here many times, I knew of the tricks he was going to do, but he changed it up on me! Made the whole grill light up with fiyahh!   Also, they randomly comped us a round of free drinks for no reason. Possibly because we were speaking Japanese to them? Who knows..   We also ate here on Friday night, because it was going to be a free dinner. I'm seriously Benihana-ed out for a while LOL. James happened to be at the table behind us, and we were bummed that he couldn't cook for our table again that night. We took a picture with him though! Hahah."}
{"text":"This place is a great for birthdays or any celebrating event, nice they can accommodate for 19 of us.  The food is always ok seasoned with butter, soy sauce, salt, and pepper.  Sorry to say it tasteless and overprice (paying for the show).  The show is not as fun and exciting as it was before.  Our table on \"leftovers - rice and vegetables\" from the previous show.  He did not wipe down the cooking surface prior to started cooking.  We had to ask him to please wipe down the cooking surface.  But our server was great, she was so attentive and we never had to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi restaurant I've ever seen. Food is horrible but expensive. Service is horrible, too. If there is a zero star I would never give it one point. Do not come here. Save your time, save your money!"}
{"text":"Great dinner! Nancy took very good care of us and the food was delicious we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"SO disappointed in this Benihana. My daughter wanted to go to a Japanese hibachi restaurant for her 16th birthday, so I made reservations for 7pm on the Benihana website. We showed up at our reserved time only to be told that our table wasn't ready quite yet. 15 minutes later I ask the assistant manager when we will be seated and his reply was \"Well, I have to be honest with you - There are three other groups with a 7pm reservation ahead of you. Table availability depends on how many chefs we have here tonight.\" After 30 minutes of waiting and seeing only 1 of the 'reservation' groups ahead of us get seated, we bailed out. The term 'reservation' apparently means nothing to this place and I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food always great and our chef was pretty good, however the hostesses were so incredibly rude! It really ruins your first encounter when hostesses are rude!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is great. When I called to ask about happy hour the guy was kinda monotoned. I guess it wasn't that busy. Plus it was raining in Vegas    Lunch menu is awesome! HALF THE PRICE GUYS! Whoop  Kyle our grill chef was great, super funny! Ask for him to be your chef if he's in! The atmosphere was a little quite but it was lunch time. We did get to sit with two other couples and they were great too! The food. Spot on.   My scallops were grilled nicely. super soft and I had enough to share with my mom and brother. We all ordered the chicken fried rice which was $1 extra which isn't bad. The alternative is veggie fried rice.  Mom and brother got the hibachi chicken. It was a little dry for my, but I'm not much of a grilled chicken girl either. My mom and my brother enjoyed it very much.  My salad was good, nothing special. Just iceberg lettuce and some carrots. The dressing was your usual ginger miso.  Soup, i would go with that next time. It had an amazing mushroom broth with just a slice or mushroom and tempura onions! It was delish. Def an UMAMI dish   Looking forward to going to eat here for my sister in laws birthday this week! Gonna try the steak next time!"}
{"text":"Just wrote a bad review of the Chandler Benihana which reminded me I owed Scottsdale a good review.    We went in July for my husband's and best friend's birthday.  Of course they had the bday certificates.  Since theirs were covered I indulged and ordered the Hibachi Chateaubriand to share with my 7 year old.  OMG it was extremely tender and delicious with the garlic butter.   So repeatable.   Our chef was very personable and cooked everything perfectly.  Scottsdale Benihana is so much better across the board (food, service, and environment)  than Chandler Benihana.  Worth a longer drive."}
{"text":"Benihana of Chandler is RIDICULOUS!!!!   Four of us were meeting for dinner at 6 pm.  I wanted their new Tempura basket (just got their e-mail advertising it) - not a chef's table needed item.  So I made reservations on-line and said I didn't need the Chef Table, figured why tie up 4 seats at a Chef's table.  I get there @ 5:50 to be told they don't take reservations for non chef tables which are actually in the lounge.  I go in there to see 3 regular tables...2 taken and another \"reserved\" how is that so?  The hostess says we can have the center table a large high stool pub table.  REALLY?  With a seven year old?  Let alone who wants to have a nice quiet meal in the \"bar\" with your feet dangling?     Walked out and had a nice meal at Chili's next door!  From now on going to Scottsdale Benihana where they have a nice non-lounge and non-chef table area for people to have a quiet dinner...that's what I expected at Chandler.    Also, they told me they tried to reach me.  No phone call, text or e-mail all day.  Come home to find they canceled my reservation at 5:53 (what while I was standing there?) CRAPPY customer service!"}
{"text":"Had a great night here yesterday. The server was amazing and the chef (Tony) was top notch, hard to tell it wasn't a weekend. Have been to other Benihana locations, but this takes the cake. Great cuts of meat, perfectly seasoned everything. Definitely make reservations just in case it gets busy. Great to go with young kids -it will keep them very distracted!"}
{"text":"First of all let it be known that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Hibachi!!! With that being said the food was good enough to merit 2 stars.   I attended dinner at this place last night and experienced the WORST SERVICE I have ever experienced at an establishment.... From the server taking forever to take our drink orders to the hibachi chef arguing with me about what I ordered as well as my desire to have ginger sauce with my meal.... It was beyond exhausting! The capper to it all was the waitress taking what seemed like years to bring our check in order for my date and I to actually put an end to this awful dining experience!!   #NeverAgain #WasabiHereIcome"}
{"text":"Terrible experience at Benihana. Sat in the sushi lounge where we were told the food would be the same as Teppan grill. Completely false. Our food didn't come out for over 45 minutes and when it did they forgot part of the main dish and fried rice.   In regards to health and cleanliness, I watched the sushi chef sneeze on his right hand and then continue to make sushi. The bathroom desperately needed maintenance with paper towels all over the floor.   Do not go to this Benihana unless you want to overpay for a poor experience. There are tons of other incredible restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Asides from the fact that Steve Aioki's dad founded Benihana, this ACTUAL location is pretty cool. It's the new establishment of the Benihana chain, but of course, they added more flair by modernizing it, opening up, and just adding nothing but red on red on red. For some reason, red seems to be the thing. Like if it's super red inside, some spontaneous thing happens that wouldn't expect to happen in an establishment, or that maybe there's a secret door that leads to some secret room that holds the answers to all of our worldly questions.   Anyways! We hit up Benihana's for a friend's birthday, because it's her favorite spot (let's call her Tami). Tami's husband, spoke to the waitress and asked for the funniest guy in the restaurant. You're welcome. I've cracked the ultimate teppanyaki code. Usually, in experiences like these you pray that the chef you get is the funniest person in the establishment. It makes or breaks your experience. The whole thing is like playing roulette, but with your chef. So I've cracked the code. We got the funniest guy in that place. His name is Tony. Tony the tiger (That's right! You heard me!). I believe he's off on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. So if you're there, and you want the funny guy. No need to slip a $5. Just ask for Tony. ;)  He'll make you spongebob. He'll make you a minion. He'll even write your name on the grill with egg whites. You are a charmer ,Tony! Yes. You. Are. I know. Total spoiler alert, but you'll thank me later when you're coordinating your party, and you want to validate that your chef is funny to ensure your party is happy.  You know the usual fixings here if you're a regular, but I would highly recommend getting that housemade diabolo sauce. It is literal fire. Your mouth will be feeling ten different shades of hotness, but it is addicting.   Also, ask for extra garlic butter. Why? Because your are an adventurer! You live life on the edge! No cholesterol, high blood pressure, or food coma is going to stop you from getting exactly what you want!"}
{"text":"I love Benihana and have been to many locations, but this was the worst dining experience I've ever had. We waited well over an hour for a chef to come to the table and within the first 45 minutes we had only been served drinks (just water). The waitress was clearly high and several people at the table noticed as well. We waited so long for drinks that two people left during that time. The whole time we were waiting, the manger just walked around doing nothing and was completely oblivious to anything that was happening in the restaurant. When someone at the table asked him how long it would be before a chef came he had no idea and did nothing to go check. Kyle, our chef, was the only positive part of the experience. He tried to make the most of the situation when clearly we had been waiting for almost an hour and a half for someone to come. The food he made was delicious and he went above and beyond to try and salvage everyone's dining experience. Clearly, the manger did not care whatsoever about how his restaurant was being run, the service that was given, or even the sobriety of his employees."}
{"text":"What a great birthday dinner for my newly 13 year old son! We had his sisters with us as well, 15, and 9... my 9 year old was clapping and laughing all the way thru the dinner! It was so delicious and super filling also! We love this place, and have been to many of them around the country, and it never disappoints!!! Love it! Thank you Benihana, for a great memory!!!!"}
{"text":"I have not been to Benihana in years and frankly, I waited too long. Not only is this the largest one in the world, the service and food was exceptional. Hao and Tung were partnered for our meal at the dinner. They were fantastic! We felt very welcome and in control of our meal. Tung interacted with two youngsters at the table and made age appropriate jokes that had them cracking up!  A last minute meal change did not irritate them in the slightest bit.   Meal portions were huge. Next time I'll bring more home and save room for the ice cream."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever gotten. Our waiter was Caleb. They forgot the vegetables with the food then brought them out when we were done. They brought out incorrect rice for all of us and the server did not bring the desert that was included with the price if the meal."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp scallops and calimari. It was pretty bland. We had the only japanese cook and he was the only one who couldn't spin knives. Throw things in the air etc. Was dissapointed. The waiter couldn't speak English and charged me fir a vodka on ice that we didn't order. Trying to get them to take it off the bill was more frustrating and stressful than paying the 7.50 for it. Next time I think I'll try an authentic Japanese place if I have the urge for Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Was in Vegas Dec. 2, 2011 for husbands birthday.  Had a party of 25, service was terrible.  Waitress was very rude and short.  After dinner no one was asked if they wanted complimentary desert that comes with meal.  Waitress came back with bill for both tables and was sure to point out how much gratuity was to be paid.  Asked if they were going to sing happy birthday' they never returned.  In the mean time another group of people came in and all attention was on them. I rarely play the RACE card, but.......things that make you go hmmmm!  I don't recommend any group of color to patronize this establishment.  (In Vegas that is).  Cooks were great!"}
{"text":"came here with the family and had high expectations considering it was a high end type of restaurant. it was no surprise to me that most of their dishes were towards $30 a plate which was expensive but i had high hopes for taste. the show they put on in front of you was pretty cool too. as we were plated our food, their portions is not satisfying! also their taste was good but not great. i give it 5 stars for showmanship, 3 stars for taste/portions. good experience though"}
{"text":"The decor/lighting at this Chandler location leaves a lot to be desired but aside from that, it's a perfectly adequate experience for a teppanaki-style dinner.  It's always more enjoyable with a lively group but the cooks are always entertaining, in a cheesy, G-rated kind of way.  As for the food, I agree that the SUSHI here is always tasty but I've gotten rolls where the rice wasn't sticky and the roll fell apart (never a good thing). Sashimi always tasted fresh and a decent portion for the price.  I always upgrade to the Fried Rice and I recommend eating it right after it comes off the grill; otherwise, there's not much difference from the local Panda chain. The seafood/steak combinations are best but everyone knows that grilling shrimp/scallops/lobster is the quickest way to dry out/overcook seafood so it's never as enjoyable as sauteed or steamed seafood. But, alas, it's the experience of having it cooked in front of you that brings people back and that's probably why I go back 2-3 times a year."}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for her birthday because it's her favorite restaurant. We had a party of eight and with making reservations on open table we were sat immediately. This was the best experience I've had at a Benihana's restaurant by far and I've been to several. Our Chef \"John Mark\" was excellent and then some. The way he entertained us and had us smiling and laughing made our experience that much better. And the way he prepared our meals was even better, he asked us about how we liked certain things prepared and he also added a very special touch to each individual meal. I wish we could take him back to Atlanta to teach his counterparts. This experience was the best."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place gets even remotely good reviews. First of all the times are completely wrong they really close an hour and a half before what is listed as their closing times. I went there one night for a somewhat late dinner and they said that they were closing, which I have no problem with but what's the point of listing closing times if those are the incorrect closing times. And the staff who said that to me were completely rude and condescending. So I went there another night just to give it a second chance and once again the staff were rude again. The food was bland and nothing special and not to mention the smell of smoke everywhere made the whole dining experience that much more unpleasant. So many other food options to choose from in Vegas that are exponentially better than what is offered here."}
{"text":"This is probably my sixth time visiting this teppanyaki restaurant. Why do I keep coming back? Certainly not the food nor the high price.  I come here because of the show that keeps the kids entertained and allows the adults to hang out for a leisurely two hour dinner.  Depending on your chef, the experience can be less than stellar.  We were lucky to have a true entertainer, Kevin, who added another star to this review.    Reservations for 11 at 730pm, we were seated at 750pm.   Service was very slow, as usual .  We ordered salmon, lobster, shrimp, steak, scallops, chicken, fried rice along with the soup, salad, edamame, and green tea.  Ginger and mustard sauces were given to everyone.   The tap water is not filtered or the filter needs to be changed.  They provide lemon wedges to mask the taste.  The lobster, as usual, was tough and chewy.  The salmon comes out overcooked due to the high heat of the grill.  The fried rice, mushrooms, and onions were all tasty having been spiced up with Salt, pepper, butter, and soy sauce.    I ordered sherbet, the server made sure to tell me there was an additional charge.   Our bill was in excess of $450 dollars.    We were  overcharged, they charged us for my sons meal twice.   Food / service 2.5 stars  Kevin / chef / entertainer 4 stars Cost 2 stars  I keep coming back though."}
{"text":"Awesome food for a special night!!! Shizuka was an amazing server! She was so much fun and personable. Andres was our chef. Everything was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Great food & ambience, we had a good time. Shrimp, steak & veggies as good as always. I highly recommend joining there birthday club for some great savings"}
{"text":"Still great.....organized. Reservation always ready. Well trained servers and chefs.  We had ANOThER. B- day celebration here. Everyone loved their food. Consistently excellent"}
{"text":"The dinner room is the place, over the teppan yaki  table. Akiko-San is the best waitress in the restaurant, she is the best. Always has good conversations with us. The filet mignon or the scallops is a must!"}
{"text":"My experience at Benihana was very disappointing tonight. All of our plates and silverware were dirty. The chef seemed inexperienced and did not perform the typical table tricks that we so much look forward to. The portions were the smallest I have ever seen and there were not even enough vegetables for everyone to have some at the table. I am not sure if this is common, but I was very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Excellent meal last night, Ryan may of been the best chef we had at any Benihana we have visited.  He skills and personality were a great combination, food was perfect!"}
{"text":"Group of 8 for lunch . I did not pick the restaurant . Very disappointing , service was stiff and forced we were just numbers at a table and any request while filled was an imposition . I have had better banquet TV dinner than what was served . Again  I just felt we were passing through. Hurry up eat and leave . This review covers lunch at the hibachi tables."}
{"text":"**CONSUMER ALERT - EMPLOYEE STATED THEY ARE BUYING THEIR MEAT FROM LOCAL ALBERTSONS GROCERY STORES DUE TO SHORTAGES FROM THEIR SUPPLIER CISCO - I'M NOT SURE WHICH IS SCARIER!**  Okay so here starts the saga of our Christmas day dinner at Benihana on the Las Vegas Strip. We arrive mid afternoon and upon entering the restaurant, a distinct smell of thick grease and old fish wafts through the air. It's as if they had no ventilation fans pulling out the air from all of the cooking at the Teppan tables. We are seated within a few minutes and then the saga began.  Our drink orders and meal orders are first taken by the kind waitress; and then the soup and salad comes out. The soup was luke-warm in temperature; and the salad dressing tasted off this time around (overly garlicky and bitter), and not the typical amazing taste.  Out comes our 20 something Benihana chef, a very kind gentleman. As he prepares the food, most of his tricks fail during the show. I asked if they are still professionally trained; to which he stated that old retired Benihana corporate chefs came in and gave the new hires a couple of lessons. Really! These guys used to be master chefs trained by Benihana in Japan. Now we get young millennials with a couple of chop chop lessons; scared of the knives flying into your children's faces!  He further stated that they were going to be super busy that night, and that they were already running out of food. When I asked why he said that they only get their deliveries on Mondays; and since it was Christmas that they didn't get their delivery.  I then asked when the meats he was preparing for us came in; to which he replied that Sysco came last Monday. I then asked what they were going to do about the shortages that night; to which he replied that managers and employees were being sent around to Albertsons grocery stores to buy up their meats. Are you kidding me I responded! We're paying over $300. bucks for Christmas and our meals are coming from Albertsons. He laughed and shrugged it off and kept cooking. BTW they were already out of Lobster by 2:30pm as the table behind us was being told during their introduction.  So now on to the food... The fried rice was soggy and mushy, the filet mignon was all lacking flavor; and even though prepared medium - was not tender at all! (Albertsons grade LOL). The shrimp all lacked flavor and was way overcooked, the hibachi veggies consisted solely of a mass of grilled onions. Made me think like I needed a hot dog to go along with them. The chicken was just weird and rubbery, and basically the entire holiday meal was a complete and utter joke - not to mention a waste of time. To top it all off, they forgot the 2 kids steaks; so when everyone was already eating, the kids just sat and waited like 15 more minutes to go find more steak. They probably had to get it out of the front seat of the employees car that had just gotten back from Albertsons.  To the management of Benihana; it is a sad day when I have to write such a horrific review of such a shitty holiday experience. Shame on you for not being prepared for your most important customers in Christmas day. Get your act together, and corporate best get theirs together as well; otherwise your rent will sooner rather then later far exceed your profits!  Thanks for a ruined Christmas dinner and robbing us of $300 bucks! I want to seriously forget about this shitty experience.  PS: Your green tea ice cream tasted like milk with no matcha flavor whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. It was a good time. And using my birthday certificate even cut the bill in half. The chef was fun and nice. The food was pretty good. And you get plenty! The wait time was a half hour but it ended up being even shorter. Overall, this is an excellent restaurant with a great location.  I am deducting one star for 3 small reasons: 1) In the past 6 months I have been to 4 other similar restaurants. The chef has performance at Benihana was the worst in comparison. This is probably due to the fact that we couldn't hear our chef over all the noise from the many other tables. 2) In comparison to other restaurants, the food is the same. It isn't anything special. 3) When we exited Benihana at about 9 pm, the Fashion Show Mall was closed. We had parked beneath and planned to shop after our meal. We are locals and even the mall near us is open past 9 so we figured the mall on the Strip would be too. For locals, it really isn't worth making a trip to that part of the Strip for dinner.  Unless you are comparing this to another Teppanyaki place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 630 our FIRST TIME there we waited 1hr and 45mins just sitting at our table asked what was going on kept being told he was loading up his tray 30mins later nothing yet and hour 15 later still nothing as we watched guest who came in way after us get served and already eating we got up and left of course we were not going to pay for our drinks and little salads and soup!!!! WORST FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR AMAZING SERVICE!!! Will not be back"}
{"text":"This is a really fun over the top benihana ---- definitely very theatrical --- but c'mon, this is vegas, so of course it's gotta be crazy circus-y. Anyways, the decor is super fun - it's located inside the Japanese Village in the Las Vegas Hilton. The show was fun, as always, and the food was standard issue Benihana - delish.  The chef and waitress were super nice and were on top of our every need. YUM!"}
{"text":"Not one of the best Benihana's but at least check it out for the decor and size of the restaurant. It's the largest in the world so that's pretty cool and it looks a little like the restaurant used in one of the fight sequences in Kill Bill. There are water features, bridges, tables everywhere it looked like a movie set.   The place was empty, there were maybe 5 people in the downstairs dining area and upstairs there were a few full Teppan tables. We were shoved in a back table in a small room, we got there a little late so we were seated with the most boring people on the planet - and you know fun people are part of the experience of restaurants like this.   It took a few minute to get our drink order and our food order then about 25 minutes go by - no salad, no soup but they sit another two people. Um ok, a little late to the game but whatever. Our soup comes out, the late people give their order, another 15 minutes go by and our salads come out. 30 more minutes go by and oh look our chef. Their timing was horrible, we were sat at 8:15 and our dinner wasn't completely served until 10:20. They were so slow that by the time my steak was served, everything was cold and I was no longer hungry. I've never had a Teppan dinner that was this slow and for the restaurant not being busy there really isn't an excuse for it.   The steak was not good, I ordered it medium rare - it was gray/brown on the outside close to burnt and completely raw and bleeding in the center. Not exactly appetizing and not something I want to eat after waiting that long for my food. The fried rice was marginal, the veggies were ok and so was the shrimp. My husband got the spicy chicken and he loved it, maybe that's the key just stick to the chicken here and skip the steak.   My advice is to stick your head in and walk around, then yelp Teppan and find a local spot to go."}
{"text":"I've never had such slow service before.   Our order wasn't even taken until 30 minutes after we sat down.  It took another hour for the chef to come out and cook.  The chef was not entertaining at all.  He cooked very slow.  The fried rice was terrible, The shrimp is not good, It had way too much lemon.  Even the mix of vegetables was terrible, it was a couple pieces of zucchini with a huge pile of onion.   One person in our party had the lobster, she could not eat it it was that terrible."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday for dinner. We were seated at the bar area tables and had to wait awhile to even be greeted by our server. After deciding what we wanted from the menu (two sushi rolls and entrees) our sushi came first. We tasted it and it was a tad dry so I figured id ask for some eel sauce. Our server was nowhere to be found for a good 10 mins. So i got up and asked for sauce from the sushi chef. Fine. After we finished our rolls, finally, about 15 mins later our salad and soup came out. Im not skilled with chopsticks and it took another 5 mins for our waiter to be spotted and more than 5 mins for forks. Plates werent cleared from our small table either. About 15 mins after we were done with soup ond salad our fried rice and shrimp came. By that time i was just ready to get out of there. I was annoyed. The food was good but didnt enjoy it because the service was so bad. After we ate i asked for the check and had to flag him down again to give him the card. I think they need to hire more servers. Service seems to be the biggest issue here. Very upset."}
{"text":"Id like to be clear, Benihana in the LVH (formerly LV Hilton) is like an abusive husband and I am the abused wife who won't leave and will always make excuses for him. I've been coming here for at least 25 years and growing up in a place like Vegas its nice to have at least one place that I thought was cool as a kid that doesn't change.  Before my pros and cons I'd like to voice 1 gripe, Benihana does a thing called chefs table where there is a 2 for 1 special each month. Ive ordered it here several times yet every once in a while the hostess or waitress will say they dont honor it here. I then go thru the uncomfortable exercise of explaining well I ordered it last time and it was no issue. Then after a \"talk with management\" I am fortunate enough to order the special the restaurant inundated me with emails about, gee Im honored!  Oh and EVERY time I have ordered the chef table special I have been told, \"its a small portion. .etc\". No problem I'll take my chances considering the last 5 times I noticed no difference in portion whatsoever. Im mean really Benihana LVH? You have to try and scam a couple extra bucks out of someone who has eaten at your store no less than 75 times??? In the meantime you do so by demeaning your own special! Pros- the show, you either like it or you don't and it never gets old for me Ambiance-  the Benihana Village to me is awesome and I could hang out in the faux Japanese village all night Shrimp- my favorite, love the way its prepared Selection- I don't go to other Beni's but I have been to several other tepanyaki places and none have the array of choices this place has Kids menu- moderate prices and decent portions for the kiddos to make it not a special occasion only situation     Cons, service-very hit and miss. This place gets busy and Im sure the location makes for some loud drunks as well but the servers make you well aware of this with the hurried attitude. Also the front desk guy who has been there forever is not a pleasant gent most of the time, smile dude! Price compared to quality- look I love tge food and even I could tell you the prices are a good 35-50% higher than what I would consider fair. You want a good steak look elsewhere.  Sushi-its just abysmal.  Really no excuse for this, I understand you don't go to Benihana for sushi but the village has a seperate sushi bar. Getting seated next to uninterested diners- I get tense when the chef and his tricks are being ignored by a table full of texters, talkers etc. I realize this has nothing to do with the restaurant but its pretty rude not to at least pretend to be interested when an elderly Japanese man is making choo choo train whistle noises pushing a smoking onion around the table"}
{"text":"We sat in the bar since it was a bit of a wait for a table. We were able to find a high-top right away and received excellent service. Awesome food and awesome service!!! Thank you Corey!!!"}
{"text":"Benihana's are quite the same wherever you are.  However this one is quite nice on the inside. If you are in Vegas and craving Benihana's, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day so I expected the restaurant to be busy although I did make a reservation so waiting wasn't a part of our experience. First, my daughter and I checked in and the hostess said to give them a moment...a moment later another hostess called my name and escorted us to a table that already had people sitting...no problem, in this type of restaurant you sit with strangers, it's part of the experience. Well the 2 empty seats were on each ends of the table and the host that was speaking to the table already seated would not ask them to shift in order to accommodate my daughter and I. So back to the front we went...thanks for the embarrassment. Next we were called by the host to follow him to another table and we were seated at the same time as another family...thank goodness for that! The family was super friendly so that helped a lot! Now for the food, they had a smaller 'Mother's Day' menu with only 2 sushi choices, both of which I didn't like. So I ordered filet and scallops while my daughter ordered shrimp and chicken. I'm sad to say the food lacked flavor...big time. The cook prepared our meals while he put on the typical show but I was extremely disappointed with the food. I came to AZ from Florida and they have Makotos and Fujiyama and I was looking forward to those types of favors in the food especially for a $84 bill for me and my daughter. We probably won't go back but we will try other Japanese teppanyaki style restaurants in the future. I give it 3 stars because the food is ehhhh and the host embarrassing us made it a horrible start but the nice family we sat with makes me feel the need to add the third star."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. Sorry to start off with that type of statement, but its more show then the quality of food.   Let me explain how I ended up giving them a 3 star rating. I gave them 2 stars for the level of customer service and the showmanship of the cook. The staff was extremely attentive and made sure that they made our group as happy as possible. The chief was fun and entertaining while cooking. Seemed like he was using old material for his jokes or maybe I've been to Benihana when I was a kid and I recall the same set of jokes.....kinda lame.   I gave them 1 more star for the fresh vegetables. I expected my surf and turf to be more enjoyable but at best it was average. So over all they get 3 stars.  Hope you enjoy it more then me."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 12 year wedding anniversary dinner enjoying the entertainment and indulging in the meat & seafood delicacies at Benihanas newest location on the strip.   We were fortunate enough to reserve a private room that really made the experience much more intimate and special. Our server and hibachi cook were really on-point with service, being attentive making sure drinks were refilled and plates cleared out of the way as well as our hibachi chef's showmanship--always love the onion fire volcano. Not only were we entertained with the  food preparation but it was also delicious. My Hubby ordered potstickers while I enjoyed the Chili Ponzue YellowTail appetizer. Thereafter we were served soup & salad prior to our main entrees: steak & chicken for my Hubby and lobster, scallops and shrimp (Ocean Treasure) for me along with chicken fried rice. The food was excellent!!   Our server, who had a wonderful bubbly personality, also took our picture to commemorate the evening.   Although we had a great time experiencing the hibachi grill service, after looking at their extensive menu we'll certainly be venturing back to try out their other menu items like the Seafood Diablo."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at this place for years--love the servers! For our last visit, we didn't sit at the Teppanyaki table. There was glass in my fried rice. THERE WAS GLASS IN MY FRIED RICE! It look like some of the pieces of stoneware had chipped off of something. I scratched the roof of my mouth and was bleeding. When I asked for the manager, she decided to \"fix the situation\" by taking the fried rice off the bill--just the fried rice. I couldn't believe it. Also, they should offer an option to sit at a table without children--what a great way to destroy a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Chef Masa came to the table and brought us the sushi sampler. Seemed like all  this was caught that day and that he only served beautiful center cut pieces . My kids loved the show part and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Rudest front desk- reception team ever - completely unimpressed by the incredible lack of respect and quality of help here. They should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Went to Benihana's for myself and my wife's birthday. Had an amazing time and the food was delicious. Tony was our Chef. He was a great host and had us laughing most of our visit. Awesome personality and a hell of a cook. We will definitely be revisiting."}
{"text":"Benihana. For a RESERVATIONS only place I'd expect better. If this was my very first time experiencing hibachi I would be really disappointed. The staff was nice. They didn't wow me one way or another. The mango saketini was the best part of my meal. Other places I have been to include fried rice but it's extra here. It was the second best part of the meal. I got hibachi chicken it was plain and rubbery. Maybe I should have gone for the spicy. The sauces they give you...awful. They both were bitter. The waitress was on top of the drinks! The chefs always do tricks knives, banging, whistling, egg spinning, and catching a lemon in a fork. As luck would have it I got squirted right in eye with a flying drop of juice. This almost never happens. The chef was very concerned, it was an accident, they happen. Pass on the mandarin cheesecake.i was looking forward to it. Not great but I was so hungry because the food was sooo bland. I am not an adventurous eater I don't particularly like things that are overly spicy or flavorful so if I'm saying the food is bland you know it has virtually no taste. Also the location is very difficult to find it isn't clearly marked I walked right past it the first time and the Westgate really needs to have some better signage or directions. I also want to add our reservation was for 6pm, they didn't even start offering drinks until 6:30, it took nearly an hour for the chef to become available to cook our food. We were there for two and half hours!!"}
{"text":"Best time in world's largest Benihana, James is the finest of the Tappan chef's we have ever had. So you can count on a time if you get him. You must try this place when you get to Vegas."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude! The manager was so rude! We came in, explained that we were here for a baby shower and that I was instructed to get appetizers ordered. They refused to do that - told us they wouldn't seat us until our ENTIRE party (40 people) arrived. I asked if that was really reasonable, given the size of the waiting area and the unlikely happening of all 40 people showing up at the same exact time. The manager was so nasty - he flat out said he won't do it - he will NOT sit a table until at least ten people are here.... I said, 10? Before you were saying 40.... so is it 10 or is it 40? He finally agreed to seat us once 10 people arrived... thank god. Please note that it wasn't so much the message that was so awful - it was the nasty tone and the body language. Granted, what he was saying wasn't what was agreed upon during the two phone conversations and the one face-to-face meeting about the event - but the issue truly was in the delivery. He was down right nasty.  Moving on to when we finally got seated...Our server Ryan, was AMAZING. He was SO friendly, full of jokes and always smiling. From the moment we got seated, the experience completely changed from an F to an A.  Carlos and Kevin were our chefs... again, amazing!! Friendly, accommodating, great at what they do... telling jokes the entire time and engaging their audience.    I am amazed that the three servers/chefs were able to turn this around and make it such an amazing experience. They took a completely ruined baby shower and turned it into the party it was supposed to be.   The manager needs more training."}
{"text":"Tony was so entertaining and very generous. If you're ever in for a nice dinner treat, please make a reservation to have him as your cook. So much fun! Also Ryan our server was very kind and always attentive. It was my first experience at this chain and it was so exciting!"}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to our dinner at Benihana as neither of us had been to any of the ones in Vegas. What a colossal letdown!  I had Steak and Chicken which was bland. It was as if seasoning is a foreign concept. They were actually so bland that they were barely palatable. I ended up not eating most of it. Sooooooo disappointing at $40  My fianc√© had the seared ahi tuna which okay. Also no seasoning. Again, disappointing for the $40 price tag.  Now, on to the rest as this was a 6 course meal:   Soup was DISGUSTING! I took one bite and pushed it away. It was like watered down beef broth with some green onion in it. Yuck!  Salad was a bowl of iceberg lettuce and some odd tasting ginger dressing. Really??  Plain white rice.  Veggies were good, but how do you mess up saut√©ed zucchini?   Dessert was a scoop of ice cream.   Decor and surroundings were lovely. The koi pond throughout a portion of the restaurant was very nice.  All in all this was a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! We felt as though the soup, salad, dressing, veggies, rice and ice cream came from the .99cent store.   The meats are clearly good quality but we both wished we had opted for teriyaki style so we could have had flavor. We expected MUCH MORE in the flavor department. Who eats meats without seasoning? They did provide a mustard sauce but ewwww. That is not an appetizing thought: mustard on your steak and chicken.  No thanks.  We are truly VERY DISAPPOINTED. It was a birthday dinner which made it sting more"}
{"text":"This is purely a Lunch Time review; i have never been here for dinner but am told the price difference is insane. For lunch, pop in and sit at the bar. get the Bowl w/Brown Rice ($9 w/Tax & Tip) or the Steak/Chicken Combo ($13 w/tax & tip). comes with a salad and some water to drink. service is great, food is awesome, and they always have ESPN on the tv. perfect."}
{"text":"I hate to post a sub par review-?but that's exactly what it is- sub par per the high price. Went tonight- beer glass was nasty- I mean filthy and spotted!! I asked for a new one and the bartender sent back the same glass dripping water- clearly rinsed but not even dried- and STILL dirty!!yuck! Had to chase down wAiter for refill. Waiter rushed us out, I was only half finished with my meal, didn't offer or ice cream or tea which were included in the meals we ordered. Check was $250+ for 2 adults, 2 kids. The only reason I gave 3 stars was bc the food was tasty, as usual. Benihana, step it up! For the price service should be way better and the dishes should be clean. What a disgrace! So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Of all the Benihanas I've been to this is the worst! The chicken fried rice had no flavor, the mustard sauce was thick and creamy...ewww. Even the shrimp tasted like shrimp, the best part is the garlic butter which was used but not tasted."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived around lunchtime. We didn't want to do the hibachi tables but , instead, order off the regular menu. We were directed to the bar area to dine .  It wasn't my first choice but when I found out they were doing Happy Hour I was happy to oblige! They HH menu is good from 12-6pm Mon - Sat and they also have a special lunch menu. The prices are reasonable . I ordered seaweed salad, a couple of rolls and a side of the hibachi vegetable rice. In true Cecille fashion, I ordered way too much food. But everything I did have was delicious! The rice alone I could eat but in a larger size!  Service was a little delayed as the bartender seemed to be spread way too thin so her manager had to step in to help. I would definitely eat here again.! It's a welcome change from the mall food court (it's located directly outside of mall next to the Sugar Factory)."}
{"text":"Chef TONY is amazing! We had a great time!! The service was fantastic. New favorite location"}
{"text":"My mom took me here today for lunch and we had an awful waitress. The whole experience though was just negative. First off, people were not waiting to be seated and were just taking tables, so we had to wait a bit longer. No big deal. A hostess then tells us which table to sit at and points us to it. My mom and I sit down and order two sushi rolls, two spicy chicken fried rice, and asked for two yum yum sauces. We should of been in and out within 20-30 mins but nope, we were there for over an hour. Our waitress brought us empty soy sauce, then didnt bring us yum yum sauce as we were eating one sushi roll so it ruined our experience since we wanted it for the sushi. Then after 15 minutes of asking for another soy sauce and yum yum sauce we finally get the soy sauce but only one yum yum when we needed two, but now where is our rice and other roll? The place wasn't even busy and we felt ignored. We get our rice, finally another sauce, eat it, but still waiting for the second sushi roll. This is now over 45 minutes of ordering. Our waitress also did not bring us plates or silverware and we had to ask someone else for it. As we were also waiting for the last roll to come she took one of our plates away for no reason. We need that to eat clearly so again we had to ask someone else. We talked to a manager who was great and super kind. He gave us 50% off our bill and we appreciated that a lot, but then our waitreas comes over and tries to argue with us about our order, and accused us of not waiting for a table when we did wait. She was trying to fight with us, so we told her we were done with her and went back to find a manager again. Her communication skills were awful and she does not know how to treat guests or work in a restaurant environment. I won't go back to this location because of her. The food tasted good but she is a horrible server and she is representing a brand. I do not want to eat somewhere with employees like her because she stressed me out. It should also not take as long as it did to get food."}
{"text":"Looks like we finally have an upgrade from the trusty old Benihana at the Westgate. Thank God!!! BUT, the service man. The service. Wish they were the same.  Got here at 8pm on a Tuesday night and couldn't be seated until 8:30. Fine...A few drinks later, we were at our table, but a chef didn't show up until an hour later! Sitting in front of an empty grill for that long while you hear everyone else's onion choo-choo trains and birthday tambourines around you in that fragrant environment is just torture.  Our chef Dominic got everything going in short order, but seemed a little nervous as the other big party at our table had a ton of obnoxious requests for extras and particulars. Poor guy. We did ask him to skip most of the tricks so we could eat, but he did make us some twerking booty cheeks with the huge mound of rice, which was quite possibly the awesomest thing I've ever seen at a Benihana. Way to keep things current. lol...Food was great.  All in all, I was on a first date, and thank goodness he was cute and chill, because the whole experience took all of 3 hours or more. No bueno when you're starving."}
{"text":"Nelson(the chef aka Ice Man) and Ryan (waiter aka Maverick) are the best combo for any Benihana location I have ever been.  Vegas has plenty of options for dining, but if you are in the mood for hibachi style cooking you should give this duo your reservation. Good food, great service and excellent entertainment!"}
{"text":"I had a great time with my wife and daughter and Benihana. Our server was very attentive and caring to everyone at the table. When my one year old baby reached on the table and spilled her water cup our server was there in literally 45 seconds with napkins to help us clean up. It's very rare you find such a high level of customer service from a waiter/waitress. I will definitely be coming back again to enjoy the delicious food and great experience.    Our sushi was very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Worst service to date at a Benihana.  Got an 18yo cook at the table.  Absolute disaster."}
{"text":"Where do I start? This is the worst experience I have ever came across with this company. It was terrible from the start and continued on to the finish.  First, I had a reservation for 7:45 and arrived with my girlfriend at approx 7:30. We were told it would be about 10 minutes (which is acceptable as we were early for our reservation), but ended up not being sat until 8:15. I had approached the host stand numerous times asking the progress for when it would be our turn. Every response was \"You are the next table! We are just setting it up\". Meanwhile, I would watch a couple more tables be sat... without me. The fact that I was forced to have a late dinner, along with being pulled along to stay was very rude and unnecessary.  Next, my server, Tania, was absolute garbage for many reasons. To start, I had to BEG for her to come around and fill my empty water glass that eventually had no ice due to her lack of urgency. As she was taking the order, she asked if I wanted the fried rice which was cooked by the chef or something else. I stated I wanted brown rice when everyone got their fried entree. Not only did I not receive my rice until 80% of the way through my entire meal (30 minutes after fried rice was served), but when I asked for soy sauce she did not supply me with some until several minutes later. In fact, she came by the table to clear plates in the meantime and I had to AGAIN remind her for my needs. It was actually humorous as to how bad her service was, considering it was a relatively slow night for the restaurant. Yes she was nice, but man was she inconsiderate at my needs as a customer.  Moving on, I get the check, which I also gave her my coupon for coming in on my birthday. She redid the total balance and gave me my revised check. The total was correct than and I, being a prior employee for 3 years in the restaurant industry, tipped her over 20% on the amount before any discounts applied knowing this is her form of income. I left and was happy to be out of there and finally have food in my stomach.  Now the nightmare begins. As my total (before tip) was roughly $33ish dollars, and after tip just under $50, I get an email from Chase, my banking provider, stating I was charged well over $130. By the time I got home and noticed the screw up the store was closed and I figured I would call in the morning to have it resolved.  In my hunt to get my bill adjusted properly, I had talked to some female manager on duty who was far from friendly. She told me that what I was charged was correct and that I am \"crazy\" for claiming I was charged over $130. She was beyond rude, arrogant, and overall left a terrible taste in my mouth to ever come back. I than had no other choice to call my bank who is now disputing my charge as Benihana could care less about the mistake that took part on their employees account. I am currently still getting it resolved, out of the additional funds they made a mistake on, and had no urge for reimbursement from them. All I want is to be charged the total I came in and dined in for but I guess in the world of Benihana, and the female manager in particular that is too much to ask.   I will never go back to this location as they are unkind, disrespectful, careless, and beyond rude.   On a final note, do not order shrimp from this location. My girlfriend and I were very uncomfortable with eating their dish as it was uncleaned shrimp and contained the black string of you know what in their contents. Very gross, but honestly after my experience with them yesterday and now today, I am not surprised.   Overall stay away from Chandler Benihana, you will do yourself a favor. Terrible store, ran by terrible \"leaders\"."}
{"text":"Never knew Amy are waitress, was from Mexico, other than that it was great, took a little longer than expected so grab a snack before arriving."}
{"text":"We tried to come here for my birthday, they no longer accept birthday coupons from your email. The manager is horrible and weirdly rude. The waitress said they changed this rule a month ago and the GM refused to accept the coupon. My whole family left as they were extremely rude and defensive. We have been going here for my birthday for YEARS. Will no longer be a tradition. I would recommend trying the Scottsdale location as they are a lot kinder."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times it was more than an amazing experience. The staff is so kind. We had the best Japanese food! It was so awesome to see all the food cooked right before your eyes! The chef also did some pretty awesome tricks. The lemonade is so amazing and is a must have. Everything on the menu looked divine! One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. So much fun!"}
{"text":"Paid $16 for a taxi to eat here and it was almost completely empty and the rude counter lady said they were booked. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I'll start with a fantastic waiter...wonderful hostesses and then our personal chef. Yes, Zachary aka Spider Man. My young adult daughters brought me out for Mothers Day...including my youngest grandson only 2.5 years old. A fantastic experience for all! Grandson who is picky ate EVERYONES fried rice and kept saying \"yummm\" during the processes. We totally loved our Chef Spider Man! Ask for him...really a fantastic chef. Salmon grilled to perfection, fried rice enjoyed by a picky # year old, I now like shrimp...so much that I was willing to give him a room in my house (I'm a local now after decades in So. Cal). Darn didn't get his number. All seriousness, yes it's pricey, but you can share, they are very attentive in who wants what.   Last time I took my now grown up kids to a Benihana was in Hawaii when they were kids. I can't speak for the whole place but as long as Zach (Spider Man) is your guy, you will have a good time, plus FANTASTIC food.   A very memorable experience for a Mother's Day gift from my daughters and grandson.   Photos and videos to follow....I think that folks at the other tables wished they had Spider Man too"}
{"text":"Great way to break the ice on a first date or any other occasion. The chiefs are entertaining and even more important, they cook well! Great for birthdays or just to grab a bite with loved ones. We did our Xmas party here~ and took up two tables with 2 chiefs. Excellent food, fun ambiance."}
{"text":"My family brought me here for my birthday dinner. There is a small creek that runs through the bar area with a few large fish. I love Japanese steakhouses that have those. Got seated in a corner table, so it offered a little bit of privacy. Looked at the menu. Was a bit pricey. Oh well, I wasn't paying. Lol. Got 'Rocky's Choice' which is the steak and chicken combo. It first comes with the soup. Good. Then comes the salad with the ginger dressing. Good. Then comes the table cook. Eh. Ok I guess. Some guys have personality. This guy had none. Did the onion volcano, but that was about it. No fancy tricks other guys do. For the meal, they give u two types of dipping sauce. The brown sauce is for seafood and veggies. The white sauce is for the chicken and the steak. It usually is a really good sauce at other steakhouses, but here it was just plain nasty. It had a chemically taste to it which after some thinking about it was a resemblance to hot Chinese mustard, but without the kick. Overall, was a good dinner. Deserves a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I enjoy Hibachi.  It's always a good time when you have a larger group.  I highly recommend reservations, because the location is relatively small and the wait can be outrageous.  Every meal comes with soup, salad, steamed rice, vegetables, and a shrimp appetizer.  I enjoy everything except the salad.  I don't know what the salad dressing is, but I do not care for it.  I also don't eat the shrimp appetizer (3 cooked shrimp per person), but that is because I don't like shrimp, not because it isn't tasty.  Chicken fried rice is available instead of the white rice, for a nominal up-charge.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  Also you can ask the chef to customize you food as he cooks it.  Some options are using garlic butter instead of plain butter for added flavor, having picante added for those who like spice, and having teriyaki added for those who enjoy teriyaki flavors.    Overall, it's an entertaining meal with tasty food!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Benihana and was super excited to come here... but alas, it was a disappointment.  The prices were pretty high and don't get me wrong, the entrance looked super grand with it's decorations and even floor to ceiling waterfall structure near the doorway.  I felt like I was in japan with it's pseudo geisha house feeling with the wooden bridges and koi ponds.  The food was just mediocre though.  The chef did the standard knife and food tricks and the food just was alright... disappointing since the prices were so high.  I had the filet mignon and chicken and I think I could have had the same at another teppanyaki place for a cheaper price.  You live and learn! Sadly, the other table across from us were very disgruntled and unhappy after their orders since their food took so long and the wrong orders were given :( yikes!!! It should have been a much better experience for the price and hype ... meh!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy a meal here every now and then, just a little pricey for me.  I guess you are paying for the entertainment.  Went with a large group, they added $16+ for the tip for me and did not give me my 25% discount.  At the end of the day the food is great."}
{"text":"We had great service and our chef was very entertaining. My salmon sashimi was very fresh. The portions were very small for the price compared to other hibachi places I have been which is the main reason for only 3 stars. Our steak, chicken and shrimp were cooked to perfection but the rice lacked flavor and the vegetable portion was very small. I also think that the fried rice should be part of the hibachi price and not an $8 upgrade from a bowl of steamed rice."}
{"text":"Yesterday my family & I (party of 9) visited Benihana for the very FIRST time! We were celebrating newlyweds and a birthday so it was EXTRA special. Let me just say we were enlightened! Daniel, our chef was super friendly and charismatic not to mention his presentation and preparation of the food was cherry on top! I'm so glad we decided to come to this location. We all left with full stomachs and smiles on our faces! Thank you Daniel!"}
{"text":"My family eats here about once a month, and the food is always delicious. I've been going to Benihana since I was a little girl, and it has never disappointed. At this location, the manager and wait staff are very nice. We typically request to sit in Lee's section -- he's extremely friendly and efficient. Even if we're seated elsewhere he'll stop by and say hi. I feel that personal touches like that make the experience even better. Also, the birthday club is very nice...they give you $30 off your meal!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food, however they are way overpriced. You can go to other tepinyaki restaurants for half of the price.  Also, I wasn't entirely happen that put drinks took forever to get refilled."}
{"text":"So disappointed this is the 3rd time I went here each time giving it another chance. I'm done now! The last time my shrimp weren't even cleaned. The dishes were dirty. This time again shrimp not clean forks sent back 3 times dirty and they brought my order without the rice. I was almost done before my rice came. Ugh no good. For the price it is be quality service. I even told the manager but he seemed disinterested and slow moving to fix the issue."}
{"text":"Having reservation mean nothing,  had reservations and still had to wait over 30 minutes. Poor management."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch twice once for dine in once for carry out.  Stay away if you are ordering carry out for lunch and are in a hurry as they are quite slow.  Also I found their meat and rice to be much drier than other Benihana locations I have been to.  I love Benihana, just not this location.  If you feel up to the drive I would suggest skipping this one and heading north to the Scottsdale location.  If not there are a few local Teppanyaki places in Chandler that are just as good and cheaper."}
{"text":"It's a fun time at Beni's if you have a large group (I wouldn't go here on a date, much better eats in Cleveland). If you want a good chain restaurant experience, this is the place. Watch \"The Office?\" Loved when Andy took the crew to Benihana (okay, so the crew goes to Hooters and Chili's too...) The chefs at each table at Benihana are very personable and ours had a great sense of humor. Fun place to get smashed on Saki and listen to your food sizzle."}
{"text":"Entertainment wise this restaurant gets 5 stars. I went with my husband and three sons and we really laughed a lot along with the couple that was seated with us. Our chef was Seth and he made for quite an entertaining and enjoyable show for us.  As for the wait, we made a reservation at 8pm, got there at 7:55 and still waited about 30 mins, so that was disappointing. What was the point in a reservation, to prevent an hr wait?? Plus it was Tuesday, not a huge outing night.   Now the food on the other hand is not as great as I was expecting. This was my first time at Benihana and with the huge reputation and high food cost; I was really expecting the food to be better. It lacked seasoning and was mostly bland so needless to say it fell below my expectation and I failed to understand what the hype is about. Could've just been me and my families singular experience but that's my opinion.  Great fun, average food."}
{"text":"This place has seen MUCH better days. Our lunch started off getting seated at 2:05 for our 1:30 reservation at the hibachi. MANY hibachis were not used because they \"didn't have enough chefs\"... The host is this slight weird little man with a grey ponytail who is very rude and does zero! You should have heard him on the phone with someone who callled to see if a hibachi was available... Another lost customer! The waitress was nice but confessed that she had \"only started a few months ago\", which is PLENTY of time to figure anything out... We didn't get our drinks, (2 iced teas and 1 water) for 25 minutes. Had to tell the \"chef\" to wait because he cam to cook our lunch before anyone at our hibachi (8 of us) got their soup or salads. We didn't start eating til about 3:15. The \"chef\" at the next hibachi dropped a little stainless steel empty bowl off of his cart into an area behind the cart where nobody could walk anyway. He stopped what he was doing and picked up off the flloor hands and then continued cooking... Very UN-sanitary! Our lunch \"tasted\" good. But, we had to keep explaining the simple order over and over. It was oil, butter and salt. The check was wrong... Too much (of course) and took 15 minutes to fix. The waitress was MIA for so long that I almost went to the bar myself to refill drinks. The manager/host/ponytail was asked by the mother of the 5 year old celebrating his birthday, for a booster seat when we had finally been shown our seats... She had to go up and ask him AGAIN after 20 minutes. When he finally showed up with a high-chair (not the requested booster\", he handed it (in the AIR!) to the Mom who had to lower it in place herself.. Real class act! He just stood there at the hostess station looking around. This place is a joke. Feels more like a poorly managed tourist trap that caters to people who don't care too much about the service they receive (or don't) and you generally feel that if you make a complaint to the manager, it would be a waste of energy. We've watched this place go down hill over the years and have been patrons forever... Not anymore! This place is a shadow of it's former self. The decor and hibachis are all that remain of a once great restaurant. Even the \"entertainment\" at the hibachi was gone... with the exception of our \"chef\" catching an egg on his spatula. They didn't have \"paper\" for their camera to take pictures of the little boy and my Aunts were were all celebrating birthdays. Everyone at our table was unhappy. The three in my party will NEVER return. There are other hibachi restaurants in Cleveland. We'll simply try them. Save your time and money. This place could be called \"Beni-Kaka\"."}
{"text":"This is a place just like any other hibachi style place I have been to.  The building is a bit nicer than what I've seen at others, but that's about all that's different.  I think this is a kind of place that is great to go to once for the show, or maybe if you're taking someone that's never been before, but after that, I don't see any reason to pay the price they expect for the food.  It's a great show, and the food I had the other day was pretty damn great, but I wouldn't pay that amount again.  The service at this one was ok.  It took forever from when we palced our order to get the chef out there to start cooking (Yes I know he probably has to get his mise en place ready once he receives the order from the waitress), but we were waiting for quite a while.  Also, at the end of our meal, it took an equally long time just to get the bill.  One nice thing they do is if it's someone's birthday, they take a picture and print it out for you right there...so that's a kinda nice touch."}
{"text":"I can say that everything that I had here was pretty damn good. I went for my birthday with my husband a couple of months ago.  We had the onion soup to start which tasted so familiar.....we both decided  that it tasted like the broth in BEEF TOP RAMEN....hahahahahah. Not necessarily a bad thing...  Then we had some fried rice, chicken, shrimp, and steak....all very yummy. No complaints and the cook we had was super cute !!! Always a plus.   We shared our table with another family that were very nice and social and they had a birthday girl in their party also. They gave us a hilarious pineapple boat for a birthday treat, sang a song, and took a picture.   We had a great time and the only reason that I gave 3 stars is because we spent a shitload of money in here and I was stilla bit hungry when I left."}
{"text":"The food was eatible. However, I pay extra to be entertained. Our chef Jacob was not entertaining. And the lunch portions sucked. I will have to stop by Smash Burger afterwards for some real food. To top it off, we had 6 people in our party that ordered at the table cooking. There was enough for 4. And so he had to slim down everyone's portions. And I got two table spoons of fried veggies."}
{"text":"I went here for one of my high school proms a few years ago and still remember getting hit in the face with vegetables. I'm betting the guy cooking the food was new because whenever I tell the story, people always seem surprised. The menu is tiny and pretty pricey. Honestly, I wouldn't be so upset if the menu actually gave a reasonable amount of options. The food was decent, just not what I wanted or what I expected. They could definitely do better."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. It was our anniversary dinner , I even noted that when doing the reservation online. Got there a few minuets early and had to wait and that's fine. Got seated in the back corner and that's fine. Usually either the server and or chef ask about special occasions. The chef asked a group of ladies and it was one of their birthday. When it came to us it was , where you from ? Start to answer him and he just rudely moves onto the next group. He was also kinda short with them , then going back to the girls. The overall show was meh , didn't care for the fact that food was flying from the grill onto the table. My wife got the Chateaubriand and said she wanted it rare. The guy almost over cooked it. My wife was not happy. Then at the end they ask again about special occasions , only made sure that the girls were celebrating a birthday and the server says well you get a free ice cream , my wife says it should say it's our anniversary. I'll make sure to get a ice cream also. A group of employees sang a \"celebration song\" , gave us our bills and collected them. All the years been going to the one near home , people celebrating an occasion, they always take a photo of you to commentate it. Did that happen ?? NOPE !!! That was the nail in the coffin for us going back again.  I guess my wife and I are spoiled with the level of service we get at the one near home. 2 stars for the food at least tasting good , what we ate of it. We never  take a to go container and my wife I did this time."}
{"text":"Dined here over the weekend and I was just not happy with any of the food at all.   I ordered the rockys choice and my niece ordered the spicy chicken(we will get to that in a moment)  The first round was salad, I have eaten at Benihana at least 100 times in my life and this night I had never tasted a worse salad. The dressing was a pale memory of what it has been in the past and the consistency was as thin as water, the lettuce also not having been drained properly added to a watery soupy mess that was really hard to get down.   I skipped soup all together as I'm not a fan.   Next up the cook arrives to the table, I made a request to have no garlic butter on any of my food and he basically fought me tooth and nail and didn't want to do as I requested.   The sauces were distributed and it was the most minimal amount he could have possibly been able to give without handing you an empty sauce dish.   The fried rice was on another level when it came to being made incorrectly. Because the chef was so obsessed with conserving ingredients he did not put the proper amount of soy sauce on the rice and it was basically white rice with undercooked vegetables and over cooked egg, the worst and most vile part was the undercooked chicken which was basically pink and raw. I did not even finish my rice.   My entree of chicken and steak was also terrible my steak was veiny and hard to chew and was an odd color before it ever hit the grill, the chicken was rubbery and tough and had no flavor.   My niece ordered spicy chicken and rather than mix the spicy sauce with teriyaki like they usually do he just globbed spicy sauce on the chicken and served it which basically rendered it too spicy and inedible.   At this point when the check arrived I was going to just pay and leave but the manager stopped over to check how everything went. I told him about the spicy chicken issue and how my niece was unable to even eat it and he took the check back and said \"I'll be right back let me take care of some of the bill\". He arrived back with the new check and deducted $12 from it, the spicy chicken entree alone is $27 so I'm not sure where the $12 discount was derived but wow thanks for nothing.   I paid the check of $77 and probably will never return to this location.   The cornerstone of Benihana is their sauces and salad dressing. When these aren't being made properly or corners are being cut in the process it is basically reducing the experience to a mall food court Japanese restaurant at triple the price."}
{"text":"Do not bother to eat at this place. 40 minutes waiting to be seated another 40 min waiting for the food. Then you will find out they send the wrong dishes."}
{"text":"I was really really looking forward to dining at Benihana for lunch with my business team.  We were a few minutes late and the hostess informed us that she thought we weren't coming. What a welcome!  All 10 of us squeezed around the teppan grill and waited for our waitress. She took our drink orders and disappeared for five minutes. One of us switched seats and the waitress was completely thrown off when she returned with our beverages. What a personal touch!   We waited. And waited. And waited. Had our drinks refilled, then FINALLY the chef showed up. He complained that one of my colleagues was in the way of his food cart. He was sarcastic and condescending during the entire preparation.  The \"theatrics\" of it all were sub-par.  My memories of a joyous dining experience here were squashed.   Don't be fooled--just because it's cooked in front of you doesn't qualify it as \"healthy\". EVERYTHING is cooked in oil, heaps of butter, soy sauce and salt. The chicken was tough, but the sauce was deliciously spicy.   The afternoon and evening after that lunch I felt nauseous, bloated and useless. My saliva feels thick because I'm so dehydrated from the sodium and fat.    Eating at Benihana reinforces my commitment to eating food I can feel good about--fare that Benihana does not cater to."}
{"text":"We love it here. I can't tell you how many times we've been here in the past 7 months. Amanda is THE best server and the chicken and rice with extra garlic butter is the best !"}
{"text":"Went to Benihana with friends and had a great time. We were entertained by the chef and the food was great. I debated on ordering the tuna but was glad I did because it was delicious and cooked perfectly. A fun place to go and have a good time."}
{"text":"Reservation was for 7:15 and the chef just showed up an hour and fifteen minutes later. Yes, we were notified of chefs running behind but as a customer being short staffed is not our issue.  I'm here because of my birthday and if it weren't for that I probably would be content and full of food by now from a more competent restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to Benihana all over the country , this is by far the worst , 3rd time here , and portion was so small , not enough for 1 person , made mistake to get food to go , pictures are attached , 43$ !!!!!!!! Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Last night I went to the Benihana in Chandler for my birthday. It was the worst experience I have ever had a Benihana and I felt as if I had to write in. It wasn't my first visit, I have been there many many many times. I have a group of friends and we all go when its our birthday. We fill up a table each time. Last year my sister had a baby and as such we've had to adjust the time we normally go. I made a reservation for 5:15pm so she could come and it wouldn't interrupt my 1 year old nephews routine (and he would be in good spirits because as much as I love him I know that kids are emotional sometimes). All 6 people in our party left work early so we would all be on time. My sister and brother in law were waiting in the bar when I got to the restaurant. They had been there since 5 and the bar was empty expect for two tables.  They hadn't even been greeted by the bar tender for the 10 minutes they had been there before me. I checked in with the hostess at 5:15pm and she said it would be a few minutes so I went to the bar to order drinks. After about 10 minutes of being ignored by the bartender, I finally caught her attention and she snapped at me \"I'm the only one here in the bar, I'll help you when I can!\".  Finally able to get a drink, we were starting to wonder how much longer for the table. At 5:35,  with the incredibly rude hostess, in an almost completely EMPTY restaurant, we finally walked back up and asked how much longer we would be waiting. The two girls had been mainly ignoring the guests and talking to each other and the lone male host. They weren't smiling, or friendly, or nice in any way shape or form. We were told ,rudely, that it would be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes after that, with my nephew getting antsy, I walked up and said that we need a table (in the now still half empty restaurant and full lobby). She said they would be sitting us 'right now'. I verified that it was in fact 'right now, right now, not right now in another 15 minutes.' And she said yes. My two sisters had walked outside to keep my nephew busy and I brought her back inside, and I pulled our other 3 people from the bar (who had been buying drinks and appetizers). We stood waiting in the lobby another 10 minutes. A full 50 minutes after we had checked in on time we were finally shown to our table. Where our waitress asked if this was our first visit. We told her that we were old pros but she still felt it necessary to go over the ENTIRE menu with us and ignored us trying to tell her that we even knew what we wanted to order. We wanted to get our order in so my sister could actually eat dinner before she had to leave since it had taken us SO long to be seated. The restaurant wasn't full at all and yet the waitresses service was still so slow and she ignored us so often that we ended up stacking our own used dishes up off to the side. She didn't even refill our drinks. My sister had to leave without even eating her meal. Her husband stayed behind to bring it home for her. We finally had to flag our waitress down for our checks and she forgot to use my coupon so we had to flag her down again. We gave her our cards and she forgot to run one of them so we had to flag her down again to run it.    I have a lot of sympathy for service (especially during the holiday season) but it was the attitude of the hostesses and the lack of involvement from the manager that really upsets me. The manager (who kept walking by the hostess desk) didn't bother to talk to the girls who weren't seating people in a restaurant that was empty! The reason we made such early reservations was so that my sister and my nephew could have dinner with us. I know that my group and I have decided to not go to Benihana's anymore after last night. Had it been only one person with a bad attitude, we would have absolutely been forgiving but this has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't be going back.  **Update in response to the company contacting me, I had actually emailed their customer service first. But didn't hear anything back. It appears that Yelp is monitored more often than the customer service email?"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and every time I come our hostess has been super nice and the chefs were great! I even joined the Chef's Table Club."}
{"text":"I went to a show at the LVH last night and I had a $10 discount coupon for Benihana on my show ticket.  It's been years since I ate here and I decided to give it a go.  You need to like dining with strangers and meeting new people or go somewhere else.  There were four people from Eastern Washington State and two from Texas at our table besides this local.  We ordered different things, but the chef kept everything going well. A woman comes and takes your drink orders first.  After being served the drinks, she brings everyone a bowl of Benihana onion soup.  Then you get a Benihana salad.  Then the chef enters the picture by arriving at the table with his cart of food.  He starts by cooking some shrimp and flipping the tails onto his chef's hat.  He does some other tricks with his knives including the standard teppanyaki onion volcano tower which he then sets on fire.  I ordered the Teriyaki steak, extra rare.  He cooked it perfectly.  He was just as good with everyone else around the table for their preferences.  With the teppanyaki meal, everyone gets a shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables,  dipping sauces, steamed rice and hot green tea.  There is also dessert.  I got the green tea ice cream.  I also paid the premium to have chicken fried rice.  I was surprised by how much food there was and everyone but me passed on dessert,  Silly people!  I hadn't eaten teppanyaki in a long time, so I found the evening entertaining and the food delicious.  Also, the people with whom I dined were pleasant and we had some good conversation and some good laughs.  It was a fun evening and I'm glad I came here.  I'll have to do it again in a shorter period of time."}
{"text":"We were seated and waited for 40 minutes. 15 of those were minutes were because they ran out of salad dressing.  It's dinner and there are 8 tables and 3 chefs.   1 star for the restaurant. 4 stars for the very good chef.    This was me giving Benihana another chance after the terrible totally comped meal a few months ago. Not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"We had made reservations an hour ahead but still had to wait 15 minutes or so when we got there. It's like what's the point of reservations then? The food was ok, the spicy rice was too spicy for me and our particular chef seemed like he wasn't really into it. We looked over at another chef and he was doing all these tricks but not ours. Ours seemed tired lol and didn't really do much. I recommend doing this one with a group vs a couple if you go so its more fun."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place is amazing. My first time here and now I'm a true fan. This is the place to bring any of your family members to have a great experience. The feeling is that I'm really full but not overly full.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Horrible, disrespectful customer service from front desk staff!!! Yelp lists this location as closing at 11 but they really close at 10. So the first night when we arrived at 10:30 and they refused to seat us I didn't understand. After speaking to the AM, Wing she explained the times listed on various sights are wrong and that they do close at 10. Ok cool.   The next day we come again. This time at 9. The front desk staff very disrespectfully tells us they're are booked for the evening and then proceed to talk to the people standing behind us like we weren't even still standing there!!!!! Rolling there eyes and treating us as if we did something wrong and giving MAJOR attitude!!!  So finally I asked to speak to Wing again. This time to complain about the rudeness of her front desk clerks. Wing seemed unsympathetic and when we turned to leave I saw her walk past them without saying a word. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my family's first time here at the Las Vegas Location & our experience here was amazing. Our server Kenny was unbelievably outstanding. The cook was nice and gave us a great show ! The food is tasty here. I recommend this to anyone looking for good time and delicious food ! Everyone that worked here was really nice !  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my family out for a nice meal. We where told it would be 45 minutes for a table, but it maybe faster. In the hour we sat and waited for a table we watched at least five tables open up of which only three where seated. The others remained open. No one said a word to us let alone noticed we where be passed over repeatedly for people with out small kids! If you want to go to dinner with your family and you have small kids, do not go here! Go to Chili's. They have better service!!!!"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews for this Benihana before taking my family there for a birthday celebration.  It certainly wasn't comparable to the one in Seattle!        No Japanese chef, no shrimp tossing.  There was a small onion volcano with a runaway flame to thrill (scare) the kids, and a failed egg juggling, but that's about it.  The hood over the grill has seen better days and we all got enveloped with smoke at some point during the meal.  The meal did not move along at a nice pace.  The appetizer (ordered sushi, but served sashimi) arrived after the soup and salad, and my daughter's brown rice was served just as we were finishing up. Tasty food, but the poor presentation and atmosphere makes it not worth the high price..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour on a Thursday evening after receiving a tip it's a nice undiscovered spot.  The prices where exceptional. They boasted an okay selection in martinis ($5) and bottled beers (Bud Light $3, Kirin Light $4) and offered other cocktails and well drinks.   The food was excellent and the price was ridiculously low. We enjoyed beef dumplings (~$3.50), rainbow rolls ($5.25) and another appetizer that was so uninspiring I already forgot what it was.   Our server, who was also the bartender, was getting worked by the non-stop mass of people waiting for tables, and making drinks. She had another bartender to help but he seemed to focused on grumbling and giving the bar a really negative vibe.   Overall, we all have bad days, so being my first visit to Benihana, I'll take it as that. The good prices and pretty good food will have me returning soon enough."}
{"text":"My fiance and i went with a group to celebrate some birthdays. Seated at 6 pm and left at 8:15 so it is not a quick experience. The food was good but for me.... The teppanyaki experience is old, played out and A bit dated but i played along. Our chef was experienced and delivered some tastey food. Grape mixed drink....8.95 yowza!!  Tasted like grape gatorade. SHIZUKA was our server and she was an abolute delight.  Give that woman a raise.....she is great. They even took our photo at the table and printed copies for us. Electronic copies are available online.  Very cool idea.  It may be time for Benihana to reinvent the teppanyaki experince. Its quite expensive and a bit dated.  Still tastey though."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place especially if you do the Teppan. Request Allen if you can he is hilarious and can pretty much guarantee a great time. It is pricey at first glance but once you are done you actually get quite a bit of food for the money."}
{"text":"I visited this location with friends & family for a birthday celebration. The experience was less than what I expected. We were a party of 10 & did not receive what we came for. No sake, small servings, and missing items. Would not recommend this place for dinner or ANYTHING!"}
{"text":"Maybe if I was 12.  But probably not then either.  Not sure if it's just the Vegas location, or a reflection on the whole organization (I can't imagine it gets much better though).  The showmanship sucked.  The food was bleh.  The cost was ugh."}
{"text":"This review is for management, and the most disrespectful manager I've ever encountered, Shareese. Called made reservations for 4 people at 9pm. Got there at 9:12pm, gentleman said we weren't in the system so he added us and asked us to wait. 9:30 asked manager how long it would be and she responded  \"You got here 15 minutes late and we take it people out of the system if they're 15 +mins late\" Continued to argue with me that I wasn't in the system. OK. She rose her voice, \"If I say you're not in the system, you're not in the system. ARGUING WITH ME WONT GET YOU SEATED ANY FASTER SO YOU CAN WAIT RIGHT HERE\" Are you kidding me? As manager you take your customer's word and certainly don't give attitude.  I've gone to many Benihanas, food and service on point, this location is such a disappointment. My group and I will never come back."}
{"text":"I havent been to Benihana's in a while, I never really had a complaint about it. It was satifying. This place though was awesome. The food was very tasty, the drinks were incredibly full of liquor, not stingy at all. We ordered sushi before our dinner and the tuna was super fresh.   By far the best Benihana's we have been too. A definite place to go next time you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, and it was great! The food and service were both awesome.   One of my personal favorite things about this place is they take Gluten Free very seriously. The chef cleaned the entire cook top and got new utensils before cooking my food. Really appreciated how serious they took my allergy.   Definitely would recommend this spot and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our cook Daniel was the best. Very funny and outgoing. Service was really good. The mixed drinks suck here. Nothing special but costly. Stick to the beer. The food was decent. Very small portions. I got the oceans treasure. Not alot of food. I have gone to several other exact type food locations near where I live and food was way better and way bigger portions. For Vegas and the cost and the competition. Up the portions."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my boyfriend to a teppanyaki restaurant since he had never been to one before. This being the closest to us we decided to go here Sunday for our anniversary. It was ok.   The chef we had wasn't very entertaining, he didn't do the egg trick, and his onion volcano was lacking any resemblance to a volcano. Maybe I was just expecting too much. Having been to a couple teppanyaki places before and loved the whole experience.  The food was good but I'd definitely recommend another place for the future."}
{"text":"well I was entertained with the chopping flipping and the tossing. its pricey but it was worth it. for 2. people I spent about 200.00 but I had a lot of food so an the food was tasty. just don't take pics with the chick you'll. spend more :p"}
{"text":"Extremely rude front staff.  Sat people ahead of us even though we had reservations and waited . The manager acted as if he did not care he lost a party of 7"}
{"text":"This Benihana is by far the worst restaurant the chain has. They had poor customer service and leave the customers waiting to eat. I watched a family sit there watching us eat for well over an hour before the chef came out to start cooking for them. And it turns out the only reason the chef came out was because the customer got tired of waiting and went and complained that he's been waiting for over an hour to eat. Our experience wasn't much better. The chef seemed to be drunk or high he kept sending food flying at us left and right then spilled this little girls drink all over her plate of food. He even openly in front of us said butter makes you horny. For all of you who have been to Benihana it know they use a lot of butter in there cooking. Well the problem with this is that there was a little girl sitting there !! How awkward is that. Never again will I return to this location."}
{"text":"Ask for chef KEVIN!!! My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with dinner reservations to Benihana's. I was highly impressed with the entertainment and our chef delivered an over-the-top performance, along with delicious entrees cooked to perfection. The flaming onion volcano was impressive! Our chefs speed and accuracy was on-point. His jokes kept us all intrigued and we will definitely be needing to go back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Benihana and will also be my last. They did not have availability at the teppan tables so we opted to sit down in the dining area. The food was bland and over cooked. The vegetables were mainly onions . No bueno."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with my experience at Benihana when I wrote my original review, but I have gone back a couple times since and each and every time my experience has improved.   My husband and I typically go to Benihana about once a year, in September, when I get my $30 birthday coupon (good only Monday-Thursday). You can sign up to receive your own birthday coupon here:  http://profile.benihana.com/registration/  I find their prices to be on the high end for the quality of the food received, but with this discount it makes the final check far more reasonable.   On our last visit, our waitress was a bit difficult to understand but our chef was fantastic. His banter was witty and did not come across as scripted. I ordered the Land & Sea (filet and scallops) which my husband went with the spicy hibachi chicken.   Our chef was open to special requests (extra garlic butter on everything for one of the ladies seated at our table, extra lemon on the scallops for me) and cooked my filet to a perfect medium rare. He also ensured his was adding enough 'heat' to my husband's chicken, and asked him if he wanted more sauce after his meat was cooked.   After our entree, we were offered hot tea and a green tea ice cream sundae was brought out to me, complete with whipped cream, a cherry, a piece of pocky and a candle.   Benihana isn't the best teppanyaki place I have been to, but it's a decent choice and I am sure I will be back, but probably not until next September."}
{"text":"Last time we were there the table was so greasy and sticky, not only table but seats and plates too. We like to eat sushi there sometimes, but I wish the restaurant would be clean."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Horrible!  Tonight I went to Benihana for the first time for my friend's birthday. We had a reservation for 8:00PM for 20 people. My friends and I arrived at 7:52PM and we let them know we were ready to be seated...since one person who was with our group was not there we had to wait to be seated...ok that's fine. So at about 8:20 the last person arrives and we ask to be seated. The hostess told us that we could not be seated since our reservation had to be given up. I asked why and she said cause our entire party wasn't here by 8:15. I couldn't believe that they didn't tell us about this rule!  We were given free appetizers and some free rolls for the incontinence (which makes me think they double booked our table). At 9:25 we were FINALLY seated!  I asked a hostess if she could bring me some soy sauce since I had ordered rolls at the bar and she said sure. 15 minutes later I still had not gotten my soy sauce so I got up and looked for it myself. I have been a hostess before and MANY MANY times I have accommodated guests by getting them little things that they need even if I was not their server. I finished my rolls and shortly after I was sick. Seriously horrible customer service, horrible food and I will NOT be returning and I highly suggest that no one else visit this Benihana!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and had a good experience. The service was good and the meals were delicious as well.  I ordered a basic California roll and a shrimp tempura roll which were both delicious. It was also nice that the eel sauce was free; usually at other places it isn't. Or server was entertaining, the scallops were scrumptious, and the steak was good too.  The edamame could use some seasoning, it was very bland."}
{"text":"I went to Benihana's for my boyfriend's birthday and although I had been there before it was like a new experience for me. When we go there, we had to wait although we had made reservations. The wait wasn't too bad, we only waited about 10-15 mins. To my surprise we were seated with other people . (The time I had gone we had a large party) I was kind of uncomfortable with this arrangement. Had I known prior maybe it wouldn't have been a big deal but I that part I didn't care for as well as I heard the other party saying how they had to wait for more people to arrive in order to get seated. (The reason for the 4)   Other than that the Chef was really nice and very entertaining. He did some nice tricks for us and he was very attentive.  He food was great and cooked perfectly and I liked the fact that who ever didn't want mushrooms or onions, the extras were passed around instead of being thrown out. I had a good experience at Benihana but I'm not sure if I would want to visit that often because of the lack of  privacy."}
{"text":"Just came to this location for my second time ever and another great experience I'm so happy I ran into the manager from San Diego open though what a super nice guy talking about the company and you guys are lucky to have Tobin  Alex our server was great.   And the chef was awesome.  The white guy with the beard"}
{"text":"I loved so many things about this restaurant but I have to give a 2 star rating because of some serious service issues. Quite simply, the employees rushed us to eat. It was TERRIBLE how badly they rushed us.   I had JUST gotten MY food (I had well done steak so I got my food last) and employees KEPT coming by asking if I \"needed a box.\" I was asked more than three times if I needed a box. It was obnoxious. Then one guy just brought a takeout box out and left it in front of me. I felt like crying. It made me so upset because I had literally gotten my food less than 2 minutes before. My food was still steaming hot and I had taken about 3 bites of food. I am not exaggerating!  Then, they came out with a birthday sundae for my husband WHEN WE BOTH STILL HAD MORE THAN HALF OUR FOOD ON OUR PLATES. His ice cream just sat on the table melting with no offer to replace it when we did finish eating nor any apologies. I was even MORE upset by that. His ice cream sundae turned into nothing but a bowl of melted \"soup\". We are NOT super slow eaters but since we were the last ones served at our table, we got screwed. It was unfair.   The trick is to order seafood only because they cook and serve that first so you can start eating while they cook the other stuff for everybody else. They at least give you the check when you are done so the other two parties sitting with us were able to leave, and we were the last ones at the table. Call me crazy, but when I'm dropping $100 on a dinner for two, I expect to savor my meal and not be rushed out the door.   The service made me NEVER want to go back there again.    The food was good though! We had chicken, shrimp and steak. We ordered a side of scallops (they were delicious) to share. The dinner came with a tiny bit of shrimp as an appetizer, some onion broth soup, a little salad, vegetables (onions and zucchini), a cup of hot green tea, and a scoop of ice cream. Well, forget the ice cream, we were served it so early that it was melted. The portion sizes are on the small side so if you are a big eater, I'd recommend ordering a few sides or an additional appetizer. The \"show\" was fun as well. It's so cool to watch your meal prepared right in front of your eyes. Your experience will differ based on your tablemates but we luckily had a fun and chatty table. Not a place to go if you are shy (or a slow eater).   My husband and I frequently entertain clients for work and based on this disastrous service, we will be crossing Benihana off both of our business and personal dining lists. It's a shame because it could've been such a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!! Service was slow as fuck and wait u have to wait about a half hr just for rice!!"}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED! So sad...we went as a family to celebrate my husbands birthday. We had reservations for 5:15. We were sat at our table at 5:30...waited for 20 minutes for just water and our server to take our order. Then waited 45 minutes for the chef to come to our table. It was ridiculous! We were all starving at the point and soooo annoyed! Our server \"forgot\" our rice in the beginning and we had to constantly ask for water. Then we had to ask him twice for a to go box...flaky! Over priced and NEVER going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Benihana's another chance as a post birthday celebration for my girlfriend with our best friends. Our server was a nice gal but she spilled our sake and broke a glass on the grill before our food was served. Once again I have to give thanks to the Chef for the great entertainment and amazing food. The gentleman cooked our steaks to perfection and was very accommodating to one of our guests food allergy. We were again rushed to close our check which was very annoying and disrespectful as a consumer. Again the whole process of waiting and getting our food took forever, estimated about 2 hours. What's disappointing is that not only did this happen in our hometown San Diego but again in Las Vegas. The company really needs to adjust their opening hours, if they can't provide excellent and outstanding service for a 930pm reservation then don't provide that time for the customers. I hope this review and the previous review I've written is taken into consideration for future guest."}
{"text":"Well, we love this Resturaunt, but tonight at this location we were stuck in a corner with our child with no room at the table, it was hot alot of smoke to. The GM was awesome with my 1 year old, but just a let down with how we were located. Just wanted to leave. Chef & staff were awesome, food awesome to."}
{"text":"The food was very yummy and our chef was amazing! He was very personable and made us laugh through the whole experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff!   It was my first time in Vegas and I'm sure it was much better than I thought because of this place.   Daniel was our chef and I can't wait to come back to see and eat his food again. So funny and amazing cook!"}
{"text":"Love the location on this place and the food was amazing. Our cook was Cody and he was very funny and entertaining. I can't complain about this place although we were seated and never got menus but everyone else in the group did... weird lol but the wait here is totally worth it. The ocean treasure is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Went to Benihana with a friend for her birthday. It was a Tuesday evening and the place was rather slow. Wait staff were moving rather quickly through the restaurant, but service was slow. The food was good; however, green tea was supposed to come with dinner and it never did. I finally said something to the waitress and she brought hot green tea after dinner was completely done. We also had to ask about the ice cream at the end of dinner as it was supposed to be included and it didn't arrive either until we said something. So, hot tea and ice cream were then finally delivered at the end and only after we asked. The check; however, was delivered prior to the desert and the hot tea. I expected more from Benihana especially with the price that was charged. Overall, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This is place is no longer what it used to be. We went LATE on a Tuesday night and they said that they couldn't seat us for 30 minutes unless we wanted to sit at the bar even though it looked as though plenty of tables were open. We sat at the bar and looked at a menu as we just wanted to order sushi anyway. Both the drinks and the sushi were astronomical in price. Also, they didn't have much of a sushi menu at all. It was really disappointing. We actually just left and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Do you like being entertained by a knife-wielding Asian chef cooking at your table while you eat?  If this may sound interesting, grab a group of friends and check this place out.  Just don't expect the food to be stellar, and if you order sushi be prepared for less than average.  Benihana is a chain that specializes in a culinary circus type environment over anything else."}
{"text":"I got the Emperors Feast & it was yummy! The steak was way better than the chicken, though. I also ordered a rainbow roll which wasn't that great at all, but my cocktail was good! The onion soup was very good as well. A good birthday lunch! Thank you"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant that Ive heard such positive things about. Perhaps its just this location that has issues.  It took a good 45 minutes after being seated for the cook to begin our dinner meal. After bringing Sprite and trying to convince us it was the Lemonade I ordered, our server forgot to bring silverware after I requested twice. He also forgot my rice, and the cook cut up everyone else's meat except mine. The reason why I gave it more then 1 star was because the food quality was decent. I had the Benihana Special which was a combo of Lobster and Steak.  Finally on my way out after waiting 2 minutes for the elevator, which had stopped working sometime over dinner, I had to take the steps."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night for my birthday.  I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air.  So we decided to try Benihana's.    Unfortunately, I think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and didn't tell a single joke.  His \"performance\" was boring, I think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat!  The food was very pricey, but the shrimp was tasty.  You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold.  They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats.  They need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls.  They also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out.  This just wasn't the experience I was hoping for."}
{"text":"The experience was nice. We eat at many different Japanese Grills so being Benihana we were excited for the original experience. The chef was nice and very active in getting diners to chat and enjoy themselves. Wait staff was constantly refilling drinks. Three stars for their attentiveness. Now, minus two stars for the (once again) price gouging. Being charged for a Japanese Grill staple (yum yum sauce) just seems silly and desperate. Grill areas or the one we were in could use an upgrade. Steak and shrimp was good but chicken taste like it came out of a microwave but I know it wasn't because it was cooked in front of us. Bland and flavorless, quickly had to spit it out. We'll be sticking to our local JG place were you don't get charged for silly things like sauces. I'll admit it the little elevator ride was kind of cool."}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful. We were staying at the west gate and received a voucher for buy one get one enter. This was a great incentive. Although we are not a fan of Benihana we opted to go. Our server was a beautiful Asian lady that was very efficient. After I have my order, I informed her of the voucher. She took the voucher and later came back with the voucher cut out and informed me that they would give only 15% off! I said that wasn't what the voucher stated and she formula told me that was what I was getting!  I didn't want to make a scene but I felt that this establishment misappropriated the voucher to get the business! The meal was good bit long. The smell and the taste of the over powerful garlic butter was very lasting.  Plan to spend a lot of money remember it is Vegas and enjoy."}
{"text":"No biggie and the price is very expensive for what you get. Customer service is on point. Our chef was Tommy he was nice but not what you expect from the old Benihana's of the past. Remember the old commercials? I'm from cali they had commercials back in the day. The food was okay, nothing to really praise about.  My fried rice beats theirs by far. The meat was tender.  You'd get a better meal from cheesecake factory at about 1/2 the price not including dessert.  For the same price you could go to Texas de Brazil and get more flavor. We won't be coming back. Again the meat was good the seafood was bland."}
{"text":"Finally a new location!! I know it's been a year already, I'm just late to the party. Came with a big party to celebrate mine and my mother's 4 year kidney transplant anniversary :) Beautiful interior and amazing service. They even kept the cake we brought cold in their back fridge! The menu looks to have expanded with plenty of new appetizer options and added sushi rolls. Much smaller than the location at the west gate, but the modern touch and more convenient location makes up for it. There is valet parking very close for the restaurants outside the Fashion Show and you can even text them when you're done with dinner and they'll have your car ready! There's no fancy koi pond or waterfall like the old Benihana's, but it was still a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The absolute WORST place EVER!!!! I had gnat in my onion soup and when I told the one of the servers she didn't apologize, replace it or anything however still paid for everything. I didn't complain or argue being that we had a party of 13 plus 2 separate hibachi grill tables. We (my girlfriend, my cousin and myself) sat separate from everyone else along with racist people that kept giving us dirty looks at the table which we ignored. That wasn't the icing on the cake. I missed work because I woke up with food poisoning along with others in my party.  Had to ask my Captain from base to bring me some crackers, pepto, ginger ale, and soup to nurse me back to health.  I will never go back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"We made reservations to this location, their service was the worse then what I would have paid for. I ordered a drink for two, then the waitress came back saying that we need to move... so they told us to sit any where... then she came back with a larger group and told us to move... so I left... there was no courtesy just straight attitude... I will never go back... so now I'm at the one in chandler... let's see how this service is going to be..."}
{"text":"Our chef was from a mystical place called Guadalajara Tokyo. He was fun and performed the usually tricks including the Cho cho onion, the beating heart fried rice and of course, the flying shrimp!  A nice diversion to our routine.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a great evening at Benihana! My friend and I were attending a conference at the Westgate and chose to dine at Benihana one evening. The decor of this restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and inviting! As the conference was for photographers, we even heard several photographers comment, \"What a great place this would be for a photo shoot!\" The ambiance is exceptional!   We chose to enjoy the teppanyaki for dinner. We were seated at one of the upstairs teppan tables. As the hostess brought the other patrons to join us, There were two gals who had never experienced teppanyaki before. My friend and I convinced them that it's fun and that they would enjoy the whole experience.  There were a total of 8 people at the table. The waitress expertly took all of our orders and promptly brought the soup, followed by the salad. Before too long, our charming chef arrived and reviewed everybody's orders with them personally, assuring of their order and how they wished to have their items prepared.  The friendly banter among all of us seated at the table grew as we all became comfortable with the others. It was quite enjoyable and there was fun laughter and chatter as our chef prepared our meals.   Our chef was a genuine showman, as is to be expected at Benihana's and he did not disappoint. Not only were his \"moves\" expert, he also had just enough comedic character to enlist laughter from his diners.  The waitress continued to be expertly attentive, not leaving any single patron wanting for anything.  The food was better than good, everybody cleaned their plate without complaint and several exclamations of delight came from those at the table.  As the dinner time wound down, we all learned that one of our table-mates was celebrating his birthday. The waitress immediately jumped up to the plate, brought him ice cream with a candle and we all sang him a hearty Happy Birthday song!   After the checks had been distributed and paid, our waitress had a little time available to stand and chat with us. We all remained at the table and talked with her, learning that she was soon to be married! As she was approaching her senior years in life, we all were exceptionally happy that she had found this new joy in her life and all wished her the very best.  All in all it was an exceptional evening of enjoyment and sharing among people who's paths happened to cross unexpectedly and with hosts/hostesses that facilitated a perfect celebratory dinner.  Thank you, Benihana's!"}
{"text":"I went to Benihanas for a work Christmas party. We were promptly seated at the hibachi and greeted by our chef. The chef was very pleasant and professional, but our waitress was mediocre at best. For example, the chef had to ask other employees to have the waitress come to our table for refills and other things we needed. The cleanliness of the restaurant was questionable! The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the restaurant opened. There were also food all over the floor. All in all an ok experience."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh weeeee!! This place is ALWAYS amazing! From great food to fine entertainment, you can not go wrong eating here. Sit back, relax and enjoy the show here. If you don't enjoy what you eat here, you need to get your tongue checked, your taste buds must have disappeared! I had lobster and filet on the hibachi... oh and the fried rice as well (dont get reg. white rice, entertain your mouf with the fried rice!), it was DAMN good!!! Ok, I gotta go, I'm drooling now!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Benihana, they lose 1 star and this time. I think I had enough and it went beyond the point even if I can get a free meal, I won't go back to this Benihana.  This time we went to celebrate my husband's birthday and we had the $30 certificate.  The quality of the sushi fish became worse. It's very watery, tasteless and not fresh but I won't complain much about it as there are many other sushi restaurants that serve the same quality of sushi in Phoenix. I think it's mainly because it's hard to get good fresh sushi grade fish in Phoenix although there are some Japanese restaurants that serve good fresh sushi.  The thing is their service. We waited about 15mins before the waitress took our order although we decided what we wanted to eat very quickly. She just didn't come back for that long.  Then she made a mistake in our order. My husband said \"Sushi and Sashimi combo\". She repeated the order as \"Sushi combo (without sashimi)\". So my husband corrected \"No, not Sushi combo, I would like to have Sushi and Sashimi combo\" and pointed out the item in the menu. She said \"okay\".   But.....yes, she brought the small \"Sushi combo\" instead of \"Sushi and Sashimi combo\". I told her it's not what my husband ordered. And surprisingly, she said \" I thought you ordered Sushi combo\"....and seemed she just wanted him to eat that. Hmmmm she \"thought\"..... So I told her my husband already corrected her mistake once by pointing out it in the menu. Then she said \"There must be some misunderstanding but I can change it.\" I thought \" Hmmmm....misunderstanding?\" I think it's a obvious mistake, though.  I didn't say anymore as my husband got what he ordered in the end and it was his birthday. In the end, she said \"Sorry for the misunderstanding\" and I think that is the best we could get from her.  After we finished our entrees, we again had to wait for about 30mins for the waitress to come by.  There's one thing we enjoyed which is the performance of the chef at our table.  So I give them 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Food was not well prepared but OK. The show of the person preparing the food was very good. I give low review because the service was very very slow. We waited and waited until finally somebody came to prepare the food. The worst is that there is no ventilation and your clothes and you will need to take a shower and wash the clothes before you go anywhere"}
{"text":"Went with the family of 4, we had a great time, food is a bit bland, so ask for the spice. I did not think I would like the Miso soup but was pleasantly surprised. We had a birthday girl , they did make it very special for her. I had the chicken and would have hoped it would not been so dry , but was a little disappointed. Overall a good family experience, A little pricey but worth the experience if you have not done it before."}
{"text":"Absolutely worse Manager ever, her name is MELINDA  She cut me off so many times and tried arguing with me, like if she was in a hurry. Then how do they let their managers dress like that it looks like she just got out of bed. Very rude and disrespectful she is the worse."}
{"text":"Don't bother making a reservation, you won't be seated or served anytime near your reservation time. We USED to be regulars here for many family events and even some holidays but we won't be going back anytime soon.   Dinners run late and service is slow. Expect at least 2 hour-plus dinner time."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our wedding after hearing our favorite chef moved hibachi locations. We sat at one of the tables where they cook right in front of you.  It may seem rather expensive, but for everything you get and for the freshness of having everything prepared right in front of you, I say it's a rather good deal. The portions are nice and generous and the atmosphere is festive.   Thurston is AMAZING. We love how he seasons everything and we love his humor and personality. He did an amazing job at making sure our night was a memorable one.   The one drawback to the location is that it isn't very well built for noise, and there's nothing on the walls to absorb some of the sound. It's not necessarily a ruckus, but it's just difficult to hear much farther than the person next to you from all the cooking and conversation. It's just this hum of commotion. We didn't necessarily mind it though.   Good food seasoned and cooked perfectly. Wonderful dessert. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants like it in town. For locals, the drive is a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. We tried Ohjah on Rainbow not too long ago. It was okay, but the food was a bit bland and the chef wasn't very personable.    I highly recommend Benihana to anyone that's curious! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. I went for my birthday last week. Place was clean. Our Chef was hysterical, and the food was outstanding. It is always consistent. We got a picture that was able to be downloaded too from their website. I always love going to this place. The amount of food you get for the price has value as well."}
{"text":"It was totally awesome the food was amazing. The staff was equally as amazing. We had never been there before and will definitely be going again in the future. We didn't even mind that you sit at a table with different people, it was nice to meet new people and they sat us at the table so we had our own little sections. overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Yes there is a long wait if you don't make reservations.... but if your Spending $$ per plate with proper dress attire I wouldn't expect to walk in like other places and be instantly seated. The show itself can be 20-40 min. And the show and fresh food is what makes it a special place. We went to a birthday and it was so perfect. I say all stars with proper expectations of knowing it's a reservation type place and there is a bar area you can drink and wait at !!!"}
{"text":"Normally we love this place.  This trip...not so much.  The service was suspect and they stuck us in the back all alone.  Seems to be they were trying to get us out as fast as possible.  Food was the same but service was lacking.  The service is what makes the experience in a place like this.  Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Here is very good and the service is really nice we had a great experience took my husband there and he's never been to one he loved it the rice is so good best time to go is lunchtime it's a lot cheaper but their dinner is good too get the combination that one's good and you got to have rice chicken fried rice is awesome"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was years ago. We celebrated a birthday by having a chef cook us dinner at the grill and I remember it being fun. We still have our picture somewhere.  Anyways, this time I joined a friend who had a certificate and we dined at a table near the kitchen/bar. We both ordered from their dinner entree section; I got the Japanese yakisoba noodles and she ordered the teriyaki chicken. It started with a bowl of onion soup which was fine, nothing special. The salad was okay but had too much dressing on it. My dish was pretty bland, it needed some spice and heat to it and it had neither. The shrimp pieces were lacking and there were far too many onions with my noodles.   We ordered chocolate ice cream to cap off the meal and it was standard. Prices were a bit high but fair considering how much food there was. I wouldn't rush to come back here, I think people enjoy the show more than the food."}
{"text":"I like this Benihana. We go here for birthdays pretty much (they have a great birthday \"chefs club\" thing) and we always enjoy ourselves. Every time we go it seems like everyone is there for the same reason...birthdays, which makes it kind of fun. I love the teppenyaki tables and the entertainment. The chicken fried rice is amazing as are the shrimp and filet mignon. In fact, I've liked pretty much everything I've had...but definitely choose the filet over the hibachi steak. I like how they take your picture and give it to you right away because it makes for some fun memories. The green tea ice cream isn't very good...so next time I'll just stick with vanilla or chocolate. Overall, a great place!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly (Gladis, especially). The food-show had my family smiling the entire time. Perfect for celebrating family member's birthdays."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Benihanas in Las Vegas the food was poor and the chef was horrible.  I hope this is not the trend at the Westgate.  The service itself was good but for 50.00 a meal, I expect much better.  BH, get your s together in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I honestly have to redo my review on this business. My wife and I use to come here every year for our Anniversary, but on our 6th year of coming here, we noticed they stopped the free photo for special occasions, so to us it was no biggie, but the we also noticed the service went down hill.          When we arrived on October, 27th, 2016, we sat with a group who all agreed that during the meal the chef was polite, but the waitress failed in every area possible. She only came to fill up drinks once not twice or rechecking everyone's drinks, but once. She picked up a few empty first course meal plates and bowls once, the rest were left in one side of the table. Sitting with people whom we did not know, all looked at other tables just to see if they too had issues and sure enough they too were wanting refills and plates removed from the table to make more room          Now when stating more room, I mean imagine 8 to 9 people at a table, but your kind of squished together and you literally only have, so much room to move empty plates and cups. Before leaving I spoke with the manager telling her that the service was poor, but the meal was great and all she said was sorry no refunds lol. I never asked for a refund, never asked for a discount, and never once did I raise my voice or yell I just simply explained how our night went with this place and it use to be great.         Every waitress is different, but overall I I experienced way better service and respect from a manager in other high end restaurants than this place. We decided to bring our business elsewhere. Specially after being polite and trying to explain how the service could of been better. I even observed others from our table and other tables in the room trying to get the attention of the waitress and or a manager and despite all they just want your money.          Many may not agree or agree with my opinion and that's fine, but I am being straight up and honest about what took place with our service and noting how the manager can careless about service and expectations. I get that each table has 8 to 9 people or more sitting and needs service as well, but when someone is paying over 160 for two people for the last 6 years at the same place and now you out of nowhere drop the respect and services, yeah elsewhere is where we will go."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness what a great time! We love this Resturant . We were so lucky to have Ryan in the house with his amazing personality . Isaac was our chef the two of them made our dinner so wonderful . Absolutely love this place . We need more people like Ryan in this world . Try this place for your birthday . If you register online you get a $30 coupon towards your birthday dinner. The food is great here."}
{"text":"It was my second time in Benihana at Westgate. One of our favorite menu for family night out is Teppanyaki. We usually go to Ohjah since it is near our house, and Geisha steakhouse as well. We had a late mother's day dinner here last Sunday, and left with no excitement at all.   Our server, Roger, was wonderful with a great smile and customer service. There was nothing that disappointed us from his point. However, when you come to a Teppanyaki restaurant at a hotel-even though we know its just Westgate- or even Benihana-which they call themselves the Originals- you expect more than local hibachi grills. Our chef, Paul, definitely had no sense of humor during the entire dinner. Unlike the server words where he said, enjoy your dinner and show, there was no showmanship at all for our hibachi. It seemed like none of the hibachi chefs around us were doing such a thing called show except for one. Honestly speaking, show is the main reason people go to Teppanyaki instead of just paying the same price for a steak.  In sense of quality, the meat was definitely better than other restaurants. We got the Hibachi Supreme, which comes with fresh lobster and chateaubriand, land and sea-filet and scallops, prime NY, and just chateaubriand. The chateaus were fabulous, they were tender, lean and they almost melted in your mouth. NY was great as well, the filet was a little tougher compared to the other ones but still great. We asked the chef to put less salt in our part of the meat, but he did not take that into consideration and put same amount of salt for all table's meats, which was a bit too salty for us.  The one thing that this place sucks, is that they charge 8 dollars extra for you to get fried rice. That kind of takes aways the whole fun of hibachi.   It was a good experience for us to compare different restaurants, but I hardly doubt I would bring anyone back here. You can get such a better show for hibachi at better prices, and get better steak at a nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! We go often and it's always Perfect! The sushi is the Best! We always go for all birthdays, our anniversary, and just because, and it's always a fun night with exceptional food!"}
{"text":"This was my problem at Benihana's. I went for a birthday coupon celebration with my husband. We we're seated at the grill with five other people who were great. The cook burnt Grill not once but, twice. The cook conversation wasn't fit for the table, LOL they spoke about cooking Dogs and all of that it entailed. The fried rice was dry and scorched, it wasn't as good as I usually get at Benihanas. The staff was extremely nice"}
{"text":"Must make reservations! The food is awesome! The atmosphere is amazing. The chefs are entertaining. This is definitely my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Benihana location I have been to simply for the decor. They are all dressed in kimonos and the place has fountains and fish in a pond its truely beautiful. I love coming here with my girlfriend for a date night or to celebrate a birthday. I wish all benihana locations were like this! The prices are a bit higher than other Benihana restaurant but the service id far better! It is in the Westgate hotel so there is lots of parking available."}
{"text":"Food was great, very well cooked and seasoned, and I liked my chicken n shrimp fried very well done and it was definitely that I was all the way pleased.  Our cook was a white guy(no shade, or racism) he was extraordinary said he was from Raleigh, North Carolina and I'm a retired Army Vet who did majority of his time at Fort Bragg, NC, but the real point is that young man was INSANE ON THE GRILL, food was flawless n really gave my palette what it was expecting, I had dined with Benihana for years in Chicago my hometown, but Hands Down he is an asset to the culinary Industry. He was really knowledgeable of his craft which I learned thru convo and knowledgeable of world events! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This was a very clean place staff was very helpful. Great location, the view was awesome. You have three choices: Inside, patio or hibachi bar. Jose the the bar tender is the truth. Ask for him."}
{"text":"While I love the chain, this is by far the worst Benihana's in the world. I have eaten here 4 times and it just gets worse every time. The rise was under cooked and dry, my tuna was supposed to be medium and the chef tried to give me super rare because he didn't read the ticket. Overall the food is bland and the restaurant lacks the atmosphere I have grown to love at other Benihana restaurants. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This review is mainly about service.   We've been to this Benihana's quite a few times since they've opened about a year ago or so. We went the other day, and there was only about 3 tables in the main dining room. When we got to the hostess podium, we told  the hostess that we had a reservation for 12:30pm on Tuesday, 1/9/18. We arrived at 12:35pm, and the hostess seemed like she didn't know what to do. She had to ask her co-worker on how to work the GuestBridge system. Maybe she was still new. When she escorted us to the table, she was going to seat us to a table with no settings. I asked her, \"Are you sure this table?\" And she she said \"yes.\" I said, \"There are no settings though.\" Hostess seemed hesitant and then there was a server who was standing nearby, and motioned her to direct us over to the table WITH settings.   We got seated and she gave us the menus and returned back to the hostess podium. Our server name was Sally (or so it says on our check). She seemed friendly but I think needs more training. I came to lunch with my parents and we all ordered 3 hot teas. When she came back, she handed my hot tea with her hands on top of the rim (where your mouth would touch). There IS a handle that's attached to the cup. I don't understand why she didn't use the handle, but to put her hands on top of the cup. Then when our salads came, she handed to us in a woobley motion and said \"Here you go.\" She didn't use a tray (which she should have) but it looked so sloppy. She held all three salads in both hands. Awkward.   Our food came out pretty good. No complaints about the Teppan-Yaki Chef. He just needs to smile.   Sally came over to the table and she asked if it was going to be on one check. We barely got our food and she asked us if it's going to be on one check. Umm ok? Sally did come a couple of times to check if we needed any more hot water, etc.   I understand that it was such a slow day! Only 3 tables total. A party of 3  ladies (behind us) was already done and there was a single lady who was nearly done as well.  There was a couple who came in about 20-25 minutes after us, and sat across from us. I understand it was super slow. Sally was just chilling in the back by the sushi bar guys. The manager doesn't seem to care too much either. He was having some cheddar fries or hot fries (in guests view) and just chilling.  Shouldn't the manager not eat on the floor, anyway? It just looked so unprofessional.   There was a vendor person working on something that needed all the employees's attention. Which I guess is fine.   When we finally were ready to pay, we needed change. The bill was $51, and we gave Sally $100. Sally then says \"I need to find $9 for you.\" She gave us back $40 only. She was supposed to give us $49. Who does that--give you half change back? My dad didn't wanna wait any longer, so he just said to keep the $9. She probably didn't think we were going to tip her good. Oh well that's probably the best tip she was going to get all day anyhow.   I don't usually come here as often as much as I used to. I think the staff needs new training on how to serve drinks and utilize the trays. Managers should definitely send people home if it's super dead. It's called Labor control. Or have the staff fold napkins or do something that doesn't require personal conversations. It just doesn't look professional. Guess they just don't give a shit. Hostess needs to be trained or retrained on table numbers and the GuestBridge system.  I wanted to say something to the manager, but I don't think he would care. He was too busy eating his cheddar fries."}
{"text":"We went here for a good bye party for a friend, and I loved the food and entertainment! The waiter was very polite, and thoroughly explained to us everything, since it was our first time there. The chef was hilarious and he cooked the food very well! The lobster, steak, and shrimp were amazing! I honestly can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Daniel was absolutely fantastic! He was entertaining, friendly, and a phenomenal chef. Everything was delicious. The filet mignon was tender, juicy and flavorful. The chicken fried rice was cooked to perfection. Our best Benihana experience anywhere!"}
{"text":"Great food & a fun experience. The staff was humorous & paid special attention to anyone with a birthday, the manager even sang our choice of Disney songs! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you haven't experienced it, definitely recommend it!!  Loved the food and the service.  The prices are a bit high, but used a birthday voucher for $30 to supplement.  (You can only sign up at the restaurant).  Go early to avoid a  long wait.  Be sure to get the fried rice, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Great location / Great Ambience / Great food. Its a restaurant to go in a group and enjoy a personalized service. The otherlocation in vegas is quite busy and more reviewed but this isnt terrible. This was my second time eating at the same location and enjoyed it. The cocktails are good too. The portion size for one person in lunch entree size is pretty good. Highly recommend to upgrade your rice to veg fried rice/ chicken fried rice. The salad that comes with it was okay."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here on new years day to have lunch along with another couple.  We called to make a reservation but were informed that they are booked up and we would have to wait to get seating.    When we first got to the restaurant we found the wait was only 15 minutes long which was great.   We got seated pretty quickly and were informed that a server would come to help us.  While seating we felt that the location wasn't really that busy  as there were 3 teppenyaki tables on our side that were empty. After waiting about 20 minutes at the table a server finally came to take our drink orders, we ordered two different lemonades.   Later he ordered our food items: colossal shrimp dinner menu with fried rice, Las Vegas roll, spicy hibachi chicken.   After ordering you wait for a cook to come to the table, that was an additional 15 minute wait.  When the cook comes to the table he confirmed our orders and began cooking up everything in a grand presentation.    So, my personal opinion is that they take a long time to get you seated drinks and food served.  I was starving so I may not have been that happy considering I had to wait not for the table but for everything else, however I give them a PASS since they stated that it would be a wait.  The food did not taste that great, and the side sauces they give to dip things had NO flavor.  The Las Vegas roll that we received I thought had no flavor either.  Maybe my taste buds were off but I definitely didn't think there was enough spice in anything that I ordered, and my food was supposed to be spicy!   On a positive note - my kids would have loved this place.  They really take the time to create a performance while cooking and I am positive that my kids would enjoy :)   Maybe next time I will request a LOT of heat on my stuff and then it will be different."}
{"text":"Daniel was our cook. Amazingly entertaining. He made our visit here fun. Will defiantly ask for him the next time we come back."}
{"text":"Overall it was a nice experience. I was disappointed because they charge a lot in the first place and it doesn't even include the noodles..that's an extra charge..also you can't just substitute the white rice for a fried rice for a few dollar charge like the other Benihana's I have been to. It's like an additional $8. So just ordering your spending like $45 a meal not $30 if you want the noodles which it should automatically come with for the price of the meal. And then a crazy amount for the fried rice which is the obviously the best. I have been to other Benihana's that included everything plus ice cream for way cheaper and tasted way better. The fried rice wasn't the greatest. The teriyaki chicken was very bland as well. I felt like I spent a lot and the quality wasn't the greatest. Will not return here."}
{"text":"I recently dined at Benihana for my birthday celebration. I always loved going to Benihana because it is typically an entertaining meal. So in my mind instead of going to a quiet dinner for my birthday this year that I would change things up and hit up this joint.   Welllllll let's just say nothing went right that evening... Our cook hardly muttered a hi to anyone at the table, basically cooked the meal and that was it. I got the Ocean Treasure that evening and lets just say I was sick all evening last night.   Not exactly the way I wanted to spend my birthday :("}
{"text":"The food at the restaurant was good.  I was very disappointed that they allowed a dog to sit at the table.  Management had the dog removed from the chair but had to ask them to get the dog off the napkin.   The owner of the dog told them that the dog was not a service animal.  The manager Victor didn't ask them to take the dog outside. When going out for a meal at a reputable company such as Benihana to have a dog sit at the table is poor management.  I have provided a picture of the dog so people can see what it looked like at the restaurant.  Animals should be kept at home if they want to have the pet at the table.   Restaurant staff was not helpful. The waitress said about 5 excuses when I was there.  My request was to not have the dog at my table.  The waitress made the matter worse.  The food was amazing but everything else failed to meet expectations."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a disaster and it's clear that it's a management issue. We arrived later in the evening and everything was messy...the floors, the bathrooms, even the hibachi and table still had bits food on it from the previous service. Host staff were pretty much indifferent and were jokingly throwing things at each other while we stood there and waited. Our chef was really nice and warned us he was new, but he hadn't been trained well and messed up orders/overcooked or under seasoned everything...that's not on him, that's on management. The food was ok but the whole experience was not worth the price paid. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the concept of Benihana and really love the decorations in this one specifically (set up to seem as if you are outside).  The food is just so-so sadly.  I gave this one another try after eating there a year ago and Z got sick.  Just not impressed.  Positives: Fun show. Great ambience.  Negatives: We had a reservation for eleven and they put us into one of the smaller tables (bringing in extra seats).  We actually couldn't get in and out of seats without the people next to us moving.   Charging extra for dishes not being cooked on the grill. To expensive for the quality of the food (tasted frozen).  Benihana recognizes that their quality has slid and are putting an effort into improving but it just isn't worth the cost at this time (they actually had articles about it at the hostess desk funny enough)."}
{"text":"I've visited numerous Benihana locations in Southern California and I figured while on vacation we go to Arizona and celebrate my boyfriends birthday. The hostess was very rude and had a horrible attitude! She was not friendly at all! Our waiter was very nice and chef. I would come here for that but when I walked in I did not feel welcomed at all! I love Benihana's but maybe this location does not deserve a return visit!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and both times the service has been great. I highly suggest making sure you get reservations though. Totally kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"Rude, boring, terrible service, took one hour to wait for chef, no water refills, never bussed dirty dishes, food plain and over cooked. Paid for lobster and it was tough. What a waste of time. Bartender rude too. Read your reviews Chandler Benihana! I really don't think they give a shat!!! Benny Hana would roll over in his grave if he knew is!"}
{"text":"Fried rice and their steak is great. But you will need to wait some time to get your food."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Hilton so this was an easy choice. This is not your normal Benihana, the lobby entrance was very nice made to look like it if you were in japan. The cost is higher than your normal Benihana."}
{"text":"The experience was entertaining and classy, but the food quality was lacking.  The food was very generic and bland.  Nothing excellent.  It was not worthy of the hefty price amount"}
{"text":"What can I say?!? This is Benihana, and I came here not just for the food but also for the interactive experience. It's a bit pricey, but the food at least was decent enough and the chef was very entertaining - totally worth it!!! Will be back..."}
{"text":"Happily surprised to have eaten a flavoursome meal here.  We stayed at the hotel and had this the first night.  I definitely recommend here for a tasty meal. Prices are ok but staff can improve.  Lady at front had a bit of attitude. They change when they see you spending though dont they?"}
{"text":"Our large party celebrated a birthday dinner here in mid August. We were surprised to learn they had only been opened for a few days because the service was spot on and the food was delicious. From the moment we entered until the moment we left, the staff made us feel welcomed. Our 4 year old grand daughter was eating with us and because of the size of our party, we had two chefs on the Teppanaki table. Both chefs had a great personality and really \" played\" to our grandaughter with many of the traditional clever cooking tricks and some new ones we hadn't seen before. This was a fun night for our whole family."}
{"text":"I was seated one hour ago and a chef has not arrived to cook for us yet. The front desk staff has an interesting strategy of telling people the wait is 4 times longer than it actually is so they can go home early. There are tables of dissatisfied people staring at empty drinks , they've probably had refilled 5 times, as they sit famished and bored waiting for their food. I really wish there were more Teppanyaki choices in N. Scottsdale. I'll remember this visit and how I'm fighting back the exhaustion of being in this establishment for 1.5 hrs and am starving to death."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our first experience at the LVH Benihana. The cook was fun and friendly, but be prepared for a big bill if you're not sharing your meal and ordering drinks."}
{"text":"My Mom and I ate here this evening and it was wonderful. Our server Kenny was amazing and was on everyone's special requests, including other tables and he never missed a beat. Our cook for the evening was Michael and he was very entertaining and remembered to not use seasoning on our seafood, steamed the lobster tails to perfection and was very attentive to everyone at our table. I can't wait to go back. The sushi was very good, and also had specifications which they had no problem fallowing."}
{"text":"This was a fun experience for my group of nine. The chef was very talented and entertaining, and the food was amazing. We had sushi as well as food cooked in front of us. We left very full and entertained."}
{"text":"Located in the Westgate (Or at least that's what it's called this week) Hotel Casino, on Paradise, right next to the Las Vegas Convention Center. Dinner and Show, right at your table. My suggestion is to bring enough people to get your own table. If not you will be sat with strangers, and with Las Vegas tourists, that can be hit or miss. The only downside is that it is a little on expensive side, for what it is. But still every once in a while, it can't hurt. Don't forget to show your local NV ID for a discount. Also sign up for their email club and get a gift certificate on your birthday. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my birthday and It was not good at all.  The food was mediocre and the server, Michael I think, was one of the worse servers I have ever experienced.  He did not listen to our requests.  One  person order Las Vegas Sushi and after 15 minutes and the cook starting to cook are lunch it still had not been delivered.  When asked the server blamed it on the kitchen being busy and that the sushi had to be deep fried.  Huh.  She declined it and then the waiter didn't take it off the bill.    I had the Chicken Teriyaki.  I can make better at home.  Chicken was so dry and the veggies were bland.   We asked our server why he asked if we were celebrating anything.  We told him a birthday and graduation.  At them end of our meal we asked him why he asked and he said the manager had him all tied up with 5 tables and he was going to get our treat soon.  We had paid our bill and were ready to leave at this time.  We also looked around the restaurant and tried to find the 5 tables he was serving.  Unless they were in the parking lot we couldn't find them  I will never be going back to this place.  The manager gave each of us a $20 gift certificate for the bad service.  Not using it."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated quickly and two other couples were sat at our table.  We went to celebrate a birthday.  The chef was entertaining.  The food was cooked well and had good flavor when you use the sauces.  I liked the red sauce but if you like mustard, you'd like the yellow sauce.  There was one point where  the waitress got busy and a few drinks sat empty for a minute but I was impressed that the manager was walking around throughout the time and caught the dry drinks.  There's almost nothing worse than DDS (dry drink syndrome)!  We definately had a nice time but for the price, I would only go there if I had a discount--especially in this economy where my dollar needs to go a lot farther."}
{"text":"we live in Henderson but a trip every 2 or 3 months is always a special treat....Well worth the money especially if you have out of towners visiting"}
{"text":"2.75 stars. I recently found out that Benihana gives out $30 coupons for your birthday. So my friend and I, both with March b-days, decided to give it a go.  I've not had teppanyaki/hibachi grilled meals in a long time, so I was looking forward to it. Located in the LVH, Benihana is in this little Asian-themed restaurant area. Decor is lovely and fitting.  We had 7:30 reservations but were about 5 minutes late. We were seated just in time, as the rest of the people around the hibachi had just ordered. Unfortunately, the photographer had already made her rounds at the table and skipped us! Boo.  I got Rocky's Choice (steak & chicken) and my friend had the Imperial Steak. The meal came with soup, salad, shrimp and some veggies (onions, zucchini). When ordering your meal, the waitress will ask if you want fried rice -- my opinion is NO. Don't get it. Not worth the upgrade price for a little bowl. In fact, I just made my own fried rice by tossing the veggies and shrimp together with the steamed rice that comes with the meal. Ok, so it's not really fried. But the rice was getting cold (it came out right after the salad).  As for the showmanship of the hibachi chef, he was meh. The onion volcano was nice. Maybe it was just an off day for him. He wasn't very engaging, in my opinion.  Overall, I wouldn't go here again unless I had a coupon. So next year?"}
{"text":"I have long wanted to eat Teppanyaki style food and been thinking of going to Benihana for a longest time. But after reading reviews on Yelp for the one in Sunnyvale, CA, I was quite apprehensive.  I had also heard good things about Benihana in Pittsburgh from my brother in law and so decided to go there whenever I goto Pittsburgh.  So, finally, we went there after New Years and had a blast. We had to wait at the bar even after making reservation, but thats OK. At the table we were not rushed at all. The food was tasty and the chef was funny and interesting. Not to mention very entertaining and friendly bartender  - MARTY.  Overall, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had."}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday night to celebrate my wife's birthday with her. I have to say, everything was timed perfectly and the food was delicious. Getting food hibachi style will require you to obviously sit with another party or two, but that is very normal and each party has their own side conversations anyway, every now and again you might speak to each other, but regardless, you will have a good time.  The chefs are very professional, our server was very good at getting everything out the way we hoped, and they treat us very well as their guests. Not sure how long of a wait is normal for this place, but we got right in at 7pm on a Monday night. I would recommend calling before hand to see if they have call-ahead seating or even reservations. We were a bit nervous that we would have to wait a while.  5 star rating for me!"}
{"text":"This place is SO lame! I have been to Benihana in San Francisco and our chef put on a helluva show..so I was excited to find one in Scottsdale. Sadly, this experience was NOTHING like my previous visit. Our waiter never said please or thank you and obviously had something other than work on his mind as he slammed down bowls of soup and salad. Our chef \"Kevin\" came out and was suffering from a lack of enthusiasm and a VERY dirty chefs coat. He didn't put on a show, had no sense of humor and when he did it was forced and not funny.  The \"big\" shrimp were overcooked and the steak was flavorless. The one positive was that the chicken fried rice was delicious! But, overall I was totally underwhelmed and disappointed.  Wasn't worth it. You come for the show, the food is second and both sucked."}
{"text":"Let's call Benihana for what it is: Expensive entertainment. We took our family to celebrate a birthday (which it appears everyone does this as we heard the birthday song screamed about the restaurant through the entire evening) and were seated with another couple (they do their best to fill all seats around the grill). Our 6-year old daughter LOVED the \"performance\" - the onion volcano of fire being her favorite part. And she tried everything, which was really cool to see! Our server was a little bit impatient or short with us, not saying more than a few words- but she was attentive and always made sure our water glasses were kept full along with our alcohol orders.   It's fun watching the \"show\" as your food is cooked in front of you. Our chef had a good personality and chatted through the evening, making small talk and cracking jokes while he prepared our orders. The table ordered shrimp, filet, and chicken with fried rice (you gotta get the fried rice) so we all had plenty to eat. I believe most meals are served in five courses. You'll start off with a Japanese onion soup, move to a ginger dressed salad, then on to fried rice, the main course (protein with grilled vegetables) and finally served a scoop of ice cream. It's a lot of food but your given plenty of time to enjoy it. Between the ordering, setup, show, and eating prepare for a 2+ hour experience. But again, it's fun and the entertainment is what you are paying for. The food is obviously fresh since it's cooked right in front of you, but you are limited to your options outside of the protein.  Our party of five, with drinks, ran about $300 with tip so it's not a cheap meal. Benihana is one of those \"every 5 years on a special occasion\" kind of places. See you in another five years!"}
{"text":"The worst Benihana restaurant service ever been to many, but this Benihana wow.waited for a long time for our waitress named thia just to take our order. Then she disappeared waited another 20 minutes for ice cream and never brought our  green tea. I had to asked the manager Dj on duty if he can find our waitress thia .The manager Dj tried to give us some free appetites coupons we explained to him we didn't want anything free but some good service. After the manager Dj finally located  our waitress Thia finally came out of hiding just to collect the bill and stated to me that I was a really funny guy, but didn't have time for my shit and pointed to your watch, which displayed a piece of shit on her watch. Manager Dj was informed of this incident and all he replied was I'm sorry to hear that. After spending much money on dinner the least they can provide is good service. The only good thing of the dinner was our chief Arron great guy very funny. Please take my advice to anyone going to this Benihana stay away."}
{"text":"Always a good time to celebrate a birthday, entertaining chefs. Hard to leave some for leftovers"}
{"text":"_STILL_ DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. WON'T GO BACK. EVER. Gimmicky play-with-your-food-is-OK teppan-style dining's novelty keeps packing people in. Not me.  I went back after 18 months, and thankfully saved myself a tidy fiddy. I left shortly after arriving.  ##maguro is that pink plank that you get from House of Rice (Is that place still out there?) CRAP!   Yet they still fill the place. Somehow. On arrival, as usual, there are 15 people waiting to be seated. Not surprisingly there is NO ONE sitting at the sushi bar. We sit right down. But what I see is nauseating.  ##One or two pieces of cut fish on each large white plastic plate.  It looks like a morgue-slash-biology-project gone wrong. They're already wearing rubber gloves. All that's missing are the surgical masks!  OK, so what are all these people doing here then? It's for Teppanyaki-style dining. It's the novelty of your food being steel-grill cooked in front of you, The cook will even play with your food like you used to when you were 4 years old and if you take your mom with you, you can thumb your nose at her while you play along.  Ooh, look at me pile the rice up like a heart and then stick my spatula under it to make it beat! Don't miss the Sliced onion volcano and steamy railroad train, complete with sound and lighting effects!  Yeah, fried rice's egg must be added at the last moment. It's so the egg will be light and flavorful, not charred hard after 8 minutes of food play!  @Hiro: let me know where you end up next.  @benihana: DOUBLE-X. YOUARETHEWEAKESTLINK GOOD BYE."}
{"text":"My fiancee' took me here for dinner on my birthday last Saturday night. I was pretty excited because I had not been to a Benihana in over 20 years. We had reservations for 7:00 pm and arrived on time. They were not ready to seat us and left us to stand in the front, so we told them we were going to the bar for a drink. Not only did we get seated late after everyone else was already at the table enjoying drinks and conversation, but we had saved our appetites for this occasion and were starving. We finally got our little bowl of soup and then the small salad, but our chef did not arrive for a long time. He was very Caucasian with blonde hair (not Japanese/Oriental), little personality and either very new or having a bad night, because he did not do the knife tricks like the others and was totally inefficient on the grill. He cut each individual item one-at-a-time into bite-size pieces, which was actually painful to watch. This may be restaurant policy, but he cooked the vegetables first and I did not want to eat them alone, so they were cold long before we got our protein. We were half-way into the meal when I had to request the rice that comes with all entrees and no one had gotten--although Mike ordered fried rice and he got that early on. I had steak and lobster and the food was good, but not better than other places [and I missed the butter with my lobster :-)]. There was no particular flavor except salt and pepper. The whole reason to go to Benihana and sit around a teppanyaki table is for an experienced Chef to entertain with their tricks and jokes during dinner. We felt very let down. Our meal took two hours, and the table next to us was on their salad course when we arrived, yet they were done and gone about an hour before us. Someone obviously knew it was a bad experience because after the tabs were delivered, a man came around and collected them, returning them back with a 20% discount. I will say our male server was very pleasant and attentive with drinks, but all-in-all a disappointing birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I'm with J C. on this. The chef was pretty entertaining, but not enough to equate the price I just paid. I also ordered my teriyaki steak mid-rare and received it mid-well. Husband's steak was drenched in butter and salt. One of the other patrons at our table asked for his steak without mushrooms. The chef was about to pour the mushrooms onto his plate until the dude reminded him that he didn't want them. The chef quickly redirected the pile mushrooms onto another dude's plate, which already had his fair share of veggies. What steak lover really wants extra vegetables? He didn't look pleased as he shoved them over so he could continue cutting his steak.  I don't know if I looked especially pale that day to where the waiter thought I was so parched, but he was constantly bringing me drink refills. After finishing my first glass of coke, I asked for green tea, yet he brought me another coke. When he realized his mistake, he brought out my green tea and, about ten minutes later, another coke so I had two cokes and a green tea. He doubled me on my cokes at least one more time during the meal, not to mention leaving my empty green tea cup each time. I started pushing the new cokes to the girl next to me so I didn't look like I had a drinking problem. It was a nice conversation starter. Unfortunately, she drinks diet, so she wasn't very appreciative. We ended up asking the waiter why he kept bringing them and he said \"It looked like it was getting watered down with the ice melting.\" Oh. Interesting. I guess it's better than him never bringing me refills? But not by much.  By the end of the night, I should have had their birthday song memorized. Literally every single teppanyaki table had someone with a birthday at it. Apparently this is the place to go for birthdays? Personally, I'll be skipping Benihana for mine."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Waitress kept telling us not to touch the cooking surface repeated, even after we told her we had visited the restaurant many times before. She couldn't understand or communicate effectively in English. When we requested items, she was frugal, like refilling our soft drinks half full. She was forgetful, we had to remind her about items we had requested. She also gave herself a tip by keeping the change from the bill."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. My boyfriend and his family are regulars. He took me on a 1 yr. Anniversary date here and it was great until our server decided to choose me as his victim.  I'm a soft spoken person until someone is rude or mean to me for no reason  He was rude,  forgot my rice, never refilled my drink,  and kept starring at the hostesses.   But the cook was so amazing and nice.  It was great watching him cook all the food and we got served lovely shrimp,  zucchini,  and other veggies before the main coarse.  Delicious and definitely worth this experience."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends last weekend and we had a good time.  Mostly that was due to the company and the fact that we are a fun bunch!  I'm giving this 3 stars because the food was decent and even though expensive, I feel it was worth the money (we reserved a teppanyaki table).  To break it down: Soup course was really good.  Salad was not so good.  Didn't even finish it.  Shrimp appetizer was literally 4 bites of chopped up shrimp.  Kind of strange.  Fried Rice was probably the best thing of the night.  And they give you a fairly large portion.  The only thing I didn't love was they serve it separately from the actual entree and I prefer to eat it all together.  For the main course I had the filet which was very good, served with some onions and zucchini and mushrooms.  All in all, an enjoyable experience but I won't be returning anytime soon.   I say this because I am a foodie.  And if I am going to plop out $30 for a meal I'd prefer it to be for something a little more intriguing than stir fry.  And I can make a mean filet mignon myself.  But I'm glad we went and tried it out."}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is I wish there were more veggies! Otherwise, it's a lot of fun. Nice date spot. Request Y-Not if you want to really get the experience."}
{"text":"We went here for our 39th wedding anniversary dinner, a nostalgia visit since we celebrated our first anniversary dinner in 1978 in the Benihana in Washington D.C. We had a relatively inexperienced chef cooking for us, and even though the food turned out O.K., for the price it was disappointing. She managed to drop a lobster on the floor before cooking it, so had to ask someone to bring her another one. You really pay for the show here, and even though our chef was smiling and cheerful, she didn't quite have the knife work and \"flash\" down pat to perform as well as a few of the other chefs at surrounding tables. They recognized our special occasion, and tried really hard, but unless you have never been to this type of restaurant before, save some money and have either a good Japanese, Chinese or Thai meal elsewhere, where it is all about the food, and not dependent on the skills, experience, or temperament of your chef to make your experience special (or not)."}
{"text":"I have been to my share of Benihana's and this location was by far the WORST! I went with my family of 6 .The location and the interior was beautiful and convenient but that is where is goes downhill. The food itself is very poor here . The fried rice which is one of my favorite things about eating at a Benihanas was disgusting and of course paying quite a bit on top of everything plus paying for a plate sharing made me have a very dissatisfied dinner ! It made me never want to go to a Benihanas again!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible; food was cold. Benihana's is one of my favorite restaurants, but this location leaves lots to be desired. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the sharpest Benihana's I've ever been to. It's big, it's clean, and the staff is very friendly. The food was very good and the place was clean. I would've given them 5 stars but their fountain drinks were so flat had to send them back 4 times before we said that's ok we will drink water."}
{"text":"First time being here was such a great experience. We had a server and her name was Jasmine &I the cook's name is Tony! Highly recommend getting tony as your cook because he is hilarious and will make the night memorable.   My steak was cooked medium rare and it was fantastic! Our appetizers though were not really worth the price. The sushi roll was simple with just rice and seaweed around it. But that was $6 and we got 6 tiny pieces of shrimp for $9. That was really not worth it. But our meal was worth every bit! Jasmine made sure our waters were always filled. It was her fourth day so she didn't know much about sushi or the appetizers. But she was still nice & welcoming. Highly recommend the fried rice! The show he puts on is super cool! The rice is also tasty."}
{"text":"Benihana is fun to go to for group events. My tastes have changed over the years, and plenty of restaurants are better, but this is one of my mum's all-time favorites, so we went for her birthday.  Most of the staff are helpful but indifferent. (Is it cultural?) I love that they've turned teppanyaki into a fun show, but our cook wasn't really into it. No worries because the food is still good.  You start with some soup (that used to contain more mushrooms and onions). The broth is still good though. Next onto the same salad they've served forever: iceberg lettuce (meh) with a tasty ginger dressing.  Next, onto your \"appetizer\": zucchini, onions, shrimp -- all good, as are the dipping sauces. Then onto your main course. My favorite is the Chateaubriand. You also get some tasty mushrooms. Can't eat it all? Makes for damn good leftovers.  You end with some ice cream and are stuffed to the brim.  Good, fun choice for a group event!"}
{"text":"This was a fancy looking Benihana. I havent been to any of their other locations but this one looked pretty good with its full force Japanese decor.  Went here for dinner with some friends before we head out to go drinking and dancing until the wee hours of the morning.   -1 star for making us wait 30 mins before we can order! I dont understand why we had to wait. The Hibachi chef from the table infront of us finish their meal before ours came to cook for us. I mean, there were 2 tables! We were practically drooling over the aroma that wafted from the other table and we got hungrier and crankier by the minute.  When our turn finally came, we ordered the chicken, spicy chicken and beef entrees. The onion mushroom soup was very light, the shrimp and veggies were crisp and fresh but I did not enjoy the chicken because it came out dry and overcooked. The meal was very filling and we enjoyed the little show that our Hibachi chef put on for us.  -1 star for using too much oil and butter on everything!   I will probably try the Benihana's in CA but I will wait until I get their lunch deals in my email."}
{"text":"The chef at our table was cracking inappropriate jokes and was more attentive to the other party sitting at our table. The food was good yet overpriced. After the meal my friends and I spotted a roach on the wall which I reported to management who stated they come out when it's hot!? If the chef could've focused on cooking instead of insulting and telling lame jokes I would be able to give them another star."}
{"text":"Cirino our cook was nice ! The food was good but the place inside was a bit dated and kinda dirty looking. The food was good. The vents over the oven had not been cleaned on the outside you could just see the grease dripping"}
{"text":"Went here last month April 23 to be exact. Our chef barely talked we could see that in advance we noticed he wasn't social we asked the manager a young Hispanic guy if we could get another chef and he said no very stern. I've gone twice to the website for Benihana to make a complaint and no one has ever contacted me back. The experience was for a birthday and several of members of my family had never been there so this experience was not the greatest"}
{"text":"Good solid four stars. Reservations were no hassle, seated quickly, chef cooked everything perfectly and my iced tea only got below half once. Food was great and the service was spot on. Thumbs up guys!"}
{"text":"had an absolute fabulous time here!! it depends on your chef i guess - but we went here for an all girls out family reunion type thing and we went all out...it really does depend on the chef you get, and ours was great..i couldnt tell you his name but he kept up laughing the whole time during the meal.  wait was a bit long, and there was an annoying crowd next to us, but still  i give them 5 stars for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is good. But one thing sticks out so much from my last time eating at Benihana...   It is, by far, the most pretentious restaurant I've eaten at. Every single employee from the hostess, to the server, to the chef, to the manager, asked us if we celebrating a special occasion. Why didn't they just say we're so over priced, no one would eat here unless it's their anniversary or birthday.   There are so many other teppanyaki restaurants around the valley that are just as good, if not better. I would probably go to one of them (many of which are not chains) before heading back to Benihana."}
{"text":"Tonight we had a reservation for 5 for a family birthday dinner.  First, we were taken to a table and given a stranger to join us for dinner. She talked constantly and advised us she was sick, great thanks ! The Mexican  ( No offense meant, just not Asian ) who prepared our dinner was nice but not very entertaining. Other tables were roaring with laughter as food  was tossed about during the cooking process. The food was good, not even great and very expensive. Will we return for a family dinner, No And another thing, The Photo lady came by the table, just after we seated. We told her 2 of our party had gone to the restroom. She never returned. We later read that we would have gotten a free picture for the Birthday Reservation. Thanks !"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Highly disappointed. Do they use the Same jokes in all Japanese steak houses? Small portions. AND they charge. MY credit card TWICE.  Ordered the steak & shrimp. It was ok, but nothing special. Many more places to go while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Worst Benihana ever. Service is rude, they act like they can't hear you when you ask for service. The manager is just as bad so don't even bother asking to speak to one. It was a nice location but once you're seated the experience goes down the drain. WASTE OF TIME!"}
{"text":"Lunch 5/24...the greeter at the desk was RUDE and not welcoming at all(other guests were complaining of the same thing)...service at the table was poor(took 20 minutes to get our check done since it had a Benihana gift card as payment)...food was delicious(chef was Jordan who was fun and did a great job)....would have been a great experience if they trained their staff better"}
{"text":"My son and I enjoyed our birthday dinner last night! Sam was our chef and he was probably the best chef we've had there! Each time we go, it's the same routine as last time, but Sam put his own spin on it and made it that much more funny! We enjoyed him!  Service was great, unlike the other recent reviews show. I don't remember our server's name, but she was nice, kept our drinks filled, and was attentive.   Can't wait to have my leftovers for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food is bomb as always. Sachie  is super nice and On top of everything and gave us a nice history on the background of the establishment. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Bravo Grant! Our server was not feeling well yet still went way beyond the call of duty and make sure our water glasses were filled with celebrate our birthday of my guest and everybody at the table have an amazing time so grant service alone made the evening a success.   We were celebrating a birthday so we shared a fliet and shrimp meal and got a crunchy shrimp roll from the Sushi bar. The sushi guy at the sushi bar was a profectionist as I watched him.  Our cook Hiro was funny and intertaining and had some great one liners and made some great decorations with the food  (see images).  All the food tasted fresh and delious and cooked just right.  So great job and keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. It was ok. I would rather eat at The Dorstop in Dormont. The staff is VERY friendly. I had the express steak lunch. The rice was not as fresh as I'd like and the vegetables were mediocre. There was a lot of squash and if there were other vegetables they did not leave an impression. Too bad Atria's was not serving fried zucchini. I would've preferred that."}
{"text":"Having gone in for lunch if you are thinking of doing the same, do yourself a favor and keep driving. Underwhelmed is the only way to describe it. That and over priced. The sushi rolls are tiny. The only place I have seen a tempura roll wrapped in rice paper. But I guess when you cut it so thin, less than a quarter inch pieces it has to have something to hold it together. The salmon roll was the width of my little finger. The teriyaki could have been anything. Not going again. Spoke to the manager before I left and explained our disappointment but he did not seem bothered and offered no recompense. Service meanwhile was fine."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a while.  Who only has one sushi chef  and gives the Sushi chef and hour break.  Reason I went there for my birthday.  Waitress  said sorry but any other appetizers without a menu?  Reall?  Another person order an appetizer never got it.  Ask for another fork took 30 minutes."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for lunch. We were waiting on just one person but six of is were already there. Hostess said we had to have all of our entire party in order to be seated. When we were seated, I noticed there were plenty of empty seats in the restaurant! The six of us could have been seated and see the menu early. The last person only came three minutes after us.   We were seated and then given menus. They took our drinks first, so that was nice. Once our drinks came out, they took our order for food. We got here a little before noon and our reservation was for 12pm. We sat down by 12:05pm. We did not get a chef assigned to us until 12:45pm. We sat around hungry and waiting. Our chef seemed a bit nervous. The jokes were funny but the techniques were definitely more of a beginner. He made mistakes and we were unimpressed. By the time we ate our side of fried rice, we were already full from our starvation. We had plenty of leftover from our main dishes.   If it's your birthday, they will give you ice cream of your choice, take a picture for you, and print out the photo for you to take home.   Margherita was our server. She was not very pleasant. Usually, when you say \"thank you\", your server would respond in a polite or welcoming manner; perhaps even just a smile. Not Margherita. She never looked happy and had no warm air to her. Overall, this was the worst experience I've had at a hibachi restaurant. Will not be returning again. We were unable to leave until around 2pm. We went way past our lunch break, so the reservation did not help at all."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience! Rosalynn our server was attentive and very kind we did not want for anything. Jocelyn our chef was AWESOME! The food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I love Japanese food and Teppanyaki cooking.  That being said, while Benihana isn't my favorite place to go for this, you'll still find good food and a fun experience.   Most recently, I was here with my family for my Dad's birthday.   We had the pleasure of having Sam as our cook, and he put on one heck of a show.   You start with a mushroom and onion soup, green salad with a tasty ginger dressing, and some shrimp with grilled veggies.  I ordered the Terriyaki Chicken, and it was decent.  The only reason I'm giving these guys the fourth star is because my mother found a staple or part of a pair of tongs in her salad, and the manager was kind enough to comp her meal and beverages.  Lastly, don't forget to sign up for the Benihana Chef's Table Club. $30 for your birthday; say what?!   Like I said, there's many other places that come to mind when I hear the word Teppanyaki, but Benihana can be a lot of fun for any special occasion."}
{"text":"First experience going there, well the hosts welcomed us with open arms, the scenery is breathtaking...picture yourself being at peace with mother nature.  Everyone from cashiers to the cooks who entertained with much laughter and joy acted professional. The food that was prepared in front of us was delicious.  Two things  i didn't like was the seating arrangements.  Since we had a group of over 20 people there wasn't any room to move due to a tight space.  2nd is food prepared is a bit pricey over there but if you don't mind spending and be entertained and eat Japanese food, this is the place to be.  Overall I give this place 4 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"We had the best experience dining at this location inside the Westgate Casino. Every single person we encountered that night was very hospitable from the valet service to the employees standing in front of the lobby greeting and directing us the way to Benihana's. I was definitely very surprised at how big the restaurant was inside.   Our server was a sweet Japanese lady who promptly took care of our needs and even comped us a bottle of sake which kept the adults very happy. Our chef James didn't seem warm at first but it didn't take much time for him to start growing on us, crack some jokes and the interesting conversations about our family and kids. The portion size is always enough to make you leaving full and it was cooked perfectly. I really wanted to have filet mignon that night but since it was Good Friday, I opted for the Surf Side meal which consisted of calamari, shrimp and scallops. Our kids absolutely enjoyed the food and how it's specially served to each and every person. Overall, it was a great dinner and full evening of rides after at the Adventure Dome to entertain the teens."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, the food was excellent!! Our cook Brandon did a great job acomodating every one and did a good show for the kids. I would give it 5 stars but the wsit staff was slow and that part of the service was lacking. Overall it is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Fun place for groups! Benihana wouldn't be my first choice for sushi or for going out at all really, but if you have a special occasion for some friends it would be a good place to consider. Pricey food, but I thought it was good. Haven't tried the sushi yet.   Benihana is known for it's tables which are centered around a stove. You get your own chef who comes over and prepares your whole meal for you! They do lots of crazy tricks and entertain the table while cooking. Lots of fire tricks too!   It's the kind of place you can say you have been to and it;s a fun experience, but you don't need to go back after that."}
{"text":"08/18 and 08/19  Came to check out Benihana's happy hour and sat at the bar.  One bartender was more eager than the other to answer my questions regarding my food issues, but both were gracious and friendly.  I wondered if they split the tips evenly?  Tried a few plates...  Some were 50% off, and some were slightly reduced.  The menu pricing was a little confusing, and I hope that this is corrected in the near future.  The seaweed salad was OK.  Don't know if I would pay the full price of $3.75, though.  (And for 50%, or was it $3?, I don't think it was worth that, either.)  The gyoza was also just OK- a bit on the bland side and a bit lacking on the mouth-feel aspect.  The asparagus tempura plate was a nice surprise; However, the greasiness got to me, and in the end, I was stripping the batter off of the spears more due to necessity, and not w/ the sadness I normally would be feeling from having to trim off delightful cruchiness, bec. otherwise I couldn't enjoy the meal knowing I'd ingested all of that excess oil!  The tuna sashimi was very good and substantial, compared to all of the \"light\" apps that I tasted before it.  The spicy yellowtail was also very nice, although the jalapenos were a bit too much, so I just scooped them off to the side.  Really liked the acidic component of this dish!  With all the HH reductions, I wasn't thrilled w/ this meal, but at least I know which to revisit and which to pass next time.  Lunch was also a bit disappointing.  Both lunch boat and duet came w/ many components, but Mom and I only truly enjoyed the salad, the chicken (it was good, although I couldn't eat much of it), the salmon sashimi, and the runaway hit, beef julienne (both off of the boat).  Since these came, for the most part, in two-bite portions, we didn't feel like we received our money's worth.    Looking back, I know we won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Compare to New York and Miami BENIHANA this place rank last with tasteless food and unprofessional service The only good things is the new ventilation system"}
{"text":"This place is nice and entertaining.  The food was good. Nice time. More about environment here than great food.  You are served one course at a time, not so fun. I will be back.  The salmon was good the steak looked like the best meal."}
{"text":"We have been going to Benihana  since 1990 or so, I keep coming back although I don't know why? I like good food, and good service together, I used to come, because my kiddo liked the show, she was little. I thought the food tasteless and unedible. but we had fun, the sad part is the service is ALWAYS HORRIBLE tonight no exception. I am far to tired to get into it, but OH MY GAWD oddly enough the food has much less \"crud\" on it, basic steak salt pepper YUMMY, I used to feel guilty saying I need less salt etc... soy on the steak blah, and tonight yippy, but our server was on drugs or just plain and simply put an idiot, I nearly left twice, I  decided to stay had fun, chatting and taking pics. my sushi was made wrong, I ordered first, so it came last and it was wrong, which makes me want to say forget it, but they bring it, and it's wrong again, I say this isn't what I ordered and blonde person claiming to be a server says no they changed the menu, bam she is gone. I ask for paper napkins, bam I never see her, other servers walk by over and over ignoring me and my Voice CARRY\"S! I have sushi after the chef arrived, They came with the Birthday  stuff, but for this kid at the table next to us, I had my birthday certificate open on the table the entire time, she says\" I asked if anyone was celbrating\" OH MY GAWD I then get a 45 dollar bill that says 78  ... she stands there arguing with me, I called Manager , he fixed it, and didn't fight,   I also usually bring cash , but last I was there they put a manditory 18 percent tip. and I was giving the waiter cash, and the chef cash, and then bam i notice the 18 percent gratuity , I can't say give me back the tip, so I tell manager, and he took it off. GRRRR so I figured it was a manditory tip, well it isn't anymore, so I tipped 15.00 cuz I enjoyed the chef, and I suppose someone else will get part of it, but I am exhausted getting bad service, I am not too thrilled the food was good, because what is the point if you have to fight for a napkin, the right food, and of course a lousy candle in some ice cream, (My 11 year old was disappointed on me. ya know) I worked for tips my entire life, and let me tell you, I have been known to tip like mad for great service, imagine if I tipped 15 for this LOUSY SERVICE~ We might be back next year for something, but I won't miss them if I don't go. GRRRRRRRRRR   Training for chefs a must, why not train servers, or is managment to blame cuz  they all look like the worst, ignoring me etc etc I finally got those napkins after begging PLEASE!  well 3 stars makes sense if they own Ra... nuff said, next time I want sushi and service I know where I go for good food and service, and it won't be Ra or Benihana."}
{"text":"Went there for my boyfriend's 24th birthday and it was AMAZING! our chef Kevin was beyond great! I had never been there and it for sure became a future spot to re-visit. I work in the industry and I understand how important being on time is for a reservation; however things happen such as accidents on the freeway that you cannot avoid. With that being said-- our host was not friendly and in a way rude about the reservation time. The only reason I mention this is because people who do not work in the industry might not be as uncaring as I was... However, I would come back again and hopefully the first face on sight is nicer. Thank you for making our experience memorable and let me just add that the pictures at the end taken by our server (Margarita) were awesome!"}
{"text":"It has been several years since I have been here and it will be just as long before I go back. I was not happy with any part of our dinner experience. The service wasn't horrible, but not impressive at all. The drinks were really bad, watered down. The food was worse!!! The mushroom broth was nothing to get excited about. The dressing on the salad was watery, with very little flavor. Our chef on the hibachi table had very little personality or skill. The food was cut in huge pieces, not bite size at all.  I ordered the Hibachi Chateaubriand, the steak itself was a decent quality. Their so called garlic has no bit of garlic flavor what so ever. I asked for my steak medium rare and it was cooked medium maybe even medium well, and cut in such huge pieces it was difficult to enjoy. The fried rice which is always my favorite part of hibachi, was very disappointing! It had no flavor, and had tough pieces of chicken in it???? I really was extremely unhappy with every part of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday, and I will never be going back. Service was mediocre, but the food was the real travesty. You go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \"no, you never served me any.\" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them.  I don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No.  The best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"**DO NOT GO HERE!**  Arrived Wed night, wait would be 35-45 minutes.  No thank you...left.  Next night, Thurs, my boyfriend and I tried again for his birthday, using our $30 credit.  Called ahead to make reservations; told they don't make reservations unless you're in the building...ridiculous!  So, we arrive and the snooty group of hostesses at the front (3) ask if we have a reservation; obviously not as we couldn't make one per them.  Teppanyaki table wait again 35-45 min.  We sat at the Sushi Bar...at 6:50pm. Vivian, the waitress, comes over. Asks for our drink order; just waters. 10 min later, we get them.  Then, I review the menu, as I'm a vegetarian; not a whole lot to offer.  My boyfriend orders sushi to start, and gets it pretty promptly.  Then, I give her my order, and she walks away. Doesn't get my boyfriend's order.  After waiting another 10 min, she comes back with rice, that I ordered to come w/ vegetable tempura, and I ask her to bring it all together and proceed to tell her that my boyfriend would like to order.  Food took forever to come out.  Didn't get drink refills at all.  Then, we're done eating, waiting for the bill, and the waitress is nowhere in sight; we're an hour and a half into this now.  The sushi chef notices and tells her we're waiting.  She shows up, with a group of waitresses, singing Happy Birthday, and still no bill.  I would NEVER go back there!  It was the worst experience ever!  I have more details, just too much for this..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Benihana and my husband's first visit since dining at Benihana in Illinois many years ago.  We had a great experience as our waitress was awesome and our food delicious! The complimentary salad and soup were both very tasty and the main meal was amazing. We shared the Colossal Mango Shrimp which had the most incredible Mango sauce either of us have ever tasted and the Shrimp just melted in your mouth! For dessert we had the tempura banana and icecream....yum!  My husband had the happy hour Saki and at $2 what a bargain! I tried their Japanese Soda - Ramune Soda - Strawberry flavor....wow! I have never, ever been excited about Soda before.....hardly drink the stuff....but this was tasty. A great alternative if you can't drink alcohol.  I would have to say that to get the most out of this restaurant the Teppanyaki Menu is the way to go. To me the food and service were 5 star....only missing a star because of the atmosphere.....could be a little more cozy."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed. I have been to several Benihana restaurants and was expecting this to be at least as good as any of the others. The sushi was so so, and my entree had no flavor, no discern able taste whatsoever. I was the only one seated at my table so I didn't get much of a show or opportunity to try a variety of dishes although by the looks on others faces I would venture to say they also left their food on their plates because it wasn't worth eating. My plain white rice was the best part of my entire experience which is pathetic."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a couple of years, so we stopped in for dinner last week.   Hasn't changed at all.  The food is delicious, yet overpriced.  And the chefs are great at what they do, and are performing comedians as well.    Benihana is more an experience than anything else.  We took our nephews who were in town visiting.  It was their first time, and obviously they loved it.  Watching the chefs cook is really why you dine here.  It's culinary entertainment.  If you've seen one show, you've seen them all.  But I like to stop in every couple of years to see it again."}
{"text":"My dad, stepmom and I ate here for the first time this past night; we really enjoyed our dinner here! My dad had the chateaubriand; stepmom had the Ocean Treasure (grilled chicken with shrimp, scallops & lobster tail); I had the Deluxe Treat House Specialty (filet mignon with lobster tail). Our meals also came with an Asian salad, grilled shrimp appetizer, sliced grilled onions & zucchini, green onion soup, hot green tea and dessert. Our chef Tim was very engaging and efficient; the servers were attentive, friendly and also efficient. Not sure why this place doesn't have a higher Yelp rating--Although we had a 5 pm dinner, we noticed that this place filled up quickly during the 1 1/2 to 2 hours we were here! So clearly, this place is more popular despite what those negative reviews say! We would definitely come back here and recommend it to others--so don't believe all the smack you read on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon 2:00. Lunch is until 3:00. I asked for a lunch menu I didn't see a vegetarian option which the other Benihana's normally have. The hostess was very unhelpful. I asked her the question of if they had vegetarian and she did one of those\" I don't know , uh uh\" Then somebody else walked by she asked him and he said they had tofu , so I said OK can we get a seat? Again she hemmed and hawed and said \"uh like, I uh, can't put you by hibachi.\" At this point , I just left. I really have not had that kind of experience at Benihana anywhere else. Will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed at all, especially for the price.  Everything on the grill was a little overcooked and charred.  The kids liked the canned presentation since it was their first time, but you could hear the chef at the next table cracking the same jokes.  My filet mignon was cooked perfectly med-rare, was a great cut of meat and seasoned just right.  It was the high point.  I would go again only if I had a coupon or some sort of discount.  I miss Ayako Tokyo on Camelback."}
{"text":"I love Benihana. I especially love the $30 coupon they send for your birthday each year. What a great deal! The place is always packed and the food is always delicious. I've never had a bad meal, nor have I had a chef that wasn't entertaining.   If you love Teppanyaki, I recommend this place. It is always consistent, the service is always on par and the food is great. Tip: Spend the extra couple bucks and get the fried rice!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today.  Service was good, and the food was great.  The chef was very skilled and entertaining.  All four of us enjoyed the meal.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sad to say this was the worst service and tepenyaki experience.  Don't waste your money!  They will rip you off and fight you for it in the end. Management is ridiculous. Our table spent well over $300 for lunch and what a waste.  Waitress was the worse ever, chef was very inexperienced, and management was pathetic."}
{"text":"Heard about how great this place was especially for date night so I decided to try it out with my husband!   The main attraction of the restaurant was the entertainment provided by our chef. We ordered the hibachi steak and filet mignon. Every single bite was delicious!   We were told they even have happy hour so we will definitely be coming back to try that out."}
{"text":"From the hostess to the serving staff, poor experience for a return guest. We had a 7:45 reservation and weren't seated until 8:20. Prior to being seated, we arrived at 6:45 in an attempt to catch happy hour at the bar, yet stood around for 10 minutes before being greeted at the bar. We ended up grabbing happy hour elsewhere.   None the less, while the experience can be fun, this establishment can use a lesson in service."}
{"text":"After always walking by this location from various trade shows at the LVCC I finally decided to give it a try. The overall ambitious and decorations are outstanding. It's almost like you're invited into a little Japanese kitchen. The downside to this place would be the overall food.  For the high price point I was expecting more spectacular food but it was just so so. The portion sizes were very large which was nice but I felt the meat and vegetables could have used a bit more seasoning.   The service was also somewhat sub par. We had to track down our server a few different times to request a drink menu and dessert menu and the hibachi chefs seemed to be very rushed and pulled from table to table. The pushy photographer also give it that typical cheesy tourist touch.   Overall I most likely will not be back but am glad I finally tried it."}
{"text":"Went here this afternoon and i can't say enough about how great this restaurant was! Everything was great from the food to the service. I've been to many Japanese steakhouses but this one definitely is one of the best I've been to. Highly recommend if you're in the area or live in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  Danielle was our server.  She was on point.  Dominick was our chef.   Equally as good.   Wanna know what SUCKED ? I had a 30 dollar off coupon for my bday.   I'm Not even a coupon person.    And I would have given that 30 off to the server in all honesty.  After I paid the tab I told them I had the coupon and had forgotten about it.  The \"manager\" came by- rudely said he couldn't reopen the check after it's closed and BOUNCED.   Never once did he even look me in the eye.   Guess what?   I work off the same POS system that they do - aloha.   I'm very well aware of the fact that you can re open a check.  In fact.  You can do it on aloha, posi touch, micros, etc...    so take your 30 bucks and shove it.    #lazy #customerservice #boooooooo"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and it was my first time. I thought the food was pretty good but the show of them cooking it was amazing!"}
{"text":"We usually visit this place about two to three times a year (various locations).  We really enjoy the food and the teppanyaki chefs are the best.  We've had Tim both times at this location and he's always been great.  The waitress was a bit slow this last time as nearly all 10 in our party had empty glasses and dishes were starting to pile up  I looked over and realized she was handling two other massive tables.  Always look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Benihiana, but this location was crap.  Yes, it's huge and has a ton of great visual architecture.   We got there and were seated pretty fast.  This had me thinking \"wow, this is going to be great!\"   It was another 30 min before we were even allowed to order the food.  A good hour before the chef came to make our food.  Really?!  They got one of our orders wrong and in the end, we had to remind them about our ice cream.  I love the Benihana's we have in Scottsdale, AZ.  This one.. not so much."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight and had a great dinner but horrible service unfortunately. We had a reservation for a table of 9 but still had to wait just a bit. When we got sat, it took awhile to get drinks. Our whole table notice that the table next to us got all of their waters and cocktails before us after being seated probably 15 mins after. Anyways a couple of things that went wrong was that we order items and didn't received it such as drinks, sauces, and an entree. The chef, Cirino was the best part of everything tonight. He was friendly and when we didn't receive one of our entrees, he kindly prepared it for us. Short and simple we had a good time just bad service."}
{"text":"This location never disappoints for our special occasion group dining. Twice we came with parties over 15 and they always accommodate us everyone has a great time & delicious meal. You need to make reservations in advance, since they book up fast for large parties. Our chef Rollly rocked!  Although this location is located on the East side of the strip at the Westgate. We like the ambience & their garden/scenic area is so lovely and perfect backdrop for pics.   I would recommend--those who do not want a big meal to enjoy their sushi choices. Always fresh & better for a night on the town in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Birthdays, anniversaries,and special occasions you know where to find us! We love the food here and the atmosphere is great. I hope the recent name change of the hotel doesn't scare people away as this is the only Benihana in Vegas. I would hate to see this place close. My only complaint is that sometimes they participate in the advertised \"chefs special\" and sometimes they don't. It really depends on the waiter or waitress... Too bad for the guy that said no... I tip way better on the chef's special then the individual dinners."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with everything at this location. I order the 5 course meals that include the Japanese hot green tea but this location will not give it to you.  They will tell you the hot water machine is broken. They will not offer you anything else to substitute for it either even though is on their menu and it says included with your meal. They want you to pay for the drink.  My daughter went to eat there with her friends last month and no one got tea either they had to pay for the drinks.  I ordered the seafood diablo and asked if I can get the yakisoba noodles instead of the udon noodles but the server said NO they can't do that.  What's so hard about cooking with different noodles?  I should of just walk out but I didn't so it was my fault. The seafood diablo didn't taste good with the udon noodles so I didn't eat it and wasted my money. I'm just going to stick to Ohjah Japanese steakhouse and hibachi.  The food is way better and a lot cheaper!  Never again Benihana!"}
{"text":"Teppanyaki is not really my favorite style of cooking. I always feel it's a little over priced because the food itself is pretty boring but you are paying more money since the chef puts on a show for you. It can be a fun experience if you are with the right people and in the mood for it but I have never really been wowed by a meal at one of these places. Our last experience at a teppanyaki place up in Flagstaff was so awful that I was not really looking forward to our dinner at Benihana but we had received a gift card for Christmas so we decided to go ahead and give them a try.  Style wise, the place is on par with the other restaurants around Chandler mall. Nice looking but somewhat trite Asian decor. Not surprisingly, they were quite busy on a Saturday night and we had to wait at the bar a little while for a table. While we were sitting there, I observed that there were a surprisingly amount of families there. I would have thought that this was not type of place you would bring kids, partially because of the hibachi grill and also the price. But there were a ton of kids of all ages. Most of the families were on their way out, though, and the late night crowd was arriving. This seems to be a popular date spot for college age couples. There was a good lively crowd in the bar area so we didn't really get a whole lot of attention from the bartender... they definitely need to staff up behind the bar. Since I found the wine and beer list very lacking, I decided to try a couple of their specialty cocktails. These were mediocre at best. The Cucumber Collins had a good, fresh flavor to it and was pretty enjoyable but it could have done with a little more lemon and less club soda. I decided to switch to something stronger and so made the mistake of ordering a Beni-Tini. This drink was overly sweet and not enjoyable at all. I could not detect any hibiscus flavor so I have to assume that they use a syrup rather than brewed tea. If you like sweet drinks this may work for you but I guess I should have just ordered a regular martini. I did notice they had some top shelf (well, mid-shelf anyway) liquor bottles so next time I'll just stick to the basics.  Once we were finally seated, my hubby and I had no complaints about our chef or the food. The mushroom soup was tasty, though it took me by surprise since most restaurants like this serve Miso Soup as a starter. I also really enjoyed the salad; it had plenty of other vegetables, not just lettuce, and the dressing was really good. The hubby got a surf and turf thing with steak and jumbo shrimp. I tried one of his shrimp and they were very sweet and delicious, much better than the smaller ones we all got included with our meals. (Those were cooked well, but just inferior quality shrimp). For my entree, I ordered a noodle dish, Seafood Diablo. This was not as spicy as I was hoping and the sauce was a bit too greasy for me (lots of oil on my plate when I was done) but overall it was good. The seafood all tasted delicious and I was actually amazed that chef managed to make sure that the squid, shrimp, etc in my dish didn't get overcooked while at the same time tending to everyone else's chicken and steak. We ended the meal with the fried banana dessert with vanilla ice cream and a scoop of chocolate on the side for me. We were both pretty happy with that!  Overall, this is not the best teppanyaki place I've been to but it is far from the worst. I would probably eat here again if I was with a group who picked it but I wouldn't necessarily suggest it myself."}
{"text":"Had one of the best experiences. I highly recommend the cook Zack. He made the experience worth the trip. He is funny, a good time and keeps the laughs coming. The food was great."}
{"text":"Horrible service, Manager was overwhelmed everyone had to wait an hour and a half for a chef so it was a two hour wait to eat.. They threw away extra food instead of serving it and the chef said he would lose his job if he served it to us after he had already cooked it..."}
{"text":"I love this place! We RSVP for a party of 7. We got a table to sit on, the chef making our food was hilarious.  The food was from $25-$50 per person. It was absolutely amazing. It was a 5 course meal. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Best Benihana I have ever been too.  Our chef was fantastic. He changed up the routine and got everyone involved. Made the meal even better. Lots of fun and laughter."}
{"text":"First, I love Teppanyaki restaurants. It is always a fun time introducing new people to those type of restaurants. Benihana was my second choice, but Option A was closed. Being a chain, I knew I had a good shot it would still be in business. I prefer the smaller restaurants - typically more entertainment and lower cost, but Benihana is typically good and it is open.  There were 3 chefs working yesterday and we got the white guy. He was nice, but he wasn't as good as the ones at the other tables. This isn't him, because the other chefs didn't do it either, but there was no volcano like every other teppanyaki place does and no big flame to clean the grill. Probably being a chain they are more worried about law suits resulting from fire. Instead of volcano with flame, it was a train with smoke.   Benihana is more expensive than other places, but considering it is like dinner and a show, it isn't bad. The show part was not as good as it could be. The chef was okay and for the first timers with me, they thought it was good. The flavor of the food was okay, but not the best I have had. It was just kind of ho-hum for me. Interestingly enough after he was finished with our table, the chef went to another table that was all Asian customers. I wondered to myself what they must think getting the one white guy in the place - then the loud clanking noise of him dropping the cart and the food on the ground told me they probably weren't impressed.   For 2 people ordered one of the standard combos and water, it was $65 ($80 after tip). A little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food. I would recommend finding a smaller local establishment. At least they usually throw shrimp at you and douse you with saki if you catch it."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Benihana and it was a great experience. My party was held up by my tantrum throwing two year-old and grabbed a plum wine at the bar as they waited for us.   Once we finally arrived we where taken to our table where our orders where taken and we started our meal with soup, salad and then the main dish of our choosing. The chef was really funny and sweet, plus the food was mouth watering (the garlic butter instantly made my mouth water). The only issue is it's a long dinner. We got there at 7 and didn't leave till almost 10!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I visited this establishment Monday evening - arrived @ 8:30pm for Sushi.  The Sushi bar area seating was already closed for the evening so we were directed to the bar.  We were the ONLY people at the bar so you would think we'd get a lot of attention but it was quite the opposite.  We placed a small order with intentions of ordering more-had the bartender leave a menu.  We had to ask for water and once our food was delivered we didn't see or hear from the bartender until the plates were empty.  I looked around for the menu he left only to find that he had taken it away which gave me the feeling he didn't want us to order anything else. He never asked how our food was - really didn't care about anything but closing down to place to get out of there.  We asked him why he didn't care and he didn't have an answer.  We left and mentioned our unhappy experience to the hostess (2) and they said they would report it to the manager.  I am sure they didn't and I wont be back.  Pitiful."}
{"text":"I enjoy the atmosphere and how they cook in front of u. It's a very unique experience. I liked the food and drinks. Had no complaints there. I will say the bathrooms looked like they hadn't been cleaned for a few months. There was no paper towels or toilet paper either."}
{"text":"Would rate 0 stars. HORRIBLE! For lunch  they messed up my order, I forgave them. Then came at dinner ordered at 727pm he said 30 minutes I came at 8 and seen 2 females and 1 male standing up front I told them my name and advised that I had ordered 30 minutes ago and told them my order. They said okay and dismissed me I sat right in front of them 20 minutes went by nobody said anything talked to me updated me nothing. I was waiting for guy who took my order to come back up to talk to him another 20 minutes went by now being 40 minutes on site he finally came around and I approach him asked him where my order was and I was upset and hungry at this point after working 12 hours shift. He said let me check he walked back there and not even 30 seconds later walked up with my order. I was beyond upset no sorry no apology from manager. I stood there when my order was ready the whole time. I left and ate at Arby's."}
{"text":"We had a group of about 14 people for my friends 21st birthday. First we were sat late. When we came to the table they hadn't even set up enough seats to accommodate to the 14 so we had to squeeze in 3 more chairs to a completely full table. The hostesses/waitresses were very rude from the entire time, it took a long tome for the hibachi chefs to come out but once they did, our dinner became a lot better because they were very funny and outgoing-that was the only good thing about the dinner-. We all had ordered 6 course meals and weren't provided with desert, and after telling the GM about our experience there wasn't much relief. After working at Gordon Ramsay Steak I know how customer service works in the food business. Never going again terrible experience and ok food. Also after watching every other table sing happy birthday to the people who had birthdays they did not sing happy birthday to our birthday girl. 21 is a big one and Benihana's did a great job of making her feel unimportant. PS my friend didn't even get Her ID checked and it was her 21st...."}
{"text":"Second time here. I ordered a beef fried rice and half of the beef was on the leftover for some one else, on top of that the fried rice doesn't mix well plus not great in seasoning. He doesn't know his trick. The table that he cook in was so messy. Not coming any more"}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life.  Took my wife out for her Birthday.  The waiter could care less and the manager was obnoxious.  When we complained about the waiter he threw his trey down and pushed open the kitchen door.  I felt like I was watching a 5 year old throw a tantrum.  20% off our ticket will not get us to comeback.  It was horrible!  Not worth the money.  Zero professionalism!"}
{"text":"Food was delish, but the wait was ridiculous. We got there at 730 and did not get out til 10. It took so long I ended up bringing my food home. $100 (party of 1] to take it home to heat it up. NO BUENO"}
{"text":"I have always liked going to Benihana even had my son's Baptism reception at a different location...I do have to say though that I was very disappointed this time around...We made reservations for our birthday around 830 pm and the wait was short to be seated which was nice...Prior to being seated we had a drink at the bar for a birthday toast...Ryan was our waiter and he was great, very friendly made us laugh and even helped take our group pics...My twin and I were excited that we were spending our birthday together after living in 2 different states it had been at least 8 years that we celebrated together...So this meant alot to us and couldn't wait to get dinner started...Our chef Jocelyn arrived and she didn't even introduce herself, how do i know her name i had to read it so i knew who she was...She then proceeded to give us our sauces and started the show...Now every once in awhile it can be normal to drop your utensils, but she did it more than I expected...Then came the heart shaped fried rice, shrimp that she missed 2 of them in her routine but hey it happens...The entire time she is cooking everyone at the table is either staring at other tables to see what's so exciting or we are looking at eachother in wonder why she isn't interacting with us...This is our birthday it's suppose to be exciting not us hear other people's reactions to thier chefs tricks etc for thier birthday celebration...It was so bad I had to make funny puns to make people laugh at our table...Normal chit chat is fine but when you're just cooking and we can't hear anything you say cause you aren't being vocal doesn't make the experience worth while...You know its bad when you have to look at other peoples table to get the Benihana experience...Well she finished cooking and left the table and we just looked around like okay that was horrible...We tried to make the best of it by saying it's our birthday and talked to her husband an my boyfriend to keep us in the birthday mood...We gave her the benefit that maybe she was new and our table was just blah...Nope as we were finishing our dinner she set up camp at the table next to us...We watched as she did the same thing and the table looked just as bored...One lady even had her elbow on the table and just was resting her chin on her hand...Then what happens ohhhh she does the onion volcano and we all look at eachother and realize she didn't even do that for us...Even if we missed it while we had to watch other tables that was pretty sad cause that's something you always wanna see them do...I can go on and on about our experience but overall it was just horrible...We spent all this time hyping ourselves up only to be disappointed...Our birthday only comes once a year and when you have a bad experience on the day of your birthday it just makes it worse...There was at least 4 other birthdays that night as we celebrated and those other tables had waaaaaay more fun than us...If we wanted to just sit down and watch someone cook for us we could have asked our husband/boyfriend lol...Benihana you didn't make us feel special in anyway what so ever on our birthday...The worst part is this experience made me wanna write a review cause it bothers me so much cause I haven't written a review in years...That is the end of my rant slash review on a place that has always been a great experience but they just let the wrong chef entertain us on our birthday..."}
{"text":"Fantastic wonderful food and good times met new people"}
{"text":"I DID NOT EAT BECAUSE I WAS NEVER SAT.  Experience #1: 2 years ago, my wife and I booked a party of 9 for a weekday evening. We showed up and the rest of our group followed. 8 of us were present and after 15 minutes past our time, they refused to seat us because our 9th was not there. Seriously!? ONE PERSON? We left and went to cheesecake factory.  Experience #2: This past January, my wife and I felt like we would walk in and use her birthday coupon on a Wednesday evening. With our last experience 2 years behind us, we went in with a fresh slate. The place was very busy and there were a handful of people waiting in the lobby. I was told it was an hour and a half to two hours to wait for the two of us to be seated. I turned to my wife and she said we'll pass, and once I turned back to the hostess and began to spoke, the girl turned around and walked away from me. What?! How rude!  So we make a reservation knowing its a busy place, and won't be seated (estimating: $25-30 a plate = nearly $300 of business) and just the two of us show up and we may not be seated for 2 hours? Like a previous review mentioned, they care more about overbooking reservations and leave no wiggle room for walk ins. Who in their right mind would go somewhere to eat and be told, you won't be eating for 2 hours! Absurd. The only way I'll give this place a third chance is if it's free, or someone else invites me to join them."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Benihana so I was excited to try it. My cousin comes here every year for his birthday and suggested it when I was in town.  Upon entering, we were told that there would be a 2 hour wait (not sure if this is the norm, but it was around 7 PM on a Sunday) so we decided to seat ourselves in the lounge, which was relatively empty. A server came to us soon after we sat down, which was nice.  My cousin and I got sushi for ourselves and I ordered hibachi chicken rice, chicken yakisoba meal, and rainbow and salmon rolls to take home to my family. At the restaurant, we had the crunchy roll, spider roll, 1964 roll, and Gotham roll. The crunchy roll was by far the best; the Gotham roll was okay but not especially fresh-tasting or flavorful. I was not a huge fan of the other two.  My take-home order was placed on a piece of paper which they rewrote to confirm when the bill was brought to me. I had asked for two orders of the hibachi chicken rice which was also indicated on the paper written by the server but only one was brought out. I was not charged for the second one (which was my fault because I didn't check the receipt clearly and assumed the order was correct based on the paper they wrote). However, it didn't take them long to bring the second one out, even though they kind of had an attitude about it.  My father was disappointed in the rice; brother said the yakisoba was good but the soup that came with the meal was simply terrible. He took one sip and wanted to throw the rest out. Mom was okay with her sushi except... the salmon roll had a TON of bones in it. To me, this is unacceptable. I understand finding an occasional bone in a fish dish but having so many bones in a simple roll is terrible to me.  Would have given 3 stars, because service throughout the meal was good and the food was okay. Removed a star due to all the bones found in the salmon roll."}
{"text":"Very convenient to where we live but clearly, geared toward tourist. Very very expensive for the amount and quality of food you get. It's very normal to have yummy leftovers at most Japanese restaurants so you feel like you are getting 2 meals. Not here! Very small portions. The food was good... not great but you also feel cheated having to pay an extra $5 for fried rice which is normally the standard rice at other Japanese places... pay the extra charge or you get just plain steamed rice.  And let me say this... DO NOT BOTHER ORDERING A COCKTAIL! Rip off! Had the $12 exotic mojito... in my opinion, no alcohol, at all!  As far as service... we had to track down our server twice to order additional beverages.... which we switched to bottled beer since we knew we would get the actual alcohol. Atmosphere was fine... the typical decor. The Ft Lauderdale location is much nicer."}
{"text":"I have to agree with another Yelper in that I can't believe the bad reviews.  Is it the restaurant or the reviewer?  I'm guessing in some places it's the reviewer.  This place is amazing and we eat out a lot!  Okay!  We had reservations at 1:30 for a party of 8 for lunch and still had about a 20 minute wait.  To be fair though two of our party were late but still our table should have been ready when they arrived.  It wasn't.  Once we were seated the experience began and an amazing experience it was.  We were surprised the lunch prices weren't as much as we expected.  Service was excellent.  We were entertained by the Japanese cook preparing our food at our table.  He had a super personality, amazing skills and knew what he was doing when it came to preparing delicious food.  The food?  It was absolutely delicious.  As a matter of fact, their filet mignon was probably the best steak I've ever had in my life.  It was tasty, delicious and extremely tender.  Not only were we served amazing food, we were also entertained through our whole meal.  It was an amazing experience and we loved every minute of it.  I can hardly wait until we can go back again!!"}
{"text":"Best Benihana restaurant I been too, the food and the customer service is beyond my expectation they really care about you and the decor inside is so authentic and beautiful my only problem is that I didn't tip as much next time I will make up for it. I left my credit card by mistake and they turn it in to the lost and found department. I will recommend this restaurant to everyone!!! It's a great place to go celebrate a special occasion yes you will spend a lot of money but definitely worth it to go once a while"}
{"text":"We go here for every thing, its our go to location. The service is great, the food is great, and all around it's not a bad place.   It is rather pricey but you have to expect that. The only thing I wish is that I could finish my meal you get so much yet you are craving more.   The show is great, the sense of humor etc. I have nothing bad to say about this place, we keep going back and always enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and was excited to go but I have to say I was really disappointed. The food lacked much flavor. I had to dump two containers of sauce to make it taste half way decent. The service at the bar was good but there was room for improvement with our server and chef. I gave it two stars because it want the worst place I've been but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've gone a couple of times in the last few weeks. Each time the food was good. The chefs antics were the same each time., and I agree with another reviewer, it really does seem as if each table is having a birthday. The place is very loud. Happy hour specials at the bar while waiting for the table weren't bad, $2 for a carafe of sake.  I also agree the wait staff can very significantly. The first time we went it wasn't very busy. We were seated immediately. However at the end of the dinner we didn't get offered our tea or ice cream. The second time we went despite it being very busy, we got offered that but once my water ran out, I never got a refill. Go figure.  Another nice thing is that it seems the majority of the staff was bilingual, so my Spanish speaking hosts were very comfortable."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food and the end of my dining experience there.   I received a birthday gift certificate for Benihana and since yesterday was the last day to use it and there's a location near my office, I decided to stop in for a solo dinner in the lounge. I was told to take a seat wherever I wanted and took a seat at the sushi bar. That is where I waited for about 10 minutes to be recognized. It seemed like the family to the left of me was getting impatient waiting for their food (they already had drinks), and a party to my right had to stop a server to let them know they had been waiting to place there order. This is where I took my chance to request a menu, which was eventually given to me by my sushi bar neighbor who noticed I was still waiting after a few minutes.   To start, I had the onion soup and salad. I could drink gallons of the ginger salad dressing so I was in a much better mood once I had food in front of me. I ordered a California roll and crispy shrimp roll for the main course. The Cali roll was to be expected, the Crispy shrimp roll was good, but huge. It was hard to get it all in in one bite, but super messy if I did two. To finish, I had the banana tempura, of which I enjoyed the ice cream and pocky stick the most, if that tells you anything. Once my server got in the swing, she was great the rest of the night, so there may have been some miscommunication on who was taking what diners."}
{"text":"This was my second time dining at this Benihana (not my first teppanyaki experience), and we were out for one of my bf Sarah's birthday. We had a 7:30 reservation, and were seated at around 7:40 (why they make reservations, who knows?).   There were six of us, and another couple was seated at our table. One of my gripes with this style of cooking, is that the dining space is super tiny. With all of our drinks (one each) at the table, there was hardly any room for error. Either way, our server was super nice and took very good care of us. The meal was good, albeit expensive, which is what one should expect when going to Beniana's. Everything was cooked great though, very fresh and yummy. This is definitely a place that you come for the experience as well as the food."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 17. Everything was great . Our chef was awesome ! He was great. Made me laugh throughout the whole dinner .   We had a few incidents when server and chef dropped a teacup and a glass of water , but other than that. I loved it !   I started off with shrimp tempura, Had the colossal shrimp and filet mignon. Everything was Delish and I wasn't skimped on the food portion ! I was very full at the end.   We also tried  the fish punch bowl drink. Very Delish .  Will definitely come back to try out the rest of the menu .   They also sang happy birthday to me . So awesome. I was totally embarrassed. Lol .   I definitely recommend this place ! Such a fun time . Such great food and service !"}
{"text":"Last minute Vegas trip for New Years Eve and we were happy as a bunch of drunken clams to find ANY restaurant that would have us on the big night.  Nothing like a sense of desperation to really enhance a dining experience, eh? We had a group of 8 and this was really just fuel to keep us going (and boy, did we). Benihani is great for groups because of the fun, noisy atmosphere. Our chef was great, despite the fact I am sure he was slammed. The decor was tiki / polynesian and they served drinks with little umbrellas (which I am a total sucker for).  To sum the review up: chain restaurants are usually consistent - I would say the LV Hilton Benihana was better than average. Also, theme/novelty restaurants are usually not the pinnacle of fine dining. Lastly, tourist traps are usually expensive. Deal."}
{"text":"Was a great experience from start to finish. Shout out to Angelo the bartender/server for excellent customer service & top notch drink making skills! Thank you to all the staff for making it a memorable experience and food was tasty."}
{"text":"Went for a friends 21st... was sat late, had rude staff the entire time besides the chefs themselves, didn't get dessert after ordering 6 course meals which included desserts, and after talking to the GM he was completely uninterested in making up for the extremely unpleasant night. Will never fo here again. Would've made up if the food was even 1/2 as decent as the prices they sell it for."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner at this restaurant.  There were 18 of us at two of the tables with two chefs.  I would have given the restaurant five stars except that our dinner was held up as they didn't appear to have enough chefs to go around.  Although there was a delay it was hardly noticed because they did serve us drinks, soup and salad while we were waiting. The manager came by to apologize and promised to sing a song for us after dinner.  The dinner was sort of served haphazardly.  First the chef made fried rice which would have been nice to eat with the rest of the meal but he seemed to make each part of the meal separately.  So first he made rice, then the people who ordered steak got their steak, then he served those who had seafood and then those who had chicken. If you had chicken and steak you got those at two separate servings as well. Therefore half the table was finished when the other half was just starting. The entire meal took at least two and a half hours to serve. I'm not sure if that is how meals are served at these types of restaurant as this is the first time I have tried it.  True to his word Ryan (manager) came and sang Let it Go, which the kids enjoyed... another highlight was that the restaurant took a group picture and gave us copies.  Unfortunately some of the diners had left before the picture was taken as their table was finished well before ours. All in all, I definitely would return.  The food, even though served that way, was very good."}
{"text":"I swore that Kobe Japanese Steakhouse in Orlando was the best one I had ever been to, but I think they may have some competition with this one.  My boyfriend and I tried them out on Labor Day, just get something different from what we normally do. He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs/feet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.  Our chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do? It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.  The food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan.   After eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it."}
{"text":"WORST meat i have ever tasted in my whole life....seafood was okay...but the meat...OMG Asked for medium well, tasted like liver and it was SUPER dry. We had their Master Chef take a piece and he agreed but no sorry. Never going back and never recommending this location."}
{"text":"My husband who is very picky loves this place and of course so did I. We started off with onion soup and both were pretty damn good I loved the salad with the ginger dressing amazingly good. I had the lobster roll and I must say it's one of the better ones I've had. My husband had the hibachi chicken and shrimp. He's not a fan of shrimp so I ate it but he loved the chicken and veggies. Alexander was our server and his level of service was just as awesome as the food."}
{"text":"It shouldn't take two hours to be seated,great food but takes forever to sit down. Got here at 5,was seated by 7:00 and then dinner was done at 9:30."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service. I loved the atmosphere and the chef was very interactive. I have been to 3 others and this is the nicest locations of all."}
{"text":"Show lacked style, what happened to this place, supposed to be cream of the crop, and in one word I describe it as..overrated. Steaks over cooked portions small, and show wasnt as good as our neighborhood teppanyyaki, save your cash"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that this location has the Benihana name when they are not living up to the standards. The bad reviews are valid and I wish I would have read them before booking.   SERVICE: Our waitress was good but didn't provide nor ask everyone if they wanted the green tea that is supposed to come with the meals. Also she should have offered the miso instead of the onion soup to everyone that comes with the meals. Other than those things, she was a good server.   CHEF: He did not seem interested in being there and was distracted the entire time. He kept looking at the other tables or around the restaurant while cooking. I get it, they do the same thing with each table and it can get monotonous but part of the appeal is an enthusiastic entertaining chef and we didn't get that.   FOOD: Horrible and overpriced. The salad dressing and the sauces in the bowls were the only good things. The onion soup was salty yet flavorless. Like someone else wrote, it tasted like boiled funions.   The salad was fine, hard to screw up lettuce, carrots and dressing.   Shrimp: disgusting is the only word I can use. They were not cleaned nor deveined and they were overcooked. Rubbery and gross. See my photo of the dirty shrimp. Couldn't eat it. This should be a health violation.   The zucchini, onions and mushrooms were not chopped or sliced well and usually are cooked together but were served separately. The zucchini pieces were thick and not at all the way Benihana restaurants in NY/NJ cook them. This used to be my favorite part of the meal in NY but not here.  The rice wasn't cooked at the table except the fried rice. Since when does Benihana charge for fried rice? That's supposed to be part of the meal. The fried rice was cooked at the table but they charged extra for it. Otherwise the meal comes with stale white rice.   I didn't have the ice cream. Wish they had fruit or something else as a dessert option.   If you're a manager, please don't write me to apologize and provide a free meal like you're doing with others. That won't solve anything and I'll never return so don't bother. What you should is fix the issues or shut down. You're giving Benihana a bad name and provided me with the worst birthday meal."}
{"text":"I am so dissapointed in Benihana Chandler. Last night 6 of us dined there for 3 Birthday Celebrations and shared a table with a couple who was also celebrating a Birthday. We had a 715pm reservation, got seated on time, got a Chef at 845pm. Our waiter came at 830pm n said that his Manager is giving free appetizers for the wait, this is after we had our Soup n Salad. Around this time we let the server know that two guests found hair in their soup, he said the Manager will be over to discuss. The Manager never came so my friend flagged him down to inform him n he disregarded her complaint and walked off. We found out that this was the District Manager.  He never comes back as requested. Our Chef comes rushing us through the service because he says there's only 5 Chefs for the whole restaurant and he's being yelled at in the back to quickly finish our meal. Burned food, not enough rice prepared, waiter was overwhelmed and I blame Management. Instead of seating more tables they should have delayed others reservations or turned people away. Three out of six of us was first n last time guests. We got 15% off the bill but that's not sufficient at all. The Chefs portion of the meal is the main attraction n Benihana Chandler failed last night."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a big fan of chains, but I had a meal coupon to burn and my choices were limited to the Las Vegas Hilton restaurants so I dared to suffer through what I was expecting to be a mediocre meal.  This particular Benihana though was surpisingly nice.  The decor was extremely nice with all the nice Japanese touches.  I'd recommend going here just to take a look and hang out in the lounge areas.  Teppanyaki is done on a grill which you sit about 8 people around each grill.  The seats are a bit crowded together so use the restrooms before you sit down.  The waitress will take your order which is usually beef, chicken and/or seafood combos.  After your typical soup and salad (which were decent but nothing special), the show begins.  The chef twirls and clashes his cooking utensils like a crazed knife-fighter.  The most common and popular trick seems to be the flaming volcano.  The cook reverse-stacks some onion rings to make a volcano shape in which he pours in some oil and lights the oil.  The flames shoot pretty high and after the oil is burned off, it continues to smoke for a long time.  Neat trick.  Food is usually cooked in this order: Veggies, Seafood, Meats.  (So if you are in a rush, order seafood only combos).  The quality of the food was decent, but nothing spectacular as one might expect.  The sauces were nothing special and didn't seem to really enhance the flavor of the meats and seafood.  So if you are looking for an entertaining dinner show while you are in Vegas, this is as good as any.  If you are looking for some really tasty food, I'd look elsewhere.  4 stars for the nice decor, 3 stars for the food.  Recommended for groups of up to 8 people and people dining on the company dime."}
{"text":"I usually love Benihana, and this one is really nice asthetically, but my entire party became ill after eating here.  The only thing we all had was fried rice, so we suspect chicken that wasn't quite right...  The service was good, but to pay over $300 for a meal and get sick from it is just wrong (there were 5 of us)."}
{"text":"Birthdays are always fun here! Such great service and food. Plus the inside looks fabulous.  I love water, so I'm always amazed by that.  When you first walk in, you walk in to an open area.  While you wait there's a sitting section. You can also get your picture taken.  If you're part of the birthday club, your picture is complimentary.   Of course, when you think of this place, you think of Hibachi grill.  I love it!  The chefs put on a little show while cooking.  Tell a few jokes as well.  Cooking up a storm, enjoy some of their drinks that come in a Buddha, geisha and other shapes.  Pretty neat.  Makes you want to keep going to see what figure is next. The chef takes your order and gets to cooking.  If you've never experienced this, I won't give anything away, but your eyebrows will be fine with all the heat.  Once the chef is done cooking, he disperses the food, for you to enjoy.  After all the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" from the mini show, there is silence.  Everyone is enjoying their food.  When your food placed on your plate, you can easily think it's not enough.  But your eyes may be bigger than your stomach.  At the end, the question comes up, \"Would you like dessert?\" My response, \"I have to where to fit it.\" haha!  Definitely an evening of good eats!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here for my 50th birthday in Vegas. Food was good but the table chef was awesome. This is a place we will return to."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for my birthday and we enjoyed it. We made reservations but still waited for about 15mins before we got our table. It was ok. Dinner is usually a pretty busy time at any restaurant anyway. The chef we had was very entertaining. Although we've already seen some of the jokes he made, we were still pretty entertained. The food was great and the serving was right for the price. The restrooms were clean and the ambience was just perfect. The rest of the staff was pretty helpful too. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First off benihana closed at 10:30 but yelp said 11...so we arrived at 10 pm and was seated immediately it was still full with customers..the restaurant itself  was a little dated for the price .we were asked what drinks we would like and we're served right away we placed our order and cook came about 10 minutes later I ordered their steak and was cooked as I asked I never had to ask for refills the waitress was there when our drinks were half way \"great service \" all my family's food came out great aswell the restaurant itself was loud from other partys which is why this restaurant got the 3 stars...the table next to us had a drunk crowd of women that were cussing quite loud throughout their stay there,which was getting my son's attention..not one employee said a thing,the employees watched on and we're fully aware but their starring at them didn't help.our cook was great he did his tricks with the fire...as for the bill my party of 5 with food,drinks and sushi was right under $300 and those drinks had no alcohol.it did come with your choice of ice cream,i tried thier green tea which was ok.however i didn't feel like I got my money's worth so I would take my money elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE . With low volume I'm the Resturant they were very slow . All my food came out Separate. My waiter barely spoke any English and the manager was not willing to correct the problem. I ordered Diablo wings in my water is what we filled also the rice to use on my sushi was very stale. I've never been a fan it was willing to give them a try in the disappointed me dramatically I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"We decided to return to Benihana since our previous experience had been excellent. We were very disappointed. A VERY loud and obnoxious young man sat at the table next to us. He keep yelling out profanity. It was so bad that the family that was sitting at the table got up and left. I feel that when they complained, they should have asked the person causing a scene to leave. Instead, a hotel host went over to welcome him to the casino. I get it, that young flashy guy was a high roller. Oh well! then give him a private table away from society.   Anyway...now let's get to the food.   The food was \"ok\". My sister and I both got sick immediately after eating. My Benihana Punch was not good. How do you mess up a drink? YOUR drink? lol  Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"It's descent for food and a show..its nothing like it used to be, but it's common place to cut corners on quality in this economy"}
{"text":"If it were possible to rate this place as a negative, I would. It was my first time at Benihana and was so bad it will be my last.  The highlights: -It took 2 hours to bring out an order of sushi. -Wine glasses for 7 of the 11 members of our party who ordered wine still had things stuck to the inside of them that were in no way wine AND were filled with water spots. The waitress took them back to clean (which took 20 minutes) and they were still dirty.  -The edamame was cold and unsalted unlike as suggested on the menu. -Some of our food and drinks never made it to our table. -Food was brought to us that wasn't even ordered. -The management and server were unapologetic to any of our concerns.  -There was no soap in the women's restroom.  It was like being in a nightmare; we couldn't believe that all of this happened in one 2 hour span. And to top it all off, we were there for a birthday and they didn't even come to sing to her...unlike tables around us."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about Benihana's. Frankly I don't think the 20 minute show is NOT worth the price. I've gone there four times - each time was a different location. And although it was a bit entertaining, the steak was always over cooked. (I ordered medium-rare) The fried rice was good, but no better than one of those \"fast-food\" places for less than half the price. Over all, I rate Benihana's as just Okay with three stars."}
{"text":"It was a bit tough to write this because the food and the cook was entertaining..but the problem with our experience here was with their time. We had a reservation at 5:15pm. We get their on time. Once there, we were seated and asked what drinks we wanted. Everything was fine so far. Then server asks if we were ready to order, and so we did.   It took 48 minutes until the appetizers arrived! Then the cook comes ten minutes after it! He starts doing his thing and it's entertaining and all but we literally had to wait for over an hour for our food!   I'm not sure about you, but to us, that was incredibly weird and ridiculous. That was the longest I've ever had to wait for food.   But again, the FOOD was great and the cook was actually pretty cool.   I guess just work on..time?"}
{"text":"I rate this as a one star, the server was the bartender and our server during happy hour! How is that a good idea? The presentation of the food was awful. Compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite."}
{"text":"This was just an all around great experience and mainly because our table's chef, Max, was super funny and had great customer service, bug thumbs up to this place!!"}
{"text":"Arlan is the best chef ever . We loved out experience . He was super friendly , we enjoyed our dining experience . I would highly recommend him to everyone that comes here . He was nice and i would come back Just to see him ."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food, service, experience! I have been here more than a few times now and am never disappointed. Sushi chef Vue never disappoints with his surprise creations and the bartender Jimmy is awesome! I need was a big fan before but everything about this place is perfect!! Love the view and the ambiance. Definitely check it out if you have a chance or are in town visiting!!!"}
{"text":"Not good for big parties. They will cram you into tables and leave u no elbow room. We made reservations and it appears it didn't matter since 11 of us got crammed in an 8 seater table.  This lack of space doesn't make it a pleasant experience especially for the amount of $$$ this is going to cost us. Our server is very personable and polite, however."}
{"text":"Decor was fine, people were nice, food was decent. Disappointed by our chef, Carlos...very Asian! ....didn't do many tricks with food and cutlery anywhere near the other chefs. How do you have a Benihana with only one Asian chef?? Only 3 Asian employees seen the whole time actually. Long wait for food also."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 2 about a month in advance for a Tuesday. It was surprising busy so I was grateful having made the reservation. We arrived and waited just a few minutes to be sat.  Unfortunately, they tried fitting us on a corner of an already full table. I am short and petite, but my boyfriend (who was celebrating his birthday) is 6'5 and over 300 pounds. We did not fit well in that corner and felt cramped.  Our waitress was nice, the chef was entertaining and skilled, and the food was delicious (especially for how picky my boyfriend is). The chef cooked everything perfectly. There were times that refills took too long to come through and other random requests because our waitress seemed overwhelmed. Our chef even had to call for her.  We finished off with some ice cream and an acapella version of Happy Birthday (because there were no available singers). We did not get our picture taken nor did our waitress ever come back so I could ask her about it. I was disappointed.  I will come back, as this location is nicer than Scottsdale's, but the service was below average. Please improve!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour just to get someone to cook at my table and there was one other party, last couple times I have been here service was not good, I hope management can get it together sometime soon."}
{"text":"Our chef, Tony was fantastic. He was very creative with his show and had a great personality. If you visit this location, he is a must have as a chef. Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Benihana.  Outside of hearing about in The Wolf of Wall Street and hearing about it in a few movies, I didn't know much about them.  Benihana is all about the performance.  It is surreal to see the chef performing in front of you.  The chefs I have seen have been very entertaining, and it was the most enjoyable aspect of the experience (outside of the main course).    Soup: Their version of Miso soup is meh.  It is a watery miso soup with little fried onion slivers in the bottom of the bowl.  There is also a few green onion pieces in the bowl.  It was disappointing to the say the least.  Salad:  Ack!  This is not a great experience!  The salad is just a hodgepodge of different veggies with a drizzle of their insipid dressing.  It is just this orange/yellow goo.  It is like the people in the back blew their nose into bowl.  I keep forgetting to tell them to hold the salad.  Torture should not be part of my dining experience...  Appetizer:  This is when things start to really pick up.  The hibachi shrimp beyond tasty, and the two sauces really help the experience.  I started to actually enjoy this restaurant.   Fried Rice:  If you order white rice, they will bring it to you from the back.  If you ordered the fried rice, they will prepare it right in front of you.  It is really good, and it is makes elevates the experience seeing it made fresh right in front of you.    Main Course: Will the chef makes the hibachi vegetables, they will do a little show with that.  They will make a little volcano with the white onion.  They will also do a train as well.  It is kind of funny seeing it for the first time.  It really makes you feel like a kid, and the vegetables are great when cooked on the grill.    Both times I went to Benihana, I went with the Hibachi Supreme (Chateaubriand and Lobster) and the Benihana Trio (Filet Mignon, Chicken, Colossal Shrimp in lemon butter).  My wife and I both enjoy the Chateaubriand from Benihana.  It is her favorite in the valley (her all-time favorite is the Chateaubriand from Bern's in Tampa, FL, but no one can really compete with that).  The Benihana trio gives you more food, but the Hibachi Supreme is better tasting.  So, I guess it is a trade-off there.  Dessert: Since I went with their specialty selection, I get a bowl of H√§agen-Dazs ice cream.  There is only three flavors (strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla).  Both times I have been here, I went with chocolate.  My second evening here, they poured chocolate sauce over it.  That was pretty good.  But, it is still just H√§agen-Dazs ice cream that you can buy from the store.  So, it is good, but not great.  Overall, the four stars is over the main course and the appetizer.  The point deduction is mostly from the salad (ack!), and their Miso/Onion soup doesn't set the world on fire.  I will go there, but I would skip their salads.  They are not worth it.  Price: the price for food is lower than what you would pay at Donovan's, Flemings, etc, but it is higher than the typical asian restaurants (it costs a little bit more than P.F. Chang's).  I did not feel cheated, and the quality of the main course and appetizer more than made up for it.    I will definitely go back to Benihana's in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's birthday celebration. The place is located inside Westgate. This restaurant more of like a Teppanyaki type of restaurant. I order myself a shrimp combo. I had to say the service is very slow. It takes them awhile for them to bring out our food and perform the show. The food was okay to me. Nothing that impresses me so I'm not sure if I will be returning back."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful date night dinner! As always it was fantastic! Chef Pablo did a great job cooking for the group. He was very informative to what he was doing and clear and made sure everyone was okay with the steps he took to prepare the food. Jeff was a great server and made sure to always check in on us and see if we needed anything. We started with a California roll, it was perfect! For diner I had got the filet mignon with a cold water lobster it was absolutely stunning! My date had the hibachi chicken she loved it! Over all it was a great dinner and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. More modern than the one near where I live.  Had a good time and everyone was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and polite. The Lychee Blossom cocktail is delicious. Take the chefs recommendations on which foods are paired well with each sauce.  Don't be afraid to ask for more either. Each tepan dinner comes with onion soup, ginger dressing salad, chicken fried rice, hibachi shrimp, zucchini,  onions and mushrooms served with your choice of entree and ice cream for dessert. The chateaubriand, lobster, scallops and filet mignon are all amazing."}
{"text":"Same as it always was, sames as it always was.  To borrow a quote for the Talking Heads, thank you very much.  Fun when you are will a fun crowd.  The chef also helps and ours was cool.  Scott, our white but swears he's the brother of a Japanese chef, was cool.  Prices are high, to be expected with high end meat and seafood.  And yes, we must always upgrade to the chicken fried rice.  I love the ginger sauce over the mustard based sauce.  It has a nice tang and goes well with everything.  Your chef will give you more if you happen to use all of yours over the fried rice as I did.  I recommend going with 8 people.  Take the whole table and take all for yourselves.  I suggest any meat and seafood combo.  i recommend upgrading to the fried rice.  And if you have a whimsical side, get the drink that comes in a ceramic Buhdda.  Cheers."}
{"text":"My son's girlfriend told him that she wanted to eat at a hibachi restaurant.  So I thought what a better place to go then the original, Benihana.  It's been a while since we ate here since other places have opened in the neighborhood.    We made our reservations for 6:30pm and did not get seated until 6:47pm.  No explanation, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even close to being busy.    After being seated our conversation was interrupted by two issues.  One the door to the kitchen squeaks, loudly.  Now you can just imagine how many times during a dinner that door is used.  Buy some WD40 please.  The open hibachi station/seating area next to us was being vacuumed.  Which I found rather ironic since the carpeted hallways that surround the bar were so dirty it made me think about leaving.  All of this compounded by the hostess being more concerned with takeout orders, a manager walking in circles and not doing a thing.   Overall, very dissappointing experience.  There are much better and cleaner options.    I am not commenting on our chef/cook because I could tell he was new and not well trained."}
{"text":"Benihana is my absolute favorite restaurant. Every time I eat here the food is delicious and consistent. I pour that delicious pink sauce (\"yum-yum sauce\") all over everything, I would probably drink it. Although it is pricey, it is great for a date night!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this location and loved it both times. Tony was our cook and he was truly spectacular. He kept everyone at the table engaged and made it a very special night. He was very friendly and you can tell he enjoyed what he did. Thank you Tony!"}
{"text":"While mesmerized by watching my dinner prepared some questions occurred to me.  Does this count as dinner theater?  How much sake can I consume?  Is a beating heart of rice romantic?  Will my wife be distressed because her tofu is where the shrimp was on the grill?  Is it okay to talk with my mouth full when asked a question by the wait staff (he contemplates the answer to this question at all restaurants)?  What is the meaning behind throwing shrimp tails into your hat and front left pocket?  Am I still writing coherently (he'll check later anyway)?  When did my daughter fall asleep on my shoulder?  Is my grandmother-in-law going to pay even though we came for her birthday?  When will the check come?  Answers: definitely, 2/3rd of the bottle, not really, probably, also probably, who knows, also who knows, a little after her bed time but before finishing her homework, she tried, and soon."}
{"text":"I am frequent visitor of benihana but tonight the experience was terrible. The chef was not great. Food was bland. My friend order ed fried rice to go and was told by the manager that she should have told the cook. Since when did placing an order again with the chef is the customers responsibility. Needless to say the kitchen closed and no fried rice. The manager was even worse. He did not show any empathy. Dont go hwre"}
{"text":"Not the Benihana it used to be.  We came in for a birthday dinner and we frankly disappointment with everything except for the service and our chef's entertainment ability. There were items listed on the online menu that were not available and the staff wasn't even familiar with. They won't give half orders of sushi even though the menus lists that they do. The portions are a lot smaller then I remember.   My food was just mediocre. I don't know is that do to the chefs ability or the quality of the food they are working with. Also they apparently only honor their birthday discount program on Mon thru Thurs, which i understand is a normal policy for regular coupons but said birthday was actually on a Friday and they we couldn't use the discount even though we were actually there on the date of the birthday, This is just a bad policy.   I used to really love Benihana would would gladly choose this restaurant over the other Japanese steakhouses that have popped up recently, I don't think i can do so anymore. we had a much better experience at a different restaurant a for a lot less also.  This used to be a slightly more upscale location, now it is not much better then an Applebee's but still have the upscale pricing. I do realize that you are paying for the show as well as the food, but when the food is sub par and the environment is lacking, that pricing just feel like a rip off.  Everything said, the chef was entertaining, the wait staff was great and on top of things, we never had to wait more then a few minutes for anything. they catered to 3 picky kids wonderfully. Which makes it even more disappointing that i cant give a better review."}
{"text":"Took my entire staff here for dinner. This place is HUGE and beautiful as others have said. Food was very good, better than other teppanyaki places I've been to. Our chef was slightly on the boring side, not bad but not good.  Pros: Food was good, it's always fun to watch your food made in front of you. Quality was higher than other teppanyaki places.  Cons: Very pricey and not really worth it except for a celebration or your first time. Our chef was a little boring.  I may eat here again if looking to celebrate or for someone's first time, but won't seek it out."}
{"text":"Starting from the fact that we had to wait 20 twice to be seated, because they wouldn't open table for two of us, to the fact that when I'm paying more then a $100 for my meal I'm expecting to be walked to my table and seated not picked up on the way while walking a group of strangers over and letting us feud for \"good\" seats with others that came later then us. I also would expect my server to speak English. But maybe it's just me.   In addition soups came out cold, food was under salted and tasteless.   On the bright side chief had good sense of humor, but then I was not going to a comedy club.   I'd really suggest taking your business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great experience, nice people! Will be back for sure! Thank you from Las Vegas locals!! Thank you so much to Sachie & Dan our waitress and cook! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Our experience was awesome.  We were entertained, the food was great, and was a great last dinner in Vegas. By far TONY was the best chef of all the Benihana's we have been to. Ee have been to Vegas the last 2 years this is our third. Hopefully a 4th time. If we do we will be going to Benihana's and asking for Tony  ..  Just want to say thank you from Tashia, Betty, Pete, & the Texas Raider fan Juan."}
{"text":"I loved this location, This was my first time at a Benihana and i was pretty impressed the location was beautiful!!! Service was good the only down fall was some jerk that was at the same table as us kept making rude comments. Besides that I loved it and would definitely recommend this place to someone else."}
{"text":"The service was great. The server was funny and patient with the group. The chef was nice and the food was perfect.  Only problem...we have been waiting for almost 2 hours for our checks. We had a group of 8 people (including myself) celebrating a birthday party. Everything was going extremely well until it was time to pay. We were told we had free drinks due to a coupon and we were charged. They said they would take care of it and we sat for another 20 minutes. Then the checks were still messed up and again we are now still waiting. Been here since 6:30pm and planned to be done by or before 9pm due to the food coming out quickly. So we can move on to our next event planned. Now we are all frustrated and ready to go. Oh and they forgot to sing happy birthday to the birthday girl.  Overall server (Alex) and Chef (Hans) thanks for the great meal and service!"}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the best looking Benihana's I've come across (located in Hilton). It's a great place if you want a restaurant that can offer some informal entertainment while eating, the food entrees can feed more than 1 person each (recommend that you share an entree & pay the $10 to have the 2nd person have soup +salad as well).  It's not authentic Japanese, but a fun place for a group."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars~!!!!  I hadn't had tepanyaki/hibachi in forever so when my birthday rolled around & I received a $30 birthday credit I knew where our next date night was going to be at haha I didn't think I had to make a reservation on a Monday night but I made one anyways and I'm glad I did because shortly after we were seated the place got packed! I really loved the ambience of the first floor, very zen... the second floor is where I think most of the hibachi takes place & it is hottttttttt!  If you're going to do tepanyaki be aware that you are going to be sitting next to strangers and basically be sharing a meal with them, it's part of the experience so be friendly and have fun :) We were fortunate enough to sit with a fun group of fellow birthday folks so shout-out to them! LOL  All of the servers here seemed to be older Japanese ladies so there is a little bit of a language barrier at times but be patient with them.. plus if you're nice she may show you a magic trick at the end of the meal! There is also a photographer who goes around taking professional pictures of guests~   The meals start out with the included onion soup & house salad which are both average at best, nothing special. Then the chef comes out and the real fun begins! Going into dinner I already knew that we would be paying more for the show than the actual food so I wasn't expecting much but I thought the food was still tasty! *Hibachi Vegetables include zucchinis, onions & mushrooms~ *Shrimp Appetizer- if you're allergic then you are assed out.. They will grill the shrimp & shellfish last but you don't get any substitute.. However, your dinner date will get an extra serving of your shrimp :) *Teriyaki steak ($29.95) - meat was actually very tender; if you don't like sweet things obviously don't get this.. *Hibachi Lemon Chicken ($25.95) - chicken breast with lemon lol I love lemon so I asked for extra lemon! yum! *Hibachi Chicken Fried Rice ($5.95/pp) - I thought it was just ok.. very buttery! not worth $6! LOL and your meal comes with steamed rice so just save your money and stick with that! *Dessert- Complimentary hot green tea to end the meal and we also got a complimentary ice cream treat for my birthday yay  *Alcohol - we spent almost $40 on 2 Kirins and 2 small hot sakes :X ($9 each) & they don't have large hot sakes :( Next time I think we will just share a Scorpion Bowl \"the 60oz crowd pleaser\" for $25      Our chef, Tuan, was really entertaining and we found him to be very funny but I could see how some people might not find his jokes funny.. But they should get the sticks out of their butts then ;ppp Don't forget to tip your chef when he is done~  When the bill came we had $30 taken off but an 18% auto grat in its place (I guess I didn't read the fine print? lol) so the total came up to $100 + the $10 we gave to Tuan... $110, so it wasn't a super cheap dinner.. Will I be back??? ehhhhhh I think it's more of a once every 3 years kind of thing but definitely something to experience if you haven't already!

{"text":"I go to Benihana's quite often and splurge with happiness and delight but i was very disappointed tonight. I had a reservation for 7:45 and didn't get sat down till 8:15. We finally sat down and it then took 25 minutes to enjoy my odouls. They finally took our order and brought our soup and miso soups. My miso was cold and my salad was hot.... weird right. It's currently 9:34 and we are still waiting for our chef while the table next to us got here after us and their chef is cooking their dinner.   I should have had my wife make me a sandwich"}
{"text":"This was only okay. The experience was not like at similar restaurants back home. The atmosphere wasn't as authentic, and no shrimp sauce!  That in and of itself was the biggest disappointment. The food was pretty good, but not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"IMydaytime lunch reservation was for 12:45 PM. Anytime I make a reservation for just myself I can never seem to get seated with another group but instead have to wait for other walk-ins before they seat me. The weather is nice and it's not his fault... But it's now been 30 minutes and I still don't even have a drink yet., nor placed my order. My suggestion to management is to get enough servers and chefs. Even though I'm not happy at the moment I'm sure I'll still come back."}
{"text":"It's best with close friends, but it's fun to make friends there too! drink sake and beer and eat lots of food!!! Benihana is pretty much the same everywhere."}
{"text":"Edgar the Manager really took care of us , truly went out of his way for us , Thank you Edgar"}
{"text":"First time ever to a Benihana. It didn't impress me much. Went with a group during CES and we all pretty much agreed that the seafood was good but the beef filet was tasteless. I had the lobster, shrimp and scallops and they were all good. Fried rice is not worth the extra cost or calories.  Although the downstairs areas have nice ambience, the upper level is a food factory, noisy and breezy. Service was friendly and efficient. Cook was OK, but his jokes seemed pretty old. Like most of Vegas there was no decent choice of beers."}
{"text":"Let me begin with the fact that I am no stranger to Benihana. I grew up coming to this chain for all my special occasions. Especially since my husband is a picky eater and this is one of the select places he will dine.   This was my first time going to the one in Las Vegas though. It's so beautiful. They stay very true to form with their employees. Problem is most of them hardly speak any English. I was used to one overrun with Hispanic chefs. At this location everyone appeared Asian but many didn't speak any English that I could understand. They were all friendly enough though and the d√©cor is gorgeous.  Our chef this time did a decent amount of tricks but I saw some photos that my friends who went a week or so ago had and they got way cooler tricks. Maybe our chef was new? I had two kids at the table so I really would've preferred some cool stuff. He didn't even try to get the shrimp to be caught in anyones mouth.  My biggest pet peeve though and reason for not giving 5 stars is the fried rice was TERRIBLE . Its my favorite part of benihana and he made it dried out with like no flavor. I felt like I could've gotten better at Panda express. That's saying something FOR SURE :/ Plus we asked for our meat to be cooked Medium Well and Well done and both people that requested it had almost bleeding meat. Yet its Benihana and who wants to be the person at the table complaining about their food?  For $250.00 I feel like there are WAY better places to go to in Vegas. I am just sad since in my old home town this was our GO TO PLACE for awesome :/  My kids did have fun and I will probably be back but I definitely wasn't happy when I left."}
{"text":"Ok let me Start by saying I love this chain , it has many photos to prove I've been there... so I totally believe I know the Benihana vibe... anyway I've been around and this location does not only employ crappy hosts and have bad food which sadly goes with my moms lobster I talked her into getting .....I have Never been to a Benihana with rude ass hostesses like Amber and Nicole who were unwarm and rude and. It left a bad taste .. our waitresS AND CHEF NELSON earned the 2 but the lobster tastes like it was old and had sat out of the fridge never has that ever happened .. anyway Nelson was awesome and caused some redeeming features but over all o say go to Westgate..  If ur wasn't for the hostess I'd go higher but lord I gotta admit they had  me praying"}
{"text":"Ate here with customers the first week of June. I have been to many Hibachi places including other Benihanas, and this one was very middle of the road.  Not bad, not great. Had the steak and shrimp.  All was cooked fine, flavor was ok, but not as good as some I have had.   I like the places that also serve noodles with the main course, and this place did not.  I have nothing bad to report here, nothing outstanding.  It is a solid hibachi restaurant so if that is what you are in the mood for, it will work for you."}
{"text":"I use to love Benihana. Now not so much.  I'm not a big meat eater so today I was really looking forward to having a nice vegetable hibachi meal.  Well they have changed their menu since my last visit.  The only vegetarian menu item was a spicy tofu steak.  So I ordered the yakisoba noodles minus the chicken. Which I was charged the same price for.  My cousin wanted to get the spicy tofu and asked if she can add the same type of veggies that came with my meal and was told no.  She asked for a manager to explain why she couldn't substitute and the manager refused to see her.  I am giving all kudos to our chef Carlos. He was awesome!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Benihana. We didn't go in expecting anything different.  To us, it is a restaurant for specific occasions and we don't expect it to be something it is not.  We were seated right away at our reservation time, our server was excellent and attentive, and our chef, Colton, was very entertaining and seemed to really enjoy his work.  The manager came by and was very nice and friendly.  I can find nothing to complain about.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I love the fried rice and everything else. Never once have I had anything I didn't like or anything that was cooked incorrectly. We had KC as our chef today and he was very interactive and entertaining. Everything was cooked to perfection.    Our reservation was made for 2pm. We got seated at our table at 215 then waited until 230 to get a server. We finally got to order at 245 and finally got soup at 3pm. I don't know why it would take an hour for us to get our food if our reservation was for 2. Now I know to prepare for an hour wait before expecting to eat.    On top of that the rest of our service was horrible. Whoever our server was, was not around. My kids ordered drinks and needed waters but never got any. My boyfriend and I had waters that were empty right after the rice was served until the end of the meal. Never once were we offered a refill. We were a party of 4 and 2 of us ordered the white rice vs the fried. 2 of us ended up with no rice at all because our server never brought the white rice. Then to top it off all four of our meals included ice cream. Our server magically appeared at the end of our meal only to hand us checks. Never got our ice cream either.   The location in Chandler has way better service so I would recommend the drive if you want to eat here. I was not impressed with missing half of our order or waiting for ever to just order."}
{"text":"Well I really can't say that much about Benihana's because i eat here a lot, and it's always the same food that i eat and it's always good so i really can't give a bad or good review about the place. Well i can say is Johnny almost forgot to put the eggs in the fried rice, but that's ok playas mess up sometimes. When i asked for extra garlic butter for my food he gave it to me so i just really can't say anything good or bad about benihana's it's just my favorite hibachi japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"We had Benihana on a Wednesday night with some friends.  Even though it was in the middle of the week the main dining room was nearly full.  I had the benihana special, which is steak and lobster.  The wife had the surf side, which is shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  These meals come with the traditional teppanyaki accompaniments you've seen at other restaurants:  onion soup, salad, tea, dessert.  You got a couple of shrimp for an appetizer, which was a nice touch.  Also, Benihana serves ice cream, which was also welcome.  The meals come with steamed rice, fried rice is an upcharge.  Overall, I was sated, but certainly wasn't blown away.  The shrimp and lobster were probably cooked the best of all of the meats.  Of the surf side, I liked the scallops best.  They retained the buttery texture that makes scallops so great, but weren't overcooked.  My steak was average, maybe a little below average.  I've certainly had better at other teppanyaki joints in town.  The fried rice was decent, but I wouldn't call it \"classic\" as the menu does.  Service was hit and miss.  Our server forgot a drink order once and failed to fill my wife's soft drink for several minutes.  But, she was friendly and apologetic.  The cook was great, he really played the role well and gave us a twist on the classic onion volcano I hadn't seen before.  He was funny and engaging; I think we got a good chef.  Overall, Benihana delivers what it promises, it was a fun evening and we certainly enjoyed ourselves.  But, there are several places in town that you can get better food in a similar setting."}
{"text":"Thank you for great customer care.  Recently we had lunch w/ a 5 year old at the restaurant.  There was a confusion w/ a discount coupon and the staff made it right.  We made an error with the coupon, but the manager made it right with no difficulty.  Oh, the food was great too.  Terrific sampler plater at lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Benihana restaurants all over the world. This one stands out as the best. The decor is amazing. It's a two floor restaurant. Very beautiful. The service was great and the Ford was fantastic. The chef put on a great show and was very original. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I Enjoyed my birthday celebration but I  Was really annoyed that I didn't get the birthday Discount.  We had two birthdays at our table And the waitress said they would taker care of  Us on the discount.  We spent a great amount Of money and are always having birthday  Celebrations there.  I was told one thing and  When the bill came the 30.00 credit wasn't  Accounted for.   You want to make your customers Happy and have them return then take care of  Them and keep your promises.  Hope you find A way to rectify the situation .  You can contact Me at bcashner@hotmail.com"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice! The chicken and shrimp was a little over cooked. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for that! I would return based on the wonderful service received."}
{"text":"the food and atmosphere is very nice. We brought my niece here for her b-day and we had a great time. The steak and lobster with fried rice and miso soup was excellent. The green tea ice cream at the end of dinner was also delicious. The bar has some very good signature drinks and the drink I ordered came with a very cool Buddha shaped drink cup. Very nice and polite staff. We will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Chefs are always amazing and entertaining at Benihana.  It is always a good choice for a special occasion.  Food is great, but $8.00 per serving for an upgrade from white rice to chicken fried rice is very excessive.    Not a great place to grab a quick dinner.  Very expensive."}
{"text":"Came here always for a celebratory meal. The servers were good and the chef comical but adept at his cooking skills."}
{"text":"This is by far the nicest, biggest, most beautiful benihanas restaurant I have been to!  The decor is stunning. You are greeted promptly by a hostess in traditional Japanese attire. The lovely hostess walks you through the stunning main floor of the restaurant to an elevator. You are greeted by another beautiful hostess as you depart the elevator that brings you to your \"table.\"   I love Japanese teppanyaki, and this place knocked it out of the ball park! Loved the food, the service, the food prep show, the wine, and oh did I mention the stunning decor!  Put this place on your vegas dining list for sure!"}
{"text":"I would say the good was okay. I'm my opinion the meat didn't have much flavor, it should've been marinated in something at least. It was my first time for Hibachi though, rice and vegetables were also very flavorless. If you want delicious Teppanyaki I would suggest going to Osaka instead. I have been their twice now and the food is awesome! Maybe it is not as well known as Benihana but I'd rather great food instead."}
{"text":"When you walk in your immediately wowed by the decor.  You are transported to a tranquil spot with bridges and falling water.  Beautiful.  Then you sit down with your party and some strangers at a table and prepare for a show.  There was really a mixed bag this time and this definitely wasn't our first time to this or any other Benihana.   Our waitress was nice and friendly and her service was attentive.  Our Chef however was not the showman that the other tables got to experience or anything like the chefs that we remember.  He was a bit lackluster.   In Las Vegas especially the performance value should be stepped up a bit.  The food was Ok....not bad.  Nothing to rave about for the price of it.  We ordered shrimp, chicken and steak and we all agreed it was OK, but nothing to write home about.  For dessert we shared a cheesecake.  Ehhh, I can make it better myself.  Not sure I would go back next time we are visiting Vegas.  There are too many wonderful restaurant choices out there.  Decor is a 5 and everything else was a two or three."}
{"text":"Wow I have been to This chain in many state. When we walked in we were greeted by the host who told us if we didn't have a reservation we would have to sit in the bar. She just pointed without looking at the bar (the bar is not visible from the hostess station). Our servers were two girls. I am not sure if one was training or not. But our service was horrible. The food was not good either. This restaurant can be expensive, so when the food quality is bad it is no longer worth the visit. By the way I work in the service industry for tips, so judging by the attitude and arrogance we were meet with our service staff they should not have made much money."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this resturant chain for 25+ years.  The experience is always good and food quality is always great. Tonight was no different! Tonight, I am writing to commend my server. Katie (Kathleen) was a rock star. Very attentive, we had a late seating before closing. We were treated like we were the first table of the night.  Thank you for great service! You dud a great job. Cheers"}
{"text":"Party of 3 went for a Birthday celebration. Started off with getting the drink order wrong, to be followed by one guest not receiving her white rice with her order after all the food was served. Asked chef twice, he replied maybe tomorrow.  Chef never entertained or interacted at our table. Food was good, very expensive. We left feeling like that could have been anywhere, not a special place or memorable experience. Disappointed due to the lack of effort-"}
{"text":"I brought my mom and husband here to celebrate Mother's Day/my mom's birthday. We had a wonderful experience! Kay was our waitress, and she was very attentive and kind. We had accidentally forgotten my mom's ID for her birthday coupon, and Kay was nice enough to talk to the manager about it, to make the coupon valid regardless. It meant a lot to us and made the night great. The food was excellent (as always). If you're new to Benihana you HAVE to order the fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the chef was great also. A little pricey for dinner but we enjoyed it all. Portions are a little small but the salad and other sides will fill you up."}
{"text":"I had to struggle to justify my two-star rating, but my vegetables were okay and there was also plenty of parking...  yeah, that's how horrible this place was.  My group had reservations for a Sunday at 12:30.  We had 9 people, so we took up an entire table to ourselves. The service was painfully slow from this point on.  We saw our waiter in 15 minute intervals, and he would always rush off before making sure we had everything we needed.  And this was BEFORE the chef even started cooking.  We didn't even see our chef until 1:20... almost an entire hour of waiting at the table!  Soup and salad doesn't take THAT long to eat......   Benihana used butter and soy sauce as their two flavorings.  Everything tasted the exact same and was so, so plain.  I was hoping for more of a teriyaki flavor for at least my chicken.  Also, the dipping sauces aren't good either, so you're basically stuck with really bland food that's been drenched in butter.   Also, if you have kids, they probably will be underwhelmed as well. This place is no-frills due to a few lawsuits (that is what our chef said).  What fun is teppanyaki without FIRE?! The only \"trick\" they do is an onion train thing.    There are better, locally owned teppanyaki restaurants in town.  We definitely won't ever be back...ever."}
{"text":"The food is good, the cook was very nice too, but in the front desk lady was not polite it looks they don't like Hispanics the manager was also Rude, so there was no one  to complaint"}
{"text":"Everything about it was so wrong.  Don't waste your time or money here, it is very disappointing.    WAIT TIME:  We went for our daughter's 18th birthday mid-week.  The greeter knew this was for a special occasion.  We waited over an hour.  We even opted for the cook table for a faster seating, only to be offered to be seated at a tiny side bar with 4 chairs in a row near the prep area which we declined and continued to wait over 45 minutes more.    STAFF:  The entire staff seems very young and/or inexperienced, not apologetic or accommodating in any way.  I asked to speak to the manager and had to wait 20 minutes to talk to him.  After speaking to him he told me where I could wait- I had been present at the bar enjoying a beer after waiting for over an hour.  Rude.    FORGOTTEN ORDER:  The server forgot the order for my husband, so he waited with an empty plate most of the night until we had to say something to the chef.   If you see an empty plate in front of someone you are serving, would the chef or the waitstaff not be attentive enough to ask what that person ordered?    APPETIZER:  I ordered a dumpling at the bar when I was waiting there.  It was nothing special, we get the same kind at Sam's Club, frozen.   THE SOUP:  Very skimpy on ingredients.  Only some very thin green onion slices and one slice of mushroom.  Nothing special, tasted of water and soy sauce, that's about it.   The other party at our table asked for additional mushrooms.  Good for them and they were raw, the chef didn't offer to soften them. .   THE SALAD:  I enjoyed the Asian dressing.  This was okay.  It's kind of hard to mess up salad.  THE CHEF:  Seemed up tight.  He spent most of his time on the fried rice.  We ordered white rice and when ours came, it was colder than cold.    I ordered scallops, the menu said they were the sea variety which you expect to be large sized.  When they came they were on the small side, more like the bay variety.  No seasonings were put on these scallops and I had to ask the chef to please give me some onions.  He had served the scallops to me without anything else on my plate.   After 2 hours of waiting.  I would prefer to have the entire meal ready at the same time, promptly and correctly.   This was well after 8 p.m. by now.   UNDERCOOKED:  The zucchini was not well cooked, on the hard side.  He could have taken some time to steam it to soften it better, but all he did was fry it, which does not make for tender zucchini at all.  My husband ate most of this off my plate, as his plate was still empty.  He did not seem very into his cooking at all.  If you have ever tasted undercooked zucchini you know it is on the sour and rubbery side.  Yuck.  When things are prepared with a good attitude and with attention and care, they are a whole lot better in taste.  The chef dropped some of the utensils on the floor towards the end, he was very not into his craft.       REFILLS:  I could not get a refill of water and after all the salty soy water soup, I could have used it.  The server was not around much to check this for me.    SUMMARY:  Did I think this was worth it for a bowl of cold rice, rice water, a few tiny seared scallops, with 2 bites of hard zucchini and mostly a plate of caramelized onions?  What a rip off.  I should have stayed home!  The server tried to make up for his oversight with extra bowls of green tea ice cream.  Our daughter loves it, but I didn't care for the taste at all and neither did my husband.  So my daughter made out with 3 bowls; she does enjoy it.      CLEANLINESS:  The bathroom:  Yuck!  Trash on floor.  Dirty floors.    I won't be back anytime soon.   Zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"So amazing! I've been to Benihana a few dozen times throughout my life and it's consistently a great experience. - My favorite thing about Benihana is probably the fact that you get to taste so many different things! Soup, salad, rice/fried rice, grilled onions, grilled zucchini, grilled shrimp, and finally, your entree. - I also love watching them prepare the food. Sitting there drooling over the food for a while as it's being prepared makes it taste that much better when it's finally ready. Not to mention that it's entertaining! Every time I've eaten there the chefs are fun, personable, and impressive. - The food is always fantastic. Most dishes are pretty standard, nothing too creative, but they're well executed. - They give you $30 off for your birthday! How could anyone not take advantage of that?"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Benihana and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  We went on a Friday evening, and our wait was about 10 minutes for a table. I was in a party of 4, and 2 other couples were seated with us at the Hibachi Grill. I ordered the Philadelphia Roll, Rainbow Roll and shrimp tempura Hand Roll, as well as a Bottle of Sake. The sake was delicious and had a hint of nutmeg and apple peels. My sushi came out timely before the rest of the tables food was beginning to be prepared so we passed the sushi around for everyone to taste. The cream cheese in the Philadelphia rolls was scrumptious. Our chef Christian was entertaining and funny, he did the volcano trick and the shrimp tail in the hat and pocket trick and recieved plenty of \"ooh\" and \"aahs\" from me and the others. I was rather impressed with how fresh the food was and how nutritiously \"clean\" the food was prepared. For a party of 4 including drinks and appetizers our bill came to only $107.  I would love to go to Benihana anytime, especially if someone else pays."}
{"text":"Benihana.... I think I enjoyed this place when I was younger but the food and drinks were not that great. The food was very bland and the drinks tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. Our bill was definitely not worth the quality of the food or the service I received. Very disappointed in such a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"If i could put 0 as a review i could. The waiters constantly take smoke breaks, over priced food with small ratios, food took to long. Only thing good was the chefs skills. Not the food but the tricks he performed. Still not worth the money though. Go somewhere else like flemings steak house or even ghengis grill, wayyy better food."}
{"text":"I have a friend who goes all the time to Benihana as it's her favorite place and I wanted to know what's so special. They do a $30 GC for your birthday if you sign up to their email so the BF and I decided to go.   When you enter, there is this dark \"garden\" they lead you through that is just beautiful. There is a lounge over looking it and there are seating areas and sushi bars around it but oddly none of it is being used..perhaps not on weekdays?. They lead us up an elevator to a teppan room that is pretty ordinary comparatively to the ambiance of downstairs so ambiance was a bit wasted.   They start you off with getting you out a soup, a salad with ginger miso dressing. They hand you 2 different sauces (hot sauce on request), cook zucchini and onions, shrimp appetizer and seafood items, then fried rice (extra. steam rice is what comes with your food), meat entrees and the guy did some mushrooms.I had the scallops, calamari, shrimps and BF got shrimp and chicken. Our food was cooked nicely, but it wasn't particularly special. The sauces were just okay, they needed more punch, it's just a bit bland and runny.   They have a efficient little planned out show and then the guy was gone. I was barely getting into our food and the guy just packed off and left. I was glancing at another table that just started their show and it was almost the same thing.  Service from the server helping the teppan guy was very personable and attentive though. Definitely top notch service and he even gave us some green tea ice cream and chatted with us a bit after dinner. I will give them that- excellent service. However, a bit sad that the server was more memorable than the teppan show!   I can't help compare them to Musashi, a local teppan place I've had great experiences at over and over. There is so much more they offer there and that really overshadowed my experience at Benihana. The show is lengthier, a bit more complex tricks, the jokes and stories are fantastic and each teppan person has their own unique style, a bit cheaper in price with a really awesome fried rice included, soup, salad, veggies and plenty of different flavorful sauces freshly made in front of you.   Glad I tried it, but will not be back. Even with the $30 birthday discount the bill was $70+ for two plus the tip. I went to Musashi a few months ago and spent $70 for two including a hefty tip! I had way more fun and better food.   Um yeah. This feels like a no brainer to where I'll be going to the next time I want a teppan experience to bring visiting friends and family to."}
{"text":"Bryan was our waiter. Marlon was our cook. Both were excellent. Both very funny very entertaining. I was always told you shouldn't play with your food before you eat it but we made an exception for Marlon. He put on a great show. It was allot of good food for the price. The green tea ice cream at the end was awesome. Met allot of nice people around the  table. I love talking to new people so this was awesome. Definitely recommend! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I did not listen to all the negative reviews!!! My husband and I ate there tonight, it was GREAT!!!! I had the filet, it was so tender. The chef was amazing, our server was fantastic!!I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight. Had 6:30p reservations for my son's birthday dinner and after waiting 20 minutes we asked for an update as to when we would be seated. Their response was, \"We're not sure.  There are 2 parties ahead of you...could be an hour.\"  We promptly left."}
{"text":"Jeff was an awesome chef! They got us in right away. The food was amazing as usual! Shizuka was so sweet and so accommodating! What an amazing person she is!! Had a blast! 5 stars all the way! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of Benihana normally but the cook at this particular location the night we went was awesome. He was clever, funny and had plenty of tricks up his sleeve. Sadly, we got stuck at a table with a bunch of rude, hungover and complaining college kids. It took everything in me not to reach over and smack them haha. I felt bad for our cook having to deal with them but he made the best of it and didn't let them faze him. I wish I could remember his name! The location itself is terrible. Inside the LVH (formerly the Hilton), a place that has absolutely no reason for anyone to visit other than possibly going to Benihana. I feel like they would do so much better if they moved to the strip. It's a pretty wild atmosphere when you walk in downstairs with a waterfall and everything. Got us excited until they bring you upstairs to this small boring room where you actually eat. The server was friendly and the food was typical Benihana quality. Only reason we go here is because of the $30 Birthday gift card they send out. It's very cool that they do that!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with good things first! The ambience itself is mesmerizing and it makes you feel like you are transported in some Japanese ancient town! Interior is precious! Now after hostess seats your group at the table, you end up watching chef's show for at least 30 minutes on the opposite side of the table! Finally after a while waitress brings you drinks! Now menu itself is confusing cause you have no clue what you getting for enlisted price. So let's say you have figured out how anything works you finally place an order! CAUTION: Do NOT go there hungry, you might get tempted to steal food from across the table, cause the waiting time is soooo long. I ordered steak and salad with steamed rice and so salad comes first, absolutely tasteless and then you get after another 15 minutes steamed rice, and then after half a century you get your steak and so overall besides little show that chef puts on you do not get what you paid for! All combined is what Panda Express would get you for $10! Not returning for sure! I'm giving 5 star for ambience and skilled chef! Food is half a star! All combined 3 star and I've been generous!"}
{"text":"I've been to Benihana and other teppanyaki places before. This one sucked.   I decided it would be fun to suprise my five year old daughter with a new experience - Benihana's! I talked up the place all the way there - they will cook the food in front of us and do tricks - you won't beleive it! Her eyes were so big as we walked in and I couldn't wait to see her amazement at the show and food.   I was shocked to see that the kid's chicken lunch was $11 and my chicken and shrimp was $15 on the lunch menu. The entire meal (no alcohol included) was $40. There are so many more affordable tasty options in this area! What a waste!!!  Now, part of the bad experience was not entirely the restaurant's fault. There were three spooky teenage boys at our table that were looking for trouble. They were yelling at the staff and being very rude. Part of my review of two stars is because the restaurant never asked them to quiet down or leave. They were yelling at the poor lady that made our food thru the entire meal, \"cook it all the way thru. don't put any spices on it. don't burn it!\" Then, every few minutes, they would go stand behind people at other tables to watch how their food was prepared. Every protective bone in my body was on guard with these little punks. Why wouldn't the restaurant ask them to leave?  SO, the lady that did the tricks was very underwhelming. I am not sure if she was always this way, or just this way because of the spooky boys at our table. Either way, it was a terrible experience and I will not go back there."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This place wavers between 3.5 and 4 stars, depending on who's doing the cooking.  In the world of teppanyaki, this place is definitely better than Kobe in Tempe, but it is not as good as Tanaka of Tokyo in Hawai'i (although the wait there, even with a reservation, can be ridiculous.)  My wife and I come here twice a year, every year, for our birthdays.  (Free $30 when you sign up for their e-club.)  Occasionally we'll bring a guest who wants to go.  The quality really does depend on the chef that day, so the quality can be uneven.  We don't come for the \"show\" anymore, seen too many.  But if you have kids, they will enjoy it.  You don't come for an amazing steak.  You come to get a decent sized meal and a serviceable steak for around $32.  We will say, the chicken fried rice is typically amazing, you just have to ask them to really go heavy on the garlic butter.  Even with a reservation, the most we've waited is 20 mins.  We've also been seated immediately, it all depends on where the chefs are at in their table rotation.  Service has been fine for us, though the staff typically looks like they're running around to cover all their tables.    Like I said, you're not coming for a phenomenal meal, and without the free $30, I'm not sure I'd go so high as to give 4 stars, but as it stands, it's a decent steak and sides with great fried rice for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very clean place with friendly service. Celebrated our birthday and they gave us a picture and ice cream. I ordered the scallops they were delicious.   I will choose steak and lobster the next time. My friend had that and it looked amazing."}
{"text":"One of the LEAST entertaining dining experience... I could've cooked a better meal in my own kitchen.   Our \"chef\" was such a rookie...  while making chicken fried rice, he forgot to add eggs and the rice flew everywhere.  Next up was the lobster, oh mine, it was soooo over-cooked and tasted rubbery.  Last up was the steak, again, totally over cooked and over seasoned.  Last but not least, we didn't even get an onion-volcano!   Such a forgetful dining experience!  Don't bother coming here if you are looking for something special."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night, the staff was very friendly but we had a really long wait for the teppanyaki chef. It was kind of a bummer. The manager came over, apologized and offered the table free edamame. I'm not sure if they had more parties come then expected or what but it was really nice that the manager went out of his way to try to make us feel comfortable.  The food was delicious! I highly recommend the fillet, calamari or scallops. I tasted some of the Chateaubriand and in my opinion the fillet was just as flavorful and tender."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a weekday. Sat at the bar.  Service was mediocre. Had to ask to have my iced tea refilled, not a huge deal but part of what I expect from good service. Had to wait 10 minutes for her to come pick up my check.   I ordered the Sushi Deluxe meal which was 21.99. Came with some nigiri, tuna roll, soup, and salad. The miso soup was okay, nothing special, but I wasn't disappointed. Salad was really good, tasted fresh, good flavor on the dressing. The nigiri was terrible. Came with 8 different pieces. Some pieces almost tasted spoiled to me. Few things worse than gross sushi to me. The fish just looked cheap and sloppy. The tuna roll was the same thing, the quality of fish just ruined it.   25 bucks on lunch isn't too common, so I expected a high quality lunch. Left with a bad fish taste in my mouth. Not cool bro"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at this location and had best service, meal and experience yet.  In my quest to eat a more plant based diet they were very accommodating for a vegan dinner.  Wine selection is huge.  Our service was excellent and our chef was fun.  My kids really enjoyed and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The waiter at frontdoor are two bitches... I think they delayed our table for no reasons"}
{"text":"From the east coast and have wanted to try out Benihana for a while. I know this was in a resort but I went against my better judgement. 1) Hostess in front did not offer for us to await our party inside the restaurant. 2) Chef was painfully slow and looked like he was either ready to go home or retire. 3) I had to pay an extra $8 to have my \"hibachi\" rice fried!!!. I've been to numerous hibachi grills in my life and this was a first. How is fried rice not the standard?! 4) Rice was bland (even the fried rice), Meat was bland and vegetables were so so. 5) Even more overpriced than expected and portions were small. Disappointed with this one. Gotta do better. The only good thing about this place was the decor which was nice."}
{"text":"Probably the coolest Benihana I've been to. It's a shame they're not closer to the strip, otherwise I'd eat there every day while I'm on my trip.  The ambiance and atmosphere of this location is far more extraordinary compared to others. They have a huge bar, & dining area that makes you feel like you're seated outside underneath the stars.  Keep an eye out for their elevator inside, it'll come in handy after you stuff your face, & wash it down with some hot sake (stairs might be a little too risky). Awesome spot, wish the San Diego location was like this one."}
{"text":"Taylor was more then you could ask for.  It was my son's birthday and he made it more than fun!  The food was excellent and cooked to perfection.  The show that taylor put on was perfect!  I recommend this Benihana to anyone. I have been to it 3 times now and enjoyed each visit."}
{"text":"Make sure you use open table to make a reservation or u will be waiting for an eternity!!! Surprisingly family friendly!! If you have a large group that can fill a typical table of 8 then your good they really make the experience all about you guys. Make sure your group is open to trying different things as well. No fun if EVERYONE get's the Chicken & Steak!!!   I know the setup is the same  but it somewhat hinders on having full table conversation or interaction to me. A bit pricey in my mind but still a good experience. I would only return with a group of 6 or more who are my close friends & cool with sharing!"}
{"text":"I am sad to say that this place has totally gone down the tubes since they changed management and employees. Benihana used to be my favorite restaurant. The cooks are average at best, the sauces/dressing (which were a major selling point of the place) are hit or miss. The salad dressing was so watered down, I couldn't eat it and the shrimp sauce (yum yum sauce) is no longer good.  The place is packed at night and if you sit at the front tables, people are standing behind you while you eat as they wait to be seated. Very annoying.  The experience is no longer special. Dinner prices are not worth the food, service or atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant has now adopted a policy in which the birthday coupon they email you has to be printed. It cannot be scanned anymore. This was not informed to us when we called in and asked and they were not accommodating at all. They said the only option was to drive to a kinkos. What a disappointment. My family and friends will find better options. I would advise to others to do so as well."}
{"text":"The food was on par to what I expected.  Great service with great food.  Similar to Sapporo in quality. Good for bdays.   You can set about 9 at table."}
{"text":"So I love, love, love Benihana's and this one was great as well.  The service was good, the chef was funny and the food is ALWAYS on point.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"So we thought this was going to be a bad experience because it took 15 minutes after our reservation to her seated.  It also looks dead from the outside because the sushi restaurant isn't very busy.  HOWEVER it was packed inside!  The food was very good, and our chef Rolly made the whole experience amazing.  If it wasn't for the fact that making a reservation seemed pointless this would be a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Alright so Benihana is definitely viewed as the king of hibachi chain serving up entertainingly prepared dishes.  As a local I stay clear away from the strip unless we have guests in town and well based on my yelp reviews, MY HOME IS ALWAYS FILLED WITH VISITORS. So as the hostess with the mostest I decided to try Benihana again and ditch Giesha House or Ohjah (my normal go-to's) I must admit I forgot what to expect because from here because I've avoided going to the run down original location at Westgate (last time I went it was called the Hilton).  Our chef was Hans and well the food tasted great. The quality of food was delicious and onion soup was amazing! I must note the lobster was cooked to perfection and not rubbery like I've had at our places. As for our chef, he definitely lacked the entertainment of your normal hibachi dinner don't get me wrong the fried rice heart beat was beating and the volcano was there but the personality and humor was cooked right out of our chef tonight. So we lived vicariously through our neighbors table who's laughs echoed throughout restaurant.   Any who, the scenery amongst the restaurant is beautiful and the location is right next to Sugar Factory right across from the Wynn. My family and I walked off our calories across the bridge to the mini wannabe Bellagio fountain at the Wynn and listened to some old school Frank Sinatra! What a \"Wynn\"!"}
{"text":"You're paying for the location and show. The food as always is a bit meh and the portions always leaving you wanting just a bit more.  For the price on the strip you can definitely do better food wise, but if you find yourself at Westgate and need some Asian food in your life, you might just meander into the good old Benihana.  If you're with a larger group it makes sense and the location definitely is spacious and leaves no stone unturned, but otherwise you know what to expect here. Check it out if you must, but really I would most likely avoid."}
{"text":"It was our first time every eating at Benihana. It was my boyfriend's birthday so he had a $30 birthday certificate.  We had a reservation at 7:30 and were seated before that. We were placed with the best people to sit with because everyone at our table was SO welcoming, polite and friendly. It wasn't awkward at all and really made our experience that much more fun.   I can't remember the name of the chef cooking our food but he was outstanding! He was funny, charming and made GREAT food. They made sure to recognize my boyfriend's birthday and treated him to his choice of ice cream to end the night.   When we return to Vegas we will be sure to come by here again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Benihana for the past 4 years and enjoy every bit of it! I have dietary restrictions as of recent and Benihana has been more than accommodating to them. I cannot have garlic or onion anymore and tonight the chef prepared my food separately for me but still gave me the in person cooking experience. I received a different soup, different salad dressing, and separate rice that did not have the garlic butter. He kept asking questions to make sure that the way he was preparing everyone else's would be okay with me (ie, is it okay that he cook the onions for everyone else near my food, can I have scallions instead of onion, etc). It was nice not feeling left out. If you want to go to Benihana, I recommend getting there at 5. We made reservations at 5 and didn't get out until 7:30! Plus, if you get there early it is less crowded."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Our chef was very fun and entertained our 4kids. The filet was amazing and cooked perfectly. The chicken was juicy. We will come back when we are in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I've frequented Benihana at the older location (Westgate Hotel) and my friend decided she wanted to celebrate her birthday at this location. Once we were seated, everything went downhill, the teppanyaki chef was obviously new which is no problem... however he cracked the egg and got shells all in the rice and continued to serve it to our group. He mistakenly gave my friends selection to another patron as well. Lastly, this location evidently decreased the portion sizes but still continue to charge 30+ for a meal which is ridiculous.... oh you also have to pay for extra sauces aside from soy.....which I've never heard of. Doubt I'll be back, this location is more so catered to tourists who just want the experience!"}
{"text":"Worst service in Las Vegas! No attention from cocktail waitress for an hour. Waited 45 minutes for sushi. People came in after us and got their sushi before us. Rude hosts. Never going back."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero I would. Every other Benihana is amazing but this place treated us bad.  We didn't have reservations and were told that the wait time would be an hour and a half at the max. We noticed during that time, people with reservations hadn't shown up or checked in, yet they'd still call them.   Thinking we'd be called next.  After 40 minutes we checked back in and were told that we have only waited 40 of the 90 minutes. They had six open tables and only the walk ins waiting.   I would understand this type of reservation based seating at a high end place in Scottsdale but in chandler, come on! I called the manager and complained but he stated that they need to plan an hour and a half ahead and that's why they keep the tables empty. I guess I didn't understand the Benihana seating plan.   my advice is to make reservations and only show up with reservations, otherwise you'll leave pretty pissed just like me. We will never come back to the Benihana in chandler, Scottsdale is where it's at! They understand how to seat people."}
{"text":"We go here for special occasions since we can only afford special occasions here. I must say the lunch specials aren't bad and you get good portion. The chefs do the same grill schtick (an onion as a train!! Stop!) but kids always love that. (I kind of like when a trick goes awry and a shrimp tale lands in someone's drink)  Not a bad place to avoid the ordinary."}
{"text":"First of all, I grew up coming to the original Samurai which then became Benihana. My family always loved it, but this past visit was my last. Came a couple years ago and vowed that as my last since it was horrible but decided to give it one more shot. Absolutely horrible. We actually left without even having dinner. It was a Wednesday night, maybe a handful of hibachi tables full, but we sat in the bar area to have a faster meal. Maybe two other tables besides us. We waited at least a half hour for our soups and salads. We complained and waitress said they were backed up in the kitchen?? From what!? Anyway, we waited another half hour (now there a full hour) and finally got our yum yum sauce which was absolutely awful. Literally tasted like salt. A woman next to us was complaining that she waited over an hour and her food was cold and tasted terrible, she called manager over and we decided that we weren't going to wait or pay a ridiculous amount of money for terrible service and food. We left the waitress a tip and left. We let the manager know and he really didn't even argue it, he didn't seem to care a whole lot, our waitress was fine but tried to get us to stay saying the food was on its way. Unfortunately we had already made our minds up.   I'm sorry but it wasn't busy at all, to wait over an hour for dinner is just ridiculous. Will not be back. It's a shame, but there is too much competition now in Cleveland with way way better food quality and service."}
{"text":"Bomb service! Our chef Kyle was great, cooked us a delicious meal perfectly with a friendly conversation. Made us feel very welcomed with great conversation and impressive show.   We came for lunch on a Friday, for the $16 Lunch duo. Your choice of two items, which comes with soup and vegetable fried rice. I totally recommend the yakisoba and calamari!  On a Friday @ 12 pm it was very slow so we had the whole table for our party of four. Very clean and modern located in Fashion Show mall on the strip side, easy access to the restaurant. The closest parking is at Fashion Show, right underneath the mall.    This place is great for a cheaper lunch meal on the strip, great choices and food with a show."}
{"text":"Although the food was good and the chef nice and talented the waitress made too many mistakes with our order. We asked to share one Rocky but she said it was for one person so we changed it to two Rocky's. She submitted only one to the kitchen and when the chef came out he questioned the ticket saying two and quickly went and grabbed the additional meat. That's fine except that we did not get the other stuff that comes with it, rice, soup, salad, vegies, shrimp etc. only double meat and full price. Not good. The other thing that was not good was some young twenty something year old and her boyfriend thinking it's ok to stuff your new puppy in your Coach handbag and sit down to a dinner table. NO, it was not a medical issue puppy, it was just a pug puppy. Completely unacceptable behavior. The manager saw the puppy and did nothing. If I wanted to sit down and eat with dogs I would go to the park not to a somewhat fancy restaurant. There were several other mistakes with our food but it did taste good."}
{"text":"Love that garlic butter! Went here tonight and was good as always.  They make it fun for the kids and keep them entertained the whole way through"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a blast at Benihana on a recent visit!  I'm sure we could have found better Asian food in Scottsdale (especially the sushi) but you really go to Benihana for the show.  The chef at our table was great and actually was able to get all of food on our plate, even the stuff he threw.  You can't go wrong with the Tepanyaki anything (and it's a great place to go if you're doing a protein diet).  As for the sushi--ehh--go somewhere else for that.  We all left laughing and happily stuffed.  They're opening a location in Chandler soon, too!"}
{"text":"Our awesome chef did an amazing job entertaining and cooking for us.  We were a big group and the kids were seated at the far side of the hibachi grill, so we adults were pretty distracted, but he still kept our attention and the food was truly delicious!   My sushi took a bit longer, but the servers kept me informed, which I appreciated.    Kids loved it, as expected. The show never gets old for us, no matter how often we have been to a similar type place.  And the food was done perfectly.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Delicious. Standard Benihana food, but everything was cooked PERFECTLY.  I ordered Steak & Shrimp- Steak was great, shrimp was ok (appetizer shrimp was better).  Tasted my friends Scallops- YUM!   Can accommodate groups of 10-12 by putting two tables across from each other."}
{"text":"We had Shizuka, the waitress, and Sam, the cook, and our service was awesome and Sam cooked our food quickly. We were seated with a family with many children and Sam and Shizuka made sure the children were always happy and well fed. We were very impressed with how these to were able keep all everyone entertained and well fed during a busy holiday rush.   If you can get these two for service, I would recommend going."}
{"text":"Here on New Year's Day eating next to a massive dehumidifier in the middle of the restaurant. We arrived for an early lunch and it took us 20 minutes to be seated as the restaurant was still being set up. While it used to be nice, our chef told us the chicken was Tyson's brand from walmart ... ew. Restaurant needs updating with a serious investment in better ingredients. I remember this place as delicious and a treat. Now it's a boring show of spatula flipping with bland food and sub par shrimp sauce to boot. Sad! Don't go here ... head to Otani instead."}
{"text":"**LAS VEGAS LOCALS!!  At the end of your meal here, present your Nevada ID and your LVH players card to receive 25% off your meal!! I've been doing this for YEARS..since it was the Hilton with the \"Hometown Hotspot\" sticker.**  Benihana is my favorite \"fancy\" restaurant.  I usually only make it here once a year, for my birthday, as the prices are a little high, but...I love it here.  I've never had bad service, and I've never had bad food.  My favorite is the filet and lobster.    I love the ginger dipping sauce...I usually end up with 3 or 4 of them...dump one over your steamed white rice, I promise, its orgasmic.   My only complaint is that the last few times I've been there, they haven't had the ginger ice cream anymore, and that was my favorite.  I recommend it, highly. :D"}
{"text":"This was my first encounter with this type of experience.  My relationship with Southeast Asian food, or the culture hasn't exactly been the best either.  My experience at this Benihana was definitely a great one, and I will be coming back.  This restaurant was excellent in my opinion.  The bathrooms were as clean as the rest of the restaurant.  Our service and food were excellent, I don't really like Southeast Asian food but this was amazing.  Having it prepared right in front of us was definitely a treat.  The price was very reasonable as well, we have gotten away from other lesser quality restaurants with a bigger bill.  I ordered the Chicken Yakisoba, which was the most familiar thing for me on the menu, and was great.  The chef made us little 'appetizers' as we watched so we would not get hungry while waiting.    The manager kept around us making sure we had the best experience we could.  For that I thank him, my family and I really enjoyed Benihana.  The food, service, cleanliness, and even price were all reasonable/exceptional.  We also didn't have to get all dressed up to go out for lunch either.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food was good but have to say we were very disappointed in the presentation.  The chef did not do any of the fun gimmicks that we are use to at Benihana.  There was no flipping of the shrimp tail or any of the other fun things they usually do.  He did make a poor attempt at a train with the onion rings but it was nothing.  The show is half the reason we come to this place."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. We showed up and waited an hour which was the allotted time they gave us. So we inquired and they said another 15 to 20 minutes. Which we again waited. We inquired again and we're told 15 to 20 minutes. Not sure who they think they think has 2 hours to wait to be seated but at least be honest with your customers. Doubling your wait time is unacceptable for a fast food place little lone a $40.00 place"}
{"text":"It is pointless to even consider going to this place as they do not really accommodate anyone without a reservation.  They really have lost all sense of customer service. Even the most busy place in Vegas works hard to serve the customer. This is sad and unfortunate. I personally feel that their management is terrible and impersonal. A once great place to go and eat is now ruined by poor management.  So very unfortunate. I would really recommend spending your hard earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"If i could rate a 0 I would. My wife and I dined in and sat there and waited for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. I had to get up and ask who was in charge of the area where i was sitting. The woman came and brought us water took our order and left to not be seen again for 15-20 min. The sushi rolls were bland and flavorless. We only went there because someone gave us a giftcard to that place...thank goodness it was free, I would never pay to eat at that dump. Please dont waste your money, there are better options."}
{"text":"Benihana is good, yes, but it is not updated as other hibachi restaurants. The furnishings, carpet, set up hasn't changed in years and the staff/food isn't always up to par. I can eat Paleo here though, which was a new discovery. I've always appreciated sushi, but I never ordered it raw without the fun additions of tempura, sesame seeds, soy sauce, cream cheese, and everything else that makes sushi AWESOME, so this was a new experience. I ordered the Tuna Tatiki, which was 10 chunks of raw tuna. I ordered it without sauce or seeds. It was a little tough to get down because there were so many pieces and after a couple raw pieces, I needed some extra searing, which they did for me no problem! The server was wonderful- she was helpful and had no problem going to extra mile for someone with diet restrictions! I was very happy about this because the last time we sat in the bar, our waiter was really odd. He didn't explain the foods and extra charges (our waiter last night did) and he seemed like we were bothering him. I was happy to have a better experience last night, but I do think that Benihana needs to monitor their staff better. I had negative experiences twice related to incompetent staff, which really made my overall feeling of Benihana go from positive to neutral. Not to mention, the last time I was there, perhaps because we got hibachi at the bar, but it was not very good at all, and I got the most expensive dinner on the menu: \"Ocean's Treasure.\" More recently when I visited Benihana though (the same time I got the raw tuna), I had a better experience- I ordered salmon and yellowtail sashimi. I was very nervous to bite into a raw cut of fish by itself, but was pleasantly surprised at how good the cuts of fish were. The yellowtail had a sweeter taste and the salmon was less sweet, but more flavorful. It was a great to jump outside of my comfort zone and appreciate the rawest of the raw food! I would definitely recommend Benihana due to its location- I love that it is on a hill all to itself, and it's unique mark in Pittsburgh, but I would choose other hibachi restaurants before I would choose this one."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night with a group of 18 people. They gave us tables next to each other, the food was great, and our chef was amusing and fun. This was a great experience and good value for your money. A great evening. Will tell my friends and cannot wait to come again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge supporter of locally owned restaurants! However, this is something I have always wanted to try, and on Christmas night in Las Vegas I got my chance. Located inside the Hilton is likely the largest Benihana ever built. The atmosphere is like dining outdoors in Japan!  Everyone from the seating hostess, and table waitresses, to our hilarious personal chef were warm and welcoming. You also get the pleasure of dining with other people, which added to the excitement.  This was my first  teppanyaki experience and I loved it.   The food was fresh and savory. My steak and shrimp were amazing, and my friend's Swordfish was the best I've tasted! ...oh, and the starter soup is simply AWESOME!  The food and the \"show\" were something to remember. Highly recommend you give this a try! I am definitely going to give my local Scottsdale location a shot!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but this was ridiculous. My fianc√© and I have one night a week where we don't have our children and we decided to spend it at this location. The table that we sat at had an employee who was off work that day, and her boyfriend who was celebrating his birthday. To start off, the boyfriend had his tire slashed in the parking lot apparently by an employee of Benihana over some drug dealing dispute. This was all told to us by the other employees while the two came and went from our table frequently from going outside, to calling the police.   So then, the police showed up inside to investigate what happened. They were right next to us inside the lobby area discussing all while our chef was making the food. My fianc√© and I, as well as another couple are confused at this point and a little bothered that there's so much commotion by our table.   The couple returns to the table while the police are still there in the lobby. The boyfriend yells at the chef and said he wanted his food well done. The chef said that he wasn't there to tell him how he wanted it done so he played it safe. The boyfriend began yelling at the chef and then we defended the chef by saying he wasn't there and it wasn't right to do that. He then began yelling at us (by the way, he was very drunk and maybe high) and at my fianc√©. The girlfriend who is also an employee at the location then started cursing at us, and the other couple.   The police had to come over and break up everything and asked the couple to leave. The boyfriend threatened us on the way out and eventually cursed at us in the parking lot on our way out. His girlfriend (the employee) was arrested in the parking lot.   To top it off, the manager came over and only offered us 25% off of our bill! We paid (a little over $100) for something that was absolutely atrocious and I will likely never return here if it wasn't for our amazing chef Kevin and the waitress Shizuka (spell check)! Thank you both. 5 stars for the chef and waitress, 0 stars for the leadership team! :("}
{"text":"Great experience here. Love that they cook the food in front of you. Cooks and waiters are great. Restaurant looks great inside and out. I recommend the lobster roll and yakisoba."}
{"text":"Expensive! Luckily we went for the birthday deal and had a much more affordable experience.  Our cook was fun to watch and needless to say the fried rice was amazing.  Also the chicken teriyaki was pretty good and I had a great time here.  Make sure you get the green tea ice cream if you do get a dessert.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been an off again on again patron of Benihana. It seems like every time they change management, things get better for while and then they get terrible again. This experience tonight was amazing! I made reservations for six and last minute needed to add more people. They quickly accommodated us and our waitress was nice as well. She forgot somethings but I'm willing to overlook that. What I really want to rave about is the chef! She was incredible from start to finish. Food tasted delicious and with many allergies and dietary desires, she met everyone's taste buds perfectly! She even added new aspects to dining at Benihana's that I have never seen! If I ever go back, as long as she can be my chef, I'll take a chance on this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing just amazing, only bad thing is I left my baby bottle and the waitress tossed it instead of holding it until I came back like I wasn't gonna notice it missing. Other than that the service was phenomenal and the hibachi cook was full of fun! Magical is what my son calls it!"}
{"text":"The sushi during happy hour is great. The wife and I eat well for $20.  That's drinking pop though.  Don't judge."}
{"text":"Been to so many Hibachi restaurants but this was my first visit to a Benihana-  service was amazing and I was super excited that they offer VOSS spark inking water (my fave-yayyyy!). The food though was just meh-  I'm sure there are equally meh but there has to be better/more flavorful/more entertaining hibachi restaurants out there!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, and it was great. We got right in for lunch, and really had no wait. The server and chef were awesome, the food was fantastic, and the kids loved it. Would definitely go back. If you sign up for their email, you get a free 30.00 ecard for your birthday."}
{"text":"Ok this Benihana gets a 4 star from me. Not because the service is better in Hawaii, but because the seafood isn't as fresh as Hawaii. Other than that, everything here is good. Just like Hawaii, the service is great, the chefs are funny and the food is good...just not as fresh as Hawaii."}
{"text":"Benihana has excellent food and service!  I've dined at Benihana twice and both times, the food and service were exceptional!  The hibachi chef's antics were really entertaining and funny.  The only drawback was the price.  They were two of the most expensive meals I've ever eaten.  I'd rather eat at Tomo because it costs about 1/3 the price.  While dining here, we sat next to a professional skateboarder, Bucky Lasek, and his entourage so that was cool.    Overall, I guess it's a place that you have to try, but once you had it you can find sushi or hibachi elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.  The decor is dated.  I do have to reiterate that the food was excellently prepared and tasted great.  http://www.benihana.com/"}
{"text":"What a shame, Benihana! I gave you two chances to make this right before I  wrote you a bad review on Yelp.  Dined at the sushi bar with a companion on a Wednesday night when it was were not busy. The server was very attentive and the soup and salad came out promptly. The sushi rolls were delicious and didn't take too long. But I ordered a spicy hibachi chicken dish, which was frankly awful. The chicken was barely sauced and had a rubbery texture, as though cut with the grain from a massive breast then cooked too quickly.  It was missing the mushrooms advertised in the menu description, and although they were delivered separately, a miserly portion.  Live ants marched across the sushi bar as we dined.  When this was pointed out to the manager, she killed one and skittered away without comment.  The trash bins were overflowing in the ladies room, which I pointed out to another manager upon leaving.  Nary a apology. I wrote to Benihana via their website, and received  a personal phone call, and after five minutes of excuses and explanations, no offer to replace the rubber chicken or invite me back for a better experience on the house. The manager said to be sure and ask for her when I return.   Why would I go back now???"}
{"text":"If I had to give an actual review of this, I would give a 2.5. Long story short -- go to Wasabi down the road.    I had a birthday coupon so I said \"let's try it anyways\". We got there at 5:15 hoping to get a drink, but the servers were late so we couldn't get seated right away. I had a moment to look around, and it didn't look like a restaurant, but rather an office building. To be honest, I would have to give the decor a 1 out of 5. It just didn't look good.   When we got seated, we ordered our drinks and waited patiently. They did not have green tea (and that came with the meal) so they got me a free soft drink. We also ordered our appetizer.   We waited for our drinks and ordered our meals. We then got our soup and salad even before our app came out, but for some reason, she always had one less item than needed. So one of us always had to wait for our soup and salad.   Our chef came and eve not then our app had not come out. Our chef was awesome through the entire meal but he had to ask our server 3 different times to bring out different things (for our meal, they completely forgot our scallops).   After we were done, we looked to a different table next to us and we saw that our entire table did not receive mushrooms either.   When I told the manager what happened, he did apologize, which I was thankful for. My only goal was to inform the manager what was going on.   So back to my point -- go to Wasabi. Better food, more flavor, and they give you both rice and noodles. Prettier place as well."}
{"text":"The food was great and our Chef, Stephen was awesome! My wife had the hibachi shrimp and I had the spicy hibachi chicken and everything was good. The chicken fried rice was also tasty. We will back soon."}
{"text":"I went for a birthday and had the steak for about ~30. you get a $30 GC on your birthday if you sign-up on their mailing list!  - Great presentation! loved the fireworks, waterfall, and the fact the we were eating on the 2nd floor.  - Show was average. Volacano onion was impressive, but no flipping rice bowls or funny jokes.  - Steak was cooked exactly as asked for. slightly a bit to salty however. - Wish portions were a bit more. - free green tea is a bonus! ice cream for your bday :) - great memories  ^_____^!"}
{"text":"My first time there the food was delicious Jasmine was great and Tame  i hope i spell his name right i really enjoy my time there"}
{"text":"I hope they go Broke very very soon !! And a great all American place with all American traditions and pride opens up in their place !! I guess the crazy Asian cook has no need to comply with the American ways of quality customer service  and he knows that.  \" The  Manager\" should look for another job that he can be proud to represent maybe he needs to remember again  what it is to work for a company that takes pride in the American way of conducting business in USA!!   About the manager ... OMG ! He had nothing to say ! He was looking at us with nothing to say! Probably afraid that he could loose his job if he were to take proper care of a customer   The one person that was great and respectful and wanted to help but was not allowed was the person that took our order thank you! Hope you go work for a better Co. You are too good for that place!"}
{"text":"Our family got together we went to Benihana's lastnight our server was great although the foods not amazing it's ok.. pretty slow Also but still super nice... the air quality was super rough the smell of fried oil was terrible .. clothes smelt very bad after being in there"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi happy hour at the bar -- great drinks too -- I never would have known. I always thought this place only had the community (cook in front of you) dinners."}
{"text":"Teppanyaki at its most average. Good food. Understandable prices. You get what you expect."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about this place. I have been here twice and had two completely different experiences.  First time was pretty upsetting. We had to wait ~45 minutes for a dinner table, at which point they sat us in the bar area. The waitress was rarely to be seen and served me won-ton soup in a chipped bowl (serious health code violation - took a picture). Half-way through our meal, they sat some people with us at our small table which made it somewhat awkward.  Second time was much better. We made reservations and got seated at the Hibachi table. Chef was quite exciting and entertaining, keeping everyone involved. Had some good cold Sake with apple flavor, the rest of the food was pretty standard.  Be sure to sign up for their birthday promotion ($30 off one person's meal), but keep in mind that it is for one person only (they are pretty serious about that)!"}
{"text":"Quality of food was great.  chef was great         The cleanliness of restroom and restaurant needs a lot of improvement"}
{"text":"Came here, because they give you a $30 gift certificate for your birthday. Ordered the spicy hibachi chicken and my friend ordered the teriyaki chicken.  First, we were given miso soup and then the classic ginger salad. The ginger dressing was very refreshing. Once the chef came out, we were given a little shrimp. Next, was the chicken fried rice which was great especially with the shrimp sauce. Finally, I got the spicy chicken which was given with green onions and mushrooms. The chicken just had a spicy sauce put on it. It was ok nothing great. The sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle. It was also served with grilled onions and zucchini.   Overall, the food was standard nothing special. Also, they ask everyone if they want chicken in their fried rice, but they don't tell you that it is an extra $3.55 per person. Definitely not the best hibachi place, the chef had very little enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed, food was absolutely awful.  We sat at the bar and ordered from there.  Benihana special rice tasted like overcooked white rice with salt and chicken stock poured over it.  Our vegetables were so soft, they all tasted the same, mushy.  My sushi (Hamachi) had a 1.5\" x .5\" piece of underbelly still attached and was also inedible.  Our chicken was flavorless and rubbery.   To top it off our server was uncaring and disinterested.  This will be our last trip here as there are now much better options.  It's too bad a once gold standard restaurant is not any longer."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give 5 stars but the seating and host situation up front is always frustrating there.  Such as I know it's going to be busy on Saturday night and I know there is going to be a line so I make sure I have a reservation and then I don't get seated for 25 minuets after the reservation.   It's like the old Seinfeld episode with the rental car agency of you know how to take the reservation but you don't know how to hold the reservation.   Besides that food was great.  Chef was great.  Service was on top of everything and the family had a great time."}
{"text":"First of all, I just want to say THANK YOU to Benihanas.  I signed up for their birthday club, and received a voucher for $30 towards a birthday meal.  That's pretty huge, and I'm very grateful.  But I have to calls em like I sees em.  Let's start at the beginning.  The salad had a bit too much dressing on it.  Check out my photo of what was left at the bottom of my salad bowl and see for yourself.  I think the folks over at The Sushi Room have got a good grasp on salad dressing.  The caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls were fantastic tasting and a good size.  This would be a great place for HH.  I came here with my daughter.  We both wanted Chicken Yakisoba.  She ordered off of the lunch menu (around $8), and I ordered off the dinner menu (around $18) since I had the $30 credit.  Imaging my surprise when the waitress brought out two places of equal portions.  Where did the extra $10 go?  Oh yes, I did get a soup with my entree.  Their yakisoba was just ok.  The chicken was a bit dry and the noodles had a taste I was not accustomed to.  Not terrible, but not a dish I'll be returning for anytime soon.  When we were done, the waitress brought individually wrapped hand towels, something I would expect at a BBQ joint.  But Wow!!!  These hand towels are awesome.  So big and thick.  I wish Buffalo Wild Wings would give you these kind of hand towels, instead of the little thin ones that burn your hands and smell of lemon.  For dessert, a large scoop of green tea ice cream, and a fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  Both were excellent.  I would order these again.  And to top it off, the manager sauntered over to where we were seated and asked if we would like our picture taken.  I affirmed, and assumed a lean-over-the-table pose.  No more than two minutes later, he returned with a nicely framed picture of my birthday guests.  Superb!  100% impressed.  Once again, thank you Benihana for making an otherwise normal birthday meal, special.  I'll be back for HH and desserts."}
{"text":"Wow...!!!!!! Went here for a FRIENDS birthday and let me tell you ... wouldn't come here for my OWN! Sat down for about an hour & 45 minutes before my food (keep mind this was sushi, so its raw) came and the hot food - that never came at all!! We had to cancel our orders and the waitress seemed SO PLEASED we did. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I had been at a Benihanas in Pennsylvania many many years ago and remember it being fun and delicious. Well I was either young and dumb or just starving for food and entertainment. The only reason we decided to hit Benihana was that I had a birthday coupon for $30 off. Depending on what you get, its a free meal, so why not? We got there when it opened so we got a seat quickly. The room filled up fast though, apparently there was a Physicians Assistant convention in the building. The entrance is beautiful, very serene. Our waitress had a thick asian accent so it was difficult to understand her at times, but she was pleasant and efficient. Our chef was a little dry and boring, he seemed like he really didn't want to be there, it his first seating...he has a long night ahead of him! Drinks were large and fruity, just the way I like em. The soup and salad were standard faire, veggies and shrimp appetizers were good, my husband hates seafood and ate 2 of them! I got steak and chicken, my hubby got steak...the meat on both were a bit dry and bland, very under seasoned. At the end of our meal a man at the end of the table began to have chest pains, unsure if it was indigestion or a heart attack. The waitress was quick to call for help, they provided him with a wheelchair and got him out of the room with paramedics on the way. I was impressed they dealt with everything so well. He was lucky he had a nurse (me) and a P.A. at his table, we were standing by ready to lend a hand. After the commotion we were served our ice cream with a birthday candle, nice touch.  I probably won't go back, the food isn't good enough, Osaka has much better Teppan and you can get it at any time of day."}
{"text":"Seriously can not believe the experience we had here! My friends and I were questioning going here since we have a Benihana's back home, but omg we had the BEST experience. If you go and it's possible, ask for Magic J! His name is Johnny, but his name on his name tag is Magic J because he has the most awesome magic tricks. Seriously, try to request him. He'll give you super good food and amazing experience!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints my taste buds! I love how they give a $30 birthday certificate of you are signed up on their mailing list.  The sushi, appetizers, drinks & teppan are items I would recommend. Today, we went for my husband's birthday. We order 2 rolls of sushi, the spicy tuna and caterpillar roll. We also order the Benihana special for teppan.   The sushi always taste fresh and delicious. It was my first time getting the Hibachi steak  and lobster, both had a lot of flavor. It's  seasoned with butter, salt, pepper, and Japanese butter.   They accidentally gave us the wrong sushi roll so we got one for free, that was pretty cool.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I usually just come here for special occasions, usually my meals are simple, but the food is great, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What a joke... the GM (Bob) running this place needs to speak to corporate and change \"policy\". I too, of many, was tricked into coming here for the first time with my $30 Birthday Coupon. Called before and asked if I had to print out or if I could show my phone because my printer was acting up. The gentleman on the phone told me I could just show my phone, no problem. And then I called again because I realized it expired yesterday( before the end of the month like it advertised) and So I call back, again he tells me no problem. I make the drive out, we sit at the table when the server tells me it has to have a bar code.. the coupon they emailed to me did not contain a barcode, and the manager then tells me because its expired. None of this was explained when I clearly did my part, calling ahead, asking before I even bothered to come out. Needless to say, they didn't honor it, the lady we sat next to said she had same problem, so my family made the decision because of the poor experience to dine elsewhere.. (the Chili's next door was AMAZING!) normally i'd pass on Chili's but they changed up their menu, Cowboys game just started and the server was so great!! Food delicious as well..it all worked out in the end. But I would NOT Recommend Benihana to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had the yakisoba noodles with tofu... It was more food than one person can eat. My meal also came with soup, salad and fried rice. The special sauce they use on the noodles is tasty and brings out the flavor of all the different veggies. Although, I've been to a few Benihanas I personally enjoyed the location in Scottsdale. It's clean, not too cold and the service was excellent.   This is also a good meal to order when ordering to go. I've done that a few times in the past.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Chef had absolute 0 idea how to cook. If this was a little league tryout he would be the only kid not to make a team. Been going to Benihana in Houston for years and this didn't even come close. Save your money. Better off going to a Panda Express"}
{"text":"First time visiting this location, been to a few in Cali. This is more updated modernized location it's very nice! Food is always awesome! took moms for her 66th bday and she loved it! Chef Hans our cook was spectacular! We ordered off the \"lunch special\" menu I highly recommend the fillet mignon/hibachi shrimp plate kind of smallish portions but it was delicious and will come back again this week! They hooked up moms w a desert ice cream & bday jingle of course along w the pictures souvenir. Overall we enjoyed the experience. Always love me some Benihanas!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Made a reservation and waited far past it to only be told that they don't know how long it's going to be. The girls up front look down at their devices and avoid talking or helping anyone. When you do get their attention they have a bad attitude. Menu is designed so you have to buy a 5 or 6 course meal, so even if you don't want a few of the items you pay for the whole meal. No thanks"}
{"text":"We made a reservation and arrived just a few minutes early. It took a little longer than expected to be seated and then of course several minutes before the chef was out. It was so incredibly hot in the restaurant and being in there so long made me start to feel ill. Our chef was wonderful. The food was delicious. I definitely recommend keeping the time difference in mind if you are from out of town. We had a 8:30 pm reservation, which was really 11:30 pm to us and made it difficult to eat such a heavy meal. With the price, I would just make sure you go hungry and not too tired to eat. It was quite good!"}
{"text":"Ok so hubby and I were here last night for our 6yr anniversary dinner and the service was AWFUL!!! It took an hour for the chef to come to our table! Then the food was dry and flavorless!! On top if it, the couple across from us was missing their order! Yeah, the chef cooked everyone's food, plated it, and then realized he missed one person!!! Ridiculous! Then the darn manager had the nerve to insult our table of 8 with excuses!!! There were 3 different parties seated at our table from 3 different states and we all agreed that we were treated like crap!! They comped us our drinks for the horrible service... Big deal. Then gave us excuses and made it seem like WE were all wrong for complaining! To add insult to injury, their plates are 10 bucks more than the one at home!!! Pitiful experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Are you interested in an entertaining meal?  This is one of the few places that you can get that!   This is a guarantee if you reserve your spot at one of their many teppanyaki grills.  It's truly a must - no other way to eat here in my opinion.   The chefs are often talented, with a personality, fun and entertaining (OK not always with a personality but very entertaining)  =).  They have several tricks to keep your eyes dancing.  I won't give away the show...  OK so now that we have entertainment out of the way :).  The food... it's all pretty good and obviously fresh - \"right off the grill\".  I've had the chicken, the shrimp and several choices of the steaks.  You get soup, a small salad, a grilled shrimp sampler - then your entree with rice and vegetables.  Now to the shocker...  The Chateaubriand Steak - I had it for the first time recently and it will be my choice forever after...  It made the filet next to it look like its child!  After searing both the bottom and top of this amazing piece of meat the chef cut it into 2 pieces and cooked it to completion (medium rare).  OMG it was so tender with amazing flavor - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.  Truly one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had (and at the price that's saying a lot).  It's apparent why people often have celebrations/birthday gatherings here - because it makes it that much more memorable.  Always a good meal/experience at the grill.  I'd skip the virgin drinks otherwise - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When family comes to town, a trip to Benihana is inevitable. I can't say that I dislike Benihana, but for the price there are so many other places I would rather visit. To me, this place is like the Olive Garden of Japanese restaurants. They have recently updated their menu and raised the prices as well as changed some of the pairings. I was disappointed to see that they no longer have the salmon on the children's menu, my youngest loved the salmon there. My problems this night were more with the service though. I had ordered a sashimi appetizer and it never came. I even reminded our obviously busy waiter and still no sashimi. Most of our party ordered the filet and lobster combo and were very happy with their meal. I ordered a seafood combo and my scallops were cooked to the brink of disintegration. My shrimp were hard and rubbery and my fried rice was so greasy I couldn't eat it.   Our chef was pleasant enough, in his broken English. The decor is very calming and peaceful, with water and fountains throughout. My kids always enjoy the \"cooking show.\""}
{"text":"So I really didn't go to Benihana it went to their sister restaurant called Silk Road Asian Bistro. But it's all in one. It was kinda weird bc they also have another sushi spot inside. It's 3 places in one. Anyways, the food at Silk Road was good, the soup I've tried. BUT Benihana was amazing as always. I've been to ones in LA and now here. It never disappoints me. It's a typical Teppan-Yaki style Japanese food but with their great customer service and friendly people that sit around with you chatting good converse. It makes the experience so much better!! Plus they cook very well!! I always get the land and sea combo and it was delicious! I didn't give it a 5 star because the way the restaurant was laid out. It almost looks like they cheat to have another sushi spot but it looks like that's where they're getting the sushi for Benihana is from. It's just weird to me."}
{"text":"Great dinner! Been to Benihana maybe 15 times in my life and our chef this time TONY \"YNOT\" was the best of all time. This guy is a star and made our dinner into an event we'll always remember. Thanks Tony!"}
{"text":"My first time ever coming to one of these and I went to biggest one in the world. Our chef Kevin was awesome he was hilarious and the food/dinner show was great! Its a bit pricey but worth every penny! Had the noodles (yakisoba) yummmmmmm!!!!!!!!!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome as always .... From the bay to las Vegas slammin as always little bit more expensive than the bay but found out this is the third oldest Benihana .... Been here twice now chef ....Leo was awesome  I mean awesome great personality  The check in lad y was nasty .... Asked for the bathroom she was like out side to the left I said and yours ? Oh this one closer ? Ya where's yours ? Upstairs to the left thank you !!! and the waitress was a little lacking ........ To say the least .... But even they couldn't ruin our time .... Leo more than made up for their shortcomings .... Leo is a Great ambassador for Benihana !!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for the evening of Jan. 2. We called and made the reservation early in the day. We arrived 1/2 early but Karina could not locate our reservation. We have 3 tourists and the rest of the 7 group party are locals. We waited and waited and Karina could not honor our reservation. Someone, a male who answered the phone early in the day, did not write down our reservation. Totally unprofessional. Not only did Karina lose out on 7 hungry guests, but Benihana lost out on future customers. You can bet I will let people know Benihana has some absent minded employees who are unprofessional.  Just unprofessional."}
{"text":"We had reservations for a large group of us (18 in all)  for our traditional Sat. night soccer  team dinner during MLK weekend. Our server, Amy, did a fantastic job handling our orders, serving drinks etc which made for a very fun & enjoyable evening. Thanks also to manager Donna for making sure that we were well taken care of. Yet another fun dinner at Benihana's!"}
{"text":"I told the cook no salt,,,asshole didnt care still used it. Had 3 couples at my table wich I dont really care for. I don't like sitting with people I don't know. The staff is also rude!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, but just recently had a 8:30pm reservation and didn't get seated till a little before 9pm, and didn't get our drinks till 9:20, and I had 3 kids with me. This is the reason for me not giving a 5 star!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was the best experience I've had at one of these. Our chef was beyond amazing.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First off I've been to Benihanas before and I really enjoy going there.  The place here in vegas was nice. We had reservations and so when we arrived we were seated quickly.  The waitress was very nice and hospitable. The chef was also funny nice and good at what she was doing. The two stars I am giving however are because the restaurants restrooms were out of order and we were told we had to go inside the mall or plaza to use them. I saw the waitress speaking to the manager about it he made eye contact with me but never apologize for the inconvenience.  So after walking my son to the restroom by the time we got back our food was cold. Also the food (at least ) the beef was somewhat chewy and didn't taste good. My daughters then had to go use the restroom and again the inconvenience. So I will go back to Benihana's but not to the one in Las Vegas.  I'll try once again closer to home hopefully that goes well and I can recommend Benihana's again."}
{"text":"Had the best chateaubriand ever tonight! Kyle our chef was masterful in show and preparing our dinners. I've been to a few Japanese steakhouses previously but tonight, Benihana made it the best ever."}
{"text":"Was ok the whole presentation the knife tricked  were impressive. Everything tastes the same as any fast food Asian places nothing extraordinary. Service is slow my chicken was dry so they took it off the bill that was appreciated. It wasn't too bad but not a place I will think of when I want to eat out it didn't make any impact for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all today ... Came in for my sisters birthday and it was horrible ..."}
{"text":"My mom and her friends had reservations, and since my sister and I live so close she invited us along as well, although we could only stay about 45minutes before we had to leave for prior engagements.  ***They asked ahead of time if two more could be added to the party*** When we walked in we double checked and they said two more people would be fine.  We get to the table, and there are only enough spaces for the others and when we asked to pull up two more chairs, just for half an hour, the employees just stared at us for a minute, whispered to themselves, and told us we couldn't stay. We had to just awkwardly leave. Like, really?  Definitely needs better communication."}
{"text":"Great place but our chef was weak compared to the competition across the room. Good thing he was a great cook just need to brush up on the entertaining skills.."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place, and when my 21 year old said that is where she wanted to eat for her birthday celebration, I just gritted my teeth. YET, it was a surprise! The decor is amazing with all these little rooms, set in a japanese village setting, with a waterfall in the middle of it all. I have been to many benihanas in my life, and this is the first time I can say they food was delicious and the portions large. I had the shrimp, scallop, calamari plate. All was perfectly cooked and tender. My bf had the sushi and said it was good as well. The show is always the same and boring, but the smile it put on my daughters face was priceless."}
{"text":"Ugh, where to begin? service is terrible from the waitresses who speak very little English, have no sense of urgency, and actually gave me attitude for requesting wasabi.   That's right, my odd request at a Japanese restaurant while having bland tuna steak was met with sarcasm and disbelief that made not only my date and I cringe and do a double take, but the rest of the table also noticed and talked about the attitude. It also took her about 3/4of the meal to bring the hot sauce i requested with my appetizer. It felt odd giving her any tip at all with her bad attitude and piss poor service  Oh and the tuna was near flavorless, drown in what tasted like straight up vinegar and covered with soggy onion crisps and a few edamame beans. Gross.   My date had tofu steak which was worse. It was undercooked, soggy, and flavorless as well. With as much butter they use you would think some flavor would even accidentally happen. No such luck. She requested noodles instead of rice which cost an additional $7 (ridiculous upcharge for butter noodles) and still that meal was borderline inedible. Leftovers were okay because I know how to cook tofu and add spices to food to enhance flavor.   If I could give 0 stars to this pathetic overpriced bland food a thon, I would."}
{"text":"I celebrated my bday here in July.. we honestly had a great time our chef Tony or Y-not  made our visit fun.. will def go back again soon"}
{"text":"I am not one to write badly about any place but our experience here was definitely lacking. It was my birthday. The husband and I made reservations for 530 online. We checked in and sat down in front of the podium. I kid you not, at 610pm, after watching others with later reservations being seated, we had to remind the girl we had been waiting 40 minutes and had checked in at 530. We got a fast apology and were told that \"so and so\" was new and we would be seated next. 620 we were seated with 6 others that we did not know.  Okay, fine, lets order up and get this going...  Our soup came. Barely lukewarm. The lady next to us fed hers to the baby and I drank it down like water, no spoon needed.  Our chef came over and went down the orders with everyone. Its now close to 7pm and I am starving. We ended up eating things randomly as they came: a bowl of fried rice. Then a few shrimp. Then a slice of zucchini. My four scallops. The onions and mushrooms kept cooking on the grill and I wound up eating bites of plain steak because I did not want them to get cold in the interim.   I watched the others play pass the baby down the line because our chef barely spoke with us. I had more fun watching the table next to us being served.    Its after 8pm at this point. I am waiting for our check and asking for the dessert to go because I don't think I can sit here any longer. $80 with tip and I even used a birthday coupon.   There's a lot of \"maybe's\" here: maybe the chef was new. Maybe the girl up front was new. Maybe three hours to eat a meal is a long time.  Maybe I should have asked for a no kid table since I left my THREE kids home so I could enjoy my dinner. I am disappointed. MAYBE they can do better if I decide to come back. Maybe..."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Zachary was or chef, and he was absolutely amazing! We had so much fun!"}
{"text":"i know people love this place, but I'm sorry i just feel like it is an overrated chain. Even our waitress was like,\" no I would not recommended that\" i mean what does that tell you? she literally had something negative to say about 4 different dishes we asked her about.  we appreciated the honesty and left after we finished our drinks and I never just walk out of restaurants. I just love my mom and pop places for Asian, Japanese and Chinese food...Benihanas just cannot seem to impress me.  At least i tried right?"}
{"text":"I celebrated my 25th birthday with my family here last night.  I loved the presentation and the customer service. It was my first time here! Our chef was goofy and entertained us from the start till the end of our meal.   I ordered the filet mignon cooked medium well. I love love love the ginger dipping sauce. It was saucey!   At the end they sang happy birthday to me in English and in Japanese.. and gave me complementary ice cream! Yay"}
{"text":"The food is average and for the price it's not worth it. I guess it's only good for a one time visit!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how the average rating here is so low. This is a great spot with consistently great food.... At least for the teppan side. I've never eaten at just the sushi bar although I have had some and it's always been fine, no complaints.   I eat at Benihana very regularly and I have no complaints so I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good date night or fun dinner atmosphere. The vibe of the table can depend on your chef since they all have Their own personalities but overall it's usually a fun experience to match e great food.   I always go with the deluxe treats which is filet and lobster with the shrimp appetizer (included), a salad with amazing dressing and a soup also which is very good. I'd say all of the above are far better than their \"competitors\" like Ah-So, Sapporo, etc and usually better pricing."}
{"text":"Food was solid but not the service.  I think poor service really kills the experience.  We had a 6:45pm reservation and didn't sit down until 7:10pm.  No excuses for being late when you're asked to make a reservation.  At the very least the management should offer to comp something.  Not the case.  Treated in many ways like cattle.  After spending $250 for dinner I'll have second thoughts about returning. That being said, our chef (Tito) was really good and made that part of the meal a great experience.  Our kids really enjoyed his show. Other than that it was average at best."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place before we decided to visit, all of my friends recommended, and now I have to say I rather go back to Torrance sharing a table with strangers. We had 8 people, and we have been changed 20% gratuity. Ok, I understand that. But our sever Lam, certainly don't deserve any penny of it. First of all, she is very rude when she talked to us. She offered to speak to us in another language, but she can hardly understand. And when my friend told her that our tea taste like soap, she said that is because we are not use to drinking \" American \" water, she said that's how their water taste like. Let's be honest, no matter where you from, water should never taste like soap. And I  ask if we can get another cup, she gave me a very dirty look and ignore me went straight to my friend. But we did have a great chef, chef Zhenxing was the best chef ever, he is very skillful and attentive, and also hilarious. I don't know how server and chef share tips, but I wish all the money that I left go to chef Zhenxing's pocket but not the rude lady Lam."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch and absolutely loved their lunch menu! Which doesn't happen to be available in Vegas, so that's a win for Scottsdale!  We were quickly seated and promptly greeted. Our server was sweet and the food came out fast. 5 stars for all that. But the restaurant felt sort of like a diner with sort of dingy booths and I was disappointed in the food a bit.  I ordered the Salmon lunch box for $10.95. It came with a salad with I didn't care for, Miso soup which was good, and the entree had a glazed piece of salmon that was tasty but small, edamame which was cold, a couple of pieces of a California roll which were meh.. but good enough to eat. It also had a side of rice but I didn't try it. The prices were decent for lunch, and I'd be willing to give it another go to try something else off the menu, but it didn't bowl me over."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good  and had no flyovers  because the chief had to cook it fast since we waited for over an hour for him to show up.  We come here  all the time and usually the food is good.  It looks like they were shorts on staff f. Every time we asked we were told he is in the back preparing it in the back. Everyone on the table was hungry and was complaining."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Benihana since I was about 8 (a long time ago)! The presentation was awesome and the service was great, but was a little disappointed in the scallops which were relatively expensive, not cleaned properly, and had gritty salt. But hey, anytime I get a fire show I love it. So all in all I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"came here after my friends got married. the food was delicious, probably the best i've had at any benihana BUT... it was sooooo expensive!! i wish i could underline the word expensive.  they literally doubled the regular price for everything. everyone went dutch.. with my food & a non-alcoholoic drink ALONE i spent $75.00 FOR JUST ME!!  i was shocked when i saw the bill, they charged everyone individually for the tip too. about $8 each. screw that, but i was obligated cause of the wedding, pretty weak.  so only go there if you can drop a benji for yourself.  oh & the waiters arent really on their re-fill game either. boo :( but they still get 4 stars for the food, my picture is the main picture. yummy rocky's choice! they also have a red hot sauce that i hadnt seen  at any other benihana's before.  it looks like it might have crushed red pepper in it but im not sure,  it was sooo good! i went to a benihana near my home recently  and they didnt have it, so if your at this particular benihana try the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I've always heard good comments about this place. The other day my husband and I tried it. So amazing! I highly recommend. Our chef made our experience awesome. I ordered teriyaki chicken and I loved it. Their fried rice is amazing also.   I would recommend calling and making reservations way before you want to dine."}
{"text":"Filthy!   I'm sorry but anyone who cares about cleanliness would have an issue with eating here. We only went because we were treated to a meal, but upon entering realized it was overpriced for the yucky atmosphere!  I will compliment the staff for their polite and kind demeanors, but everything else was really disappointing and the bathrooms were frankly disturbing. Sticky floors to the point where I had to consciously use a great deal of effort to walk, and the sinks and toilets were LESS clean than a hole-in-the wall gas station! Obviously hadn't been cleaned properly in many many months! We paid $100 dollars for less than impressive steak and seafood that was seasoned with nothing more than salt and pepper and then dipped in bland sauces that were OK at best.   I admit the Father's Day pictures were a nice gift but after dropping $100 and feeling nervous with how dirty the restaurant and the staff looked, it was the least they could do.  I Do not recommend this restaurant! Please do not support this place or refer it to friends. Dirty, overpriced and disappointing! Should be out of business!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was busy or just because I have been going to Beihana at different locations for so long but it just wasn't entertaining for me any longer.  The food was good as to be expected and the service was good.  I am just not wowed any longer."}
{"text":"When I walked into this Benihana, the first thing I noticed was the sheer size of the building. It is by far the largest Benihana I have ever seen! I felt as though I had just stepped off a plane onto the island of Okinawa - just like Daniel LaRusso in Karate Kid 2! Being such a big fan of that movie franchise, I expected that if the restaurant looks a lot like a set from Mr. Miyagi's house in Okinawa in the front, that further into the building there may even be a fighting ring, not unlike the one Daniel-San has to fight in for the honor of his girlfriend Kumiko and house Miyagi. Yet around the corner, nobody was handing out those drums that you twist around in your hands. In fact, all that was back there is what I would normally expect from a teppenyaki restaurant. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING.  The food and service were excellent and our chef was quite skilled at both presentation and preparation, but I couldn't help but wonder how much more amazing the night would've been if I had the opportunity to take a picture with a Pat Morita lookalike posing as Mr. Miyagi. Ultimately, I would still say go to this Benihana, but check your Karate Kid fantasy expectations at the feudal Japanese door."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here for my birthday. They took forever to seat us, even with a reservation. The people up front are rude. We didn't have a waitress come up to us for 10 mins then she explained she didn't know we were her table. The menus are dirty, the place itself is very dirty. Management sucks. Don't think I'm coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Loved this location compared to Westgate. Communication was great & staff very friendly, quick attending. Food amazing as always ! Our chef was Tony! Such a funny guy will request him again, only negative, did an egg trick & it cracked on my boyfriends new shoe  lol it's clean now though."}
{"text":"\"If you are here for flavorful quality food, you are in the wrong place.\"  FULL REVIEW If you want a positive experience here, start with the fish tank outside and enjoy the last living fish they have in it. If you want the full experience; just enjoy the ambiance, take a few pictures and go to a Brazilian steakhouse ouse or the Wynn buffet a block away for the price.  So let's dissect this beast of a rip off: First off, the hotel is absolute garbage. The one time I made the mistake of booking here, they had to change my room three times due to AC problems. You would think it was admirable that they comped me a Buffet, however this was the result of the worse food poisoning I have ever had in my life. So that said, the is the legacy of this resort. Fremont offers better accommodations, and damn that's saying something already.  PROS The servers were very nice and on point. The chef did his best to be funny but shouldn't take his focus off the cooking for a poorly articulated joke. When he asked how I wanted my steak, I said medium rare and the other two couples around us said well. Somehow he managed to serve mine last after setting them all down to cook at once... maybe he was trying to mask the flavor of the cheap meat (yes that's me being facetious).  CONS The salad and soup starters are an absolute disgrace to the heritage. Two leafs of greens and a slice of mushroom in a tasteless broth. You can get better at 7/11 and save yourself $25 already.  The twin lobster tail; I am originally from Maine. $55? This was an absolute rip off. The tails are small, frozen, and the chef actually had the audacity to serve one and half! I couldn't believe it. SERIOUSLY! GO TO THE 99 CENT MARKET DOWN THE STREET AND HAND PICK THE BIGGEST LIVE LOBSTER YOU CAN FIND AND THEY WILL STEAM IT ON THE SPOT IN 15 MINS YOU HAVE REAL FOOD (that will run you about $25 total). You are welcome.  All the saut√©ed vegetables completely lacked in flavor. If you are here for flavorful quality food, you are in the wrong place. The chef was so busy making lame jokes - the food matched his humor well. At least he paired that well as a chef. I know it was all scripted and the point here is entertainment; but if you really think that's the only thing food service is about, you should invite chef Ramsey over.  The rice was an up-sell for fried... I had white and my girlfriend tried the fried. Honestly, blind taste, I couldn't tell the difference. My rice cooker is much better chef than everyone in that kitchen combined.  The only thing that made any sense was the sake (if you don't look at the price).  I do regular reviews for things that are amazing around Vegas. Though the resort already put a bad taste in my mouth and I walked in with a sense of skepticism, I was optimistic and chose this location over the one in Fashion Show Mall - I deeply regret paying to eat here. Taste wise, this was the most amature food I have ever paid for. I felt like I was playing with my niece in her play kitchen as she tossed two leafs of greens and a bouillon soup with a tiny mushroom floating in it. This place is a waste of time and money. They should turn it into a laser tag arena. It would suit the hotel perfectly. It's the equivalent of the Boulevard Mall with their little kid parks. Except it's classier there and the prices make sense.  For half the price, go to China Town. All you can eat sushi! Custom order anything you want straight from the chef. Honestly, I left Benihana's hungrier than I came. You would have to roll me out of Yama Sushi."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Benihana's and it was 1/2 enjoyable, 1/2 eh. You really have to be in the mood to share a table with people. Cross your fingers that they're friendly. (Our table compadres kept complaining that their coupon restricted their dinner choice.) The chef was very entertaining and it was definitely an experience watching my dinner be made in front of me. Be prepared to wait for your food though. My entree was served first since it was salmon, and my dinner counterpart's dinner was served about 5-6 minutes later. It's not that big a deal but when you're hungry it feels like a lifetime.  I'd skip Benihana's in your in Vegas and just go to your local location. Vegas has so much more to offer than this chain."}
{"text":"My first time at Benihana and Daniel was the perfect waiter! Food was amazing and entertainment was what sold it! If you are ever debating what to eat on the strip, Daniel at Benihana's is the right answer. Best friends of mine have been here on multiple occasions and Daniel never disappoints."}
{"text":"This place is over rated to say the least. I love Hibachi restaurants and have been to several in my hometown and in other cities. I've never left any so disappointed though. The service was fine although our waiter could've been more present and the place was nicely decorated and clean, even down to the bathrooms. However, the food left much to be desired. The soup and salad were good. My shrimp was good as well. The rice, however, was hard and not seasoned well. It was also cooked first and immediately put on our plates, which meant that it was cold by the time our meat was cooked. Every other Hibachi restaurant that I've been to has allowed the rice to continue to cook while preparing the meat so as to keep it hot. Duh, right! Well, that didn't happen here. Also, the two sauces they provided were very odd. They looked to be the same as what is provided at every other Hibachi restaurant but were ultimately gross. The deep fried sushi that we ordered was also cold and not very good. This location was also hard to find (it took us more than 10 minutes of walking in circles due to their lack of a large sign.) We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this place. The atmosphere is great, the staff are great and the food is great. If you come see if you can get Hiro as your chef, amazing..."}
{"text":"I love to come here whether it's for a special occasion or just craving their onion soup or their sushi. The only complaint is that sometimes they seem to be understaffed and they won't have the dining room open. Definitely call ahead to make sure they aren't busy as well! I have never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and have always had a great time! We usually start at the bar and grab drinks and then make our way to our table. I love the show they put on for the table! It is so much fun even at my age (although I do get afraid that a shrimp will be torpedoed towards my face sometimes). The food is always delicious! I love LOVE teppanyaki! Great show and great food every time. Typically, my family and (ok... My dad and I) polish off the night sharing sake. The server takes a photo of us and then prints it for us. Such a great place to go for special occasions. We will be back again soon.   Side note: if someone you're with has allergies (perhaps to shrimp) tell your server immediately! They cook everything on the same place. We have to do this for my mom every time we go."}
{"text":"Came here right at 5pm when they opened to place an order for take out. They told me to sit and wait for a server. 4 different servers walked pasted me before someone asked if I was waiting for something. Yeah, to order. Placed my order and sat there for 25 more minutes and all of what I ordered was chicken fried rice. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? WERE YOU PICKING THE RICE IN THE FIELDS? I could of gone grocery shopping and had quadruple the portions all in 25 minutes! I was getting visually frustrated so one of the managers came over and said \"can I get you something to drink while you're waiting?\" \"Is that going to get added to my bill? Yes? Then NOOOO.  After waiting for this damn rice for what felt like the damn prehistoric era I get my food and walk back to my job. I get in, open my bag and portion didn't even fill the box! It was literally flavorless, like the chef doesn't cook with salt, people or even soy sauce. I noticed when I left even after 5:30 there were still parties with 5pm reservations that had not been seated in an entirely empty restaurant. I don't even feel like I need to dine in here to know its a tragic and terrible place to go.  This is a NO NO NO NO NO x infinity for me."}
{"text":"What a great first experience for my girls. We had a trio of birthdays and Benihana was our celebration spot. What a great choice. Roberto was our chef and he was terrific! He entertained our 18 year olds and kept the rest of the adults attention as well. Us girls ordered a variety of fish plates and my husband had the steak. All were cooked to perfection (my daughter couldn't stop raving about the calamari). My husband likes his steak medium well done but not dry and Roberto did not disappoint. Birthday song in 2 languages was fun. I also want to mention that not at any point did we feel rushed to get out. Our waiters were attentive and water glasses were always full. Thank you again Benihana for such a great evening."}
{"text":"Very dirty ( just looking at the hibachi stove top would get you sick).. slow service... small portions + BAD FOOD I don't even know how they are still in business. Not worth a penny honestly save ur money and order Chinese take out I promise it will satisfy you way more than this   -10/10 would be the appropriate rate for this place"}
{"text":"This one is interesting because it really does look dated with the fake fireworks show with audio.  The food show was pretty neat with a fiery volcano (FYI ALL California Benihanas DON'T have the fire!!).  The food is expensive, but hey, you pay for entertainment.  That said, you can get better food elsewhere without the show.  The food pretty much is the same at all Benihanas so you are not going to be surprised."}
{"text":"It was my first time ever at Benihanas. They have beautiful decor, the walk to our table was amazing. Our chef definitely made our night more fun and entertaining not only by his onion fire pyramid (agree! must see), but the overall ambiance of the place was very pleasant. However, I had higher expectations of the food, the portions are very large..(I ate about half of my serving) but..idk..I just don't think the food is that great for the price...but it was definitely worth the overall experience."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Benihana's of the handful we have tried. We ask for Tuan, he is hilarious and the food is great as always. Obviously the food is pricey, but for your birthday, if you sign up for their email club they give you $30 off.  This location is inside of the LVH hotel which is at the older end of the strip, its a little ghetto on the outside but the Bnihana's itself is really quite beautiful. Make sure you call to make a reservation or make one through Yelp. They open at 4 and book up quickly."}
{"text":"I had dinner reservations for 6 tonight to celebrate my husbands birthday. We got there 5 minutes prior and we were checked in. Waited 30 minutes at the bar and still wasn't called back. We checked with hostess to find out how much longer we had to wait and she said she couldn't find our reservation  (mind you she had checked us in the first time and even confirmed the reservation) she was very rude and said we would have to wait longer.  We decided to leave. The whole night was ruined because of this. We frequent Benihanas quite often and I am truly disappointed and I will NEVER go to Benihana again. I am also not going to recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"My friend and manager talked up this place like if it was the greatest thing ever.  My 1st year anniversary came around and thought this would be a good spot.  I really didn't know what i was expecting, atmosphere, food quality, elegance, etc but i was really disappointed.    If you are going to Benihana MAKE SURE you go to the teppanyaki grill instead of the lounge because the lounge was no better than eating at Panda Express.  The 5 course meal ($31, in which i counted 4) included a soup which was good, the salad was subpar, the main course was cold and the desert was probably the best part and it was just ice cream.  The waiter was polite and looked like he was really busy even though the restaurant was nowhere close to being 30% so i guess they were understaffed.  Im guessing the chef prepared all of 5 courses at once the moment we placed our order because by the time we go to our main course it was cold, the dipping sauce for the steak was watery and not thick for it to stay on the food.  I was embarrassed because it was our 1st year anniversary and eating at Red Lobster the previous week was WAY better for around the same price.  Im never coming here again not even for the teppanyaki grill and i would rather go somewhere else, hell even Olive Garden runs circles around this place.  Ruth's Chris?  Forget it, its on a completely different level.  My guess is that Lee C is going to respond to this review like the countless other one-star reviews and apologize.  Well there are a ton of apologies from several months ago and it doesn't look like anything has changed.  I should have considered the reviews before coming here, my mistake."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant.  I come here and really enjoy the food and the atmosphere.  The chefs are so good and make it a enjoyable experience.    I very much recommend this restaurant and it's conveniently located in the Westgate casino."}
{"text":"Came in during the sema show on Thursday and the restaurant was pretty busy, our server was Suphatrra & she did a good job considering he restaurant was busy. This Benihana is inside the Westgate Casino & Resorts-attached to the Conversation Center that it's a combination of three resturant! Cheff Chai did a good job cooking the food with his entertainment included. I like the way they of sharing your table with strangers that you can quickly become friends and finding out that we're all are one! I ordered the Salmon with veggies, steamed rice & avocado sauce that came out good. Overall experience & abundance was satisfying."}
{"text":"YUK; save your money and go elsewhere!  My husband and I went for lunch on Tuesday, I got the Express Lunch Combo with Chicken and Shrimp plus asked for the rice to be upgraded to the Chicken Fried Rice with Vegetables.    The food was very disappointing to say the least, the food tasted like a frozen entree (very plastic like).  The chicken was dry and flavorless, the shrimp was old and leathery.  The upgraded rice did not have any upgrade (no vegetables added to it and the chicken pieces were minuscule) to justify charging me an extra $3.50."}
{"text":"This location is super-convenient, right on the Strip.  Our chef was awesome, fun and talented.  The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We sat down here just to have a drink. We ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir wine and a Long Island Iced Tea. The wine was good but the tea was a little too sweet. It wasn't worth the price considering other places in Las Vegas offered bottomless drinks for the same price. ($29 dollars for both the drinks)."}
{"text":"Absolutely Rude. I made a reservation for a surprise birthday celebration. The hostess said they are unable to seat us until all people in party arrive. Ridiculous they were unable to accommodate. Poor customer service. 1/2 star Just lost my business. I almost am going to email there corporate office."}
{"text":"I wasn't really a fan of Benihana Restaurant til I came to this location. It's so nice and staff is great! The food was good and the chef was awesome! It wasn't too salty or bland. Thank you for your great service! Will definitely come back when we come to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first time at Benihana! We were staying in this hotel for a trade show my company was doing and I got to pick where we ate for night one. It was truly an experience. The lobby for the restaurant is beautifully themed. The server was very charismatic. I got tempura veggies, the fried rice, and cucumber sushi. I also LOOOOVVVEEED the mango lemonade. Wow. Loved it all. I would give five stars, except the photographer that goes around the restaurant is pushy and it's pricey, so it's really only a special event type place, for me."}
{"text":"You deserve worse than 0 (cero) stars....it is 10:06 pm and according to your own door sign you close at 11:00PM yet to our surprise tepanyaki tables close at 9:30?..quite literal false advertising and a lack of respect to walking customers ....not returning"}
{"text":"Chef David was tired. Grill was dirty,.shrimp fried rice was $7.00 with 1 1/2 shrimp cut several ways.. Ordered steak no flavor...overall not worth the money.."}
{"text":"We recently were invited back by Donna the GM of this location and the experience was amazing. Her staff and chef were amazing and remind us why this is our favorite location in Vegas. Thanks again Donna and Lam for going beyond the best!!We will see you soon."}
{"text":"My mother and I just came for their sushi happy hour last night.  Luckily it wasn't as crazy crowded as normal (at times it can get jammed in the lounge area since the sushi is good and the prices are great), so the noise level was down, and service was good.  We ordered the shrimp tempura, dumplings and seaweed salad to start - all good.  Nothing special, but great for the price.  I added a bit of hot sauce and soy sauce to the sauces they came with, so all was good.  We also ordered a few rolls - spicy tuna, dragon, caterpillar, and shrimp crunchy and they were all nice sized and a great bargain!  Everything tasted fresh, although the spicy sauce I asked for wasn't as spicy as I normally like it.  The portions were so generous, I had some to take home to the boy (even though they normally don't let you take happy hour home, I think they could tell we weren't trying to scam the place).  I still haven't tried Wasabi happy hour, but I am okay with Benihana happy for now!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Japanese food and the table cooking that Benihana offers.  I have to say though, there is so many better choices in Vegas for this type of restaurant.  I feel the service is average at best and the pricing is high.  I would look into other places if you like this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here for the live cooking and loved it. I went last night to use my birthday certificate and found them to be really crowded, with a wait for everywhere. I was bummed, but I had to use my certificate that day. I got put on the list, but the hostess didn't ask which list I wanted to be on (chef's table or regular) and I assumed that meant I would get the first available. However, we went to check and she said that there was a wait for the regular dining and would I like to be on that list too. Well, yeah. I didn't come here to sit. I asked about the lounge area. It had a wait too. Basically you can go get a drink and take it back to the waiting area. Ugh, ok. Thankfully when we got seated, the server was really cool. I forgot his name, they don't seem to have name tags. He was great, the food was good, so the experience was saved. Just dealing with that hostess who didn't want to willingly provide information was a pain. I've seen perkier people working at Denny's. A place of that caliber should make better sure that people who are paid to make you feel welcome in that establishment at least smile."}
{"text":"I have been going this restaurant for years at there main location. I decided to try something new so we went to this location at the fashion show mall and it was the most horrible experience for be a Benihana's. I am a local and I would never recommend this location to anyone. My food was over cooked and it took server forever to bring my drinks. I paid $160 for a meal and was so not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is great for a group celebration. We had great service and got the chicken/filet for 2 for $50. Good deal. Next time I will try something with more sauce. We also had the spicy tuna  - we loved it. I'd go back with a full group of 6-8 people. I am curious to see what their lunch prices are. I will go back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal with the kids. Definitely not worth the price. Drinks were expensive and kids drinks aren't included. We did enjoy the service but if you've been once the. You've seen it all. Place is a little run down and if you truly want to spend the money I would recommend reservations though it's not required."}
{"text":"With such a famous history, I expected more. Went in with a group of 15 people expecting a good show. (We spent around 1500 dollars at this place) we got a random white dude as our chef..he didn't do any tricks... And any that he did try he would mess up and say \"cmon guys to have to cheer me on here!!\" Sorry man, we are not going to cheer you on if you can't even do one trick on the grill. There were people I was with who had never gone to something like this before... So it was disappointing. He even stacked the onions up and I told my friend next to me, get ready he's going to light it on fire!!! So he got his phone out to record it (other places do this) only to find out that random white guy was just going to scoot it slowly across the surface of he grill and pull out a whistle that sounded like small child's train toy, and act like the onions were a train.... Super lame dude. The food and show is better at AH SO and its less expensive and it's centrally located instead of driving all the way to chandler.  Waitress was nice, food was good, oh, and the bartenders need to learn how to make drinks, I shouldn't have to explain how to make any shots I order that are pretty standard... Step your game up BENIHANA!"}
{"text":"This decor was so beautifully done.  The food was second to the dragons and lanterns.  You feel like you are in the Asian casino game.  WTG!"}
{"text":"Took the family there (kids for the first time) and unfortunately our chef was brand new and had little or no skills.  Chef was very nice and the food was decent but the whole experience was awkward and not good while the table next to us got the whole package with a more seasoned veteran. Not the chefs fault, management should not be putting an untrained rookie on the floor."}
{"text":"Poor service, long wait...no one cares about the customers. Basic chain. I've been to others all over the country. Don't waste your time at this one! My husband said and I quote, \"I'd rather go to chilis\" and we don't go there."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Great good, great service.   Its very expensive, so we only really go when we get our birthday coupons for $30 off. (sign up on their website for their emails and you get a free meal on your birthday)   There is a waitress who works there most nights (I  have it written down somewhere because i can't remember her name) she works the tables usually in the front of the building on the left side. She is amazing! We always request tables in her area.   My husband has many food allergies and she pays extra attention to make sure his food is allergy free.   Fried rice here is amazing, hibachi style food is alwas great, service is a little bit slow, you may be waiting a little while to get your drinks  refilled but They get pretty busy, and the waiters definitely hustle.   This is a restaurant you go to take time and enjoy yourself and your friends and family. If you're in a rush anywhere, come for the lunch specials and avoid the dinner crowd."}
{"text":"We are delighted to have chosen to dine at Benihana before our night outing to see Vinnie Favorito at Westgate. My husband and I both had the three meats meal that included shrimp, steak, chicken, rice, salad, vegetables, and ice cream. All cooked right in front of us! The ambiance was pleasant, and I certainly must highlight the amazing service and entertainment fron Yan. He was so funny while preparing our delectable cuisine. This totally made for a one of a kind, Japanese dining experience. If you're at Westgate looking for a delicious meal and fun-filled entertainment, visit Benihana!"}
{"text":"To start this location is huge! There are two floors both with some pretty large seating areas. It's nicely decorated inside also.   We arrived with a party of six being such a large space I wasn't too concerned about seating. We get to our table and are joined with a couple who are enjoying a nice dinner. I will admit I'm not the biggest fan of sitting at a table with others who aren't in the party. In this case the couple was on a date so it was awkward to say the least.   Anyway the service was okay being with friends in Vegas we are bound to be a little loud. Our waitress was sure to let us know to keep it down. I didn't find that appropriate. It definitely had an impact on my overall experience.   The food was okay we ordered a little bit of everything. The drinks were good. They weren't watered down which in my case is always a good thing.   Overall it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"I ADORE Benihanas! I have never been disappointed by any of their restaurants in any state I have been in thus far.   I have been eating at Benihanas since I was born, no lie. It is my all time favorite restaurant no matter how hokey the tricks and jokes may be, a smile is plastered on my face from beginning to end. I have encountered fallen knives, shrimp tails soaring through the air, you name it. No matter how amazing or not so amazing the  chef has been, I always know I'll be leaving full and extremely satisfied with delicious & fresh Japanese food.  This location was very beautiful, clean, and modern. From the moment you enter the building you know you're in for a culinary adventure. Entertainment at your table, and delicious food that never seems to end!  Absolutely recommend to anyone and everyone! Definitely stop by on an empty stomach!!! They don't joke around with their portions."}
{"text":"Meant to write this awhile back. Many changes since westgate took over. They discontinued the locals discount, which was a big reason we ate there all the time. They upped the cost of many things, including the rice to $8! Wow. And then some lil things. Like the salad dressing didnt taste the same as it used to. The teriyaki steak didnt really taste much like teriyaki. And the scallops looked smaller. Just seems like the product has been downgraded a bit & the cost has gone up. Was generally disappointed. Aside from the architecture its no diff than the geisha house or any other teppanyaki place. Sad to say we wont be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I decided to give Benihana a try for my birthday this year, just last week.  Since the boyfriend and I decided to go on Super Bowl Sunday after the game ended, we expected a crowd.  To our surprise, the restaurant was virtually empty with just one other table occupied.  We therefore had the entire hibachi/tepanyaki table to ourselves!  It was fun, and the fact that it was just the two of us sped up dinner service considerably.  I ordered Benihana rolls as an appetizer; they were basically tasty California rolls, loosely packed but a real bargain at only $4.75.  For my entree, I went with the Hibachi scallops.  Now unlike Kyoto (the Japanese restaurant I usually hit up on my birthday), there are not a whole lot of veggies prepared as sides with your entree.  In a way, that was a good thing, because I didn't waste any food.  I got a ton of scallops, and I took home what I couldn't finish.  It was great value for the price!  Still, my chef was not Asian and the emptiness of the restaurant did make it feel a little weird.  Perhaps I'll add a star when I update my review after the next visit..."}
{"text":"Only complaint was when we arrived we were basically told we had to wait for another party to arrive prior to being seated.  Was told we could go to bar---after saying no we wanted to be seated they agreed.  We made reservations for 3 and had no idea who other party was so why could we not be seated---we were not asking to be served.  Over all experience was nice.  Waitress very nice and attentive and so was Chef."}
{"text":"Benihana. Crimson flower. The petal like lips of a geisha. Geisha pouring sake. Me want sake!!! Sake goes with sushi. Wife also likes sushi. Sushi makes wife happy. Happy wife will make sure I fall asleep happy, later, at the hotel.  I can usually make word association end in the way I want it. But starting with Benihana makes it almost too easy!!  Generally, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. And Benihana is not an exception. Except for this Vegas location. And it's not because of the sushi and sake, which I find around average. But, the decor, the architecture, the ambiance- it's stunningly beautiful and aesthetically gratifying. Just an incredible place to have dinner. First came here in the mid 90's when it was the Hilton. Rather amazing Beni is still here almost 25 years later, considering most of the 75-100 restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas are long gone. Even one from last November!!  The teppanyaki show is great fun, of course. But, I prefer a more romantic seating here, because like my word association shows.... my mind's occupied with events to occur later.   Can't say I recommend any Benihana anywhere, but this is the one exception. Breathtaking restaurant, and a fun dinner show if you want that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurants. Hands down. I come here for every special occasion. The food is delicious, the staff is amazing, and I never feel like I'm eating in a dirty restaurant. Considering that you get a meal, and a show... I personally don't think it's expensive at all."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for an office holiday lunch. Our chef was very entertaining. We had lunch menu and we all opted for the duet. I had shrimp and beef. The food was very good and their sauces that accompany were also very good. It was a fun experience and i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! Taylor did an excellent job entertaining us while he cooked our delicious meals. My 8 and 11 year olds had a blast. Tons of fun and great food!!! Total win win!!"}
{"text":"typical teppenyaki , food is ok but not that great that my palate would pay for that much. Meals range from $19-$45. I guess you pay for the \"show\" and not really for the food because you get the same or tastier meals from other vietnamese/japanese places without spending too much $$, but definitely worth the try if you wanna experience having your meals prepared in front of you.   on the other hand, I loved their sesame ginger dressing that I could use that dipping for any meat or veggies. Total bill for two with a beer, a sake = $96"}
{"text":"Beautiful and perfect environment with a standard Benihana food!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality as expected, well it's on the strip that's what you get. Have you been to hibachi place before? If so you might not be impressed by this place. I bet you can find a local one that's cheaper, taste better and more entertaining.   We start off with cocktails and it taste blahhhhh for a $12 drink!!! I've got the pineapple coconut and rum drink and it's just like drinking pineapple slash on water and rum. I had to ask them to add lime for me so I can taste some flavor  $24 for spicy chicken hibachi set. The mushroom soup that comes with, again just water + MSG Chicken texture after they cooked it is like crunchy rubber. Spicy sauce is not spicy but just sweet with a whole village of butter in it.   The whole meal is so oily, I'm buttering this place with 1 Star"}
{"text":"5 STAR is for my server Alex, the chef Chase and the Manager Dylan.  You guys are great.    BUT my dining experience was RUINED by this woman who was in the same table with us for the teppanyaki service.  She is allergic to dairy.  So the chef and the server had to accommodate all her requests and this and that thus ruining the chef's cooking show.  He ended up just cooking did 2 tricks and that was it.  Messed up twice on food as I was counting.  I have been to a few Benihana's and frequent the one in Anchorage so I know how this works and we have always enjoyed it.  The cooking show was not fun anymore because of this woman.  Don't get me wrong but I completely understand how people who have allergies are as I am one of them but please dont ruin it for everyone.  Piece of advice:  First do some research on the menu or call the restaurant in advance and ask questions so you know what to order, make special request and so on.  you can find menu online pretty much, So your server dont have to go back and forth to the kichen to answer your questions thus delaying everything.  Then get a table just for you because if you are allergic then other people who are paying dont have to suffer.  Especially if they are paying customers like you.   I so wanted to ask you to pay for everyone's meal on that table after.    I also want to give a shoutout to the other lovely couple in the table with who took it so great and was just trying to enjoy their dinner.  I wish I had their patience.     Dinner time took about 2 hrs.  I lost my appetite.  After the cooking was done I asked for my bill and a box and left."}
{"text":"What's not to like? If you're stuck working and not playing in Vegas, you gotta go for the super duper extra large meals since you can't go sick on the partying.  They entertain me, they cook fresh food for me, they bring me drinks, they have ginger ice cream.  Amen to the knife wielding, flame throwing chefs at Benihana.  You roll out of here way too full. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"}
{"text":"First time at a benihana and was pleasantly surprised. Napz, our chef, had funny and cute jokes about the food prep. Food was good, not great, but better than what I expected for a chain restaurant. Restaurant was clean but poorly ventilated. The grilled food/oil smell was strong and somewhat off-putting."}
{"text":"Fantastic Service and excelent food! Recomended de Rice with shrimp! The waitres was so nice and wiling to help us! Definitly 100% recomended."}
{"text":"THEY DONT HAVE SHRIMP SAUCE!!!!  Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.  It was such a disappointment finding out that this benihana stopped serving shrimp sauce.  Apparently they did serve it in the past, but this was my first time at this benihana.  The only other place I've had benihana was in minnesota... which was nearly 5 years ago :)   Honestly, this place didn't measure up.  For the value, you certainly don't get your moneys worth of food. Though the chicken, steak, shrimp, etc were all excellent, it would've been 100x better with shrimp sauce lol, anyone who's had this sauce know what im talking abou!.  All the entrees were pricey, but then again it is vegas.    The chef was fun, same ole tricks though.  Still had fun, but I don't think I'll be back here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"walked in and host was absolutely rude. stared at us until we acknowledged him. told him we'd like a spot for 2, and he said that there was no room for the next three. no apology, just a rude look. obviously we understand if there's a wait, but the way he handled it was embarrassing. we left shocked at how terrible of a \"host\" the kid was. very disappointed in that interaction."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a conference so I got the opportunity to spend my per diem money on their all you can eat sushi.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  So disappointed that I just couldn't keep eating it anymore for the sake of being full.  I actually went somewhere else, because I was still hungry, and got a sandwich.    The reasons why I didn't enjoy my meal:  1.  Rice was super mushy.  Eventually, every sushi they served me had medicre rice, which totally ruined the whole meal.   2.  They put so much rice in their sushi so that AYCE diners will get full sooner.   I actually had to tell the sushi chef to kick back on the rice. 3.  The fish was not as fresh as I am used to in Southern California.  One of the servers told me that this was a common complaint by non-local diners.   Needless to say, I didn't go back here during my remaining 3 days.  I actually preferred the Japanese mall food court restaurant over this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Benihana...but this one failed me."}
{"text":"We went here for my sons birthday.  To be honest I really wasn't thrilled to go here, because past experiences(not at this location) were sub par.   Once sat we were greeted by Colton, our Teppanyaki Chef.  He was very funny and displayed many of the common tricks, the train, heart, and of course the flaming volcano.  Additionally he had several very unique tricks that our 8 year old as well as all others really enjoyed. His skills on the grill were superb and what had been normally average food on past experiences became rich in flavor and juicy meats.    I would say this has been the best teppan experience ever.  I would ask for Colton again in a heartbeat.  The menu appeared to have been enhanced as well with many new items and available options.   The only thing I would say that could be improved would be the odor of the restaurant upon entering. It was a \"dirty carpet\" odor that could easily be addressed.    All in all an amazing time and it totally changed my impression of this restaurant.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday last week. It was my first time at this location. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Probably one of the biggest Beni's I've ever seen. The food & drinks were good like at most of their locations, but the service was sooooooo slow. We got seated at 8:30. By the time the chef got to our table it was almost 10. By the time he was done making our food, almost everyone at our table was ready for a to go box because it had taken so long and the restaurant was about to close. Don't know if the chef got lost  or took an extended lunch break. Either way, I damn near lost my appetite waiting for so long."}
{"text":"Always a great experience dining at Benihana and lay night was no exception. Wanting to go out for a nice dinner with my boyfriend while we were on vacation, we made a reservation for our last night there and we had a wonderful experience. This is definitely the nicest one I have ever been too with the ambiance of the restaurant and the incredible hospitality. Our chef, Kevin took great care of us and did an excellent job making sure everyone at the table was satisfied with everything put on their plates. Excellent food and great service, no complaints."}
{"text":"Benihana is a decent place to get hibachi or sushi anywhere in the country. We've been to this location a couple times per year for the past few years and it is always pretty good. The sushi? There's better in the valley. The tepanyaki? Same. The drinks? Pretty good. The prices? On par with everyone else and the happy hour specials are pretty good.  But let's be realistic here. Most people come for the chef's table birthday special. The coupon has gotten worse over the past year. It is now a discount with another purchase, cannot be combined with happy hour prices, and the times you can come are more limited. They are all fair policy changes since businesses need to (and deserve to) make money. But at full price I do not find the food or experience to be worth the trip across town. There are areas with better sushi, better tepanyaki, and better prices.  It is good but not great. If there was a location in the west valley I could see going here when I got the itch to sit around a table grill. But with the recent changes I wonder if even the birthday special is worth the trip across town. Or if I'd rather pay full price and drive half as far."}
{"text":"We piled up used dishes on the end on the table where I sat as my family finished their soup and salad. The yum yum sauce was outstanding, with a hint of garlic.  The tuna steak was excellent.  We all received a scant amount of veggies with our meals.  The carafe of wine is not a carafe;  no even half a carafe.  Server forgot to deduct our coupon and we had to have it corrected by phone when we got home which took multiple calls when placed on hold for long periods.  Not very professional.  Food was good, service was poor."}
{"text":"Cant say one bad thing about this place. One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The Hilton is gone but glad to say Benihana is still here. One of the most beautiful Benihana's I've been to. Have been a long time customer here when coming to Las Vegas.  If it's your first time here, get the Benihana trio chicken sirloin and shrimp. Having a Long Island Ice tea to go with it.  Today's server was Kenny and the cook was Paul.  Perfect combination to serve your meal if I say so. Both entertain the group and Paul cooked my sirloin to perfection. I like to add that the ladies at the front was very friendly and attentive of someone's celebrating a special event.  People, if you're a local or coming to visit Las Vegas and want to be fed and entertain please check out Benihana at Westgate formally The Las Vegas Hilton."}
{"text":"We have been here many times over the years. Celebrated birthdays and anniversaries here, It is inside the old Hilton. When walking in you will feel like your in a different place not the casino anymore. It is decorated really nice. They even have a elevator for special events upstairs! Its a big place!! The food is always so good. If your staying in the hotel and there is a event in town it is a good Idea to make reservations ahead of time to be sure to get in.We have seen it get pretty busy, Have always enjoyed eating here. The food is really good and have never had any problems. Staff is friendly too. Check this place out it is really nice,  A little higher priced than other Japanese restaurants but its great for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Staff was extremely rude. Came in to have lunch with my sister and upon arriving we sat in the lobby 10 minutes without being greeted. A guy walked in from outside and seated us. There was no bartender during happy hour and they kept saying he's on his way. We sat at the table for a few minutes then the guy asked us to move down when it was a whole table for the party of two to sit at. My sister and I asked to sit at a regular table and the same guy continued to be a jerk so we left. Not worth the time or energy. However, I do think if we looked differently we would've been treated better instead of ignored. When we asked for a manager the guy walked off, just unpleasant."}
{"text":"The food is OK. It's a Japanese steakhouse and the food tastes like it- lots of butter and lots of oil.   The service is awful. It takes at least 2 hours to have a meal.   I do like the sauces- they have ginger sauce and a seafood sauce.   They charge more than $3 each for fried rice. That's pretty expensive.   I wouldn't go back. They've had two chances and the service was slow both times."}
{"text":"I love love this place. I look forward to it every time. Scared that mall is closing. Where they going to go????????"}
{"text":"My experience today at this Benihanna location was absolutely horrid. We made a reservation at 4:30 we arrived at the location at 4:16 pm our whole party was not there upon arrival it was about half of the 10 person party already there the rest of the party we just coming in from out of town so they would not be there by 4:30 we wanted to go Ahead to be seated because we wanted to order appetizers and Sushi but the server at the front said we could not be seated until our whole party was there we explained to her that the Hibachi chef did not necessarily need to come out immediately until they rest of the party arrived because their arrival time was questionable she then went to grab the manager whose name I did not get to ask if she as able to go ahead and seat  us after rudely once again refusing to at least seat Us at our table at the time of reservation. At this time the partial party and I went to the bar ordered some food to wait at this point and time. In passing we were able to talk to Ray whom was the manager and he seemed as if he was going to assist us because at this time. We had been waiting for about thirty minutes and still no service he was condescending and inattentive just ignored us. There were only two pleasant employees who apologized to us Briana and Deonte whom explained to us about the  terrible experience that was much obliged.One our complete party showed up I let the server know that we were ready at this time there was no table available and no answers as of why. Once we were seated they placed us a large group in the corner which we asked to be moved because there was no amount of comfortable space for us which the sever refused to do with an attitude because they said the hibachi was already on. At this point more than an hour past our reservation we chose to leave and not give our service to this location. This was highly unpleasant the bathrooms were dirty and the service was the most disappointing and rude experience all around. My party and I were getting together as we came from all parts to commune and the service was horrible. No solutions offered by management and not the Benihana franchise experience the premium prices should match with premium service ."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for my birthday dinner. It was a Thursday, so my party of 5 was seated right away. The chef was very charismatic and entertaining and the food was pretty good. My favorite item was the Las Vegas Roll. Of course, unless you have a large party, you're sharing your table/hibachi with others, but it wasn't as bad as I assumed. They also sing \"happy birthday\" to you and you get an ice cream sundae for free.  TIP: sign up for their email club and you receive a $30 gift certificate with the purchase of an entree."}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland...  They used the same spices, or combination of spices, for nearly every dish that came out- salt, pepper, sesame seeds, lemon, soy sauce, garlic butter. Rinse, lather, repeat. I don't know if I could have tasted anything more boring. We got the chicken and shrimp dish for two, which was only about $32 which I'm thankful for now. If I spent any more, I would have been really sad.  My other friend ordered the fillet with teriyaki sauce instead of the garlic sauce, and while it was decent, it definitely wasn't worth the price tag.   While the show was nice and the service good, the food was obviously overpriced and not tasty. They have a program where you sign up on their email list and get sent a $30 gift certificate during your birthday month. It's kind of sad when you go to a place and think the food is so boring that you wouldn't even come back for a free meal on your birthday."}
{"text":"We arrived a little early, waiting for family, and tried to sit in the bar area.  I asked the server in the bar area if the area was bar seating and was rudely told by a server, woman approximately late 50s, \"this is dining room only.\" I had been to this Benihanas in the past but it had been at least a year.  Wasn't sure if they changed their policy.  We proceeded to leave.  I turned around because I wanted this rude lady to know there was only 1 other party in there and we had just wanted appetizers and drinks while waiting for dinner. She then changed her tune.  The rest of our experience and food was very good.  When discussing what happened with my husband, who witnessed the exchange, he felt her harshness may have been a cultural thing.  My feeling is that it has nothing to do with culture.  If you can't control your harsh tongue, get out of the hospitality business!  We will go back the next time we're in Vegas but won't take any guff off this lady.  Their food is a 4 but the experience with the server in the bar area dropped it to a 3.  Found out the bar area servers name is Meilong"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding, food isn't  the greatest Japanese steak house around. But really your paying for the environment. The price is steep but worth the climb"}
{"text":"For a first time visit, they certainly left a lasting first impression that was not to my liking. The only good thing that came about from my dinner this evening was the comedic chef who lightened the mood. For starters, our waitress was rude to exclusively my friend and me. The other party seated with us was treated far more nicely. My friend simply wanted to inquire about the wait time for our meal and the waitress rudely snapped back that it was coming. After waiting an hour for the food and chef to appear, we waited another 5 minutes because they screwed up my friends entr√©e. The shrimp was undercooked, my tea had a rice grain from a prior customer's meal and the food lacked seasoning. While the meal lacked flavor, our waitress did not lack in bitterness. She not only screwed up our order but also blatantly ignored my friends request to get her drink without ice, three times. Towards the ending of the meal she was pleasant, probably with hopes that we'd tip her. I also mentioned the food in my tea to the bus boy, which we were charged for, and was never brought a replacement. I never drank the tea either."}
{"text":"Diane and I just returned from enjoying our first dinner at this Strip location of Benihana during Restaurant Week.  For $50 I was presented with a full 8-piece roll of moist and excellent Spicy Tuna; a huge heap of perfectly salted Edamame; Benihana Onion Soup; Benihana Salad; Hibachi Shrimp appetizer; Hibachi White Onions, Mushrooms, and Zucchini; Hibachi Chicken Fried Rice; a Samurai Treat of medium-rare Filet Mignon and Colossal Shrimp; Seafood and Meat Dipping Sauces; endless hot Japanese Green Tea, and Chocolate Ice Cream.    The Onion Soup with Mushrooms and Green Onions was very good, as was the salad with Cherry Tomatoes, Iceberg Lettuce, carrot slivers, and Ginger Dressing.  Requested low-sodium Soy Sauce was unexpectedly presented in a white ceramic spouted dish.  A touch of class!  And extra ginger for the sushi was quickly supplied.    The Benihana Signature Chicken Fried Rice was nicely soy flavored, and the grilled vegetables, tender Filet, and meaty shrimp perfectly seasoned.  Seating at a hibachi grill was comfortable in the sleekly modern dining room accented in red-cushioned chairs.  We sat with 6 sociable men from Germany who were staying in a penthouse suite at the Mirage.  And service by Unique was outstanding.     Great cooking of top quality ingredients by our grill master yielded a superior teppanyaki meal.  Only too many dropped knives and missed shrimp catches prevented this from being a 5-star experience.  4-1/2 sparkling stars overall!"}
{"text":"f this place.  Cute decor (if you like Disneyland versions of things)  Pretty unexciting showmanship and culinary skills from the teppanyaki chefs.  How about not flipping dead shrimp into the plates of vegetarians Benihana guy?   The food was remarkably blah.  The salad - even the dressing is better at your local sushi joint.  The onion soup- yech. The steamed rice- pretty awful (and there is an art to rice that Benihana should have learned) and finally, if I myself took some chicken, sauteed it with butter and poured sesame seeds over the top it would taste MUCH better and cost WAY lest than the 49.50 that my client had to pay.  PS If someone doesn't eat red meat- can you please not put their chicken next to a bloody piece of steak cooking on the grill?  Could you perhaps use a different knife?  The whole thing was gross.  Stay away. It's not that it's bad- it's just not good."}
{"text":"Pretty good they paid special attention to my three kids. I really thought it was going to be a tough dinner but it turned out to be fairy easy to do with a 6 yr, 4 yr and a 11 month old. they seemed mezmarized by the chef and the other people at the table were pleasant. the building does need an update and seems to be getting a little shabby but other than that it was about what I'vd come to expect from them."}
{"text":"By far my FAVORITE restaurant! Our chef kept us entertained and the food (as always) was absolutely delicious!!! This is the first place I think of when planning a special dinner, never a dull moment."}
{"text":"Had a great time, new blood added new material, fantastic time. Only time felt like food wasn't cooked exactly as desired & think salad not as good as before but still great. Will continue to be back. Happy birthday to my Mommy - do wish they would have embarrassed her more."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and they made a point to say they only hold it 10 mins. We arrived 4 mins late and it was already given away and no more seats available for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Delicious, free meal with 30 dollar birthday voucher. sushi was fresh and well made. taste was great. edamame was not fresh as I saw when they popped it in the microwave."}
{"text":"Review from now 2018- wife got an email for her birthday so we went to celebrate although we tend to go to other more proximate non corporate establishments.  Despite reservations we were seated about 10 minutes late, and when we were, God Bless the server but it must have been her first night. We were stressed for her and patient, we were worried that she'd drop something and at one point she actually did. At one point she disappeared and we were joking that she quit and was driving home!  Now, if you, our server are personally are reading this, don't take this personally- that's what happens when you are new, but the fact that the company allowed this to happen makes you wonder about the training program. Luckily she had a trainer who was clearly a pro and was letting the trainee try her best. But guess what, it was my wife's birthday and the birthday of a girl who was with another family at our table.  It literally took an hour from our reservation time to even get our soup. We joked that we should go get some hamburgers to tide us over. Eventually the chef came out and he was very cool and very capable and did a great job. The food was good but each person got served at different times so at one point 2 people in our group were done eating before the last person in each of our groups even got their food. Then he offered us onions- after half of us were completely done with our meat- so who wants a plate of onions after dinner? So the timing was a bit off and from experience at other restaurants this is not normal. I did speak with the manager and he gave us a fair and greatly appreciated discount. Hey I worked food services when I was young and any new job can be stressful but for a big company like Benihanna to miss it this hard is a mystery.   Review from 2010- The best dining experience in a long time. It's more like the Jungle Cruise but with food.  Great service. Great (right at your table) chef. And we got out if there spending less  than we planned. I forgot that its kid friendly too. If you've never tried it, I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"NOTE To management: Thanks for making it right, but please fix your staff. Maybe go train at the Beaverton, Oregon store? It's run right.  Unlike normal, I did not take any pictures, but I'm kind of glad I didn't, because despite all the gross mistakes(detailed below), when called out on it, they made right. If not I would be giving them a 1 star review. While I am still irritated my husband had to call them back after they said they'de call him back and did not, I am glad that they have us gift cards equal to our dinner, and I am satisfied with that. I can honestly say, I have never been so disappointed in dinner my entire life, I live Benihana's, head they not made it right, I would have never ever come back. As it stands, they did the right thing when called out on it, and I pray they retrain staff and let people go if necessary, there was no excuse for some of the details below.    know what Benihana's standards are because 7yrs ago, I did mystery shops for them, so I was very upset when this store failed on all fronts.  My husband and I went here while on business in Scottsdale/Phoenix from Oregon, we go to the Beaverton location for special occasions, birthdays, anniversaries, etc.   Unfriendly staff, manager never showed up at the end of meal, dirty bathrooms, friendly, but absent-minded waitress who kept messing up and forgetting parts of our orders such as our sushi, we head to remind her 3x's(our local guest with us said it was the 3rd time this waitress did this to them) lack of drink refills, no offer of to-go boxes I had to ask, worst presentation of food I have ever been at a restaurant(food lilterally looked thrown on the plate), my steak was medium well instead of medium rare, the sushi rice was mushy and overcooked(the fish and other ingredients were very fresh thankfully), and the food was far Below Benihana's standards, and was never offered complimentary tea or my husband's complimentary ice cream. Like I said, having done mystery shops 7yrs ago, I know EXACTLY what their corporate standards are, so while highly disappointing, it was rectified in the end.   Bottom line,  for an easily $100 dinner, there is no excuse for the terrible mistakes, and it was very depressing that it gained, even though it was made right in the end.   God Bless ~Amy"}
{"text":"We took our daughter here tonight for her 21st birthday -- there were 11 of us total and we had the best time! After calling a few restaurants, we were surprised about how many eateries were fully booked on a Tuesday night and could not accommodate a reservation for party our size. But Benihana happily took our reservation and it ended being the best thing that could have happened because we truly enjoyed an incredible meal. Our grill chef Tommy was so funny and entertaining and we truly enjoyed every portion of our meal -- all 6 courses were delicious! We highly recommend the hibachi chicken, steak and shrimp. You simply can't go wrong with any of those choices. The grilled veggies and chicken fried rice are also excellent and cooked to perfection. While their prices are on the high end, it's totally worth it for all the courses you get including ice cream for dessert, plus you'll be entertained by one of their great grill chefs! They also sang happy birthday to my daughter and gave her a cute porcelain buddha for good luck. Although they automatically charged tip because of our party size, we added an extra $25 because we had such a great time. Our server said it wasn't necessary, but we insisted and she expressed such gratitude. Benihana is a memorable experience for the entire group and great spot for any special occasion!"}
{"text":"Went here for a girl friends bday and Tony was awesome! He made it a great and fun experience. He's such a pro we loved the food and the show. Great cooking Tony!!"}
{"text":"Would highly recommend! Easy to reserve on open table. Alex is a highly attentive waiter and Ryan is a hilarious and talented chef! Food is awesome! I am gluten free and vegan and the staff is very accommodating. Great food, decent price, great entertainment!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with a Bucket List experience, \"Be the Chef.\" It was spectacular. General Manager Dylan was wonderful and so accommodating. Master Chef Cholula was patient, fun, helpful and quite talented. Everyone made me/us feel special. Could not have been more perfect!"}
{"text":"I should have listened to other reviewers! I received a gift certificate from Benihana for my birthday. My husband and I went on a Wednesday evening. Let me just start by saying the WAIT is ridiculous!! Mind you, the servers were busting their butts but they need additional help. Our reservation was at 6:30 pm and we didn't leave until 9 pm. It took almost 45 mins for our cook to come to our table. Our cook was new (you can tell) he spilled things everywhere, did not engage with customers, took him almost an hour to finish cooking. Oh and he messed up our order. We also ordered sushi for an appetizer but it came out the same time as our entree. Portions were not the nest either. Overall very disappointed for a place like this. I don't recommend it here! Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isn't top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... I'm docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for."}
{"text":"I highly recommend coming here for happy hour...  We got there right at 5 and we were the only people in the lounge area which usually means good service...I was right. Our server was excellent!   The plum wine is delicious and only $5 a glass. We decided to order a plethora of items and I think we picked all the right ones.   Teriyaki wings...perfectly crisp and just the right amount of spice. The spicy tuna roll was just okay, it wasn't bad by any means but it was just your typical spicy tuna roll. Pan-Fried Beef Gyoza Dumplings...very good! Now for the drum roll please......CHILI SHRIMP ROLL!!!!! (see picture) Where do I begin, this is a combination of everything  delicious and looks pretty too. It is a somewhat crunchy hand roll on the bottom with rice and crab then a comes a crab and spicy mayo concoction, on top of that is a piece of shrimp tempura...that's not all! The icing on the cake is the jalape√±o on top with a dollop of Sriracha. Needless to say, we ended up ordering a second chili shrimp roll, it was THAT good.  For all of this delicousness our bill was $28. Everything was under $6. You just can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We were here for my husband's birthday dinner (family tradition) and it seemed that everyone was shorted on something. Not to mention the habachi cook was sweating profusely    All in all, not the greatest Benihana experience we have had."}
{"text":"The place and ambiance was great.....but...from a tapanyaki standpoint....about as close to the bottom as possible. Benihana's was one of the originals.....it sure hasn't kept up with the rest of them!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the friendliness of the manager but this was by far the worst service I have received on this Vegas trip.  Out of a group of 8 individuals, they messed up the order on 4 people at the table and did nothing to rectify their mistake. Anytime a consumer is paying any amount of money, their order needs to be accurate or at least have a courteous waitress who apologizes for their mistakes."}
{"text":"I LOVE Benihana. I had not been in almost 10 yrs. And it STILL was as exciting!!! Nothing like being seated with a bunch randoms."}
{"text":"Cliff & Kim were such great workers! We loved our first experience at the new Benihana in VEGAS!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have had an unpleasant experience here for dinner. We really used to love coming here in previous years, but I sadly feel like it's gone a bit downhill. A few positives are that you get a free $30 meal when you sign up online for your birthday and the portions are extremely filling. My dad decided to use his last month and while he enjoyed the food at the time, he immediately got sick as soon as he arrived home and his entire meal came up. I just went here the other night and used my free birthday dinner and the same exact thing happened to me. We also received our check and had gave the waitress our card, then she forgot about everyone at our table and we had to wait 25 min just to get it back until one of us went to ask the manager where she went. Staff was friendly, but unfortunately it is not something we will be looking forward to coming back to."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Benihana for years.  It was so beautiful and lively when it first renovated. Now, not so much. The only time I really visit is when myself, or someone else, has a birthday certificate.  My birthday was in December and I missed out on using mine because I wasn't in a rush to go.  It's a $30 value, so that's significant that I can't even make it a point to use it.   Anyway, a friend and I randomly decided to go for happy hour.  That's probably the only other reason to go.  Their happy hour menu is decent, though you can still rack up a decent bill if you aren't careful.  Between the two of us we ordered the teriyaki wings, edamame, Philadelphia roll, fiery shrimp tempura, gyoza, and the chili shrimp roll. Everything was just satisfactory. Nothing stood out at all.  I assume that the .50 cent difference between regular shrimp tempura and \"fiery\" was the generous drizzle of some sort of hot sauce. They could have kept that on the side because it could make the tempura soggy if left too long. What's happy hour without drinks? I had a seasonal drink, the Pacific Ocean Cooler.  It was good, but not boozy enough for me.  I really enjoyed my Bene-tini though.  That's actually on the Happy Hour menu.  Still not boozy, but had a good flavor. Service was decent, I don't usually have too big of a problem in the lounge area.  Though I'm relatively sure out waitress forgot to put in our sushi orders at first.  All in all...a \"meh\" visit."}
{"text":"For as long as I can remember Benihanas has been the standard for the American teppanyaki experience. Sadly I think that the experience has been lost in translation and their sharp knife that was used to slice would-be competition is slowly dulling (pun intended). The teppan cooks we had tonight was \"ok\" . He did the standard flair tricks and jokes however quickly became flustered with the cooking and food management and that's where the entertainment portion ended. We were lucky, the group across from us were seated after us and their chef came and went before ours was done. We could hear them arguing with the manger about the quality of service, taste and a missed order. I don't know about the validity of their argument so I'll leave it at that. In my personal option, I think the level of expertise/standard of the teppan chef/entertainers have gone down.   Another area for concern on this outing was our kimono dressed waitress, she was not friendly nor very customer service oriented. She forgot 2 of the tables drinks on the initial order and had to be flagged down constantly for refills. Each engagement with her felt like we were inconveniencing her versus being felt like a welcome guest.  The last complaint about the staff was we were not thanked once after paying our bill or walking out of the dining area! Not the Japanese way!    Other observations: When the couple next to us asked for a take out box they were given Chinese take out boxes?!? I find this odd and at the same time insulting. This is supposed to be a Japanese dining experience not a Chinese one. I'm not racist (I am actually both Chinese and Japanese) but do not confuse the cultures! How do Chinese take out boxes play into an authentic Japanese dining experience? It doesn't! It may seem trivial but It tells you how they view leftovers and the food. You are paying $30-60 for a meal and by giving you a cheap Chinese take out box and LVH gift shop bag makes the restaurant look cheap and takes away from the experience.. Its the little things people...  Ending on a good note: Compliments on the completed renovation the place looks really good and makes you feel like you were transported to the motherland."}
{"text":"This has to be the oldest Benihana in the US.  Was staying at LVH, so had to eat there.  Went for dinner, ordered steak and lobster.  The chef was very entertaining.   If you like Benihana, and are in town, check it out."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Benihana here, our family would always come in this area for family dinner. Their service is excellent and their foods are just amazing! All of their chefs here great, but our favorite is DILLON! He's very fun and so entertaining.It's always good to dine and be entertained at the same time. Makes your dining experience even more fun. We'd definitely would come back again soon! This place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"meh...  The Service: bad The Show: tired The Portions: small The Fried Rice: extra $?...what? The Clientele: low Drink refills: none Desert: melted ice cream  Will I return: unlikely  THIS PLACE IS THE WORST!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service our chef was entertaining food was prepared quickly and efficiently Cost was a little high compared other Benihana's I've been to"}
{"text":"So tonight was my 21st birthday. My reservation was for 8:30 pm, i showed up at 8:40 but my party was on time, but would not seat them until i arrived. Understandable. They sat 15 of us at a 12 person table. They didn't start cooking our food until 10:30.... our service was horrible... mind you we all ordered alcohol and the 6 course meal and we're spending money. I was extremely disappointed until our hibachi cook \"too much Tony\" showed up as well as Miguel. They were amazing, hilarious, and lit up our night. They were all worth the wait and i was happy again. Until our check came out, i had not been sung happy birthday after i watched numerous tables receive that... ON TOP OF THAT.... nobody received their tea OR their fricken dessert!!!! In which we all paid for. So respectfully at the end, i asked to speak to the new GM, and explained to him in the utmost respect my experience.... and how we were left out our dessert and tea we paid for and he did not care, did not apologize, or did not accommodate for. HAHAHAHA thanks for the birthday wishes benihana lol... once again ur chefs were absolutely amazing... but your GM and staff was absolutely horrible. Will not be returning. Two stars was for the homie cooks tony and Miguel."}
{"text":"I'll admit, it was our fault that we didn't make a reservation. As a result, we had to sit in the bar for happy hour to avoid the 90 minute wait. The food was only ok (I had a few of the sushi rolls--Ra is better) and my girlfriend ordered dumplings and wings. The dumplings came out cold and the wings just never showed up. The bartenders weren't mean or anything, but they didn't really seem to care either. They took the wings off the bill and apologized but it still seemed disingenuous. Not really impressed."}
{"text":"We went to Benihana because my husband received a $30 birthday certificate from them and my toddler son received his free birthday cup.  We were seated with 2 other families who were also celebrating birthdays with the same certificate.  They were a fun bunch.  Our chef, John was really nice and very accommodating to our son.  He was funny and cracked jokes with us while cooking.  I know it must be a hard job to have to stand there and entertain people and cook and sweat so we definitely were appreciative for him.   The husband and I both ordered the \"Splash & Meadow\" - which was jumbo shrimp and steak.  Our son had the \"child's\" version of it. Even though hubby's dinner was \"paid\" for, we still ended up with a $74.00 bill.  They added on gratuity that said it was \"suggested\" but had no where to really change it - the only extra line was to add on \"additional tip\".    \"All of our beef is USDA Choice, aged to perfection and hand-butchered on premise. Served with Benihana onion soup, Benihana salad, shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables, homemade dipping sauces, steamed rice, Japanese hot green tea and H√§agen-Dazs ice cream, sherbet or sorbet.\"    I want you all to take a look at this description - and let me say that none of us received hot green tea...and ONLY the people who had the birthday coupon received ice cream.  When we asked if us \"regulars\" could get ice cream, they said we had to pay extra for it when it CLEARLY states on the menu that it comes with our dinner!  Total crap.  Also, the \"onion\" soup was completely tasteless.  It was just broth with some mushrooms and dried onions tossed in.  I do say that the shrimp and steak was pretty good and even better when dipped in their mustard sauce.    I probably will not come back again - even if we get a birthday dinner, it's still expensive and it's mostly for the entertainment of the Chef cooking for you that you're paying for."}
{"text":"Ok, it's Benihana, so you know what to expect. I'm not a huge fan of teppanyaki generally but my fella happens to love it and when I mentioned that Benihana offers a $30 birthday coupon, he told me to sign him up, and what my baby wants, my baby gets.   We came here the evening before his birthday and they took our picture and printed it out for us as a birthday present. We were seated quickly and luckily the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday, so we didn't have to wait long to get the show on the road. My fella got the steak and shrimp and I opted for the spicy chicken hibachi. The prices are much higher than most other teppanyaki places. You can't find anything for less than $25 and most are around $40 if you want anything including steak. Fried rice is also extra.   Our chef was friendly, but it's hard not to notice that pretty much everything he said was scripted. The chef behind him was about 15 minutes behind our table and I heard everything our chef said repeated by the other chef. It was still fun and entertaining, but I've seen better. The food was just ok as well. The steak was a little overcooked and underseasoned, but still tasty. My chicken was nice and spicy, which I enjoyed quite a bit.   They brought out ice cream to everyone at our table, well everyone but me, since they forgot mine, but since I didn't really like the ice cream I tasted from my fella's dish, I didn't bother asking for one for myself. They even included whipped cream, chocolate sauce and a candle for all the people celebrating birthdays.  Overall, it's worth a visit if you have your birthday coupon, but there are plenty of other teppanyaki places that are better and cheaper in town, if you don't."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants,so I hate that I'm only giving this location a 2 Star rating. First of all our chef, Chef Roberto was amazing.Great cook, very funny,had jokes & smiles & GREAT energy.My reason for 2 Stars is that it was my sons 21st birthday & I called days in advance to make the reservation & explained it was for a birthday.My reservation was for 8:00pm & we did not get seated till 9-9:15, which means we didn't start eating till 9:30-9:45.A little too late for my digestive system.Apparently they were short handed of chefs, waiters & staff in general.It would have been nice if they volunteered to comp our drinks or free dessert or something, but they offered nothing for the inconvenience :( I don't think I will return to this location again."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chain restaurants but this location gives you the feel of a local restaurant. Have had the teppenyaki and mostly eat in the sushi bar area.  The manager is always friendly and accomodating. We try to have Sashi serve us as much as possible, she always takes care of us and gives us special treatment.   We try to make it to the half price sushi happy hour which is M - Th until 7:30 pm.  When celebrating a special occasion we will eat in the teppenyaki area which is always entertaining.   The lunch menu is also a great buy if you order the lunch boat which comes with miso soup, salad, entree chicken or beef, california roll, sashimi, eminabe, and rice for around $11.00  Don't forget to sign up for the Chef's Table Club online and for your birthday they will email you a $30 coupon toward your dinner.  This location in the Scottsdale Promenade and has plenty of parking and in a great location with many other high end restaurants.   This is one of our go to restaurants and will continue to go there.  Great food and service always."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We love Japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in Pittsburgh. Nice atmosphere, service was fine, but our dinner was average to poor. The salad dressing was tasteless, the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy.  It tasted more steamed than hot grilled. The shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful. Our chef ( new and slow) compulsively wiped his knives and the grill (which was dirty when we sat down) with a dirty rag?  I guess a lot depends on the chef you get but ours cooked a tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered at the table looked good.   We are not big on the circus atmosphere of Saga, but the Wexford location does have the best hibachi food in Pittsburgh to our taste."}
{"text":"I ordered the tofu steak and so did my daughter. We both suffered severe upset stomachs and by the time we got home we were both running for the bathroom. If you can get sick from tofu then there is something wrong. They aren't too careful about keeping others meat items separate either so if you do decide you want to cleanse your colon and have allergies or are vegetarian/vegan make sure you specify you don't want a steak cooking by your tofu. This place would be cool if they didn't poison their patrons, but going home with a 55 dollar bill for some sliced tofu and an upset stomach? Yea 1 star is generous. I want a refund!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I came here for lunch. Their sashimi and sushi combo is definitely great, but the service definitely needs more work. I ordered an appetizer for lunch. My friend and my main course were already served. Yet, the appetizer was still not ready. I asked the waiter what was going on, and he told me that the kitchen was very back up. This wasn't his fault but I did end up canceling my order. Our server did come over to check up on us, but the entire time he was busy stocking up the bars for the night.   I'm probably come here again for the food....but definitely will not expect any great service. It was disappointing since I haven't been here for a while and hoping that things would change for the better. Apparently not"}
{"text":"We made reservations thinking we'll eat in the beautiful sushi restaurant. We were taken with am elevator upstairs to a small horrible smoky room for teppan. No one warned us. I had trouble breathing in the room trying to eat my overpriced tasteless food. Service was friendly but she kept forgetting our sake, brought me wrong rice and we had a mix up with orders. Other ppl in our table also has issues with getting billed wrong. My clothes and hair smelled SO bad afterwards and my throat is sore. Smokers may have an easier time but other ppl better make sure you get to eat in the restaurant they see downstairs.."}
{"text":"went for a late lunch today. there were probably about 10 other people there. seemed like everyone was there for a birthday. the song they sing is sure to make you feel awkward. then, you get some free pineapple, and they take a digital picture of you, which instantly prints out and gets put into a benihana paper frame. cute.  food is decent, but it's pricey for what it is."}
