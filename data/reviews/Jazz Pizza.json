{"text":"Great restaurant!

My husband and I stumbled upon this place for lunch. Are we ever glad! The owner is so friendly and conscientious! And this restaurant is extremely clean! I am definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Stuck in a less-than-exciting strip mall, Jazz Pizza was a nice surprise. It is a small place, but warm and welcoming. The decor is bright, and modern. TV screens can be a bit distracting but were thankfully muted. (Ambient music was in the background - a bit loud, but not disturbingly so.) Service was very good (it was a quiet evening, though). The beer selection is somewhat limited, but the pizza selection was nearly overwhelming ... and our server let us know that we could also build our own! Many options have a Persian influence, and we opted for a Shirazee salad and the New Jazz Pizza with Persian ground beef. Everything was excellent, and prices were decent. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for over 6 months and I have wanted to try it since I first saw the sign opening soon.. 

I have been here a couple of times since I finally tried it and the atmosphere of this restaurant is amazing. You can tell alot of hard work and love has been put into this restaurant. 

The food here is great, the pizza is delicious! 
The owner is very friendly and is happy to have business. 

I recommend you fellow yelpers to go try Jazz Pizza as he needs business, you wont be disappointed!"}
