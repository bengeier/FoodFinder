{"text":"Ok. I looked up these people and saw their reviews. I also saw that they deliver. Usually a lot of businesses state that they deliver when they don't but what caught my eye is the little paragraph they wrote about themselves explaining why they are so famous and they specifically mention that they deliver. When I called them they not only said that they don't deliver but also failed to explain why they have false and misleading information on their yelp page about delivery. I know it's not a big deal but for someone looking for a delivery service this comes across as fraud."}
{"text":"I didnt mind this place. For a fast food place, this place makes a pretty good burrito. It runs you around $10 for a burrito and a jarritos limona soda drink. I had the beef burrito with refried beans and rice, highly recommended. After writing this review, my mouth started watering and i want another. :D  There's an obvious focus on ingredients, fresh black beans, tomatoes and lettuce are widely employed. Make sure you have it grilled, and make sure you buy a Jarritos, it's a Mexican soda drink."}
{"text":"Pretty good burrito. I ordered a veggie soy burrito because I am a vegan (the cashier said they are vegan).  Felt fulfilled and happy with the taste. Their topping options are limited and the hot sauce is the best part. Perfectly salty and spicy. I would come here again if I was in a rush and looking for a quick meal. Nothing special though."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but service is bad. Don't go if you have any special dietary requirements. I am vegan, so I ordered the bean and cheese burritos and asked for guacamole to be substituted for the cheese (undoubtedly the most expensive ingredient) and sour cream. Nope. There are plenty of places who appreciate my business and would happily make this substitution. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Lets make one thing clear here... its not as good as Burrito Boyz but its not bad either..lol  Firstly, the place is a little small. The seating area is like a small cabin, a little cramped up; but there is sitting if you want to sit and enjoy the burrito there. The seats aren't that bad to sit on.  The food was tasty and there was verity to choose from. The person made the Burrito with love by stuffing it properly and now cheating us on the vegetables, etc. Make sure you identity the spicy level properly as it does tend to get hot up the scale. The Burrito did hold up and did not break which is very good.   Well if you are in the area Decent Mexican food is right here or else go to Deep fried Popeyes Louisiana Juicy Chicken just across the it."}
{"text":"i ordered the chicken burrito and was waiting to pick up toppings .. but i was then given a burrito all wrapped up with all the toppings in them .. they never gave me the options to pick what i want! i didn't wanna argue since there was a line so i left, and never going back"}
{"text":"Best burrito place. My husband and I go there frequently. It's the only place that makes their burritos spicy enough. Plus I think it's much better then burrito boyz."}
{"text":"Was in the area and was craving their chorizo burrito, which I haven't had in some time.  They seem to be under new ownership, and regardless, they don't make it like they used to. As I said in my previous review, the chorizo was great and was cooked to order. Much to my dismay, they took the chorizo from a steam tray and put it right in the burrito. The meat looked strictly steamed and not grilled or fried in any way. I also asked for the spice to be medium as it used to be quite hot.  From the first bite, I knew I was in trouble. Way too much sour cream and sauce. That, along with the cheese made it way too creamy/dairy. The chorizo was barely warm and not an appealing texture being only steamed. They still seem to have the same supplier for the chorizo, so there was still a good taste - but disappointing. In regards to heat, I could barely believe if it was even mild. The overall burrito was: creamy, lukewarm and lacking taste.  Sometimes only a couple steps can throw the whole thing off. If the chorizo was still cooked fresh and I had less sour cream and more salsa, it could've still been good. But they've moved a couple steps in the wrong direction and I'm going the other way."}
{"text":"This was my first burrito spot many years ago. This was the first spot I had my first burrito lol. My cousin who lived in the area bought me here for lunch one day. I ordered the chicken burrito wrap. They usually have the typical toppings included but you can add more of something that isn't included. Makes it easier for people that aren't sure of what they want. They do have other options like bowls, quesadillas, tacos, burritos come in two sizes small and large, just to name a few. The food is always good! Me and my mom were craving a burrito and decided since we were in the area we would try out this spot. We got the chicken burrito for me and the bean, cheese & guacamole burrito for her. We both did get small but even the small one is a lot for us. We were dying half way through the burrito. Loll but it is sooo good. Has to be one of my fav spots!"}
{"text":"This up scale knock off of Burrito Boyz menu is just horrible.  Several issues I can mention of this location, one they don't have a process down for how long to keep the Burrito's on the grill and the meats are all pre cooked and dry for the most part.  It just spells slowness and dis satisfied customers (my burrito was cold in the centre).  They could definitely use a Lean Six Sigma consultant to improve customer satisfaction.  I think one of the most upsetting things was the service, the Cashier seemed to be the only one who knew what was going on. As he passed the order on to the girl making the burritos, there was a lack of transparency and no sense that they gave a s**t about the customer.  Then there was the manager just gabbing away to customers who seemingly hadn't purchased anything.  Maybe this was a one off, but is enough for me not to want to give them my business for a while.    The only innovative thing they had was a nacho style burrito, which has nacho cheese and tortilla chips crushed up in the burrito. Beyond that they are at most a dollar off from Burrito boyz prices but do have a sit down area and a small patio area.  I cannot recommend this place.  I hope they get their s**t together."}
{"text":"Love it more than BurritoBoyz because of the ground beef option. It is a little cheaper than BurritoBoyz but after branching out to more options, i especially love the chorizo burrito. Absolutely get a little in every bite. The staff are pretty nice, enjoy the music/radio they play indoor & out, and food is prepared quickly. Absolutely love it and I'd come back anytime when I'm feeling for some Mexican."}
{"text":"Disappointed... in both service and food. I have eaten here a few times and generally find it good... but yesterday night at 8:30pm was the final straw.  They made my burritos (3) with pinto beans and when I stated I wanted black beans his answer was... \"It's already made\" and \"they are really popular\"... I do not care if everyone likes something... I the paying customer HATE pinto beans, since I have had it many times before, I think I would know what I eat and like. He made no offer to redo them, but I was ok with reordering 2 with black beans and paying again.  What upset me most was...I ordered 3  fries and they literally shared 1 order of fries into three boxes (I have ordered it 3 times before and the quantity was +++). After paying $85+ for 5 burritos, 3 fries and 3 tacos and 4 drinks, I unfortunately feel like this was the last trip for me.  There was no rice in 1 of the burritos, very little cheese, and barely any meat in any of the burritos, just an overall disappointing experience. If you didn't have enough meat etc to fill the order you should have said so instead of the horribly made presentation you provided to make a quick $. They are too cheap with the filling, unapologetic and very expensive for literally crap service and very small portions.  I suspect we would have received better quality and portion sizes had I not ordered so much... because they would not have tried to spread out everything like they did.  Pinto beans were just as unappealing as I remember them to be.  Possibly the worst experience I have ever had at this establishment, but I am willing to give them another chance, as 1 off day shouldn't over shadow the past good experience."}
{"text":"Well living in California for years, it was pretty common thing to go out for mexican food twice a week. Canada lacks those cantinas places I hungout in Austin and the bay area, but I came across a  place called Bar Burrito in Brampton. It's a new chain that has opened up and is spreading it's way across Canada.  The food was pretty dam tasty. I tried the large pulled pork burrito, the meat was very flavorful, and tender I order mine spicy, and it didn't disappoint on heat department!!!  The rice was alittle too wet, but overall I thought the flavors were outstanding. i'm going back to try the soft tacos next.   So if your in the Brampton boonies, and crave good mexican food, you gotta check this place out. Unlike the other mexican place down on Queen they serve pork, what Mexican chain woudn't have pork on their menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The staff are super friendly and accommodating.  There's one older lady who often works there the nights I go there, and she is the sweetest and friendliest staff member I've ever met.  The food tastes fresh and great and always satisfies my appetite.  The only thing missing here (though I think this a chain issue, not just this particular store) is they need a salad bowl option.  They have burrito bowls in a pita bowl (which is awesome), but there are some nights I prefer just a regular bowl of the toppings instead of wasting the pita bowl.  So I hope BarBurrito adds that someday :).  I'll continue to keep coming here all the time."}
{"text":"Not bad... menu is a bit limited compared to Fat Bastards Burritos.  Their fish tacos was really good!  I find the tacos were more on the small side... for the price value.  Its ok... staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We order ubereats from this place at least once a week and we are always very happy with our meals. Their food is always nice and fresh. The orders are always correct.  I am very sensitive to spicy food which usually turns me off of Mexican food, but I always request it to be made mild which nothing spicy and it always is.  We had an incident where ubereats delivered the wrong order and I could not get a hold of anyone at ubereats to correct it, so I called Bar Burrito and the manager was very helpful and accommodating.  The burritos are always a very good size with lots of filling, but never fall apart when you are eating them. We love this place. We are hooked and will always return."}
{"text":"Helpful fast friendly staff Fresh tasting Had the chicken,chicken and beef and extreme fries + 2 drinks=$29 Roughly 20 seats"}
