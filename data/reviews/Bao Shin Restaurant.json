{"text":"Yum! They're chicken corn soup is so great. Some of the best I've ever had. Also the Chinese rice was superb. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 was because the take out was a little messy and disorganized."}
{"text":"Indian Hakka Chinese restaurant. Small and neat interior. The food is decent fit their price. I'd recommend their Manchurian dishes"}
{"text":"This is the worst Hakka chinese restaurant period. The service is bad, the female server with short hair is very rude. Hair in the chilly chicken and she won't even apologize. Never going back ever."}
{"text":"I used to like this place... not anymore.  Their standard has gone down considerably.  The fried rice was a sticky mess the chilly chicken was runny and full of sinews.  Will not recommend or go there any more"}
{"text":"This is our second visit and our first Yelp review. 

This visit, we ordered Tofu Ma Po, which is a dish of stir-fried soft tofu in a spicy black bean sauce. It was delicious! Exactly as described. The tofu was soft not mushy (I had been expecting crispy tofu so was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't) and the flavour made this dish the star of our meal. 

We also ordered Manchurian Vegetables, which are veggie pakoras in a spicy sauce. We think the sauce might have changed from our last time visit (*sniff*). This dish was the main reason I had wanted to come back. Once I got over my disappointment (LOL), I still ate a lot of it. The dish was still good, and the sauce this time had more of sweet and sour flavour than a Manchurian flavour. 

To complement the two dishes, we ordered a veggie fried rice and was shocked by the generous portion. With a mix of fresh and frozen veggies, the rice was properly cooked and was tasty on its own. 

Overall, three dishes was plenty of food for three people. We took home two meals in leftovers, and overall, enjoyed good food at good prices... we'll be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"The flavors,  the texture, the spices.... YUMMY! I come here A LOT and I must say that they never disappoint. I would suggest the chicken pakora as it is on a different level... Recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2004 when I lived closer to this location and honestly I still come here for their chicken soup, manchurian chicken and fried rice. Hands down Bao Shin nailed the Hakka cuisine for an affordable price and good quantity. I do wish they had more space since it can tend to get busy and barely room to sit."}
{"text":"Every item is tastful. Try chicken chilli. Manchurian. Shrimp fried rice. Soups. You will love it."}
{"text":"Good hakka Chinese food and generous quantity compared to prices. Overall a good experience and taste ."}
{"text":"I love Bao Shin. Of all the Hakka Restaurants in Mississauga, this will always be my favourite. Nothing can compare. I used them for my wedding. The portions are huge. The price is great. Most would be turned off by the location and brutal decor, but the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Bao shin is gone! De roof exploded Cuz the chilli chicken was too HOT! Please come back Bao Shin we need you! But less spicy makes everything safer."}
{"text":"Finally gave this hidden gem a try! If you're craving tasty Halal Hakka style food, head to Bao Shin Restaurant - their proportions are huge for fair prices. I tried out their chicken fried rice and spicy kung pao chicken mixed with steamed veggies, peanuts, and chili peppers"}
{"text":"Delicious hakka food, and the price is very cheap! I decided to dine in with a friend (during the evening) a while back and we were shocked by the enormous serving size - one dish was enough for two people!! What I found the most remarkable was the amount of chicken in our dishes. Moreover, the lady at the cash was soft spoken but very kind.

I don't eat Hakka regularly, but to me, it seemed that there was no compromise on quality, while maintaining a very good price! They do have a very nice variety of dishes but try to catch a special if you can. 

A word of warning, the plaza where Bao Shin is located has limited parking spots, so try to avoid this area during weekend nights."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Pakoras are plain amazing. Would definitely recommend those! We also ordered a manchurian chicken but it did not taste like it should be. It tasted more on the sour side... Would only get the pakoras next time."}
{"text":"Amazing quantity and quality for a very reasonable price. Authentic hakka cuisine. Been going there for a hakka fix since 2005 and haven't had a single bad experience. Owners are a husband and wife team that excel in cuisine and service. Be prepared to wait for a table if you visit on a weekend. The place is generally packed in the evening."}
{"text":"If you want feel taste fresh don't buy the lunch special. The place need to be clean more."}
