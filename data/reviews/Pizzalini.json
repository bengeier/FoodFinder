{"text":"Fantastic pizza! Had the meat lovers and they really don't hold back on the amount of meat. The house wine is also very good. Busy around dinner and they don't miss a beat. I would recommend everyone try out this gem!"}
{"text":"Gryos on pizza?  If only it was as good as my imagination had promised.  The pizza wasn't very flavorful, the crust was dry and thick, the bottom was soggy.  I don't mind eating a pizza with a fork and knife if I must, but this wasn't doing it for me."}
{"text":"Great food for amazing price.   14$ for soup and lamb chops.  5.50$ for beer.    Service is very good"}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza very often, as I save it for rewarding myself. But when I do, I order the meat lovers pizza at Pizzalini. Hands down the best meat lovers pizza I've ever had, and the only one I'd recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Group of us came in for Friday lunch. I had the gyro platter lunch special. It was a LOT of food. Way more than I could eat. Came with a pea soup which was excellent. Gyro, salad, rice, fries, water and coffee came to $13.37 Canadian with tax."}
