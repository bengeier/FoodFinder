{"text":"I heard raves about onion rings being so good. I was a bit disappointed when I tried their onion rings. It tastes ok...not terrible but no seasoning to it. I like the A.&W.'s onion rings the best. Crispy and firm at most A&W's. Peter's were simple and bland. Maybe a bit like back in the 50's?  The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor. It didn't taste like real ice cream shake to me. I won't rave about it but don't hate it there. It's not a place I would want to go as top thing to do when in the area. Food is decent though."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years & never will again - this place was the absolute worst food poisoning I've had in my life, not once but twice - the only 2 times I ever ate there, even after my first experience & a colleague convincing me how great it was only to here of others having the same experience I did. First time shame on them, second time shame on me"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. The burger is delicious. The onion rings are pretty good. The milkshake is SO GOOD. I had the marshmallow milkshake. The thickens of the shake goes very well with the marshmallow. The price is pretty good. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I'm afraid that Peter's is really overrated. There's nothing special about the food, although the location is convenient and it's nice to sit and eat in the parking lot on a summer's night. When I first moved to Calgary 15 years ago, people raved about it, and I found it didn't live up to the ravings. I guess I don't have the childhood memories to go with it :-) The staff is quick and efficient, although the washrooms are a little dodgy.  If I want a good burger, I'd rather drive to Edmonton for Red Robin's or go nearby to Boogie's Burgers. Tommy's Burger Bar is also a better choice."}
{"text":"My experience with the food and milkshakes at Peters Drive-in is always a good tasty experience. Every time You go to Peters you have to get a milkshake I really recommend this more than any other thing on the menu. But there is a really big downside that is not convenient for anyone that is in a hurry just because there is at least a minimum of 10mins to a maximum of a 1 hour wait. But if you want to get your food fast, it's faster to stay in the drive-through only if there is a big line outside of the building."}
{"text":"Came for a burger...not impressed. Stayed for the shake...the only thing that's great about this place. So disappointing after hearing about how great it was from born and raised Calgarians."}
{"text":"I love the milk shakes! MMM MMMM Coconut is my favourite! My boyfriend got a burger and fries even after I told him he wouldn't like it. He took two bites of his burger and threw it out. I paid for lunch so I was not impressed.  Gross burgers and fries. YAY milkshakes. That is all."}
{"text":"S'good. Apple pie shakes. Yaa maan."}
{"text":"If you ever want a milkshake THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. The milkshakes they make are thick, creamy and delicious. You can pick up to 3 flavours to put in your milkshake. I like Oreo chocolate marshmallow.  As for the burgers, they are ok it really depends who's making them, sometimes they are over sauced on a big bun and tiny tiny patty and other times its a perfect delicious burger, I find you should order a double patty + double cheese and easy sauce.    Fries fries fries... They are usually really limp, not crispy and very bland. I usually need to get extra salt packets. They recently added poutine to the menu and they use different fries for the poutine... And might I just say it is DELICIOUS! Huge cheese curds, lots of gravy all over fries! :)   Onion rings are also a hit or miss, sometimes there fresh and sometimes there old, but always good until cold.    So all in all, get a milkshake, and some poutine. Onion rings and burgers are a gamble.  Bring cash, they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Nothing beats Peters Drive in on those warm summer nights, although it's extremely unhealthy the burgers are unlike any other( in the best possible way)."}
{"text":"Peter's Drive-In is a Calgary classic that delivers big taste and even bigger portions. The single burger is actually a patty and a half, and it's coated in what I've heard referred to as a \"secret sauce\", which tastes remarkably just like ketchup. I don't know exactly for whom the flavor of ketchup is a secret, but I digress.  I once made the mistake of ordering the large fries, which turned out to be a mountain of mediocre fries held in their small box by a tinfoil tent. They were like Jiffy Pop fries, which I barely made a dent in, and afterwards regretted ordering. However, what the fries lack in quality, the onion rings and milkshakes more than make up for. The onion rings are crispy and delicious, and the shakes are thick and creamy and come in about thirty different flavors. I've certainly had a better burger, but you simply cannot have a better true Calgary experience than visiting Peter's Drive-In - it's part of the initiation of living in this city!"}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of Peter's for decades and as long as Gus Peters owned it, quality and service were consistently good. Gus sold the business several years ago and quality was about the same until recently. We have noticed that the quality of the burgers and fries has been slipping in the past several months. In the past, the meat always fit the bun. Not anymore! Last night's burger patty was 1/2 an inch in from the edge of the bun. Fries were okay although they are now more like shoestring fries. Milkshakes are still the same and still delicious. May be awhile before we return for burgers."}
{"text":"While visiting my family out in Calgary, they took me to Peter's Drive-In. It looked like a real deal drive-in not like Sonic drive-in. We ordered at the windows outside, which was neat but being from California I was freezing! I really liked the chocolate shake, the burger is okay but nothing special, and also I didn't like the fries. Overall, I had a great experience but I still like In-n-Out more!"}
{"text":"Milkshakes are so thick that the straws go flat when you try to drink it right away. The key is to let it melt down a bit. So delicious and a huge size for only $4.75 what a deal! The burgers are decent but nothing overly impressive. But the milkshakes.... what can I say... they are the most amazingly thick delicious drink that you could possibly ever try, and with an assortment of flavors/combination of flavors it will keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The best thing to get at Peters' is the milkshakes, hands-down. The burgers, fries, onion rings... I can pass on. Combining and testing the different milkshake flavours is quite fun, if you're into that kind of thing.  I think that Peters' Drive-In is 'famous' in Calgary because there isn't anything else quite like it in the area; it's an experience. It isn't the best, but hey, it's Peters'."}
{"text":"Milkshakes, milkshakes, milkshakes.   This is really the only thing on the menu I will order. Not to say the rest is terrible, I am just not a fan of fast food.   Note: When you order fries and ask for a large, it is actually huge and will feed a family of at least six people."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since I was last at Peter's, and boy has it gone downhill. The burgers are thin cardboard slabs drowned in sauce - probably in hopes of infusing moisture, but just making them messy and unmanageable. The only good thing about them was the bun. The onion rings were fine, but the fries were skinny and seemed to resemble McDonald's more than the former Peter's fries. The milkshakes were mega thick but the flavours were chemical tasting. I used to love their orange shakes, but it tasted like mega syrup - too much at the bottom perhaps? Even my daughter said her chocolate shake tasted strange and she used to love those. All in all a disappointment. This is no longer the Calgary institution it used to be - just another fast food chain. Give me a Harvey's hamburger over it any day.   And NOTE:  it's CASH only - no debit or credit cards.  There are signs everywhere, but people still seem to ignore them."}
{"text":"despite all the hype about this place its very overrated! I have been there 4 times now because my husband loves the food, each time they get my order wrong! I always order the same thing: single cheese burger with lettuce,tomato, ketchup,mustard. and every time they forget at least 3 of those things! i've ordered a cheese burger 4 times and have never gotten one! The fries we got were cold and weren't even cooked! they were like chewy cardboard! absolutely disgusting! They called our number \"29\" we went to the window and they gave us our milkshakes and said \"your food is coming\". They called our number 3 more times after this and each time we went to the window they said \"oh you got you milkshakes?\" we said \"yes but we havent gotten our food\" this happened 4 TIMES all together! They would look at our order paper then just walk away and not come back while everyone else behind us got their complicated orders! Every time i come here the service is HORRIBLE! and they always get my order wrong! I will not be coming back unless i feel like standing outside for 40minutes for an incorrect order and getting my car hit in the VERY SMALL parking lot. This place is a huge rip off for how much they charge and how awful the quality of food is."}
{"text":"I worked for Gus in high school about 36 years ago and have always returned to support this business. The last couple of times I've noticed the staff don't move too fast anymore and line ups are longer. We can't blame it on debit as there are lots of machines and that is the not it.  Sorry to see a thriving business become sleepy and slow. Owners FYI your missing cash flow and customers, as not everyone is patient."}
{"text":"My main problem with Peters' is that everything only comes in size \"very large\"..seems like a waste for me to order any icecream products because I know I will throw out half of it. But I can't deny that I love the bubblegum milkshakes, so if someone is willing to eat/drink my leftovers I am always up for a trip.  Get a small size, Peters'!"}
{"text":"I'll admit to being one of those people does like Peter's burgers and onion rings and shakes over others in Calgary. Heck, I'd rather pay $10 here and have a burger and a shake than wait around in an alley in DT!   I love the Peter's DriveIn Burgers - because they taste like burgers! Strange concept, I know - but to me they taste like something I would make at home and the condiments etc just add to a very nostalgic feeling for me.   Onion rings are second or on par perhaps with A&W's, but generally are fresh and all sorts of deep-fried goodness.   Now the milkshakes -are amazing of course, the best being the rootbeer flavoured milkshake - like the leftover rootbeer and milk you get from a float. Divine! But did you know that you can order a small milkshake which is $1 less, and is a lot smaller - so if you don't want to pack on 2000 calories of goodness, you'd only have to pack on maybe 1250?!  So, there are those that talk about the 'burger' wars from one drive-in/ retro restaurant to another - but Peter's is a go-to for me - open late, consistent quality and service and very quick to move through lines as well.   Peter's - I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"If I could give this a 1/2 star I would. I was told I had to go here that it was amazing. The lineups were huge so I thought that this place must be really good. I was sadly disappointed. The milkshakes were not good, the burgers tasted like cheap no name burgers, and the onion rings were ok but extremely greasy. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"The food bag says since 1962 the drive in you can't drive by........ Well it has been over a year since I was last there and today..... Still bad! Drive by...head to any other place, I was in the area around 7 and thought what the hell I will give it a go again, bad idea the burger was tasteless even with all the sauce making a mess the burger was blah ! The bun fresh but tasteless, the fries... Them fries.. I thought would be still good.... Nope soggy hot but no crisp to it.. I really wanted everything to be as good as I remembered it but no.... So I will not be going back or recommending it to out of towners any more. The place still has line ups, so I'm guessing some people still like it.. But go else where... Try something new do not just go there because you \"think\" you should..... Just drive by......"}
{"text":"I love Peter's. Its nothing fancy, and there is always a line up, but you tend to move quickly. Ive always gone for the ice cream and fries, which they serve in huge portions. The banana split is ginormous.  There's something about the vibe of the place, when its busy, especially at if you're there at night. Just a fun place to be, because you can tell everyone is enjoying their treats."}
{"text":"The burgers are crap. Fries meh, onion rings meh. But I love love love the ice cream products. Just eat at McDonald's and come here for dessert."}
{"text":"Had been years since I last ate there, I now remember why. The burgers were soaked in ketchup making the bun soggy, patties tasted like frozen ones from the groceries store. The milkshakes were good, that would be the ONLY reason to go back."}
{"text":"Peter's was suggested by a friend as a destination spot for milkshakes. I highly trust all of his opinions and suggestions. Except for the time I asked for a great spot to eat in Calgary and he suggested...Tubby Dog. Nothing against...Tubby Dog. It was just a shock. And slightly weird. Why would he suggest...Tubby Dog. Anyway I digress.  First: watch your parking. Because there is limited space. You might be able to \"drive-in\" but the \"drive-out\" is a course in navigation. Was happy for my rear-view camera. Always busy. Second: the shakes are thick, tasty and last for quite some time. Best part of this day was having that same shake and walking McHugh Bluff and taking in a beautiful sight of downtown Calgary and the Bow River.   Check out Peter's. It is worth the drive. Then go here @ http://bit.ly/yu80NH for a sweet capper to your day."}
{"text":"Peter's is always packed with people on weekends and sometimes on a weeknight it's lined up like a movie theatre with nothing to explain for it at all except that they make pretty decent original hamburgers. And their wide variety of milkshakes probably helps, too. I've eaten some good burgers in my day and these ones are right up there with the best. They actually throw a patty and half on a delicious bun for a single burger covered in their famous sauce. The women who work there look like old cafeteria ladies with hairnets and pastel uniforms, but it gives Peter's a timeless feel. It kinda reminds you of the 50s and I don't imagine they've changed much since they first opened. But they don't have to, they've perfected their system and their burgers. Everyone in this city loves these burgers. They can't all be wrong...."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the passable milkshakes, this place would have gotten only one star.  Bland squishy burgers and soggy fries, sadly MacDonalds does a better job and that's really not saying very much.  Yes it's an institution but seriously you should have the food to back it up."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom.... nuff said.    Not spectacular, yet brilliantly spectacular for its quality, cost, and perfectly executed, decades enduring, unique experience."}
{"text":"First, let's clear up one thing: notwithstanding its name, Peters' is not a drive in.  It has a drive through, and a walk-up counter. I don't know anyone who ever remembers it being a drive-in.  Peters' holds a special place in the hearts of many Calgarians because its long history conjures up memories of picnic tables and family outings, or late night gnosh with friends of youth.  The line at the counter is almost as accurate a measure of Calgary's temperature as a thermometer. For more recent arrivals to the city, it's a little harder to tell what all the fuss and long lines are about.  The hamburger patties are indistinguishable from the frozen pre-forms you'd buy at the grocery store, but on the plus side, a \"single\" actually gets you 1.5 patties (on an unremarkable bun).  The regular ketchup, mustard and relish are supplemented by nicely fried diced onion.  I would not go out of my way for this hamburger, BUT where Peters' does distinguish itself is in the accompaniments.    In particular, I get the onion rings, because while most restaurants barely give you enough rings to fashion an edible Olympic logo, here you must get at least 25.  The fries are similarly plentiful -- the only reasonable occasion to buy a \"family size\" fries is to cater a family reunion.    The other distinguishing accompaniment at Peters' is the milk shake.  It's available in umpteen flavours from blackberry to butter rum, and you can combine them to create delicious combos (though probably not the two I just mentioned!). The shake has the right viscosity: not so thick people will think you're having an asthma attack, not so runny you'll get brain freeze. All in all, Peters' is an OK spot for a hamburger, but a better spot for a shake and rings."}
{"text":"If I were to use just one word to describe this place, Fantastic comes to mind. If you want a no nonsense service, best value and a special taste of Calgary, you can not go wrong with Peter's Drive-in. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Delicious milk shakes and ginormous proportions of french fries. Be prepared--they only take cash."}
{"text":"This place is a legend in Calgary. Whatever you do, save room for a milkshake. The wait lines may be long, and it'll be worth it. You're not buying quality food here, you're buying quantity, atmosphere and the chance to experience a local legend. This isn't gourmet, it's old school fast food with a 50s feel.  Note: Cash only."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious! The onion rings are great, I haven't had a burger from there in a long time though - I don't really like to eat beef. The milkshakes are amazing! So many different kinds, but strawberry banana is the best. I'm ok with paying $5 for the biggest milkshake ever."}
{"text":"A Calgary Icon. But to be honest, aside from the Milkshakes (which are good) there's nothing special about it. I always get so excited to go, but the fries are flavorless and the burgers are always soggy and have an oniony flavor even if you get no onions (total mystery to me). I think that the Calgary food scene has expanded enough that we can do better. If you want a cheap, fast, interesting burger, you'll be happier with Clive Burger, or Burger 320, or Boogey's Burgers.   It pains me to say this, since I'm a born and raised Calgarian, and this was one of my favorite teenage hangouts. But the soggy burgers have gotta stop. I'm putting my foot down. Sorry Pete. You'll always have a (soggy) place in my heart."}
{"text":"Good burgers however gst used to be included in the menu price and now is added on to it.If you're going to increase the price be upfront about it. This is a sly way to increase the price."}
{"text":"A must-eat Calgary landmark. Line-up appeared huge... but dread naught intrepid burger fans, it moved at a good pace. Note that this is a drive-thru restaurant so the only seating available is outdoors at 2 tables. Burger was solid and satisfying with fresh condiments and not a drippy tasteless mess like you often get handed. Small fries and onion rings come in huge portions. And then there's the shakes... phenomenal product offered in mind-numbing combinations. Sadly they missed one of my flavours which we should've caught at the pickup window.  But still it was awesome. Very glad we went."}
{"text":"Little overrated, but okay. Needs to keep up with the times and take other forms of payment besides cash. Who carries cash anymore?"}
{"text":"Peters is classic, if your in the mood for a classic sloppy burger, onion rings, and a shake this is the place to go. .. Just remember they only take cash"}
{"text":"A must-do in Calgary! Love this place. Don't order a large fries, the regular size is huge. And don't pass on the milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"Drive-ins like this are so rare these days. Before I moved to Canada, I'd only seen them in films (further proving my point that 'everything in North America is just like the movies!!').   I was taken here during Stampede in 2010 and considering it was one of the days where it didn't rain during that summer, Peters' was kind of packed. We managed to snag a bench, though. Because it was my first time there, it was my birthday, and I'm me, I tried the burger, fries, onion rings and milkshake. I won't lie, the burger was pretty delicious, but nothing spectacular if you're used to the gourmet burgers food trucks seem to be churning out as of late. The onion rings here are great and the fries do what fries are supposed to do. However, the real star of this place is the milkshakes. Anytime we're back in calgary, we swing by and pick up a milkshake to go. There's hundreds (literally) of different flavours and they've got everything from blueberry to marshmallow. My favourite is the chocolate, chocolate, and orange. Pro tip: The chocolate isn't that chocolatey, so if you want it in your shake, double up. Otherwise, the other flavours will drown it out.  This was also the fateful night that I discovered mosquitoes don't like me, so it really was a rather pleasant evening -- burgers and a dash of schadenfreude. Four stars just because of the milkshakes. If they didn't have those, it would definitely be a three-star place."}
{"text":"Messy burgers. Tasty shakes. Good fries and rings. Cold ice creamy shakes. On the KuKu scale, 5 out of 10."}
{"text":"Sundaes were very good. Ice cream was incredibly soft, though I wonder how much whip cream and fattening calories were in though.... Syrup was very good, loved the berries. Overall very nice pick-me-up."}
{"text":"Peter's Drive-In got pretty good, moist (and BIG!) burgers, and milkshakes are must try! Even though there's always long lineups but it's always under 5 min wait. Much better than those fast food burger chains!"}
{"text":"Great place for food when you are really hungry! The large fries are like a bloody shopping basket and the burgers are so yummy that you WILL go back. However as nice as the burgers and fries are, the one thing that keeps me rocking back to this 50's looking place is the milkshakes! Almost every flavor you can think of is here to be whipped into your sweet large shake!  Now the only bad side of Peters is the dodgy crappy sides you get.. I found the onion rings over cooked and greasy, cheese dog is just a little frankferter which you can hear screaming from the proccessed cheese sauce.   So if you are heading along 16th and you feeling hungry STOP HERE!"}
{"text":"Peter's is a Calgary institution and if you don't know it... well, why the hell not?   I try really REALLY hard to stop here at least once whenever I visit my hometown (sadly, didn't make it my last trip), and I often get cravings when I'm back home in Vancouver which really isn't helpful.  Surprisingly, I'm not really in it for the milkshakes. WAY too big and thick for my taste (though I won't hesitate to order a Coke float to get my ice cream fix instead and it's nice to know that if I really wanted a marshmallow/raspberry/mint milkshake I could get it. Not that I ever would). What are the cravings for then? Why, the burgers! One of the only fast food places I know of who use bbq sauce on their burgers and that makes  them sooo good. Plus, I find it really weird and awesome that a \"single\" burger actually consists of 1.5 patties. Hmmm.  But my main vice? Dude, the onion rings. There's only one size and it's huge, so plan on sharing with a friend or 2, but holy crap they're good. And this is coming from someone who DOESN'T. EVER. eat onions. The only way, in fact, is in ring form, specifically from Peter's. So that's saying something.  Plan on being in a very long line (both for the drive-through and standing at the order window) especially in the summer on a nice day or night, but they've got their system down pat so it really doesn't ever take too long to get through it. And last I knew, they only take cash or debit, so plan on that."}
{"text":"Very normal burgers, if you are hoing for ice cream or milkcheck it is above average. The atmosphear is excelent and the staff are A+ :)"}
{"text":"Burgers were toooo sloppy, fries were overcooked and bitter, wished there was less of them! I remember I enjoyed Peter's food 'once' about 2 years ago...  Now that I have been disappointed a few times in a row over the past couple of months, I don't think it's worth going back until something's changed."}
{"text":"I was chilling in my friend's place when suddenly he had a craving for milkshakes. Then, Peters' Drive-In came to mind. We had to go. Thankfully, it was around 11:30PM on a Sunday night, so there was barely anyone there. I've seen how busy it gets, and I don't think the place would be worth enduring a 60 minute wait for.   I had a cherry/vanilla/root beer milkshake, hoping that I could replicate cherry vanilla coke which I absolutely adored in my childhood. I was mistaken. Still delicious though. I also had a burger, which I would compare to a gourmet McDonald's burger (if such a thing existed). Decent tasting beef patty, fluffy buns, nice helping of ketchup, relish and mustard, and pickles to boot. I would go again, but only if there was no one in line."}
{"text":"More sizzle than grade \"B\" beef I'm afraid.  IMO Peter's makes its money largely on reputation and longetivity rather than quality.  Peter's kills any claim that I could otherwise make to being a logical human being.  For some reason I stop there almost every time I go to Calgary, even though I don't really like it all that much.  It just seems like an obligation.  I guess that I still enjoy the novelty of walking up to the window to place my order.  Or maybe its because I can get a chocolate, mouthwash, and bourbon milkshake  Peter's does have passable burgers, fries, and milkshakes.  And they have rightfully gained notoriety for serving almost comically sized shoebox portions of fries.  But the quality of the food just doesn't match the hype.  Perhaps it is due to the large order volumes they continually have to pump out.    The cash only transactions may seem old-fashioned and nifty to some, but likely a dubious veil to the Canada Revenue Agency."}
{"text":"Have been going to Peter's off and on for 30 years. Nothing like charbroiled burgers, the fries and onion rings are delicious.  Always hot, never stale or soggy!  Now that they take debit, it's twice as convenient to load up!"}
{"text":"Maybe I don't get it.  You get a huge portion of fries, but they're bad. There's no interact payment, so you have to have cash on hand, and if you're a vegetarian, you're basically screwed. I really don't understand the appeal of this place."}
{"text":"Ran to the Ground. This place use to be a great burger joint with large portions and decent quality, now it seems like they tried to cheap out on the quality. The milkshakes can be good but can be bad., I much rather go to starbucks and pay the same price for standardized drink that does not fluctuate in quality. The same story is with the burgers, sometime they are good but when they are busy, they lose the consistency."}
{"text":"I drive by this place a couple times a week and see it lined up all the time so I decided to try it out.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  After standing in line for 65 minutes waiting to order I ordered the cheese burger and fries.  I threw the burger out after two bits.  It's pretty much all bun and the patty is probably 1.5 to 2 oz.  Imagine putting a piece of beef jerky in a giant soft soggy bun.  The fries were under cooked and cold.  I had about 7 of them...they also went in the garbage.  I saw a lot of people having milkshakes...maybe I should have skipped the food and just had a shake.  If you want a good fast food burger just go to 5 guys.   This place was disgusting!!!!  I couldn't figure out how to give it a zero star rating.  By far the worst food experience in Calgary since 1991."}
{"text":"milkshakes are the best and giant. Burgers are heavy on the bun."}
{"text":"The hype for this place perhaps makes me enjoy it less. Pretty good onion rings and shakes, but there is something to be desired from the sloppy burgers I've tried. I will continue to be willing to give it extra chances, though."}
{"text":"If you get a large fries be warned... It's massive. Burgers are a bit sloppy, as can be expected from a drive in. Milkshakes are super thick but good, and you can mix three flavors"}
{"text":"There is no reason that this place is busy. The burgers, fries and onion rings are just plain awful. Don't do it. Not only is the food well below any edible standards, the service is absolutely awful. This place seems to be busy all the time and customer service now doesn't have to be top of mind since it doesn't seem to matter. people still flock to this place only because it \"used to be\" an icon.   The folks at the windows taking and delivering your order to you have no idea the meaning of Thank You! Yet, it's still lined up.   Now, the milkshakes are OK not great but t they have lots of flavours. That is the only reason to go here however it is not good enough to line up around the block. Calgary, lets get real here. The food and the service is well below what is acceptable. It will not get any better if this city continues to patronize this business."}
{"text":"I have so many memories of going here as a child with my father and siblings before heading out to the mountains for skiing. Even though the food is mediocre (burgers are passable, fries were decent). The milkshakes though-- AMAZING. Huge, delicious, and tonnes of flavours. Ridiculously thick (which can be an issue).     Definitely has a fun, retro atmosphere. I really like this place."}
{"text":"Whether you live in Calgary, or you're like us and just end up there over the summer (checking out the zoo, or passing through on our way to Vancouver or Seattle or the mountains) this is a summertime staple.  On hot days the lines are a bit on the long side, but the service is great. Eat in your car with the window rolled down, find a grassy place to sit, or if you're lucky snag up one of the picnic tables.  The prices are amazing for the quantity and quality of food you get. This is a retro burger shack in every sense. MIlkshakes so thick you are in heaven and burgers a grown man would have difficulty finishing.   Kids love this place, heck - everyone loves this place!  *Onion rings = YUMMMMMM! *Don't forget you can combo milkshake flavors, so have fun with that!  Do it."}
{"text":"Over rated. Sorry.   Like most Canadians and their national self-identity, Calgarians are really good with myths, and they're even better at perpetuating them. \"Calgary's Frontier Cowboy Heritage\" (lolz),  \"Calgary is a truly global and cosmopolitan city\", \"The Stampede is the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth\", \"Calgary- Heart of the New West\", etc. Peters' is the \"best place for food\" is also one of those myths.  Yes, Peters has had a \"long\" (ie: few decade) history with Calgary, albiet, not at that very location. But there's nothing unique or sensational about it that should make it #1. Well, actually, considering the terrible food options here in Calgary, yeah... it's probably the best LANDMARK place for food here, because we have no good landmark places. The thing is, landmarks with such a bloated reputation like this should have something unique about them: you know, fresh cut fries using potatoes from nearby, hand-made burger patties from a cow slaughtered a 20 min drive from the place, burger buns baked on site, etc. Peters is none of that. Hell, no one that works there knows who \"Peter\" is! The damn place has undergone various managerial changes over the years which further epitomizes the lack of character this joint has. The food is adequate at best: they serve obviously frozen fries (i realized this before i saw them take a shrink-wrapped bag of fries out of the freezer and dump them into the fryer), the burgers are like any other burger you can get (although they give you 50% more beef than you paid for! woooowww!), and sorry kids, while the milk shakes and dairy are great (with lots of varieties) they are not so good they are \"the only reason to ever set foot in Calgary\".   The experience.... uh... yeah, it epitomizes Calgary. You need a car to get to it, and even then, it's automobile oriented. Even in nice weather, you can either walk up to the window (where there is no line up) and get your food in 2 minutes, or you can wait in the drive-through with the rest of Calgarians seeking an \"authentic\" experience, and wait 15 minutes. To the south is a parking lot so you can further enjoy your Peters experience secluded from any other humans (or wild life, if they can find a way around the 7ft high wooden security fence) and to the north is a lawn separating the place from the trans-canada highway. There are picnic benches that I am amazed people actually use, considering the idling vehicles and speaker-box chatter in a drive-thru on one end, and the noise from cars zooming by at 60-80kph on the trans-canada just a stone's throw away. It's a pitifully undesirable outside food experience considering what they could have done for the public good to the south (where the useless parking lot is), but because Calgarians are so used to mediocrity and half-assedness, they just settle for it. It truly epitomizes the sad state of our city.   If I'm driving by and have a hankerin' for a milkshake, I'll stop by. But otherwise, this place is really nothing special and not worth your time unless you're around it, and the only chance you'll be on 16th is to get in or out of Calgary. If Peter's relocates somewhere nice (ie: not across from an esso and minit lube), make the parking lot into a nice park that humans can enjoy, and put some fucking vision into what they are serving their customers, **maybe** I'll say something nice. Otherwise, this place is just an over rated CB's drive-in.  What further bugs me is the demeanor of people who work there. There is nothing special about them. While they border on rude at times, they are never friendly or act in a way that is memorable. Again, this place is a (supposed) landmark but the staff wear hospital scrubs and do nothing but serve the food. It's soul-less and bureaucratic. There's no pizzaz, no yelling, no ridiculousness that you'd see at Pink's or pretty much every place you can get take out in Chicago. In-n-Out (a freakin' chain, people!) employs VERY friendly people and they are never short staffed. You don't get this at a \"landmark\" place like this.  In'n'out is about 14x better than this place in every regard: burgers, millkshakes, and service.   If you're genuinely baffled by what I am saying, go to any Whataburger or In-n-Out, preferably In-n-Out's location 500 metres east of runway 24R & 24L at LAX;  http://www.airliners.net/photo/Korean-Air/Boeing-747-4B5/0694455/L/ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RYA5VQ_8BJS6xilYG-BPkg?select=9uanhAvhhl2ZqACmSIAHNg"}
{"text":"Before two days ago, I had never been to Peter's, even though I've been a Calgarian since birth (gasp). My friends were shocked when I told them, so they forced me to go. Since I was uneducated in the ways of Peter's Drive In, I decided to buy a Orange-Lime-Root Beer Milkshake. Never again. Disgusting, but that was expected. I got a burger with cheese along with that, and I must say, the burger was quite good. Not amazing, but good. The only thing that ruined it was the mustard that apparently comes with it... again, I was uneducated. So I went back today, got the same order, with a few changes. I got a Root Beer Milkshake and a burger with cheese (making sure to ask for no mustard), and within two minutes of ordering, I was sitting on one of their many benches eating and attempting to drink their VERY thick milkshakes. Want proof? I turned the milkshake completely upside down, and it took 20 seconds for it to reach the top of the lid. Insane. One thing I noticed, however: the employees were socializing during work time! While waiting for my food, I peered in through the window and noticed a group of five employees laughing and talking away. It didn't affect me in any way, but just an interesting side note. Anyway, their burgers are very messy, so keep the sleeve on, or risk getting everything on your clothes. Their milkshakes are okay... very overrated, but if you need someplace to relax with some good food, go for it, as long as you like overpriced food. It's $4.50 for a milkshake, bring cash. No cards accepted here!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the neighbourhood around Peter's and still live close by. I have been to Peters' hundreds of times. Going to Peter's on a summer afternoon remains a fond childhood memory, a favorite late night hang out during high school, and was perfect comfort food for much of my adulthood. Sadly, however, although Peter's has been a Calgary institution for a few generations, for the last few years, it has been on a greasy slide into mediocrity...   The milkshakes remain stellar - my favorites are chocolate-banana and blueberry-raspberry. That is the best part of Peter's. In contrast, the burgers, and especially the fries, have slipped in quality since the original owner retired and sold the business a few years ago. The burgers are reasonably tasty when constructed at the time you order them; all too often they soggy and lukewarm from sitting too long. The biggest disappointment are the fries. In the past, you could trust them to be hot, crisp and delicious. Over the last few years, however, more often than not I have received soggy, limp, greasy, barely warm fries. I learned to solve the problem by assertively requesting fries fresh out of the fryer and I keep my eyes peeled to make sure they do not slip me the third rate soggy ones. Although this solves the limp fry problem, one should not have to make a special request to ensure quality.    I am sure I will continue to come for late night burgers and shakes. Peters remains a refreshing change from the chain burger take out joints -  and I am too much of a creature of habit to break my Peters' addiction. Given that Peters' and I are likely in a relationship for life, I yearn for a return to the days when there was true pride in the product and customer satisfaction was number one."}
{"text":"The service was quick even though there was a long lineup. The small fries is enough for two people. The burgers have a patty as a half on them so are very filling! Don't forget to add lettuce, tomato, and fried onions. Milkshake was delicious but very thick. They now take debit, too!"}
{"text":"The synonym for Peters' Drive-In milkshakes is definitely perfection. I absolutely love mixing chocolate and banana.   This place is always packed with people and that's because of how good it is! My recommendation? Grab some grub and drive around back to the Calgary downtown look-out point to enjoy your delicious Peters, preferably with your favourite human. Makes for a lovely date."}
{"text":"Get the shakes, and appreciate that the staff wear scrubs as their uniform"}
{"text":"I love Peters' milkshakes! Whenever I have a craving for ice cream, I satisfy it with a Peters' drive-in shake or one of their banana splits.    I also love their burgers.  I have tried hamburgers around the world and I have to say that Peters' ranks in my top 5.   : )"}
{"text":"Milkshakes are fantastic. The food is cheap and tastes cheap. Big College hangout. Debit and cash only."}
{"text":"Peters' is an iconic Calgary establishment but I really don't think they are living up to their reputation anymore.  Their milkshakes are still excellent (I usually get the bubble gum one) but their food has gone downhill in recent years.  I generally give it a pass these days."}
{"text":"Must stop shop for any road trip through Calgary. This place will please every member of your family from the hipster, to the good ol fashioned parents to the rebel vegetarian.  I recommend marshmallow milkshakes!!! You can mix up to 3 flavors in any shake for up to 4500 combinations.  The best one I've had so far was oreo,  caramel,  marshmallow.   The line closest to the benches on the south side always seems to be the fastest, but I almost always choose the wrong line so who am I to say.  If you like onion rings try these!  The portion is massive for $4.50. The fries are fresh cut,  but a little thin for my liking. The burgers are awesome, simple and cheap."}
{"text":"Peters' is a great independent fast food place that is a part of Calgary's DNA. The portions are generous and the food pretty good (though not for those counting calories). It is one of those places you take people who are visiting Calgary for the first time. Their burgers are delicious, though messy, and their onion rings are addictive, though greasy. I would recommend their Sundae's because you can taste the creaminess of their ice cream and it is topped with real fruit. It isn't a place to go to everyday or every week, but once in a while it makes for a great artery clogging lunch or dinner. Beware the mammoth seagulls and crows that own the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Burgers are always fresh, onion rings and shakes are the best in the city.   If you want an old school fast food burger, the place can't be beat - don't listen to the haters.   Five Guys has a better burger but it's not as convenient.  If you want something more sit down and gourmet, there are other spots."}
{"text":"God I love this place so much it's got so many memories for me as a child and me and my parents still come here ! I recommend anyone who's new to Calgary to come try it some may say the burgers aren't amazing but I beg to differ the fries and onion rings are amazing and the service is always pretty quick! I like the concept of eating in the car or on the picnic place I wish they had more food places like peter in Calgary cause it's such an interesting experience !"}
{"text":"Had a poutine ( fries tasted bland, way to much like McDonald's. Co workers got a burger shake n frys and the burger didn't look good at all. Way to much $ for a poutine!"}
{"text":"One of southern Albertas musts to eat at while on the road, affordable burgers and shakes for right around 10 dollars combined. Great quality for the good price only downside is how long the wait is for food (upwards of 20 minutes) on a Sunday night at 7pm."}
{"text":"Just try their onion rings, okay? If that doesn't win you over... Well, damn. They're not greasy at all... AT ALL! How do you make them so delicious and crunchy without them dripping oil? Some new miracle innovation? I even feel a little healthy eating Peter's Drive-In's onion rings... Yum.   Cheeseburgers are on point, too. I can't say much about them, though, because all I can remember and think about while writing this review is how good their onion rings were..."}
{"text":"I had to eat here because I heard so many good things about it and it was \"legendary\".  The food was good, but nothing special.  It is quite an experience though and I don't think there is any place like it.  First of all you have to be careful when you order.  The fries only come in two sizes, Small and Large.  They are more like Large and GIGANTIC since their large fills up a full box and the small is big enough to share.  The onion rings were good but a bit salty.  You can choose if you want a single or double patty.  I ordered a single but got a double.  I guess that was okay since the patties are really thin.  However, where are my veggies?  It was just meat and cheese.  Which would have been fine if I ordered it that way, but I like to have some lettuce and tomato in there so I don't feel so guilty that I am about to clog my arteries with a greasy burger.  I much prefer In-N-Out Burger because you can order the burger the way you want it with grilled onions, animal style, etc and the quality  is so much better.  I do have to say that their shake selection is pretty cool.  There are a ton of flavors to choose from.  I didn't know it but you can actually mix up to 3 flavors.  I got the blueberry and strawberry combo which was pretty good.  I tried the root beer shake which was also pretty good and tasted like a root beer float.    The shake was really heavy though and I was not able to finish it.  Actually I felt very heavy after the whole entire meal and had a hard time getting up. Not sure if it's because I've been over eating all week or they were purposely making me over eat by giving me two patties instead of one and making me think I was having a small fries when it was actually a typical large.   Overall, it's an okay place.  The burgers are definitely better than any you would get at like Mc Donald's or Burger King.  It's good to cure a quick craving for a  burger, but it is not exactly \"fast\" food since the wait in the drive through is really long.  None the less it is an experience of Calgary so you should at least check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Great Classic Spot! Had the Double Burger (Great!) Add Tomato, Lettuce and Bacon next time. Also had a small Fry (which was huge!) great home cut fries! And an Oreo shake (great!) get a 3 fruit combo next time. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. Burgers are dull and uninspired. They are also soaked in bbq sauce. Fries are not what they used to be and o-rings are overly greasy. Not worth the hype, the wait, or the price."}
{"text":"If you live in Alberta and have taken a road trip to Calgary, chances are you've stopped at Pete's. It's legendary. It's been famous for decades. Even when I was a kid, we stopped here on a team road trip and it was the highlight of the whole trip.   Pete's is really nothing fancy. It's reputation preceeds it. It's an average greasy burger joint but the food is good and the portions are huge. I remember to this day a box of fries as big as a shoebox. Some 20 years later the thrill and mystique are gone, but it's still fun to stop for a burger and fries and milkshake. It's so much more exciting than going to McDonald's, and pretty much as cheap as the golden arches. Pete's has been deep fried into our collective conscience, and I like it that way."}
{"text":"I like the idea of Peters, but the food really isn't that great.  It's decent, but not great.  I suppose that's not what you're looking for from a drive-in restaurant though.  The experience is fun, but we'll go about once a year, just to go."}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago. Order to pick was very fast!! The burgers are ok, nothing to write home about. Milkshake is awesome! Very think but they give u a thin straw so it was very hard to drink.  Huge portion for fries and onion rings. 1 small could feed at least 4 people."}
{"text":"I'm a Peters' Girl. I'll admit it.  There's just something about pulling up to a Drive-In. I love the fact that it's always packed. I love the fact that the owner refuses to make it a franchise. I love the fact that there is only one and will only ever be one.  I may be vegetarian, but there's still tonnes of fun fare that I can enjoy at Peters'. I usually start with the onion rings and polish them off with a Strawberry Milkshake. I know, I know...dinner of champions. But hey, every one is allowed to indulge now and then, and it just so happens that every time I do, I end up at Peters'."}
{"text":"I've only ever had a Peters' milkshake, and it was delicious. Pricing is decent considering the size of the drink, it is pretty big and quite filling. I had a toasted marshmallow shake, and it was a little too sweet, yet the flavour was prominent and good. Note that the shakes are very thick, almost an ice cream texture, but it melts down and becomes easier to drink. They have a wide variety of options, and I definitely want to come again to try one of their other dozens of flavours!"}
{"text":"I love Peters' milkshakes and burgers. However, I had a marshmallow milkshake this evening with unidentifiable crunchy black pieces, which has deterred me from coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"The main attraction to Peters', for me, is the kitsch.  A drive-thru with serval walk-up windows, the retro feel, late hours (open to midnight 7 days a week!), and some very smiley staff do tend to overshadow--in a good way--some very par for the course fast food.  The texture of the burgers is nothing truly to write home about; neither are the fries or rings.  The milkshakes are offered in near-countless flavour combinations (yet I only ever choose chocolate), and on my last visit I watched a guy muscle his way through a Root Beer & Raspberry milkshake; I couldn't tell if the look on his face was regret with a tinge of revulsion, or simply simply physical exertion as he tried to extract the shake from its home through a straw--but it didn't sound like a flavour explosion I would accept, even under extreme circumstances. I do recommend Peters' Drive-In for the experience.  It tends to make me nostalgic for a car hop youth I never had and only dreamt about thanks to the likes of Happy Days and American Graffiti; but sadly, I don't recommend it simply for the food."}
{"text":"I've been told by my friends that use to live in Calgary about this place. Since I was going to Calgary for one day I decided I had to try. I order the double cheeseburger, onion rings and mango shake.   The shake is very very thick and good. So far a great start. The Onion rings are crispy and delicious. So far so good.. I save the burger for last.. After all.. it is a burger joint and the burger should be what sells this place.   I open my burger and it is covered in BBQ sauce. Hmm. doesn't look that good. I took my first bite and it's terrible. Thin patties, way over sauce and just plain bad. I can't believe my friends told me I had to try this place. I was in Calgary for only one day and I wasted it.    I am giving 2 star because the shake and rings are good."}
{"text":"We had the milkshakes at Peter's Drive-in for dessert and it was awesome. One price fits all is a great business model and you can mix flavours so selection is excellent. They have other food too and definitely a must whenever you're in a Calgary. Long line up even late at night.  Here's my Vlog on Peter's Drive-In features at 0:13  https://youtu.be/c7BIYunlnHQ"}
{"text":"Peter's was suggested to us to be the best hamburger place in town.  We drove there and tried it just to find out that the burgers are mediocre but the milk shakes are great actually. They used fresh fruit in our milk shakes which made them taste better than many other we had before."}
{"text":"Stopped going here last year. Grew up eating Peter's all my life (40 years). Quality and service is horrible. Prices are insane for what you get. Fat burger is way better."}
{"text":"I like it... It's fast.  The shakes are great.  Service is always good.  Ok.. It's a mediocre burger, but.. It's exactly the right mediocre burger for me...  4 stars for the staff and shakes... Only 3 stars without those high points.  Ps:  add the fried onions."}
{"text":"In and out! I am not a fan of waiting for my food, so this place is fantastic! They give me my burgers/onion rings/milkshakes in 5 seconds after I order! Then I get to take it to my car and eat it! Score!!  Now, on to the food.. The burgers are okay - you have the option of a single, or a double or a triple! The onion rings are fantastic! Crispy and thick and juicy! The milkshakes are so gigantic I definitely need to take one other person with me to share it. And it's so thick when you get it, it's usually much easier to drink after 10 minutes or so, when its a little more liquid."}
{"text":"The taste of the milkshake and long lineup haven't changed much since I left Calgary 5 years ago. I normally just go there for the milkshake. One time I went there for lunch with my colleagues and all of sudden I just want to try their burgers despite the warning I got from friends \"don't try anything else but the milkshakes.\" Boy, was I wrong. Anyway, I will just come back for milkshakes from now on."}
{"text":"Now this is a great burger!!!  Tastes like in n out burger for sure!!  Canadaians know how to copy great American fast food chains. Meat taste so good you can tell it's not GMO like American-made but a burger taste like in and out burger."}
{"text":"The menu of Peter's has remained pretty much the same since their debut in 1962. You won't find grilled chicken sandwiches or fish here. I can also assure you that you won't see anything that resembles a salad...nothing here even rhymes with salad. Now that we're clear on that, let's move on to what Peter's does have; Burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, ice cream treats and some of the best shakes you will ever attempt to drink through a straw. As a matter of fact, Peter's claims that you can mix up to 3 of their 30 milkshake flavours for a combination of more than 4500 flavours.  The burgers are charboiled, dressed in a signature fashion that makes them uniquely Peter's. Each patty is made from fresh chuck, individually submerged in their BBQ sauce before being tucked into freshly baked, custom-made buns. They are then lovingly wrapped in their foil before making their way to your mouth. Just consistently delicious.  As much as I like the possibility of 4500 combinations of shake flavours, I often choose the simplicity of the vanilla shake. That doesn't mean I won't go for a blueberry or strawberry/chocolate now and then. Believe me, the shakes are thick, they are delicious and made from fresh fruit.  If you are going to Peter's Drive-In, remember to bring cash. The closest ATM is at the 7-11 a couple doors down, but save yourself the pain and get your cash before you find yourself banging your head on your dashboard 'cause you're stuck in the drive-through with a useless debit card and an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Last time we went to Peter's Drive-in we just ordered a pair of milkshakes.  This time it was a day to try the food.  We each ordered a cheese burger with everything - including fried onions, lettuce, and mine had tomato (all optional items).  The burgers were delicious.  The patties were super juicy and properly cooked, the lettuce and tomato were fresh and the onions were properly caramelized.  Even the cheese was great - actual slices of melted cheddar, not some simulated plastic.  The bun was tasty and the barbeque sauce was enough that the tinfoil wrapper was a must-have in the car.  We also had a box of onion rings to share - at $4 for an order we expected it to be large enough to share.  It was.  They were crispy on the outside with juicy onions on the inside and the batter was perfectly seasoned.  To drink we each got the special - Peach milkshakes.  Supposedly the Peach flavour is the most common special but it's super tasty!  There's chunks of fresh peach and even when you're stuffed you can't stop drinking the super thick milkshakes.  Next time I think I'll try either Coconut & Lime or Chocolate & Marshmellow.  Don't let the insane drive-through line intimidate you.  If you haven't been, it moves fast and is worth the short wait!"}
{"text":"Peter's Drive in is definitely a fixture on my road trips to Calgary. I'm not a huge fan of the burgers, but the fries, onion rings and milkshakes are delicious.   A fun experience and definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I went to this spot because it was a \"must-see\" when we stopped in Calgary on our way to Banff.  Kind of a cool little spot.  A very 50's drive-thru type feel.  There's only outside seating, which I found was odd since it's below freezing 9 months of the year in Calgary.  The burgers were nothing special.  Your standard charbroiled thin-patty fare.  Given the fact this was in Alberta, I kind of expected more out of the beef.  The bun, however, was delicious.  I got an order of fries and thought I was getting a side... a regular order is enough to feed a family of 4 and then some!  They weren't anything special either, mostly half-soggy - but I can't complain with the amount they give you.  The big thing about this place was supposed to be the milkshakes.  Unfortunately, I'm not much of a milkshake guy and couldn't tell the difference between a burger king milkshake and a good one (are BK milkshakes supposed to be bad?)."}
{"text":"While cramming a sub in to my face, my sister asked me how far away Peter's Drive-In was from where we were. I told her that it was 10 minutes away, and since I used to live across the street from it, I knew exactly where it was. She had never been, so I said, \"let's go. Otherwise, they kick you out of Calgary.\"  Yeah, when I lived across the street from Peter's, my neighborhood smelled like french fries and hot grease. If I was bleary-eyed from my migraine medication (which was often); I'd stumble over there and order their onion rings, take the bag home, polish them off and then pass out in a 3-hour junk food coma. Sigh. Memories :).   My sister's first experience included a burger, fries and a banana, oreo and coffee-flavored milkshake... though she did not bring all the boys to the yard. Maybe because we were surrounded by cops on their dinner break. Her response to the food was that the burger was juicy, the fries were fresh and her milkshake was phenomenal. Guess we caught Peter's on one of their better days, since it can be hit or miss! I've gotten amazeballs onion rings, and sad and soggy onion rings. You take your chances, but since they haven't changed their prices in the last few years, it's not a bad risk to take.  Pro-tip: either bring a spoon with you when ordering a Peter's milkshake or let it sit for a while, or you'll give yourself a headache and sore jaw attempting to suck it out of the straw."}
{"text":"Drive-Ins are a dying breed and when you find one like Peters' you need to help keep the business alive. I have never had a burger dipped in bbq sauce before. It adds a different flavor to a classic burger. I also put some onion rings for an extra crunch. I got a mango coconut milkshake and it was the most delicious things I've ever had. It uses real cream, quality ingredients that most places just don't use anymore. A small was still pretty big, I was only able to finish half."}
{"text":"Fries were gross!!!  They were very thin and very over cooked.  No fluffy insides this visit.  No way to get a replacement if you are in a hurry.  Milk shakes were still ok."}
{"text":"Just came through the drive through, \"Melissa\" our server was very rude, impatient and dismissive. We have always enjoyed the food here; however in the last few years the staff seem overly stressed and toxic. It was 10 am and this was the mental/emotional state of the staff. Sad."}
{"text":"Sooooo.... if you've been going to the same place for years and years you have an expectation.   I do PDI about once a year. It's been a bit since I've been there as it is a summer time adventure. But I was lured by thick milkshakes and burgers delicious.   ....And was mildly let down. I guess its been sold. I don't know when. I've recently tried a lot of burgers around town.   Peter's used to be a good sloppy down to earth burger. Today, the MacDonald's like bun, thin microwaved looking patty, and skimpy toppings combined for a sub par lunch.   With so many terrific burgers in town, and close to Peter's, the only thing keeping this place going is nostalgia.   Go down the hill to Boogies or 10th St to Flippin Burgers. Unless your inner child needs a reminder of wonderful things used to be."}
{"text":"I love Peters'! Mind you I've only ever had milkshakes, using the drive through. - the drive through attendants are very nice, always having a cheery attitude - the price is fair, especially for how large one milkshake is - while the lineup is long, never once have I seen the tell tale signs of lazy customer service, so we've always got the impression that the staff really are trying to keep things moving  Tips - one milkshake can easily be split between two people - factor in about 15 minutes of wait time when you get a milkshake, as it takes a long time to defrost, and if you personally prefer a creamier milkshake you'll have to wait - the wait is definitely worth it! Love the ones including oreos"}
{"text":"Came here for the super thick milkshakes.  They're so thick that I had a hard time sucking it up the straw.  I ordered the classic chocolate flavor.  Didn't want to be too adventurous by mixing flavours, since you are allowed to choose up to three flavours from a selection of 30.  Peters' Drive-in was a fun experience either you walk up to the counter to place your order or wait in the actual drive-thru line up.  The milkshakes are what makes this place great!"}
{"text":"I will drive from Edmonton to eat at this place anytime.  A nice, cold milkshake to wash down the burger and massive amount of fries they give you, nice tasty onion rings.  Yes this is the basic burger joint idea, but their milkshakes will blow you away.  Flavors of BANANA, BLACKBERRY, BLUEBERRY, BUBBLE GUM, BUTTERSCOTCH, CHERRY, CHOCOLATE, CHOCO-SPICE, COCONUT, CRANBERRY, CRÈME DE MENTHE, CRUSHED MAPLE WALNUT, GRAPE, LEMON, LICORICE, LIME, MANGO, MAPLE, MARSHMALLOW, ORANGE, OREO, PEACH, PINA COLADA, PINEAPPLE, RASPBERRY, ROOT BEER, RUM & BUTTER, STRAWBERRY, VANILLA, WATERMELON...or you can even mix these flavours for another flavor combo.  Burgers, with cheese, double, triple burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, sundaes, and variety of soft drinks.  Great place to come in Calgary...very busy street its on, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the milkshake and onion rings. Onion rings stay crispy even 30 minutes later. 3.5 stars for their burger. Poutine wasn't great- soft, soggy fries with not enough cheese curds and gravy. Good thing they have massive packets of ketchup you can dip the undressed fries from the poutine from. Milkshake is massive so it's sharable. Can mix up to 3 flavours into it. $4 for a single burger is good value but it didn't feel spectacular as how some rave about it. I think it's more a fan fair. There are better burgers in this city but the experience of going to a place that seems to have not changed with time was a neat experience."}
{"text":"Drove from Banff back to Edmonton and detoured in Calgary just to come to this place and by god it was worth it.  $5 for a huge milkshake in which you can put up to 3 ingredients. I chose coco mocha, caramel and coconut. Sounds like a really odd combination but it was delicious! And I'm not really a big fan of milkshakes, but I believe I have been converted. If you're visiting Calgary and you love drive-ins, milkshakes and burgers. Peter's is a must!"}
{"text":"I have loved visiting this place ever since I was a wee child to get the delicious milk shakes (and occasionally a yummy burger too)! They have 30 flavours and you can mix up to 3 flavours in your milkshake. On my most recent visit I had licorice marshmallow as my flavour while another in my vehicle had chocolate mango grape. On previous trips here I have enjoyed butterscotch as my flavour. It is often lined up with foot traffic and the drive-thru itself is really impressively busy. Interestingly enough I noticed that Peters' Drive-In is opening new locations elsewhere now too! But this location has been a fixture of Calgary since 1962, and deservedly so! It's hard to find a good milkshake on occasion and this place certainly delivers!"}
{"text":"Have been going to Peter's since high school, and that's a long time ago.  Even back then it had lineups so not fussed about that.  But, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FRENCH FRIES??  The milkshakes and OR's still rate a 5-star, but the burger is around a 4 now.  And the French fries which used to be the BEST in Calgary are more like shoe-strings now.  The meaty center is almost non-existent.  At best, it's a 2-star FF now.  Understand that it's the best for a speedier fry, but still sad.  I'll still go for the milkshakes though."}
{"text":"Not a legend.. not even sure what the other reviewers are thinking.  Yes there is some nostalgia factor - I'll be the first to admit that. Peters is a long held Calgary establishment. The kicker is that, in 2005, the place was bought by a new owner and the quality plummeted. As much as it pains me to say it, it is now one of the absolute worst burgers in the city. The patties are overcooked and spongy, soggy buns, sloppy sauce, overall bad tasting. The fries are bland and greasy. The onion rings are soggy. It just isn't the place it used to be.  As for the shakes.. I think they are still one of the better milkshakes in the city IF ultra-thick is your preference.  Just don't get the burger.. and don't believe the hype. It's all nostalgia that is no longer substantiated by any quality. And it really sucks to say that."}
{"text":"Heard so many stories of this place when I moved to Calgary and got many recommendations from friends back in Toronto and Calgary. The burger wasn't the best I've ever had but the milkshakes are amazing and huge selection of flavours you can mix to make the most perfect milkshake"}
{"text":"An absolute must for anyone who lives in Calgary, visiting Alberta, or even just looking at a map of Canada.   This place will always rank 5 stars, quite possibly because my grade 1 \"hot lunches\" were provided from Peters'. It's such a fun experience, the food is cheap and always a good burger! The fries are HUUUGE, and onion rings delicious.  But let's be real, what do we really visit Peters' for? (Besides standing in the lines in hopes of running into someone semi-attractive) It's for the milkshakes! DELICIOUSSS!! Yes they are very thick, but that's what makes them wonderful in the sun. Pick up a milkshake and you'll be enjoying it all afternoon.   A must visit for all. Great vibe."}
{"text":"Can't believe how many people I know that live in other provinces, but still know about Peter's Drive-In, and make time for a stop while in Calgary.  Definitely a Calgary treasure!  Great food, reasonable prices, although line-ups are frequent - they typically move quickly, lots of parking, tables around if you prefer to stay.  Still have not caved to electronic age - it's cash for food, and all staff adds up amounts with pen on paper.  Milkshakes are tastely, and usually so thick that it takes a few minutes before you can actually use a straw!  yum.  Never been - you must try."}
{"text":"Well, for many in Calgary Peters is an institution. Like any major city - we tend to hold on to our local traditions and mom and pop places and elevate them to levels that in some cases are worthy, in other cases are not.  I think when it comes to Peters they are in the latter half.   Peters does one thing very well - the milkshakes. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of combinations. They are rich, creamy, flavourful and delicious.  If ordering hot food - the chips are pretty standard - although you do get a ton of them in your order.  Getting into  Peters itself can be  tricky - one big parking lot out back connected by one entrance and a few dead end streets surrounding it. It appears that at one point you would have been able to enter Peters from a different entrance, but this seems to be blocked off due to the amount of business  - Peters is always busy, and in the summer even more so.  The parking lot does have a sense of nostalgia for me though - reminds me of when I was a kid going to A&W  and parking and eating in the family car.  In addition to alot of cars, there are a lot of seagulls - just gagging for free food.   So Peters - the food is pretty average, the milkshakes exceptional , the service fast and the overall experience nostalgic.  Where the food lets you down, the sense of tradition brings you back up.  I think Peters will be around for decades to come."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a very busy one of a kind experience, and a must try.   I must begin by saying that the lineups are huge, which usually means the food is good. In this particular case, I agree that the food is good and it is worth the wait. The restaurant itself is like an old fashion diner but there isn't any inside sitting areas, at least to my knowledge.  There are sitting areas outside however.  The food in question produces mixed feelings. The burgers are large and messy, which most people don't appreciate, for me however, the messier the better. The milkshakes are to die for... so thick and creamy. Plus, they have tonnes of flavours you can pick from, as well as mix and match. The cost of the food is surprisingly quite cheap for what you get. Its less expensive than a fast food chain and there will be food left over. The fries taste as if they've been cut fresh on site and you get lots of them.  I will return here when back in town as it is a great experience for a hungry man."}
{"text":"The grub served up by this place is processed dreck.  Milkshakes aside, am I missing something here?  Lay off the \"nostalgia pipe\", kids!"}
{"text":"Love it the poutine is huge 6$ for this much is insane deal consider a&w 6$ gets u a tiny one McDonald's same thing peters hell yes"}
{"text":"Classic Calgary spot. The radio commercials don't lie... it truly is the drive-in you can't drive by. BBQ is bomb. Triple burger just sauce extra sauce, onion rings and a chocolate banana milkshake is bomb"}
{"text":"I don't care how others rate these joints. I love Peters'! I love their sauce, and I always get my double cheese with extra sauce! Always hits the spot right where it counts, and that's it for me mate!  The milkshakes are killer too! The abundance of flavour selections and combinations make it a treat to grab as a side. Mind you, the sugar and sheer size might make you feel some regret later on (so I just save half for later!)  A couple years ago, I would have given the place four stars, but the service took a hit these last couple years, with them botching my relatively straight-forward order a couple times IN A ROW! I've been coming here for over ten years, and this has never happened before. I gotta say, the service is slippin'... slipped one star."}
{"text":"One of my fondest memories of visiting Calgary as a kid was going to Peters' and getting fries and onion rings. I was a vegetarian at the time so I don't know about the burgers, but I'm willing to bet they are also excellent. They're so busy on an average summer day that everything's cooked fresh out of necessity. I don't  know what kind of voodoo they do with their fryers, but no fries or rings have ever tasted as good. One day I will return to Alberta and try the burgers. It will be a good day."}
{"text":"So I pull up expecting a huge line of customers going around the corner. I received the huge line, and should have abandoned ship at this point, but waited it out as Im not that smart.  If you desire a huge basket of soggy fries with no salt, this is your place! The only thing edible here anymore is the ice cream and shakes.   If you want a great burger, go the extra three blocks to Boogies, you won't be disappointed. I actually guarantee it. You go to Boogies, order a burger. If you don't like it shoot me a message and I'll reimburse you so you can spend your money at Peters."}
{"text":"Peter's proclaims that they have entered the 90's and now take debit! This announcement called for a special trip to the 50+ year Calgary icon.  It's hard to argue with their tried and true 60's style drive-in burgers. Are there better burgers in YYC? Well, sure, you could argue that... but they're not Peter's burgers! They've got their own style that is classic drive-in yet uniquely Peter's.  Same goes for their milkshakes. These babies are the bomb! Are better ones out there? I'd say so, but this Peter's milkshake! No matter what the flavour is, theirs are unmistakably thick, and unmistakably Peter's.  Peter's is a finely tuned and well oiled (with canola oil) machine! I don't know how many scrub clad employees they have running around in there, but I'm pretty sure the answer is \"lots\". They serve up all the classic burgers, fries, onion rings, and milkshakes with the greatest of ease.  I always feel like I get great value at Peter's and they never skip on the little things that matter. You will get an excessive amount of ketchup, vinegar, and napkins. Even the burgers as messy as they are (Seriously, the ketchup always spills out of them inside the wrapper and coats the outside of the bun.) I've never managed to plough through an all the napkins they give me. Hooray for a supply of emergency napkins and ketchups in my car.  Actually... they both come in handy.  Pro Tip: Unless you're a family of 7, get the small fries.  You may eat a large fries at McDonalds, but you don't at Peter's."}
{"text":"A victim of its own hype, in my experience Peter's tends to let down first time customers because of its reputation as a \"must try\" place for those visiting or passing through Calgary. The lineups are also always ridiculously long, but it must be said that the staff there are used to it and keep things moving fast considering this.  The food is alright...it's hard to screw up a burger and fries, and they don't, but there's nothing spectacular there either. The big draw is their milkshakes; they offer a great selection of ridiculously thick and tasty varieties. Grab a spoon, because they are too thick to drink until you let them sit for a bit.  Is it worth the trip? If you aren't in a rush, sure. Does it deserve the legendary reputation it has established? Probably not."}
{"text":"As Canadians hold their breath for famous American franchises to enter the market, Peter's is a true Canadian cornerstone featuring classic in n out type fare, delighting folks traveling on business and families looking for that special afternoon snack."}
{"text":"Classic Calgary burger, it's unique and special to Calgary, gotta have it if you visit that's for sure, milk shakes are great in the summer."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my wife, because several friends from Calgary had told me that Peters' drive-in is a great place to eat.  However, I found it okey. Nothing bad, but it is not as good as people might think it is.   I would recommend you to try it, but not stress to much on going."}
{"text":"Get the shakes......oh man.....get the shakes! This place is pretty old school, I saw the exterior, and I wasn't really expecting anything spectacular, or gourmet. I definitely judged this one by the cover. I wasn't disappointed though, the burgers were what I expect, smashed, sauced, and you have to eat it by peeling the bag it came it. Awesome. I didn't get the fries because, well soggy fries are just not appealing to me, so I got the onion rings; holy crap the onion rings were HUGE. Took four of us to kill that order. AWESOME. And the milkshakes.... your choice of flavors, I hope those out there know how to pair flavors, or else, it's your fault if it comes out gross. Shakes are are thick, heavy, and not too sweet. AWESOME. For the folks out there expecting gourmet burgers, and incredible sides...well, it's a Drive-In. Definitely venturing back to Peters' next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"You can't get better for a unique burger joint in Calgary and the milkshakes are awesome."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a summer indulgence - amazing milkshakes!  It is tough to find a good Tiger Tiger milkshake in this town!  I am not so much of a fan of the food - anything I've had  has been dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm visiting my folks up in Edmonton and we head down to Banff, I have to stop by Pete's Drive In; even though they've now completed a highway that bypasses Calgary to Banff when coming from Edmonton.  The milkshakes at Pete's Drive In are like none other.  Huge, creamy, and a huge assortment of flavors.  It's the only place I've been that I've had a grape milkshake.  My only complaint is the painfully long lineups I've endured.  Sure it's a good sign of a great place, but it still seems like it should take less time per customer to put together an order.  Burgers and onion rings are good but those are easy to come by any restaurant.  Not many restaurants can make a shake of this quality."}
{"text":"Peter's is undoubtedly a love-it or hate-it type of place. Part of what makes it great is the nostalgia for people who grew up with it such as me. The burger's are sloppy and juicy but there is nothing quite like them. I sometimes have dreams about them, they are that wonderful - but not everyone feels the same as I do. My wife, for example isn't a huge fan.   The one thing that no one will disagree on though is that they have incredible shakes. They have unlimited flavor choices and you can mix and match them however you want (although in the last couple of years they have started limiting people to 3 flavors per shake).   Even if you are lactose intolerant, the trip is worth getting the runs for.  Oh, and don't forget to bring cash - they don't take debit or credit."}
{"text":"First time I've been here, was take by our gym teacher. The milkshake here is incomparable. It's fresh and with lots of choice to choose. And I love the burger here. There's some table under the shelter of Peters and under the tree. I was here with my bf, the sitting area is a good place for gathering and dating.lol"}
{"text":"I, like many born and raised Calgary folk, have been going here for years. In the past few years I have not been much but recently had a coupon so I gave it a go before my hockey game. It was just as I remembered, which is a good thing. I had the all time favourite chocolate banana milkshake and enjoyed it to the last slurp. There is just something about the atmosphere that will always keep me coming back. The portions are huge and the milkshakes actually taste like milkshakes compared to other fast food chains attempts. If you have not been you must have just moved, and now that you have read this what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"yummy burgers, although I always laugh that the single cheeseburger has 1.5 patties...   their fries could be better. but the milkshakes are awesome, and considering the crazy prices of most food in Calgary, it's the perfect price and taste for a late night bite!"}
{"text":"Woot!  They finally accept DEBIT!!!  We always stop at Pete's on the way out of Calgary back home to Edmonton.  It is a tradition started many years ago.  It is one of the few \"Drive-In\" type restaurants left in Alberta.  For those of us that grew up with the roller-skating servers and the trays clipped to our car windows, it is all about the nostalgia.    I go to Pete's for the onion rings and the milkshakes.  I have had better burgers, they are nothing special.    The portions of onion rings and french fries are HUGE.  The gulls that hang around Pete's are FAT!  It is entertaining to sit at one of the picnic tables outside and throw french fries to the birds.    The milkshakes are fantastic - thick and creamy.  You can mix up to three different flavours and there are about 50 available.    You need to be patient when you are lined up for Pete's.  I prefer to park and walk up to the order window.  The car lineup can be backed up for a couple of blocks.  They have been in business since 1964 so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"It's not bad. Portions were ginormous. The family fries is probably enough to feed a whole village. The burgers were juicy and delicious. I had a strawberry milkshake and my boys had a chocolate milkshake. They too were ginormous. If I had a craving for a burger I'd probably want a burger from here. The onion rings was good. Also a huge portion."}
{"text":"This is a classic in Calgary if you are visiting!! The options for milkshakes are endless and the whole atmosphere is like a 50s-60s drive in. Hands down my favorite spot in Calgary!!"}
{"text":"best fast food in calgary.  Milkshakes are highly desirable"}
{"text":"I love Peters for their milkshakes! The only place where I can get a decent banana milkshake for sure! They have a good picnic bench area to eat at in the summer and fall and a few benches under the shelter where you order. I would definitely go and walk up as the drive through can take ages. Gets super packed in the summer.   Great range of flavours and their burgers are tasty but don't always look great. The price of the milkshake is good for the size and the price for the food is a little more but still not crazy. Their fries are ok nothing special.   Over all Peters is a great place to come and try some wacky milkshake flavours!"}
{"text":"This place slightly disappointing me because the hype was so big. I would only go back because of their milkshakes.  Skip the burgers, i would say they are mediocre at best, wouldn't wait in line for them.  The milkshakes are generously sized, and being able to mix flavors opens up to so many unique and delicious milkshakes. The only bad thing I have to say about the milkshakes were that they were too thick, I could barely even get it threw my straw."}
{"text":"This place competes on the simplicity of its product and the size of its portions.  Be sure to have the special sauce and you will enjoy a very well done, basic burger.  Also the choice of milk shakes in huge and you can mix up to 3 flavours -- love the coffee and chocolate combo.  Things to remember: the large fries are enough to feed 5 or 6 people and they only take cash."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Calgary, everyone has told me that Peters Drive-In is a must do in Calgary. Well, let me tell you... I completely agree!  The drive in has such a delicious selection of milkshakes. This is pretty much the reason I go to Peters! My favourite combination is Blueberry and Lemon! Yum... My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The food is pretty delicious as well! Every time that I've been, I've gotten their Cheese Dog. Delicious beefy hot dogness with some sharp cheese laid on top. If you get a \"regular\" serving of fries, be sure to either be extra hungry, or have a friend to share it with! It's quite the size."}
{"text":"GET HYPE. Peter's is LIT. You're going to scroll through these Yelps and see a few of those 'Airdrie' types, you know the ones: forgot where they came from, using our water and pretending it's cleaner, talking about how \"inspired\" the burgers aren't.  Forget 'em. The cheeseburger is a drive in cheeseburger which is better than 100% of those \"big name\" burgers, the fries or onion rings are not to be conquered by one soul alone, and those milkshakes? If McDonalds is throwing down \"Triple Thick\" gang signs, Peters is rolling up with the Quad Thicks at LEAST. It's basically dessert, because I feel for you if you try to suck that bad boy down right from the start. Those flavours tho. Choose from the board, mix n match. Don't be afraid. Get the lime shake. Lime shake? Yeah, lime shake.  Did I mention if you order a regular cheeseburger you get 1.5 patties? Out of the kindness of their hearts. That's how Peter's rolls."}
{"text":"This place has had a consistent line up around the corner for 2 weeks since we've been in town. I've been to the spot in gasoline Alley and wasn't overly impressed so I decided to give it a second go but in Calgary location. So we went at 9am for breakfast and were the 25 order of the day already. The Onion rings top notch the shakes are delicious and I must say the burgers are pretty tasty so I guess I can understand why there was such a line up. If you're in the area and aren't in a hurry it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Gotta love Peters just to say you've been there ! A quick stop after hockey to get back all those calories I burned off ! It's the drive inn you can't drive by . I can't when it comes to the shakes , love love love the chocolate banana shakes !!! I'm not a Peters burger guy but I do like their cheese dogs ( with all the sauces ) and of course the onion rings !  Last time I was there the shakes are now 4.95 , guess they need to help pay for the Red Deer location ?!?!"}
{"text":"On every visit to Calgary I make at least one visit to Peter's. I can remember eating their burgers and drinking their milkshakes all the way back to Grade 1.  They've barely changed. They moved into a slightly larger location sometime in the late 80s. But that's it. They could have branched out into multiple locations, but they didn't. They've kept themselves in the same location, serving the same burgers, fries and milkshakes for well over 40 years.  Nothing at all has changed about these guys. Same great burgers (they were rated #1 Burger in Canada for quite a few years in a row back in the early 80s ... not sure who was handing out the award at the time or if the award is still given out) with the same great taste, same milkshakes made with real fruit, same giant portions of fries.  These guys have consistently sold Calgarians great burgers for a hell of a long time, without sacrificing any of the quality that made them great."}
{"text":"Peter's Drive-In is a great old style burger shack for fans of grease and milkshakes!  As an avid burger and milkshake enthusiast, Peter's is an obvious choice. I have never been disappointed by Peter's either. The quality is always great and very tasty. I could eat a cheeseburger, fries, and vanilla milkshake from these guys everyday without any problem.  Peter's generally gets quite busy so you may have to wait a little while, but they can serve people quite quickly so you don't have to wait too long.  If you are there on a nice day you can even sit at one of the few picnic tables if they're available!  It is worth noting that they did have a salmonella scare a while bad and had to shut down for a bit (which is why I can't give them 5 stars), but I still trust them and continue to eat there.  If you like burgers, fries, and milkshake then you'll fit right in at Peter's."}
{"text":"milkshakes are ok. Not the worst burger ive had but pretty close."}
{"text":"Excellent milkshakes, could really taste the mint one. Onion rings were nice and crisp."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, consequently, Peters' overall doesn't have much sheen for me. Lately, however, I've found myself in need of a liquid diet. This warranted a trip to Peters for a cookies and cream milkshake. And let me tell you, Peters definitely delivered! The milkshake was creamy, liuqidy enough, and the cookie pieces were the perfect size to be sucked up the straw! I was beyond impressed.  ON top of that, we had top-notch service and were in and out of the drive through line within five minutes. The Peters' folks definitely provide top-not service.  And... if you haven't heard, they now have debit (and had a hilarious sign welcoming themselves to the 90s)."}
{"text":"Peters' Drive-In is pure and simple beauty, it's completely unrefined and honest goodness, it's awesome!  I love this place, its values and the delicious treats they offer. Where many businesses are constantly changing and evolving to keep up to date with emerging trends Peters' follows a different path, they do the same thing and choose not to change. Since opening in 1964 they've maintained the same standard of delivering persistent and consistent quality, using the best ingredients, providing great customer service and running a clean/sanitary operation. It may seem old fashioned but it works, Peters' sets its own precedent of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\". People come to Peters' for fresh home-style burgers, old-fashioned 100% beef hot dogs, natural fries and onion rings cooked in clean 100% pure canola oil and last but certainly not least, their milkshakes and ice cream made with real ice cream and fruit! MMMM Delicious! My most recent visit was an Oreo/Chocolate milkshake, just one of over 4,500 flavor combinations you can make here!  This is what you can expect from Peters', no less, no more, simplicity at its absolute best. If you want a crazy burger with all the fixings and specialty ingredients: look elsewhere. If you want a shake with the latest trendy super fruits: look elsewhere. You won't find anything new and fancy here, and the second you do, you'll also find a business that isn't the Peters' people line up for daily. Did you know they even sold a record breaking 4,000 shakes in one day? When was the last time you heard of the new trendy restaurant doing something like that. Exactly...  So why mess with a good thing? Peters' Drive-In is perfect the way it is! There's been some changes like the \"recent\" introduction of debit (lol...), but they still only take on what's necessary without changing the core business and their quality commitment. They're making a pretty bold move with the opening of a second location in Red Deer, something they've previously avoided doing like the plague. It should be interesting, but I don't think people will be worried about them \"selling-out\" and mass-franchising for more money quite yet. This is never something the original owner Gus Pieters wanted. That being said I doubt there will be too much uproar about the Red Deer location, I actually hope it's well received and I don't doubt it will be. So next time you're driving by \"The Drive-In You Can't Drive By\", stop by and grab a shake, lets cheers to tradition!"}
{"text":"An 'institution' that is way past it's prime. If this establisment was a horse, it would have been shot by now.  When Peter owned this, it was much better. Since the buyout some years ago, corners have been cut.   Soggy, flavourless fries, subpar onion rings (A&W does better), greasy, slimy burgers. This is conveyor belt food at it's worst. Perhaps they need to churn out such dreck as unbelieveably, people still flock to this place like lemmings, blind to the fact that it's now faded glory days are long gone, replaced with food and management more interested in sheer bulk of throughput and cash only payment.  Cash only is inexcusable in this day and age. It would actually be faster if it was debit only. No running back and forth for change. But of course, that would involve hard record keeping of transactions right? (Think about it, a real Italian family restaurant would be proud.)  Only one thing saves this place from total whitewash. Milkshakes. They are, indeed very good.  Don't go for the burgers, go for the milkshakes. You want a better burger? Boogies Burgers further down Edmonton Trail.   Oh, parents, please don't feed this pap to your kids. The amount of saturated fat, salt and preservitives in this 'food' is tantamount to child abuse..."}
{"text":"I got a burger today at lunch.  $3.30   Single burger, but it more like a patty and a half.  Always busy, and always tasty.  I was debating about also getting the tasty onion rings and a milkshake, but I would have needed a nap after.  Milkshake tip -you can combine flavors, so mix and match your favorites!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends go all the time after school or dances. The Milkshakes are so good and the cheeseburgers are great and well made although they can be put together a bit messily (mostly avoidable of what you put on it) It's open until midnight. Great! The hype is there for a reason!"}
{"text":"Longtime Calgary institution..  Always great for a late night fast food burger and shake.  Went with the usual double cheese and chocolate shake. What more can you ask for? Tasty and cheap.  As a new calgarian, I will definitely be back for late night eats. Glad they accept debit and not just cash now.(accompanied by a hilarious sign indicating they have moved into the 90s with debit)"}
{"text":"Absolutely dreadful burgers! McDonald's has better burgers and that explains it all!  They have pretty good milkshakes, though!"}
{"text":"It used to be the best burgers ever but they have changed. The burgers are still good but a little less charbroiled flavor and leaning more toward mass produced. It is still leap years ahead of macdonalds  I still stop in and pick up a cheese burger, onion rings and milk shake a few times a year because it's still tasty."}
{"text":"This is a must stop on your way into or through Calgary, the portions are huge and the milkshakes are the best around (I recommend the cherry)"}
{"text":"I used to love Peter's Drive-in when I lived here in the 80's, so while visiting here this week I had to stop here with my kids!  We all got a milkshake, and they were all delicious, thick and fresh.  Yum!  But the burger and fries were average at best, and not what I remember.  The burger was soggy, and the fries did not seem special at all.  There were too many fries for the three of us!  Luckily the man serving us told me a large was too big, but he didn't tell me two smalls was also too much.  I would be happy with smaller portion sizes if they tasted better!  To tell you the truth, I was disappointed.  From now on, if we come back, we will only order the shakes.  By the way, bring cash because they do not take credit or debit."}
{"text":"Excellent place for milkshakes and fries but stay away from the burgers, soggy bun and generic frozen patty isn't really worth it.  I combined the coconut and coffee flavors for my milkshake and was in heaven!  Mixed with the hot delicious fresh fries and I'll def be back!   As a huge burger fan I was for sure disappointed with what I received so I'll be going elsewhere when I get a craving but I guess you can't be good at everything (that just wouldn't be fair to everyone else!)"}
{"text":"This is a must visit for Calgary.  As a born and raised Calgarian I have spent many nights as a teenager hanging out in their parking lot or waiting a good 20 minutes in their drive-through.  The food is good, though not fantastic, but the milkshakes are awesome.  So many flavours, so little time..."}
{"text":"The milkshakes are HUGE and well-priced compared with fancier places. Don't order the \"family size\" fries unless you're starving ; the box holds what looks like 10X the fries you'd get with a typical fast-food combo. Huge parking lot with outdoor tables, great for picnic-style dining when weather permits. Hint: skip the drive-through, park in the adjacent lot, walk up, and order through the serve-through at the front."}
{"text":"Went to check-out Peters' tonight after recommendations from a friends that used to live in Calgary.  The shakes are fantastic, the food I had was mediocre.   First for the food....this is Alberta! Cattle country, I would expect to get some great tasting chuck in these burgers! Nothing. Where is the flavor to these burgers? The bun is nicely made fresh and engulfs the meat patty. Even for a drive-in, I would expect to get some flavor from the burger. Instead it's masked by their \"secret sauce\" (tastes a lot like Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ ).  So disappointing.   Their onion rings are certainly not fresh - but rather frozen from a bag and deep fried. Avoid them. 1 order will feed two people.   They are able to redeem themselves on their shakes. You are allowed a selection of 3 flavours free of charge. The sizes are huge. A small is equal to a large at McDonalds. Nice and thick.   Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional so far as burgers are concerned.  Order the triple cheeze.  Count your money though.  I almost always get short-changed, but never \"over-changed\"."}
{"text":"So the saying that their burgers are good, their onion rings are great, and milkshakes are fantastic rings totally true. We had an excellent experience at Peter's--met the lovey Mel who served us a delectable Maple Nut Chcolate shake and a BUCKET of onion rings. Y'all best be checkin out this place out. Only reason I withheld the 5th star is that the restaurant requires that you stand outside and ask for the food from a liftable window; in the chilly months it's a little much! Other than that though, food and service was superb."}
{"text":"My burger looked like someone sat on it before it was served to me. Mediocre at best. Fries and rings were a let down but milk shakes were great. Should have drove down the street to Boogies Burgers."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would, in fact I would give negative stars. Peters deserves -10 stars for their performance tonight. I remember when I was a kid going to peters was awesome, they had such great food and shakes. Tonight we got the most disgusting poutine I've ever had in my life. How can you make three of the most delicious things in the world taste like garbage? Explain to me how you ruined cheese? The cheese in the poutine was literally just like stringy cardboard, the gravy was non existent and the fries were so bland I was worried I had a concussion, or had maybe severed an olfactory nerve. But that's not all, not only did I bite into the most disgusting burger I've ever had, but I bit into a piece of bone/cartilage... okay, so I didn't finish my burger or poutine (because I don't hate myself and don't need to subject myself to more of that disappointment) well, at least I still had the shake right? To make up for this poor excuse for \"food\" I had to be subjected to. This bland tasteless combination of garbage. Nope. My shake also tasted like nothing. Blackberry shake? More like \"luke warm cup of semi melted vanilla ice cream\" so, I was legitimately concerned I was losing my sense of taste. On the way to the hospital to see if I was having a stroke, I stopped at McDonald's. McDonald's tastes great, I'm not having a stroke, Peters was just awful. Stop living off the reputation you earned years ago and start earning it again, because right now, I would suggest NO ONE ever go here. Go get 4 $1 burgers from McDonalds. Better in every way."}
{"text":"Worth the wait in line :) yummy fries and shakes.  My boys have been asking daily when we can go back and get another milk shake"}
{"text":"This burger place is always busy and has a big line up. The burgers and onion rings tasted decent. The fries was OK. The Milk Shakes are awesome.  There were lots of selections for people to pick."}
{"text":"Poutine at $6 was ordinary.  The fries were quite hard since they were cut like shoestrings.  Milkshake was thick and worth the $5 price specially on a hot, sumny day.  We ordered the triple burger at $6. It was ok.  The meal was overall alright except for the fries."}
{"text":"This drive thru is a quick spot to grab a burger & milkshake if you want a McDonald's alternative. You can definitely tell that the food is without many preservatives, unlike other fast food chains.  Every time we go I get a single burger with no onions. They give you one and a half patties with bbq sauce on them on a nice warm soft bun. It comes with ketchup & mustard and relish. The burger is good but it's disappointing that the patties aren't homemade. If they are, it sure doesn't taste like it. I would consider this burger worth $3, not $4.50.  My husband always gets a banana milkshake which he says is delicious... I've never tried one though. The size is generous.  We dont order the fries as they taste like deep fried frozen fries.   The setting is reminiscent of growing up when the chain burger shops had drive ins. Drive through is available as well.  The staff are friendly and the food is ready within 5 minutes.  Overall, this is a good stop for a quick meal, but I wouldnt go out of my way to eat there unless I needed something quick.   I heard that the original owners now own the one in Red Deer & that it is back to the old quality with fresh made, well structured burgers. I look forward to trying this one out."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE going to peters drive in, it's a must go too whenever we are in Calgary! The place is always packed, the burgers and milkshakes are great!"}
{"text":"I've always lived close to Peter's Drive-In, and it is our go-to \"too lazy to cook but need food\" destination. So I'm something of a Peter's expert, having had it on a regular basis for a loooong time. I'll confirm the rumours: it HAS gone downhill from it's golden days, long, long (5 yearsish) ago. The burgers in particular have shrunken in size and taste, but even mediocre Peter's still outclasses the majority of most drive through fare.   Don't go in expecting life changing food because it just ain't what it used to be, because we Calgarians have problems letting go of our beloved institutions and still talk it up like no one's business. Fortunately the Milk Shakes are more than up to snuff: those bad boys are always delicious and creamy. I love the Pina Colada, and the Peanut Butter, and Chocolate-raspberry. Half of the fun is having them make up weird combinations, but if you're short on time or experimentation the stalwarts are always Strawberry, Chocolate and Creamsicle (or Orange?).   The onion rings are also amazing. Crispy and delicious, and the onion is just thick enough to taste in that light batter. Best onion rings (still) in the city handsdown.  In the summer, expect near gridlock if you go during rush hour. It's always busy, but that's half the fun."}
{"text":"We stopped at Peter's Drive-In on the way back to Edmonton after a nice weekend in Calgary/Stampede. Been here a couple times and this place is great! Edmonton definitely could use a place like this, foo sure.  Anyways, for the food, my friend and I had: - 2x milkshakes ($4.75 each) - I had mango and my friend had maple walnut. Milkshakes are SO thick and delicious. Best to drink on the long ride home. - Onion rings ($4.50) - nice crunchy, crisp onion rings. - Poutine ($6.50) - my friend liked it. I had a taste - definitely not as good as the ones I've had in Montreal (but I'm not a huge poutine fan in the first place so take my input with a grain of salt).  We sat out in the bench parking lot area which I thought was pure genius (the idea that is, not us sitting out there). The picnic tables are a bit weird...they were half-way folded up and we originally couldn't figure out how to put it back down.  Great place to get your junk food fix! And I don't even junk food."}
{"text":"Of course this is a must in Calgary. Best milkshakes in town. Usually a long wait but well worth it. Best item on their menu has to be the onion rings which are advertised to have no cholesterol or trans fats!   The milk shakes are as thick as they can be and walk the fine line between a cup of ice cream and what can be classified as a milkshake.   Burgers are filling! And the buns are so buttery. Definitely a classic place to go for a quick bite."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the milkshakes; they're good, not great, b/c I highly doubt it's hand-scooped ice cream.  From the time I ordered in the drive thru, drove up maybe 20 feet, and the best flavour in the world, chocolate, it was ready!  But boy, the thickness, the marshmallow-like (also a flavour to try next time) softness when I eagerly plunged the straw (after ripping off the paper, nice touch) right dead-centre---I knew this was going to be different.  I'd come back to try the burgers, possibly, but those good-soul Calgarians in the Talk thread gave me some better suggestions with better rankings, that's what I go by ;)  5 stars for value: all this for just $4.85?!  Vancouver ones are half this size for the same price.  Look at pic, almost the same height as the steering wheel lol  4 stars for the marketing:  all the workers wore some type of colour-coordination, and it's a clean, bright, open kitchen concept for a diner, it's a tradition alright.  Glad I came in today, looks like they're going to be closed half day tmrw.  Probably Christmas party."}
{"text":"The only reason to ever set foot in Calgary...if only for the experience alone..for those of you out there to young to have been around for the A&W or White Spot Drive-Ins that brought you your good to your car....I used to love it when my parents took us to A&W and they brought that orange tray the hooled onto your car window and the Root beer still came in the big frosty mugs..alas...I digress...Peter's will give you an experience that is close enough!   The burgers are pretty good..standard \"rink\" or \"beach\" type burgers...the fries are awesome and the portion size is defiantly enough to share!   Now...if you aren't really feeling the Burger thing then no worries...the milkshakes will be worth the long wait in line..OMG sooo effing good...they are so think that your face practically sucks into the straw as you try to get some out...oh...soo..good! The Root beer is my personal fave but the chocolate is a nice classic!   If you have no car to Drive-In, fear not! You can also walk up and order as well. They have plenty of picnic tables to sit and enjoy your grub.   I will warn you that on a hot summer day Peter's gets super busy, so be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Extremely Disappointing Experience at Peters'. My husband and I had the worst fries. They were overcooked and chewy. Even after I asked for a replacement, they week still terrible.  Either their oil was not hot enough,  or the fries were overcooked.  While they claim that they cut fresh potatoes into fries, and cook them immediately, they were not good."}
{"text":"Pete's Drive Inn is always a fun option to experience on a Sunday afternoon, you get excited about getting into the car and hauling your friends to that cute little hideaway near a park, driving through and ordering on a speaker phone.    Perhaps there is a line up of cars which makes the trip more interesting cause eventually the line up separates and you get to foresee which window you will be ordering from.   But when the meal finally comes into your hands, you realise that the burger and the fries when you finally sink your teeth into them are not really worth all that anticipation.  Merits are the cheap price on a huge package of fries and the crème de la menthe milkshake amongst dozens of flavour choices. Plus that milkshake is huge; its lasts for hours and hours on end, and even then you are sipping it.  It kind of dissipates all the memories about the burger and the hoards of seagulls that you constantly have to look at."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years, and what more can be said about it.  They do NOW offer debit.  Not a big fan of fries/rings as I like them way more crispy.  The large order of fries or onion rings will feed an army.  The hamburgers and milkshakes are the star of the place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I have had for under $4. Their milkshakes are fully loaded and simply delectable (although very unhealthy)! My biggest beef with their restaurant are the insane queues that buildup during lunch or on weekends...and they get über busy!"}
{"text":"I was told that Peter's was a Calgary tradition. So, we went to give it a try. Before leaving for Peter's,  we were warned that the portions were big and that at one point in time, it was voted as the Best Burgers in the country.   When I heard that Peter's was a drive-in, I had expected servers on rollerblades/skates bringing the food to your car. In stead, you could either go by the drive through or park and order your food to eat at one of the many picnic benches that they have located by the parking lot.  You can mix up to 3 flavours for your milkshake. I just ordered strawberry but should have added banana into it. The milkshakes were thick.  I also ordered the single cheese burger and requested tomato and lettuce (it doesn't come with it unless you ask). The burger was ok. Nothing special in my opinion.  To top it all off I also got onion rings. It came in a bucket and can only imagine how the large the large is!    All in all, the food was ok. The milkshakes were good. I'd come back if I were passing by it."}
{"text":"Simply good, there is one taste and you might crave it randomly then you know its peters drive in, u rush there order 3 and eat them as fast as possible!! They are that good, sooo good u might crave them."}
{"text":"Peters' is a classic destination for anyone visiting Calgary. And did you know that it is open until 12am? Craziness!  We came here at 11:45pm and there was still a massive drive-thru line-up. Burgers are all right, but the milkshakes and onion rings are pretty good.  The place is throw back to the 60s and it is still thriving. They also take massive group orders too too which is very useful if you've been tasked with planning a special lunch for your entire company.    Mmm I definitely want some onion rings now."}
{"text":"I like Peter's because I like the business model - cash only,, one location, staff in scrubs. This is a local business that is driven but not driven to crazy ambition - they want to make decent burgers that people like and serve over 4,500 combinations of milk shakes.   I know what I'm getting when I go there - I don't go there too often though. Maybe three or four times a year? I feel like the food is well cooked and the ingredients are fresh. But then again - I like McDonald's too so how much can you honestly take my word for it?   It's a Calgary classic - I dig."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Peter's yet? It's only a must go whenever we are on a road trip that requires us to drive anywhere remotely near Calgary. I generally don't like fast food, but I like Peter's. I think Peter's will always hold a special place in my heart: from the delicious milkshakes to the fantastic burgers and mass amounts of French fries, Peter's does it right. They have so many delectable options when it comes to their thick and creamy milkshakes I just want to drive over and try them all! The line can be long, but don't be alarmed it moves really quickly - they really are fantastic in that sense. Another note is to have cash on hand because that's all they take! I've never met a single person who doesn't like Peter's. You can take your meal to go, sit on the benches near Peter's or walk a couple blocks and sit down in the grass to enjoy your Peter's picnic!"}
{"text":"The food was below average.  The service was horrible.  When we got to the Window they didn't have our order,  then they screwed  up our milkshake order. The staff was not pleasant  or apologetic. We will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"So you have decided to do a cross country road trip this coming summer and you find yourself in Calgary, Alberta... and you have a hankering for a hamburger.....Peter's is the place to stop.   Hands down the best burgers I ever had while living in Calgary.  First off I recommend parking your car getting out and doing a walk up order.. the experience is excellent.  Picture it a 1950's burger shack complete with drive through.   Order yourself a burger and one of their many milkshakes (I luv the maple one) and you won't be disappointed.... oh and don't forget about the fries ... delicious!"}
{"text":"I've heard this place has been around since the 60s so I'm sure they're doing something right. I like the simple menu and options, it kinda reminds me of In & Out burger in the States.  Each item is decent on their own but the onion rings were my favorite. They advertise their patties are fresh never frozen ground beef but that may have been when they opened. The ones I had were definitely not as advertised. I can understand that they would make the change since they are serving approx 4000 patties per day. The time and cost of making that many patties a day would raise their prices a lot.   The shake was definitely thick and used real ice cream. I can tell because I'm slightly lactose intolerant and real ice cream affects me every time.   I will go back to Peters but I will lower my expectations and therefore enjoy my experience for what it is."}
{"text":"Delicious Milkshakes and Fries... with some pretty decent burgers. Everytime I visit Calgary I am tempted to stop here on my way home to Edmonton. I usually time my meal to be in between peak times....because the rush can be chaotic.  Portion size is generous and pricing is fair. I am a 6 foot 2 male and I am only able to eat a  \"single\". The \"small\" size fries is enough for two and the \"regular\" size milkshake is comparable to a large at McDonald's. The milkshakes are definitely the highlight of this place. The ice cream base is delicious and you are able to mix up to 3 of their many flavors into one shake. My favorite combo is Chocolate/Banana/Oreo."}
{"text":"Peter's Drive-In is located in central 16th Avenue NE.  You can't miss it!  The lines can get pretty long (drive through and standing), but when you finally get to order .. you get your food pretty fast.  I usually order a cheese dog ($3.30), which consists of a nice juicy wiener, cheese, ketchup, relish and their 'special sauce' (bbq sauce).  It is DEEEEEEElicious! I also get the onion rings..OH.MY.GOD. I think they have the best onion rings in town! They seem better than eat in restaurants or other fast food joints.  The onion rings are nice and crispy AND they fill the container right up!  Its just oniony heaven in a container ($4).   If I may add, it is summer ...so hitting the ice cream up here is a definite must!  I've tried the sundaes ($4) and they're quite good..they have some whip cream on top of the choice of fruit (blackberry, blueberry, pineapple, raspberry, or strawberry) and its pretty big.  What is the best in my humble opinion... is the CHOCOLATE DIP!  I ordered a large ($3.30) (which I should of gotten a small $2.30)  It was HUGE! The chocolate is nice and thick and the ice cream is yummilicious.  It can get messy so be sure to ask for extra napkins!    I do recommend Peter's for a quick snack...good prices, fast service, great selected foods...what more can you ask for?  The only downfall I'd say is trying to get in and out of Peter's on the busy days.  Its kind of a Mickey Mouse route."}
{"text":"i went to junior high at a school that was in walking-distance of this place, and i have to admit that i didn't eat there too often. the food wasn't terrible, and no i never had any problems with the food that i DID order there.. but there are a few other things that steer me away from peters.  1. i'm a tiny a person. the over-sized meals and milkshakes served here are insanely to huge for a person my size to consume. 2. prices are stupidly high. 3. there's too many stupid milkshake flavours to look over to find the good ones. 4. no one wants peters in bad weather.. and calgary is terribly unpredictable when it comes to bad weather. 5. i've heard about many bad experiences from OTHER people with peters.. food being found uneatable, or the food resulting in them  becoming ill  but i also have to say that i luuuuv the environment and just the whole 'drive-in' idea and still keeping that restaurant tradition alive. me and my friends will bike down to peters on a hot summer day - that's when it's best. SOME of the milkshakes are verrrrry tasty too, i won't lie.  i've grown up with peters, and its always been around so its nothing super exciting for me, but i definitely suggest it for anyone who's just driving thru calgz looking for lunch or a snack. it'll be a good one-time experience for a nice memory from calgary."}
{"text":"The first time I ever came to Peter's was on a big yellow school bus because our gym teacher decided the best way to end our \"healthy living\" unit was to go to Peter's. At the time one of my classmates owed me food because I had done an assignment for him but I felt kinda guilty about making him buy me food so I didn't really order anything.  Years later I have returned to fully experience this famous local establishment and I regret not doing it sooner. They seem to accept credit cards and everything now so no need to worry about different forms of payment.  It's a drive-through with a small parking lot and also windows you can walk up to and order. I don't understand why everybody waits in the drive through because there is almost never a line at the window but the line for the drive through snakes all the way around the building. Are we that lazy now as people? Or maybe it's part of the magic of Peter's?  We got onion rings and a mango milkshake. As others have noted, the milkshakes are *very* thick. I am not sure why they don't give spoons. The milkshake tasted just like fresh mango and it was not overly sweet and didn't taste fake at all. It was amazing and I can't wait to try more flavours. Their onion rings are also quite good - almost as good as A&W. One thing to note about Peter's is that their portion sizes are super-duper-uber-sized. I feel like it would be very hard to finish a mlikshake on your own but you are more than welcome to try.  A local landmark for a good reason! Will definitely be back next time I have late night munchies."}
{"text":"was there in like 1993 or so. really good ice cream idd reccomend and id really like to go back there someday..."}
{"text":"OMG! I tried this place while on a visit in Calgary and I totally loved it! The shakes are really thick and creamy. I had the coca mocha shake and I really enjoyed it. The cheese burger I tried was fantastic! I want one of these where I live!!! I would totally recommend this place to people who are visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"I don't see anyone here mentioning that this place seems to be the only place that claims to have fresh burgers, but they look and taste like they're not. Dairy queens frozen patties are way more delicious. Obviously not a sit down restaurants Burger, but there are plain Jane fast food joints that have better prepared meat, and the fries, chewy, I remember they used to be a bit better years ago. What happened??"}
{"text":"If you like big milkshakes with lots of flavor varieties and non-greasy burgers, stop here.  The fries and onion ring portions are huge.  If you see a long line-up, don't worry about it 'cause it tends to move along nicely and you may encounter some interesting people.  Personally, I'd rather grab a burger here than any other fast food joint and I've never left without a milkshake."}
{"text":"I really don't get the draw of this place.  The food is greasy and unappetizing. The only thing (for me)they had going for them was their shakes.  Well, now that's off the table.   Had a craving for a shake, something I get once or twice a year, and decided to stop in since it was on my way home. I've been disappointed with them every since they discontinued the Rum & Butter milkshake but have managed to find other flavours to make do. As I pulled in, I read their marquee stating holidays flavoured shakes are back: Eggnog and Peppermint flavours. I love eggnog, so that sounded great to me.  After waiting in a long lineup, I got my shake and made my way out of the drive thru. As I finally managed to get some up the straw and into my mouth, I almost gagged! It tasted like chemicals! Almost like pure extract, alcoholy and artificial.  Not to mention there were pieces of something (pineapple?) in the shake, as if they didn't clean the mixer from the shake before.  It was the worst thing I've put in my mouth. Threw it out when I got home, what a waste of my money. Done with this joke of an 'icon'."}
{"text":"It is undoubtedly a Calgary institution, but Peter's can be extremely unpredictable in their quality. I've had some great burgers, and I've also had burnt turds on a bun; juicy, crispy onion rings and just plain juicy with grease; and let's not get too into their milkshakes! If you've ever tried to suck a golf ball through a garden hose, you have had a Peter's milkshake. This isn't even to mention the ridiculous number of flavors to choose from, calculated to boggle the mind and never to find a perfect combo. A trip here on a pleasant summer day can turn into an all-day nightmare as you go from one snaking line to another in the midst of suffering heatstroke, or else suffocate in your car from the fumes of twenty cars ahead of you. Try it once to say you have, then decide if its worth the inflated prices."}
{"text":"The milkshake here is better than the food. It's a famous landmark so you'll see it in many \"guides\" to eating in Calgary. Don't be fooled. So so burger, great milkshakes."}
{"text":"Only went for a milkshake - but so worth it!  $4.50 for a large milkshake with an abundance of flavours to pick from.  You can make your own combination of up to 3 flavours.  I had strawberry, chocolate & banana.  AMAZING!!  Will be back to try more flavours!!"}
{"text":"Being from BC there are no good drive in burger place so when we visit family in Calgary we always have to come to Peter's no matter how bad the snow or or even if it's -20 I don't care becuase these burgers are as the mrs says \"yummy\" Love the single burger that is one and a half patties, fries can easilt feed four, onion rings I devour like a beast (crisp and not soggy) and the milkshakes you can split with a buddy cuase they are so big. The parking lot is great as you can eat in your car as there is ample parking stalls and lots of picnic tables. If you want to get your food quicker it seems the drive thru is faster. Cash only no debit or credit"}
{"text":"Best burgers and milkshakes in town! A Calgary classic. I'd recommend the Oreo milkshake but there's over 350 flavours to try, so to each their own. I love how perfectly thick the milkshakes are"}
{"text":"I'm now going to forget the ill-advised warnings of a person I knew four years ago who told me he got terribly sick eating peters drive-in. I finally gave it another shot tonight. I'm afraid I have been missing out the past few years. Four stars because it's open until midnight, the lines are very long but it doesn't take forever to get through them, food was delicious and piping hot. I'm not giving it five stars because it's not the best burger or fries or shake or onion rings or poutine I've ever eaten of course.  We went through the drive-in, ordered, and then drove to the parking lot, parked, and eat our food on a clean picnic table.   We ordered two double cheeseburgers with various toppings, chocolate milkshake, poutine and onion rings.   Everything was good. Everything you'd expect from peters drive-in and just how I remembered it 25 years ago when I was a girl eating for the first time.  The shake was massive, thick and tasted really good. We got a lot of condiments to dip or onion rings into - mayo, vinegar, ketchup and mustard. Also, I think it was reasonably priced. We got all that food for under $30.  I think it was worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big fuss is about. I like milkshakes, but I don't like super thick milkshakes and that's what you get here. They do have a great selection of flavours and you definitely get your money's worth. But not the first place I'd turn to for greasy burgers and fries."}
{"text":"The milkshakes are still the best in the city.  Tons of flavors and very large portion size.  The food isn't as good as Boogie's, but it's a place everyone knows about.  When someone unfamiliar to Calgary comes to visit us, we'll probably take them to Peter's.  Careful -- it's cash only!"}
{"text":"It's cheap eats. I'm from Jersey and have been spoiled with awesome drive-ins and diners all my life. Peter's Drive in was a bit of a let down. The burgers taste are pretty good but taste like ordinary backyard barbecue and are a bit dry. The milkshakes are awesome. The fries are regrettable. They are tasteless.   It's unique for Calgary and like I said the milkshakes aren't bad."}
{"text":"Finally visited Peter's again in such a long time! It's been ages since I've had their super thick milkshakes, burgers, and fries.  Like how I remembered it, the line-up at Peter's was insane and we waited about 15-30 minutes in line, which isn't too bad.   We opted to sit in the parking lot benches, which were poorly maintained. But that didn't bother me too much. I'm giving Peter's 4 stars mostly due to their fries and burger. The burger was a bit soggy(must be because the patty is drenched in sauce?) and the fries weren't even a little bit crispy. It's not too bad, but it wasn't all that great either. I guess for the size of the burger and portion size of the fries they give you, it's not too bad.  We also ordered shakes as well, which was the best part of the whole meal. I ordered a coffee and maple walnut shake(you can combine up to 3 flavours) - and I'm definitely coming back for just that milkshake. Just wished the burger and fries were as satisfying."}
{"text":"Peter's my boy, your food.. she is not good.  The burgers are not good, the fries are not good, I think your onion rings MIGHT be ok?  I just don't get the hype.  This food is guilty pleasure food, because you feel guilty about going here over Boogies. Here is why Peter's gets 2 stars and not 1:  The milkshakes and ice creams are unreal.  Their chocolate dipped cone?  Ugh, lady wood.  The Oreo milkshake? Delish.  Sundaes, banana splits, yes yes all delicious.   I also found out why there's always a line up - because it's SLOWWWWWWW.  Have you ever actually gone to Peter's and lined up outside?  You're there forever!  Half the time you forgot what you even ordered.   All in all, if you're looking for a delicious burger:  Naina's, Boogies, McDonald's.  Anywhere but here. In the words of the late Greg Giraldo to Larry the Cable Guy at his roast \"How the f*@K are you SO POPUULLLARRR?????\""}
{"text":"not really worth a huge line for ok food and a good shake"}
{"text":"Alright, if you lived in Calgary for a while you've undoubtedly heard of Peter's Drive In and, more likely than not, you've tried it.  If you haven't, get your butt down there to experience one of Calgary's best drive-thru's!  Seriously.  I think the reason Peter's is so great is because they don't sugar coat their advertising.  The burgers that you buy at Peter's are sloppy and messy... and that's exactly how they're shown.  Not only that, but a single burger comes with one and a half patties!  Yeah... I'm not lying!  It's pretty wicked.  Another great thing about Peter's is the large parking area they have next to the drive-thru.  It's the perfect place to park and eat, or sit on one of the benches.  If you're not lucky enough to have a car, they do have walk-up windows, but I don't think they're as fast serving them.  I caution you to be careful when driving up to Peter's.  There are two different lanes that you can go down, but one requires a passenger to do the talking and paying.  Don't go down this lane if you're alone in the car or you'll be struggling to get your order.  I've made that mistake...  Peter's is an awesome place to go for fast, delicious food.  Whether you're in a hurry, or you've got a bit of time to waste, I think Peter's is definitely one of the best drive-thru's Calgary has to offer.  Good thing it wasn't shut down after that E. Coli scare..."}
{"text":"I love peters for their milkshakes! Espcially the bubblegum one :) The burgers are really good too, you order a single cheese burger and they give you one and a half patties. The con is that you have to get your passenger to make the purchase and grab the food."}
{"text":"This used to be such a great place. Since the new ownership, the food is different, especially the fries which now are tiny and taste like cardboard. Such a shame."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas visiting Calgary for business. My Canadian colleagues suggested Peter's and commented on how they served huge fry portions and awesome milkshakes. But I really wanted a burger. So I tried out their double cheese and a choco ms, The burger was slathered in some weird steak/bbq type sauce. It was weird and messy but definitely tasty. The shake was awesome. Thick rich and creamy. The burger a little weird, sorta like a thin-chili dipped burger."}
{"text":"I am visiting Calgary for a volunteer trip and the woman I was with insisted we check out Peter's for a quick lunch. I ordered a burger and Oreo milkshake (super healthy, I know). She had let me know that their milkshakes have a reputation of being the best in North America - that's lofty, but it may be true.  The burger was meh. The onion rings my friend ordered were meh. The milkshake was unbelievably good. It's thick, had big chunks of Oreo (without getting stuck in the straw) and I honestly couldn't put it down.  It's modeled after a 60's drive-in, which is super fun! Overall, I give it a three. Not sure I'd go again for food, but would definitely stop by for another shake.  If you're from out of the country: they do not take US credit/debit cards, so make sure you have cash or a friend with a Canadian debit."}
{"text":"There are many positives and one negative to this chain. The positives are as follows  Everything about the Milkshakes Excellent Thickness, Taste, Flavour Selection, and temperature. 5 stars  The burgers and fries As for the milkshakes, the selection and taste was exquisite, and if you just want a classic burger and fries feel, peters is your place to go. 4 1/2 stars  The venue  The venue is nice, however the picnic tables are worn down. Could use some maintenance. 3 1/2 stars.   The only negative I can think of is the sloppiness of the burger. It falls apart easily and ingredients are sometimes unevenly placed. 2 Stars.  If I average out my ratings I would be giving peters drive in a 3 1/2 or so, but the taste of everything is so fitting with itself, it deserves a 4 1/2 star rating. But since you can't give half stars on yelp, it would be more fitting to give peters a 4 rather than a 5, because it isn't perfect.   In conclusion, this is a must eat at. 4 stars"}
{"text":"Peter's.  I mean, yes, the nostalgia factor is cool. I love a place with some history. I love a place that has been doing the same thing for decades.  But when that \"thing\" is not very good quality, what more can you say?  The burgers are tough little flattened hockey pucks that are doused in enough of a condiment mish-mash to both mask the crappy patty and turn the bun into a soggy wad.  The shakes are like sucking sweetened cement. Not bad, just not very functional. There are a lot of flavours, which is fun, but what good is that if you can't even get them to come out of the straw?  The ONE thing that I think Peter's really has going for them is the onion rings. They are actually REALLY good. Possibly the best in the city. This is their one saving grace that saved this review from being ONE star.  Sorry Peter's, I think if I need a burger fix, I'll be heading around the corner to Boogie's."}
{"text":"This is a sad day in history, a famous Calgary icon has gone to the crapper.   Peters used to be \"THE PLACE TO GO FOR BURGERS\". now since the original owner has sold it it has steadily gone to crap,  the burgers are soggy and tasteless unless they drowned it in the BBQ sauce and only then is it edible, the fries are bland and taste like yesterday's refrieds, the onion rings taste like sawdust and are so greasy you can lube your car with the grease off your hands from touching them.  The so called gravy is just brown thick water with a wired after taste.   The only thing left not destroyed by the new management is the shakes but even those are going down hill.    It seems that the most recent management has decided to go bargain basement with products and ingredients.  Sacrifice an icon to make more money but of all the ppl I have spoken to 75% said they will never go back to peters because of the new management."}
{"text":"Oh Peter, where did it all go wrong?  You used to be the place I craved whilst knocked up, now I can't even look at you.  Why, why have you changed?  Your burgers are a mess, and not even a hot mess, just a sad sad mess.  Your fries have lost their perk and are oh so greasy, not even the good greasy that is sexy.  And your shakes, the start to our affair, although still hold a place deep within the very depths of my soul, are now the main reason I don't see you anymore.  While still temptingly delicious and oh so creamy, I WILL NOT PROSTITUTE MYSELF FOR YOUR $5 SHAKE.  I AM SORRY, YOUR MILKSHAKE DOES NOT BRING ALL THE BOYS TO THE YARD, HECK IT ISN'T EVEN BRINGIN' THE GIRLS!  I am sooo over you Peter, even though every summer you tempt me so, all I can say to you is fuggedaboudit."}
{"text":"SORRY Calgary, but Peter's Drive In is NOT the legendary, awesome, fabulous place you think it is.  Peter's Drive In serves flavourless mushy burgers on unimpressive white cake buns. A \"small\" frozen Con-Agra generic brand fries weighs about a pound, and everyone thinks this is remarkable. It is not.  Service is empathetic and generic.  For a MUCH MUCH better and more satisfying \"Drive In\" experience, head to \"CB DRIVE IN\" on Northmount. CB actually serves similar food, but its cheaper and the fries are of particular note: old-school krinkle cuts with that orange seasoning salt.  The food at CBs is extremely close to what you would have gotten in the 50s or 60s. AND the owner guy is this hilarious, friendly, AWESOME Korean guy with a VOICE that should be in commercials. You have to go there to know what I mean.  ANyway, dont bother with Peters no matter how much you have heard how its a tradition and a landmark and all that. CBs Drive In, or Angels Drive In (Bowness) are WAAAAY the hell better, and ICONS in their own way as well."}
{"text":"Their burgers have gone downhill but are still decent enough to consume.  I have had some pretty mushy ones where the sauce was all over the place - super unappetizing.  I really only go there now for the milkshakes and onion rings.   The milkshakes are so thick and there are so many flavours that you never have to have the same one twice."}
{"text":"I eat at Peters' almost every time I visit Calgary, because we don't have anything quite like this in Edmonton.   I heard about the food poisoning thing, but from what I know, that only happened once, and the new owners have worked extremely hard to ensure this never happens again. It happened in 2005, and there's numerous articles on the Internet covering the story. I feel like it's safe to eat here, and I am super paranoid about that stuff.   This place still rocks, even though the workers wear the type of outfits that make them look like they work in a hospital or are part of a cult, it makes this place totally unique. They don't use cash registers here; they use their minds, which also makes me think that they religious fanatics that don't believe in technology.   The food is kind of expensive, but you get what you pay for. An order of fries or onions rings is more than enough to feed two people. And a single cheeseburger is actually a burger and a half. The milkshakes are huge, and they taste really good too.   This place is great in the summer, because you can eat at the many picnic tables that are scattered around the parking lot. There's always lots of little birds that seem rather interested in what you're eating.   Peters' is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have loved Peters since I was a kid.  I remember they would cater for sports days at my elementary school.  Now I don't go often,  maybe once per year, but I have never been disappointed.  Great burgers, shakes and onion rings.  It's great to grab a meal at the window and sit at the nearby picnic tables to eat it in the spring or summer."}
{"text":"I have known staff..and upon hearing how UNCLEAN things are..No thanks...  My friend came over with a milkshake one evening and after drinking about 3/4...something clogged up the straw. An unidentified glob. It was a vanilla shake...."}
