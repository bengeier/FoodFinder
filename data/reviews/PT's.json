{"text":"Decided to check this location out again, tried here about a year ago and didn't like it. Had to ring bell  to enter. We.were greeted by older bartender sat down. Asked about happy hour was told it changed recently and my beer no longer on tap anyways  (new castle). We were offered to sample The PT's beers and love the heffenweiser and red one. They now have kitchen open and wings were great. Bartender kept busy cleaning and that was nice to see as he wasn't pushy like most are and this is.cleanest bar I've seen."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while car being fixed across street. Jules the bartender was friendly and welcoming. I had the omelet and it was enough for two. Price was half price before 10. Home fries were crisp but not greasy. Omelet cooked but not dry. Felt comfortable sitting alone."}
{"text":"Nice after work get together place..happy hour is worth waiting for...food is pretty good. Atmosphere is jumping on late weekend nights or pretty much midnight happy hours..."}
{"text":"They're happy hour is great! It's also just a comfortable place. The bartender is nice and always remembers us. It's a great place to get some pizza and a beer, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Lol, 11/19/2016 7:03 PM, whoever the chick bartender is at that location is horrid, I called to ask how much a large pizza was bc thier website menu doesn't work, the chick answered and said \"pt's on warm springs rd\" , I asked how much is a large pep pizza, she could be heard laughing to her friends who are obviously sitting there keeping her company, she didn't hear me ask my question bc she is oblivious to customer service , so I wait a few seconds to see if she answers me, which she didn't lol, then she hangs up on me. You're lucky I'm not your manager there because I'd fire your ass quicker than you could imagine is possible. Horrid customer service with whoever the rude arrogant chick bartender is at night there. I'll go elsewhere, thanks."}
{"text":"It was cool pn wednesday night. Cool music. & bartender was cool too. I think her name was Lisa. She took care of us as soon as we were taking a seat! I like coming here. Good job"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service is bottom of the barrel.  I wait maybe 15mins to even get a \"I'll be with you in a moment\" when it's seriously dead in there. Even though I'm patient and make my order they act very like I'm wasting there time and give me pretty bad attitude. Just because you have huge breast doesn't give you the right to talk to people like there second class citizens because I don't come to your bar religiously."}
{"text":"People please don't go to this PTs... Bad customer service..Waited 20 minutes and no never came over to take our order...No stars for you"}
{"text":"Great bar, friendly atmosphere. The entire staff is Amazing!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great! The only problem me and my coworkers had was with the bartender that worked on 2-7-15 from 7-12am. She messed up our check twice and charged our cards way more then what was suppose to be charged, if she was willing to listen to the directions given to charge out the bill she would have gotten a better tip"}
{"text":"A Great bar!!!  The only problem is there is no coat check."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location for years, glad I stopped in. Hot bartenders (Tiffini and Jenna), great happy hour prices and good company. I'm coming back for more."}
{"text":"Poor service, took forever and it is not even busy. Shameful because other PT's better atmosphere than this location."}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend with my wife and cousin. They switched to a new menu and found that my large hualapai IPA is now $11 when it used to be like $9. The pizzas are now $20 for a cheese pizza when it used to be cheaper and they got rid of the cheaper small plates. I will not be coming back here anytime soon since they decided to screw locals and try to get a few extra dollars in their pockets. $10 for basic mozzarella sticks? Cmon now...  

Note: all our servers have been awesome (Joseph in particular) and I will be sad to not see them as often."}
{"text":"Love PT'S but had an awful experience with out bartender Liz tonight. Dirty looks from across the bar, snide comments all night. Dropped off my friends sliders and fries asked if she needed anything. Friend says ummmm ketchup maybe? Rudely stalks off, comes back slams ketchup down and says didn't know you wanted it all you had to do was ask.  Wait that's what she did. Amazing food but an awful waitress makes us not wanna make this our  after work hangout. Sad because we go everyday and will not be returning after Liz being so rude to us."}
{"text":"I do not know why I still go here, not once have I ordered and it's been right! I seriously have had enough of this damn place, I'm so fed up with their incompetent staff! I will continue to go here, and never leave a single dime for a tip, they seriously need to hire a whole new staff, the current ones are trash, ALL OF THEM!"}
{"text":"Great foods, the owner is super friendly and so are his staffs. The place is nice and neat. I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"I feel at home here!  Todd the Manager makes it a point to know your name.  The food is amazing too!  I recommend the loaded bucket of tater tots or the Gilroy pizza.  David the cook is very friendly and accomodating.  He's an awesome chef and is one of the reasons I come back!  Did I mention half off all drinks from 4pm-7pm?  The best after work happy hour in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite while my car was getting worked on.  Ok service.  Typical bar food menu that was just ok as well."}
{"text":"Has the most AMAZING Nachos I have ever had!! Perfect bar food and the staff is great!! Happy hour is always good to me and my friends!! :D"}
{"text":"Whenever we throw a party we like to get a few buckets of wings from here. There are a ton of flavors to choose from and everyone I have tried is very good. The service is always prompt an I get taken care of. For those that like to hang out it has a great vibe and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great bartenders! 5 Stars! Good food, good people, great happy hour rates."}
{"text":"Worst bar in Vegas!! Carrie is a supreme idiot! The other bartender too, ugliest mug cant miss him, slower then a turtle on standby!"}
{"text":"I don't really care for this place. Their drinks are over priced for somewhere as run down as this and their glass cups look dirty, like they aren't clean all the way. This place is also pretty boring. The bartenders are usually nice though, but the only thing I really like about this place is the $5 pool tables for an hour deal. The area is pretty remote and sketchy too."}
{"text":"I had never experienced racism in my life... This guy's (bartenders) stopped the music that I PAID for in the juke box just because it was in SPANISH. ... they said they couldn't play the music because other customers didn't like it, I PAID FOR IT JUST LIKE OTHER PEOPLE PAY FOR THEIR MUSIC. ... THEY WERE RACISTS TO ME AND I WILL NEVER GO TO ANY PT'S BAR AGAIN EVER IN MY LIFE"}
{"text":"Bartender ... Amanda, as I'm currently sitting here after coming in to watch the game and eat is extremely rude, disinterested and the body language of someone who could care less.

It starts with me coming in @ 5.30ish and not be addressed for about 10 minutes ... & being that I'm a frequent visitor of Pt's I know its happy hour.  Bartender made no mention of it to me, but its funny as others came to the bar after me, she gave them the full run down ... Hmm!

Okay no problem ... so when she finally engages and takes my order, never came back to check on me ... but surely enough the patron sitting next to me drink was refilled four times 30 minute lapse and then stops and asked if I want another.

The saving grace was the Laker game was on and the gentleman who works the bar on Monday night was outstanding, hence why I came back to this location.

Never again ... Horrible service & attitude!"}
{"text":"Great experience for local bar!! The grave bartender Sam is awesome! This is deffinetly my new spot!"}
{"text":"pool tables, darts,and cheap pitchers and a super cute Malinda... PT's is a great great time =] Not to expensive, great atmosphere, and an awesome lounging area ... I love me some PT's."}
{"text":"WTF!! Lame ass bartenders 
Friday night was dead. Place sucked. The chick bartender rude and actually not too attractive unless you like the \"daddy took me to the tool shed too much when I was young\" look. Scrawny, bitchy, zits on her back,  no personality!!!! Even her implants are sexy... Think maybe it's a metro sexual place as the guy seemed to wink at guys. Avoid this place. Both bartender never washed there hands in 2 hours. Ugh"}
{"text":"Bartender uses the expensive alcohol to make your check heavy. Overly priced drinks but the food is the best. When asking for a drink, the bartender makes a face. There are other PT's, don't go to this one."}
{"text":"Ice cold beer and pretty bartenders... What else do ya need?? 

Food is good and the slots hit!"}
{"text":"Great service! The overnight bartender (Stephanie) is amazing. She is always quick, thoughtful, and professional! Plus she is a sight to look at ;) clean bar, fun atmosphere, and always a good time!"}
{"text":"My usually stop after a long night of work! How can yah possibly pass on 50% off breakfast!?! No brainer! I stick to the steak and eggs with sourdough toast! Such a great deal with great food!"}
{"text":"\"Great Place To Take a Break From Anything\"...Free WiFi, Great Food, Drinks,Games,ect... All in All a Great Place to Relax and Enjoy....... 
     Happy Hour 4-7pm & 12-4am"}
{"text":"The worst pt's in town. Service absolutely sucks, with two bartenders behind the bar. Over $40 down and not even hey do you want a water."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with some friends, and one of my besties is a local and recommended this place for the karaoke and late night happy hour (12a-3p). So we jumped in a cab to meet him and another friend there. 

We sat down at the bar and we were greeted by a wonderfully cantankerous bartender named Kevin. He served us up some wonderful drinks and witty banter. He really makes the place awesome.

We had some wonderful drinks and delicious pizza (white sauce, chicken, and mushrooms...I'm not kidding, you have to try it.yum). And it was VERY reasonably priced during their happy hour. I mean, it was downright cheap.

So why aren't I giving it five stars, you ask? Well, their karaoke wasn't working. And the bar wasn't as hopping as my friend says it usually is during karaoke nights, so we were disappointed. The karaoke lady was still there, attempting to work it out with her iPod and a few friends' phones, but when she said we could sing if we knew the words, she meant we could sing whatever songs she had on their phones. *Shrug*

Anyway, overall, I think it's a great local bar and I would give it another try for karaoke on our next visit. :)"}
{"text":"I love coming to this PTs. Everyone here is so friendly. The bartenders know the locals by name and already have my drink waiting for me sometimes before I even sit down at the bar! Great food, excellent service, and almost never smokey."}
{"text":"PT'S is generally a good fallback for a decent meal, a beer and maybe some video poker. They are usually a bit smokey however. The bartender got my order wrong but the food was still okay. I had not been to this location. The bartender that relieved the first was Crystal and she was far more friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Bartender is rude unless she likes you. Roma's pizza was the only reason worth even stopping by this bar."}
{"text":"It's bar food what could I have expected.  The place was busy and the bartenders where on their game last night.  I didn't have to wait long to get a drink or for them to take my food order so they get points for that.  The food on the other hand was not good.  I ordered chicken wings and they where bland over cooked.  The fries that came with it where undercooked and just not tasty at all.  I only had a bit from each and just left.  The food was only tone star but the service bumps it up to two stars.  With so many places to choose from I think PT's need to be on point every time."}
{"text":"This is the spot I go after work.  Kevin the bartender seems very laid back and maybe even bored sometimes but he's nice."}
{"text":"I recently been calling this location \"my spot\" because my friends and I have been going there frequently as of late. Food is pretty good and thanks to my fave bartender Derek, he has introduced  me to my new favorite beer, 'Blue Moon Peach.'  He even had it ready for me without even asking. Score! So delicious ice cold and on draft. I suggest every try it. I also enjoy the fresh potato chips and bucket fries. Great place to go anytime, but esp after a hard days work. It's not a loud place, so it's easy to talk to your buds and chill. Thanks Derek and the rest of the staff for the great customer service, beer, food, and occasional small talk."}
{"text":"This location is okay. Service was very slow. It's hard to get anyone's attention. I was with a group of people, we all had tabs open, but the bartender put every drink on my tab and then it was confused on what to separate at the end of the night. I had 3 drinks and paid $61. Something wasn't right, but no point in arguing. The bartender with glasses, skinny, long hair is very very RUDE. Will not return."}
{"text":"I normally like this place, but I am very upset with the overnight bartender's customer service skills. I completely felt discriminated against. I don't know if it was my skin color, my age, or just the fact that my friends and I were out so late, but the bartender treated us like we were nothing. He was rude, he yelled, gave \"smart aleck\" answers to our questions, and he completely seemed like he  didn't want to be bother with us; however when a group of young girls came in right after us; he was the nicest person to them. He even let them sit at the bar without checking their ID, Stating \"I hope you guys are over 21.\" Hope? I didn't know we issue gaming cards on hope! There's too many PTs in Las Vegas, so I will not return. And I recommend if you're going out late at night, choose another place"}
{"text":"You know, I am a firm believer of good service and honoring promotions set by a corporation, especially happy hour in a bar. I came here thinking it would be nice to catch up with my brother and have a couple of drinks. We got here just before midnight and realized that happy hour was about to start. However, we ordered literally TWO MINUTES before and the waitress put in our order.  We then ordered other stuff that was on the happy hour menu thinking it would be all good since we were going to be here DURING the freaking time stated. Unfortunately, when we got our check, all of the drinks were not half price like they should have been, and when we asked the waitress, she said her manager quote \"said there was nothing they could do\". What kind of s**t is that?!?!?! Very disappointing. And speaking from someone who came here since they were a teenager before the place was a bar, I'm very upset on what this place has become. I will not be back. Ever. Shame on you pt's. Your company has become such a disappointment"}
{"text":"I love this bar! The staff is great, the food is awesome and its a REAL vegas local favorite."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service by entire staff, from the cooks to the manager (Todd Kline).  Nicole is an amazing server who always takes care of people, Ashley and Starr were wonderful additions.  I can't say enough good things about this location.  Well one more Dave is the BEST cook PT's has, hands down."}
{"text":"Rude bartenders. Food decent. Regular drinks prices, over priced. Took 15 minutes just to be acknowledged. Once we were, she didn't smile  and took forever to get our drinks. Pool is always fun with friends tho so this place gets two stars."}
{"text":"I am new to Vegas and was looking for a low key bar to hang out at.  Alot of people had said Pt's was a good spot so we decided to check it out.  Probably will never go back again.  When we got there the girl who greeted us was very nice, we decided to go sit at the bar.  The bartender was very rude.  It took her about 5-10 minutes to come up to as after we had sat down.  (maybe 4 or 5 other people at bar)  We both ordered a beer, took about ten minutes to get them.  When she brought them she put them on the edge of the bar, on her side, we were not sure if we were supposed to get them or wait for her.  I am not asking her to put them in our hands but she just put them there and walked away.  We stayed for about 30 minutes, we were never offered a menu or asked if we needed anything else.  She spent most of her time on the other side of the bar talking to what seemed to be a waitress.  It is a nice bar,very clean but the whole time we were there we felt like we were a burden to her."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke! They served me a beer but then carded me for my players card. The bartender had about 5 brain cells"}
{"text":"4 Steins of Newcastle's 2 shots of Jamison and a Large Italian Thin Crust Pizza all for under 37 bucks without tip for happy hour....pretty Good"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday waiting for my second drink over 2 hours and never got it when I asked for my check it took the bartender an other hour to bring it to me and to my disappointment I seen that he charged me for both of my drinks even he never brought me the second one"}
{"text":"Come here to watch those games you wished to have with more excitement and good company...
Must try for those wine lovers: glass of Riesling (server recommended it for me)
As for the Italian pizza, it was good... It had a somewhat thin crust with tasty marinara sauce, topped off with sausage, pepperoni, and olives if preferred.    
As for the layout of the place, this bar had tv's running across the top wall and there was plenty more in different locations, good for everyone to have a good view wherever they may be seating."}
{"text":"Food was pretty darn good. Server didnt pay any attention and took 20 minutes to bring out wings with only 2 other tablesoccupied in the entire restaurant"}
{"text":"Had a great first time here after work with one of my colleagues.  Matt was the one to take care of us and he was super friendly and funny. My friend and I are always looking for new places to explore and we will definitely be back here in the future. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a bar. We sat and got our drinks played $5. Then we figured we would eat. Ordered one hamburger and the rest buffalo fries. Order took over an hour to come ! Drinks never got refilled (soda) & food came out cold. Waitress / bar tender asked if there was anything else I sent it all back asked for the tab so I can get out of there. I was so upset. She asked if I wanted to reorder. No no no would of taken another hour to remake it! This was horrible don't wait your time or hard earned money for this. Worthless & pointless"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Ordered well done Bacon Swiss burger with ketchup, mustard and mayo and FF. What I got was a rare burger with lettuce only. Very dry! Oh and 7 fries. Yes 7! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Seems cool so far man. Was a great hamburger good service and friendly people everywhere. I had a few nice cold ones and a excellent hamburger. 
 Only problem I had was I am a ex-smoker. And had to take a shower when I got back to the hotel because of all the cig smoke! But it's Vegas and that's to be expected I guess. anyway I wont go back simply because of the smoke but the food and service was great."}
{"text":"Terrible service I always order the same thing and its always wrong when they bring your food out the server never fails to get upset because we tell them the order is incorrect if your looking for service don't come here or make sure you triple check with the waiters your order is correct."}
{"text":"Am shocked. This PTs.has great service. They have nice bartenders. Their bathroom is pristine. A clean bar bathroom? It isn't a dream. I witnessed it!"}
{"text":"PT's you guys!

Best HH in Vegas. and they don't judge you for ordering a tall Coors Light with a side of ice at 8 am on a Sunday so you can get a nice little Tebowner before work.

I love you Erin, you horse riding fool. And Patrick, I'm giving you a fistbump right now. Don't leave me hanging man! It's ok, we'll connect later. No worries.

But seriously you guys, this is a great joint. Usually all the pool tables (regulation baby!) are functioning, and there's never a terrible wait to get your game on. HH is great, 3-7 and midnight-4am everyday, 1/2 off all drinks and zas. 

Ichiza is just down the road too, so feel free to get a nice little buzz on and get down on some whole roasted squid you guys."}
{"text":"The bartender Justin is very attentive and up spirited!! Definitely a nice addition to the bar!"}
{"text":"I went there couple times already. Personally I think it's a very good good place to hang out with co-workers and also close to where I work (as my part time job)!

They have one security guard check ID before enter the bar area; then you will see a full bar in front of you with 2-3 TVs on each side. If you want avoid smoke or group of ppl, maybe you should turn left, they have couple sofa down there; or turn right if you want quiet and eat something here (because they provide 1/2 off on pizza after midnight and 1/2 on all the drinks, very very value).

I love their nachos, especially steak!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!

Easy parking + open 24 hrs + looking for DANNY ( I like his service very much)...... = enjoy a night!"}
{"text":"This is the big gambler's PT's.  Lots of big spenders go here.  Problem is with PT's points system.  You have to be a big gambler to benefit... and I'm not.  Food is always decent at PT's but they gyp you on the keno payouts and again, the points aren't generous either.  It feels like the little gamblers are funding the perks for the bigger ones..."}
{"text":"The Food at PT's was very good. The waitress was also very good. The WAIT however, was very long. There were only the two parties in the place when we arrived, so I'm guessing that's why it took so long, but waiting an hour for food seems like a bit much. 

Also, if you like torturing yourself, be sure to try the Guinness Float. You'll be sorry you did."}
{"text":"Great service. Quick friendly. Susan does a great job of balancing her tables. Happy hour is great! But comes at a cost. I've gone 6 times so far and 3 of those times the liquor was watered down. You know there's a problem when a white boy can shoot patron shots without a second glance."}
{"text":"This is the only PT's that I like. Derek is the most amazing bartender ever!  I've been going here for 6 years and I drive out of my way now to go there.

Let me put it this way.  Once you've been in a time or two, you will be greeted the next occasion at your favored sitting place with the drink that you ordered. For instance, my ginormous Miller Lite is sitting at my favorite place and bartender greets me with a bump before my butt hits the seat.  ...and greeted by name.

It doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's a short drive away after a long day's work.  This place is usually lively even on weeknights.  A lot of my coworkers and seemingly other workers make their way here from the strip.  So it definitely is more of a locals joint than touristy spot.  This place has made for a lot of fun times.  The bartenders are cool and Brett is definitely the coolest.  Dude has heck of a memory and will share stories and will usually make for awesome time with friends.
    Like any PT's being at the bar right up is your best bet for a drink.  If you're in the outskirts, say the pool tables or sofas the drinks will take a lil while.  4 of 5 because they've provided for some awesome nightcaps during all the times I've been here."}
{"text":"You have to be in the business to understand the business... This is by far my favorite PT's... Not too smokey like most and the grave bartender, Heather, is awesome... After being here twice she knew immediately what I wanted, made me feel welcomed and has nothing but excelled when it comes to being on point with service.
   Things like refills before my beer is gone, goes a long way and tends to win me over when the bartender knows instinctively to serve you.  That and all the stories she shares when it's not too busy make me come back.  This PT's can be fun and has a lay back atmosphere.  Expect to get to know the regulars once you've established yourself as a local, they're all fairly inviting."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin...this is the second time I've been to this location and it has the same bartender as before. On a Saturday night they literally have only 1 bartender, and it's a pretty busy location. He certainly isn't a great service provider that's for sure. He always walks around the bar a few times and passes you by...once I get his attention I ask him for what I need, he then tells me he has 4 ppl before me...(so why listen to what I was asking for) he then continues to go back to help the ppl that tip him continuously that he already assisted. So while my food gets cold sitting there, I'm still waiting for just a thing of ranch that I had already ordered with my food that I never got! So as I tell him he rolls his eyes about his coworker not putting it with the food order. Way to show his coworker some respect. Regardless of who forgot, it shouldn't be such a hassle as he made it to be. Bottom line if you're looking for slow ignored service...this is the spot for you!! So Enjoy!

On a later note I got up the play my turn at pool and then turn around to go back to the chair I was sitting on which had my purse hanging on it, and the lady cook had the dirty bus tub on my chair and didn't even wipe it off after using to hold her bus tub to collect cups and dishes. The worst I swear!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet bar. Happy hour drinks were pretty good. Wings weren't too big but they were okay. Fries were hot and good
Service pretty average as there was only 1 person working the bar. We also played pool for a bit.

Overall a pleasant experience and since it's just around the corner we will be returning."}
{"text":"This Pts Gold location in particular is an average bar with decent tvs and sometimes pool tables. Beers are always cold and great on tap. Food is average. Service is good. 

Gambling: ive had decent luck- i won my very first 4card keno jackpot here- $7009 back in 2014! I play mostly 5, 6, and 7 spots now if i come here. Its close to me so an easy walk or drive."}
{"text":"I just left PT's because the bartender  didnt acknowledge us at all , she was busy but 7 min not even a hello even tho she picked up the empty glass and bottle that was right infront of us , we cashed out because she didnt pay attention at all to us 7 min and not even a Hi give me a minute , but she said Hi to the lady that came in way after us , we not gamblers but we went to eat, i had to call and ask for her name because obviously she never greet us, horrible experience, we just left to the PTs next to airport and the minute we walked in we were greated even tho its super busy"}
{"text":"Spring Mtn and Arville, yep, the asian pt's. This place seems a lot more bigger than most other PT's, plus there are a lot of pool tables. Drink's are always cold. This one seems a lot more relax than the other locations. This would tie the Silverado Ranch and Pollack Pt's as my favorite one's in the group. Plus, what is great about this location is that if you're jonesing for some pad Thai or pho, there are plenty of locations around here open late for your convenience.

The only knock I would give this place is that sometimes the bar would get really crowded and you would only see 1 bartender and barback. The wait times can get really long, even though they are trying their best to get the orders out. It's not their fault, more of a management/staffing issue."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the nachos! Service was quick. Place was cozy. Sports on the TVs. They do need a better lunch menu. It appears to be the same menu for all times."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this a 1 star is because I use to play pool here for tournaments and everytime I did it was a great night. That being said, tonight was just horrible. And I mean HORRIBLE! I walked in and they had karaoke playing which is fine, but the people singimg were terrible, and the sound for the karaoke was so loud I couldn't even talk to the person I was with unless I was right on top of her or I was screaming it. On top of it when I walked in didn't get greeted by the bartender until 10 mins after sitting down at the bar. Wasn't fast at all and can't understand why there is 1 bartender for a Saturday night. If you're going to bartend by yourself you need to stay on top of it. Not look at the person see him wave, acknowledge him and then start stacking glasses like you're doing something important. The crowd was okay but 1 guy was screaming loud as hell and kept saying NO WAY like 50 times... Overall I had a bad experience tonight and very disappointed that the bar is like this. I use to come to bar all the time to say hi and play pool but sadly I might have to start looking for a new bar if they don't start improving their bartenders and updating a few things in the bar too. Sorry for the bad review, but there was no reason for the service and atmosphere I saw in that bar tonight. Very embarrassed I pick this bar for a date night."}
{"text":"This bar is the shit.  My friends literally make fun of me for coming here as much as I do, and I keep coming back because they have a ton of pool, beer pong tables, cheap drinks and awesome friendly bartenders.  This bar is mcdonalds.  I'm lovin it."}
{"text":"Came early on a Sunday morning (only people in the building!) Specifically came in for 1/2 off breakfast deal (side note - this is for EVERY PT's/Sierra Golds, daily! before 10am) The breakfast menu is very limited - probably for the discount reason. I got just the egg breakfast with sausage and toast. Once again, it is half off so the toast was the really cheap bread and pretty burned. Sausage links were greasy but good and eggs were well scrambled. You can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came after work: we shoulda read more of the reviews because we had one of the worst service ever. Never knew the guys name and he recommended the house beers. (even tho they are not good at all) I work in hospitality and I get it to recommend house stuff but don't push and please recommend better stuff. The service was slow and when I'm sitting at a bar please give me at least okay service I'm right in front of you. But shoutout to the cooks the pizza was good ."}
{"text":"PT's Pub is a chain in Vegas. Some are nicer, MUCH nicer than others. This one, not so much.

The bartender was cool, but that's about it. The clientele is a little sketchy, and the place needs to be updated really bad.

{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Came for happy hour and literally had to flag down the bartenders every time I needed something. We ordered a round of shots that they forgot completely about so we had to ask a second time for it. Bartenders didn't check up on me once to see if I needed refills nor if I wanted to order food. This place needs some new bartenders."}
{"text":"PT's makes the best pizza I've had in ages. If you like thin crust with lots of cheese, this is it. The bar is clean, and so are the restrooms. We like this particular PT's for its friendly, efficient service, and the great location near Hacienda on Decatur. I give it five stars because it is exactly what a late-night bar should be."}
{"text":"The service is great and everyone is super friendly! Steve the bartender is awesome, as well as the cook in the kitchen! The pizza is always hot and delicious. Definitely our go to spot!"}
{"text":"Been having good luck with the machines lately .  Happy hour from 5-7pm & again from midnight to 2am.  I like that they change food specials every month, variety is nice."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food and drink specials.  Seems like this place has good gaming too .  Love the chorizo tacos...$5"}
{"text":"Here we go.....well my wife and i frequent this pts and we always have mixed feelings....sometimes they bend over backwards to make our pts outing one to remember but other times they simply dont care and just do there own thing and make us feel almost unwelcome. We only go during happy hour for the drink specials and we also try to make football games for the half priced pizzas and other goodies...so i give them 4 stars only because the times we went were really good and they did everything they could and lacking 1 star because im still bitter from the other experiences......"}
{"text":"PT's is a very basic bar chain in Las Vegas.  Nothing exciting.

This particular place had karaoke going on the night in question, and it was way too loud.  The service was bad, but that's because they had just one bartender working on a Saturday night.  The prices are cheaper than you'll find elsewhere because it's a neighborhood bar.  About 3 or 4 bucks for a beer.  I can live with that."}
{"text":"Our favorite hangout in Vegas. It's off the beaten path and where the locals go, and its only about 2 miles from Mandalay Bay/Luxor (DON'T WALK, cab or Uber it). Great bar food, it tastes good and you get plenty for your money. It's spacious and they have pool tables in the back. Joe and Kevin are awesome, they make you feel very welcome and like you've known them for years. It's a great atmosphere, much better than all of the touristy crap on the Strip. And if you absolutely must gamble at every single place you go when in Vegas, yes, they have games built into parts of the bar here too. Drink a big beer for me when you go, you owe it to me for sharing this with you."}
{"text":"When we realized there was a two hour wait at Goyemon's, we decided to grab a brew at PT's (just down the street) while we waited.  One in our party needed a quick bite, and before we knew it a large platter of eye-pleasing nachos was delivered to us as lounged on the couches.  Tri-colored tortillas chips provided an aesthetically pleasing backdrop for an abundant array of juicy,tasty tomatoes, jalapeños, at least two kinds of cheese I believe, a generous serving of guacamole and sour cream, and even more than I can remember.

I struggled with deciding between three or four stars because the building and interior are worn and energy just felt a bit tired.  But every time I think about the cold brews on tap (I had a Fat Tire) and the scrumptious nachos, I realize I've got to give them props.

They are a pub and they do it well!  Based on this experience, I'll keep PT's in my list of go-to places when a group of us wants to hang out.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I played 200 in the poker machine and she tried to charge me for my drink. Had a lousy burger, compared to the cheapest fast food burger drive inns."}
{"text":"I really love most PT's but in this one I always feel uncomfortable. The two bartenders who are usually there seem like they go out of their way to be rude.  I can see that maybe they are joking but to me it's unnecessary.  Just give me a tall glass of beer with a smile it's not that difficult."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the case for all PTs but the lemon pepper wings I ordered were super salty.

Took a while to get some drinks at the bar but it was busy.

They have a few video poker/blackjack machines to play on and screens up top the bar showing sports"}
{"text":"This is the only PTs I will regularly visit. Every OTHER PTs location I have been has left a bad taste in my mouth (sometimes literally) for the chain. At this location however, the prices are decent (especially during Happy Hour), the standard bar food is a little more costly then I would expect for the location, which reminds me that it's a PTs. The Bartenders always manage to find time to stop and greet their customers, and Dale (Bartneder) remembered my beer on my second visit (2 weeks later).

If you've been to any of the PTs throughout town before and weren't satisfied, give this location a try before giving up on the chain entirely. If you do happen to enjoy the other locations, this one will probably rock your socks!

Be forewarned though, there tends to be really loud, somewhat ridiculous karaoke here on some nights..."}
{"text":"Very pleased with how this visit went.  I can honestly say I have never been disappointed at a Pts.  The bartender was nice and saved us a pretty penny with giving us the menu with football specials.  
Clean environment, can't say anything about the guests because every one kept to themselves and that's what I like.  
The food was good for an affordable price.  The wings however were a little spicey for a mild but o well they were still good."}
{"text":"I went to this PT's because, I had a long wait for an oil change, and it was right across the street. To my surprise... I found Jennifer there... It was her first day there, because she had transferred there from the PT's I'd normally visit. 

The decor is really cool. I really liked the layout. It felt very warm and cozy. 

The shopping center is very easily accessible. 

The food was pretty much up to PT's Standards. I had a chicken sandwich... The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the vegetables, along with the bread was very fresh.

The service was exceptional. It wasn't extremely busy, but the customers were pretty spread out, and the bar tenders spent equal time with each person sitting at the bar. 

As many of my followers know, it's very rare for me to rate a business with 5 Stars... This PT's earned each of those stars.

I can't wait to go visit Jennifer, and the rest of the staff again!!"}
{"text":"The best bar in Las Vegas! The bartenders Tino and Ashley are the BEST! They are so professional! They wait on all the customers quickly. The beer is cold and the drinks are perfectly made. The thin crust pizza is delicious. All the food is great! Pool tables in the back for a fun time. The bar has lots of machines for those that want to gamble. Big screen tv's everywhere to watch all the games. We love this bar!"}
{"text":"Worst parking situation, other cars double park to block you in and PT's has no solution but to ask the bar go'ers. Takes forever to get a drink from bartenders, better off standing in line at a club."}
{"text":"I can't give this anything but 1 star because I never had my order taken in the 38 minutes I was sitting there. The chef was watching the game and who knows what the waitress was doing. The place wasn't busy, which was weird on the 1st Football Sunday, but then I realized why. Don't go here if you want to eat. TERRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"Graveyard Steph is the best!! She is so hard working and gets your drink fast!! Tip her good!!!!!"}
{"text":"For starters, I'm being generous with the 2 stars. This place isn't what it used to be, the whole staff has changed in the past couple months and it has gone way down hill! I'm talking like 1-2 min waiting on a beer to now like 10-15. The amount of people here hasn't really changed, maybe less if anything! I know me and my normal group of friends (usually about 8 of us on average) have noticed it going downhill greatly! We don't even go here that often anymore, it was \"our bar\" for months! The older crew was just so much more efficient!"}
{"text":"horrible service!!
the servers brought food to the wrong table... and refused to serve my husband alcohol due to another persons attitude. we got treated like we werent welcomed. NEVER again are we going back there"}
{"text":"Oh PT's, you hurt so good. This location is perfect for all those Las Vegas Strip workers like myself. 1/2 off happy hour starting at 12 AM as usual, and nice comfy couches to chillax after a long day of dealing with all those temperamental tourists. Surprisingly, the pool tables are moderately taken care of, and cheap. Shoot the shit, have some beers, and when you start spinning, get a giant pizza or hot wings to sober you up for the drive home. Tip your bartenders, they put up with your drunk ass!"}
{"text":"I will never never go back to a PTs Pub or any OT their other properties including Stratosphere or Avia Casinos until they change there policy. Drinks are based on how much you play not how fast you drink. I played $80 drank 3 beers was charged for the 3rd. I was told for every $20 you play you get a free drink. BS."}
{"text":"80s karaoke night is what saved this location. The half-price shots and beer after midnight helped too. But otherwise, the bartenders weren't particularly attentive, they don't serve food, there are only two stalls in the girls bathroom, it's not exactly the nicest area, etc., etc. But hey, they've got karaoke."}
{"text":"I just moved into Eastgate apartments near the corner of Nellis and Vegas Valley and was pleased, thinking I just found a new watering hole at your Pub located on the corner, spending a great deal amount of money at this location. This Pub is close enough for me and my friends to walk there. Your bartender Mindy gave me poor hospitality from the start when she checked my id. She said what would you like Albert Looney lol saying my last name with a smirk, while laughing. Her and one of the regulars sitting next to me were talking about Mormons. I just thought to state how my cousin married a Mormon. She looks at me and says what does that have to do with anything lol I think he is fishing, trying to get someone to pay attention to him, hey look at me. This was after my second chug from my 3 dollar pint. I was also pleased of this deal. I did not order a second drink, which I was planning on having a few. Then I left for home, upset."}
{"text":"I always love PT's. Nothing beats bar food. EVER. They have good ranch, which is definitely a must for any place that wants to bring me back."}
{"text":"Since BWW Centennial changed management, we are loath to go there for the absolutely horrible service (with the exception of one particularly good waitress). So, it being a while we thought we would try PT's again. Let's just say that so far so good. I will write a full review later if it is warranted after a few visits."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Wasn't too busy.  Arrived at 1140...by 12 we had ordered. Not once did the waitress come back to our table after taking our order.  After waiting 30 minutes for our food my husband went to find the waitress to find out how much longer it would be.  At 1245 we walked out...no food, no communication,  no nothing... and we had met our son who had to get back to work... 
Would not recommend this place to my enemy."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend to have a good time and have a beer and encounter a couple of  issue which upset me.  First of all this is a bar not a freaking club so there no reason to have a bouncer outside asking people for id and shit that dumb is the only pts that does it.  Second the bartender was rude I order two drinks and he wanted me to pay right away and of course expected a tip im like really dude how about I pay you when im done drinking and eating and if your service is good you will get a tip a hole.  And finally the drinks were bad you can tell he was a rookie bartender that didnt know what he was doing the service was awful I even paid and left the drink on top of the bar and left.  I dont recommend this PTs to anyone stay away and spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Didn't want to sit in smoky bar but no one noticed us in the restaurant section so had to move to bar where the one waitress working was eating her lunch. We ordered burgers medium well. After waiting an exceedingly long time, they came out pink and barely warm. Took forever for new ones. In the meantime, waitress never checked on us or refilled our drinks. And did I mention they were excessively heavy handed on the salt??  Not the PTs of old."}
{"text":"This is my local spot....love the staff!!!   Stephanie is the best! Always happy to see you!!  Always ready to engage in the greatest conversations.. Between waiting  on her customers!  Always makes me feel welcome!!!  Love this place"}
{"text":"Tonight I was craving a burger and a little bourbon. I did a search near my apartment and saw there was a PT's. I didn't have major hopes but PT's is known for having a good burger so I thought why not. 

I go into this location and it's old old old. The place REEKS and is dark. I over look that part and find a table near the bar. Of course there is a dirty ashtray and no chair so after I move the ashtray and get a chair at the bar. I sit down. The bartender comes to the end of the bar (doesn't even come out from behind it) and hollers over at me, \"What you drinking?\" I ask her what some of her better bourbons are. She begins to mumble and babble about everything except bourbon. First she starts with Wild Turkey. I point out that that isn't bourbon but Canadian whiskey. She then babbles about a couple of other strange flavored whiskey. I tell her that that's ok and I get up to go look at their bar selection. Immediately I notice Bullit. I have a better feeling but am wondering why she had droned on about other things when there was Bulleit sitting right there.

I order a Bulleit on the rocks and ask for a menu. She quickly tells me that the only food they have are \"personal pizzas\" and something else but I had stopped listening. I asked her, \"Isn't PT's known for their burgers.\" She mumbles something about how that location doesn't have a working kitchen. Of course that means I was probably being offered a frozen pizza cooked in what amounted to a microwave or toaster oven. Gee, thanks. I told her to cancel the bourbon and I got my stuff and left. On the way out some jerk at the bar made a rude comment, which only help solidify that this place is crap.

I'm sorry but in a city like Las Vegas, I am appalled at an establishment that (1) Has such crappy staff that they can't even answer an easy questions like, \"What bourbons do you have?\" and (2) Is so ridiculous that you don't have a working kitchen but offer some frozen crap because you \"HAVE\" to offer food. I will NEVER step foot near this place and am hesitant to EVER go to a PT's again. I wound up at Ace's and Ales and am SOOOOOOO glad I did."}
{"text":"Not a good pt's compared to others. Plus, not the friendliest of service but I do love that happy hour."}
{"text":"Great happy hours after 12am chill spot...comfortable leather couches.  Cool bartenders hooking me up with some strong cocktails and goose without the extra charge!  Got me some fries that were legit.  I think they were fresh cut , but I was so f'd up, they could've been the frozen Ore-Ida kind  for all I know.

Right in the heart of Chinatown.  Too bad that hot filipina server was married...wow was she smoking hot!  Great service and very attentive.  I'll be back for maybe March Madness."}
{"text":"In the evening it is ridiculously smoky, lights at the bar are too bright, food is mediocre, service is...well, where was the service, anyway?  What little service we had was lousy as bartender has attitude.  So, we'll go to Casablanca."}
{"text":"I came here with friends having never been here before and I was very pleasantly surprised! Stephanie was serving us and she was fantastic! We will definitely be back and I highly recommend this location. Not only was the service prompt and accurate, Stephanie made our experience stellar! Get ready for some laughs and great drinks!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Went after work at 2am and although I was one of five people, it still felt fun and welcoming.  The bartender was friendly, the drinks were delicious and even the lovely cook who had 15 minutes left of work insisted on making me some food I could have, since I'm gluten free.  My co-worker and I stayed till 4, shared her pizza with other patrons and gambled a little on the machines.  I will definitely return, as I have become a point earning card member!  LOL.  I do hope more people come out!  It's clean and has pool tables too!"}
{"text":"Gaming, Darts pool table, food, and great staff. Its alittle smoky in there but its My pts"}
{"text":"I'm typically not a PT's fan nor do I frequent the business, however I decided to pop in this location one day to watch the Vegas Golden Knights game and have a couple drinks.

SERVICE: The one thing that really stood out about this location was the service. It was a very professional and warm interaction. The bartender shook my hand and introduced himself and was overall helpful jovial and accommodating. I also noticed it was not just one bartender that practiced this type of good attentive service it was the other bartender as well.

MENU: I took a gander at the menu and while the menu seemed to have some very good items on it -evidenced by seeing some things come out of the kitchen to other patrons, I opted not to order anything just due to the fact that the prices were so inflated for even simple items. 

ATMOSPHERE: It seems like a warm and inviting atmosphere 

For those looking for a solid experience this is it"}
{"text":"I love getting breakfast here. Before 10 a.m. its half off price! Can't beat that! Tina is very sweet too! Great service. So happy this place is right down the street from my house"}
{"text":"Asian PT's! Well only because it's located on Spring Mountain and in the heart of Chinatown because there weren't really any Asians inside lol. They have happy hour after midnight and drinks were dirt cheap although we just stuck with beers. A large mug of beer during happy hour though is only like $3.75 and they also have 50% off pizzas which are pretty large. I had the popcorn chicken pizza and didn't realize it was a buffalo popcorn chicken until it arrived on our table and damn was it spicy! We ended up not being able to finish it because it spice level was killing us. There are a few pool tables and some table seating near a wall of TVs in case you don't feel like chillin at the bar. It was kind of smoky inside but I enjoyed it nonetheless and would come back especially for the after midnight happy hour!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Pt's in the valley hands down.

Daaaaaaaaaamn GINA! She is the best bartender. Very attentive, easy on the eyes (I can't believe how good she looks for her age!) and she keeps the drinks going. Knowing exactly what we want even before we order.

Must have ID to enter, which i really like. This is the largest PT's I've been to. This Pt's is always happening. It's always going down on a tuesday or any day of the week matter of fact. You know your a regular when Gina knows you and your group by name. If coming on a friday or saturday get here early because otherwise seating is limited. 

Lots of pool tables. 6 i think? darts. lots of tv's with lounge couches, tables and bar seating. Want to pick your music? Sure, they've got a jukebox.

Love happy hour. 5-7pm or 12-2am. Get my rum and cokes for only 2.75. Nacho's are huge and the perfect item to eat when drinking. Please share with a friend. Pizza is good but sometimes a little too greasy. Love the gilroy! (garlic, mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage and tomatoes) Warning, it has so much garlic that i brushed my teeth twice and the boyfriend said i STILL smelled of garlic. It def impressed those taste buds of mine. Then again i was 5 rum and cokes in. Service is slow sometimes during happy hour but that's because there are only 3 bartenders and a bazillion customers. So I'm lucky we know Gina cause we flag her down and she gets our drinks stat."}
{"text":"I have to retract my earlier check in at this location, I was NO good times at this place. We met up a group of friends, all fairly new to this side of town and decided to meet up here and shoot some pool. Me and the misses show up a little early and have a few drinks while we're waiting for the rest of the group and pool tables to open up. Just around the time everyone showed up the tables were free to play, we politely ask the previous players if they were done and they were. So now we need this so called bartender to unlock a game so we can play, we ask politely if we could use the tables and this motherfucker doesn't even have the nerve to turn his back around and answers the tables are broken when we just watched these other people JUST GET OFF like WTF kind of service is that! So we closed our tab because obviously this bitch ass bartender didn't want our service, and will never step foot in that location again if that's the way they treat paying customers. Business must be good!!!"}
{"text":"12/31/15 @12:55 AM

I was in a great mood to have at least a drink for the upcoming new year. Me and my friend decided to come here since it was near my home. Bar looked slow and mellow and when we got greeted by this bar tender with no name, he seemed very irritated and wasn't feeling our business. He looks young or tries to be young, his vibe was crude and I felt very uncomfortable. He might be a mixed white and Asian, oh well I doubt I'll be coming here again if he's here serving an outstanding crappy service."}
{"text":"I love pts! But I hate this one. Obviously it's a bar so there is smoking going on inside... I just wish this one didn't smell so bad. I cannot stand the smell of cigarettes and it lingers on my clothes, skin and hair even after I leave. Not a fan but I deal with it. 

Other than the horrible smell, this pts doesn't make my list of favorites because it's always packed. I'm always able to find a place to sit but when I came here with my friend last night, he had to sit on a wobbly stool because we couldn't find another empty one.

This specific pts isn't my number one choice but for the convenience of where it's located, I still come here quite often."}
{"text":"The reason why I am giving this place a 1 is over exceeding it. It should be a negative 5 star. My friends and I usually come here all the time since they live across the street. And my friend walks up to the bar and asks a simple question regarding a beer to see if there was a difference and the bartender replies \"well obviously it's fucking different\" with an attitude and the server stated that we should not go to the bar since she is our servicer. So does that mean you're not allowed to go to the bar to order drinks if your sitting down? The customer service from the bartender is terrible. His name is Mikey. That's just so rude for him to be a smart ass. We will never come here again!"}
{"text":"I come here way too often. But I like this place. Good deals at happy hour for drinks. Lots of tvs for me to watch my dallas games. Last but not least the bartender is awesome. 

Best thing about going through a divorce is you can drink your sorrows away!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and prices! Great drinks! Gina is a great bartender and will make any drink you like!"}
{"text":"This location is kind of hidden behind the Smiths.

I like the local vibe. Great place to go after work or just to catch up with friends. They have two happy hours 5pm-7pm and 12am-3am where you can get 50% off drinks and appetizers. Drinks are pretty cheap without the happy hour special.

Service is a hit or miss.

Pool tables at PTs would really increase the rating."}
{"text":"the place stinks like cigarettes and music is way  loud, even for a 6 am week day breakfast!"}
{"text":"Used to love going to late night happy hour at this place. It used to run from 12a-5a and everything on the menu would be 50% off. Food and drinks. The pizza was also fantastic. Just went this past 12-17-16 and it was just not the same. First of all HH is now only from 12a-2a. And now only specific food items are $5. Nothing is half off on the food anymore. The pizza wasn't as good as before. Most likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"I like this PTs location. The service is good and the cooks take pride in the food they are whipping up. Descent selection of beers and the pool tables are for fun too. Perfect location for anyone living in Southwest summerlin area. I recommend ordering the dry rub chicken wings!"}
{"text":"My favorite dive-in bar! I guess because its literally about 5 minutes away from my place so the drive isn't bad and if I don't have a ride home after drinking a few drinks, I can just walk home! It is a very casual bar with a great happy hour list. All beers, drinks and pizza are only half-off! The staff is great, fast, and friendly! There are also many pool tables for your friends to have a fun competition! Losers have to take shots... hehehe! I also like this place because I won my first and probably only jackpot on the machines at the bar!!!! Great place to just hang out and chill!"}
{"text":"mindi Is the best server we have ever had... after 1 night she knew who we were and what we were drinking. she is very friendly and makes everyone feel welcome.. an asset to Pts for sure. come here just for the great service"}
{"text":"A bit smokey but the staff is great.  Prices are fair and the group of people that hang out here at night are usually hospitality so they tend to be fun. Food is PT's quality so don't expect much and you cant sports bet here anymore but go for the people you meet and the fun nights."}
{"text":"Best PT's for food. Kitchen team really takes pride in thier work. Bar service team was attentive and courteous not to much smoke for dining late night."}
{"text":"While I haven't been here during the day, I visit with friends when we get off work (usually around 2-3 am).  During the Happy Hour times, the place gets packed and there seems to always be at least a few seats at the bar.  The jukebox here has a ton of selections and there are pool tables that are usually half occupied at the hours when I visit.

The food here is decent and while the pizza may seem to be made on a large round cracker, it's edible and pretty tasty with a beer after a hard night's work.  The burgers here are actually above the normal \"bar average\" but they are a little pricey compared to other neighborhood bars.

If you're looking for a good spot to watch a sporting event, there are enough flat screen TVs here to satisfy the sports enthusiast in your family while having enough room to actually sit and enjoy your time there.  

The bartenders are cool and seem to be running around doing something all the time.  This is a good thing, especially if you know what its like waiting for a bartender to take your order in one of those high priced nightclubs on the strip."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Kathy was really attentive and handled everything, even when it was busy"}
{"text":"Pretty middle of the road for a pub. Exactly what you'd expect!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite PT's location! Their happy hour (although they've been making it shorter) is great! Half off beer and their pizzas. Our favorite is the Gilroy and we usually add pineapple and bacon. Phil and Marco are awesome!"}
{"text":"always like this PT'S it's been here for foreeeever, it's close to where my wife works on spring mountain. We usually go for happy hour for cheap drinks, much more reasonable then those strip prices you get gouged with. 

Always plenty of parking right out front, never had an issue with that. Ambience is pretty chill, there's pool tables and table gaming if you get bored, it's a little dark but then again I wouldn't want it brought here. 

Service is friendly and very fast, we sit up at the bar because it makes good for people watching, some interested people shuffle in and out of this bar. Felt totally safe though, no issues or problems.  

Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went in at 8pm on Tues September 1.  My boyfriend spent $60 in the machine and the bartender only wanted to comp one of his beers. There were about 10 customers at the bar and it was very slow. She acted like it was a problem for her when we needed food or refills for drinks. 

Will never return because of the poor service."}
{"text":"Best PTs in Las Vegas. .great staff Joe,Rachel and Danie are awesome bartenders . They pay attention to you and make u feel at home . GO Angeles!"}
{"text":"Food and service here is consistent! Great staff and comps are reasonable and justified. Mornings are quiet and nights are just busy enough. They need more going on in the dining area and the more games on the game kings."}
{"text":"1st time....Melinda was awesome. ....thanks low key PTs....sucked they didn't have food but they will soon....."}
{"text":"Love this PT's its dark, quite and has a definite PUB vibe.  The food is really good for bar food.  If you want to carb up this is a great place to go.  The beer was cold and our Bartender was very nice and attentive. We try and go here every time we go to Vegas for a \"local\" feel and affordable beer!"}
{"text":"Only had 2 beers in 2 hours because slow service.  Been waiting 30 for my check. I want to leave!!! Guess 7 people in this whole place is to much to help me. Nope. Not coming back. Ill go to sean patricks over this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service. For a spider In your food you get 5$ off your bill.  SMFH!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be! JAKEPOTS, EXCELLENT FOOD (highly recommend the Bikini Wrap) and the best customer service! Everyone here is like family!"}
{"text":"I like this PT's. Located on Spring Mountain and Arville, it's a centralized location that is easy for my friends and coworkers. There is plenty of room to sit and have a few drinks. There are multiple pool tables as well. The bartenders are friendly and have heavy hands. Overall, it's a clean and welcoming place to hang out. Only downside? The cigarette smoke is AWFUL!!! It's stays in your hair and clothes long after you leave. So if you plan on coming here, plan on smelling like an ash tray when you leave."}
{"text":"Nicer than other PT's. Cool place to go if you're looking for a place to just chill and hang out. Their wings are pretty good."}
{"text":"Small quaint little pub. The service is quick and the people are nice . Not the best sports bar as the TVs are small and the sound off . But nice place to kick it in north Vegas. The Beer is really cold and the food is good . Happy hour between 5-7 with pizzas half off."}
{"text":"I don't think so! After what you all did to me! Ima dropping all of you! Screwing me over like that!"}
{"text":"I finally came around to eating here. I'm sorry PT, but not satisfied. I'd probably only come here again because we have no choice because we usually only come here for good-bye parties, so if you're coming here just for drinks, you'll be fine... (for the most part, besides the fact that they take about 20 min to bring you out your beer, and another 15 mins to get your check.) 

However, their food is not that great... We ordered a pepperoni pizza, it sucks. and definitely wasn't worth 20 bucks for a pizza. Call me cheap, but I happen to find pizza places like hungry howies or lil caesars WAY better than this. We were even there at happy hour and our bill was still 20 bucks for just a pizza. Unless the pizza was originally 40 bucks, then i guess i got the happy hour discount, but i'm sure it wasn't. But after as long as it took for us to get our check, I didn't want to deal with the waitress because i didn't want to be there all night. Pizza took over a half hour to get there, and another 45 mins to get our check. It wasn't even worth 20 bucks in any way. It was flavorless, plain, yuck. We couldn't eat all of it so we just started giving them away lol.

The same thing with our buddies. He advised us to not order thru a waitress and go to the bar because it took forever to get his pizza and beer, so when we went to the bar instead, they wouldn't take out order because we weren't \"technically\" sitting at the bar. Way I look at it is... We were still in the bar area, so who gives a shit!?! so we had to order thru a waitress. No big deal... it ONLY took about 30 mins to find a waitress. geez, what does it take to get some service around this place? Fuck PTs. Thats all I have to say."}
{"text":"Location is convent since I live right down the street but the past 2 times I went here, the bartender (brunette lady) always seems to be in a bad mood. Not sociable at all. I'm not asking for a conversation but she could be a little more upbeat while taking people's orders. Doesn't look like she likes her job at all. When I asked what size pizzas were on the happy hour special she rudely threw a menu at me and walked away. Took her a good 5 min to come back around even though I already knew I just wanted a pepperoni pizza to begin with. I'll drive a little further to go to a different Bar from now on."}
{"text":"Rude bartender.  Checking people at the door after hours with the buzzer... Because per him... Wants to see who he will serve.  Then at the end of the bar chatting with his friend all night, Friday 9/16. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food and drinks come out quick and the happy hour is amazing! 5-7pm and 12-2am. Had the cheapest dinner today for 2."}
{"text":"This was my local bar for close to a year.  I recently moved out of the neighborhood and it is still the best PT's I have ever been too.  The staff is great, mainly graveyard and late swing.  Their prices a very fair and the midnight happy hour is awesome for us night owls.  Go check out the vibe at this place.  Remember, it's not in the greatest of areas, and you will get some characters in there, but it's always a good time."}
{"text":"This was a go-to bar when I lived in the area, and at first I liked it, then hated it, then loved it. I wouldn't say they have 4 star drinks and food, but the service, combined with the ambiance, combined with the food/drinks brings them to a solid 4. There's two pool tables here, a nice bonus when you're bored with chilling at the bar. This location is always clean, and they have a decent dining room if you don't feel like sitting in the bar at all. The food is pretty good, I prefer the pizza here, and they usually have featured special menu items and drink prices. Prices are a bit high, especially on the pizzas. The TVs aren't the best for watching a game, as some are quite small. Depending on your bartender, the service can be hit or miss (typical of many bars, of course). The best bartenders here were Paul and Jen, although they may or may not still work at this location. If they do, it's a good overall experience with some very good drinks!"}
{"text":"They appear to have removed all waitresses from this location. That being said, everything else is the same except the kitchen. Good lord, what a change. Have eaten here twice in the last two weeks and it's been beyond horrible. I just ordered what is basically a hot dog and fries. Had better at a ball park. A really bad ball park. Imagine taking frozen French fries and dunking them in a frier. Then go on a trip to the French Alps. Then adopt a French poodle. Raise that poodle from puppy until it starts to bite into your wallet with extensive senior canine veterinarian bills. Then build a time machine, go back in time, with the French fries still cooking in your machine, and assist Madame Curie with discovering the basis of radiation. Then hang out until today, letting all of those decades past until you can safely come back into PTs without disrupting the spacetime continuum, and have them serve you your fries. That's about how done your fries will be. I literally cracked one open and it was hallow inside. Just a shell of a tired worn out time traveling fry. Disgusting. 

No more food from here. Thank you very much. Adios. Bleh. Eric."}
{"text":"Really slow service. The bartenders straight up ignore you. I'm a regular and most likely will continue coming back here. It's down the street from my house and I love the layout and the crowd. But it's either very short staffed or the staff can't handle a busy bar. Whatever it is the service needs to change, for a prime location like this PTs I expect better. I only give it 2 Stars because it's a good location and has a lot of pool tables."}
{"text":"Service is ok, atmosphere is kind of dark. Good for gambling on the machines it's ok but not too fun for NFL games, etc. it's just not a \"fun\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and I have to admit I am pretty impressed. The bartender Corrine was really friendly and kept the beer full! And the cook I think his name is Bobby made me one of the best Philly's cheesesteaks I have ever eaten will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  Ashley is great and thank God Todd the manager is back. I love both of them. :)  service is great, food is great, and they have the coldest beer in the valley!  Best service ever. Before your beer is done you have another one in front of you!! Much better then the ft apache one!!!"}
{"text":"Price is right but the food is mediocre. I had the ceasar salad, one had the kitchen sink. It was ok but not very tasty."}
{"text":"I was sitting down gambling my money away and having a couple of drinks with a friend, and watching the bar-tender attend everyone's need. I enjoy people watching and it's always interesting seeing who walks into a bar at 1-2am & the bartender was awesome servicing everyone by himself."}
{"text":"So I come here a lot because my friends and I are usually around spring mt area but I honestly dislike this location a lot. Every time I come it is always pack and never enough seats. I guess I'm just more of a chill person if I am going to a Pts. The bartenders are not the best and it's always a hit and miss with them when it comes to service. I give them 3 stars and I do not have anything else to say about this location."}
{"text":"This is my local Pt's & I love it. The bartenders are seriously the best. Also for some reason their food is always so good. Some nights are better than others depending on the crowd. But I mind my own business, come get a drink and play a little Keno. Overall, the only thing I can complain about is the music. I wish the jukebox had better selections and that they had Champagne :)"}
{"text":"PT's is the ultimate go-to kind of place for happy hour! I love the specials they have and this particular location just happens to be close to where I work! My co workers actually introduced me to PT's and I'm glad they did! Now the food itself is that normal bar food type of thing and the drinks are decent. For the price I mean it does the job! The service is actually a little sub par but it's PT's so I can only expect so much. Something that I've noticed is the last hour of happy hour the waitress likes to take her time and purposely make it impossible to get as many drinks as you can before the cut off."}
{"text":"My bf and I were there 3 nights last week. The weekend bartender was great but Monday night... bartender was MIA most of the night, we gambled quite a bit and were charged for every drink we had. I almost feel that if we would have paid cash the bartender would have pocketed that money on free play.We did leave our phone number for her manager to call but he probably never got it. Try a different location on weekdays. The service is way better."}
{"text":"On a late night when the cravings are high and the bar isn't too low either, you may find yourself at a Pt's pub looking for the perfect bite! Orrrr, as you may be doing now, you will search on yelp before wondering into the bar as hubs and I did! 

To the juicy, shall we? At about 1 am the parking lot was slightly full and that was the first sign that we steered (pun) in the right direction! We rang the buzzer..entered...and sat ourselves! The music was nice and the patrons were yappin and smackin! We knew we wanted a burger and buffalo fingers... not wings! 

The fingers were straight up delish!!! The meat tender, not stringy. The breading was thin, not the usual that I peel off to maintain an edible balance! The sauce, though it wasn't what I expected in appearance.. that sauce was FINGER LICKIN GOOD!! The burger was good also, but nothing stood up next to the chicken fingers! 

Now for the star deducting factor.. my bill for the burger and fingers was a shocking $33 that's really pricey especially to not have ordered drinks nor dranks (alcoholic drinks ;) ) with that said I'll be sure to triple check my menu, receipt, and pockets before returning!"}
{"text":"Good for watching football, it's like an uncles old 90's style bar. The chicken is good and the bartenders are cool. I'm excited to watch football here this coming up season. See you soon PT's"}
{"text":"Ok, these will be a very short review. They have on the menu a \"bucket\" of chicken. Fingers, wings or popcorn and supposedly a half pulound worth with fries. $11.99. I order it and a small basket comes out. I ask what happened to a bucket? The waitress is very nice but responds... \"they come like this now. They are saving money\". Well I get menu changes but they are typically associated with a price change as well. Not this time. Small basket with only 3 fingers and maybe a small fry worth of fries. I'm sorry but that's not a basket. Oh wait, I forgot to mention I was charged an extra $1.50 for the 20 fries I upgraded to sweet potato. 

Ok. Food was just ok, not worth the price. My lady got a steak Cesar wrap, also ok with a small fry. Another $12.99. I've always thought PT'S was known for decent bar food at a decent price. Things change my friends."}
{"text":"Service is FUN here & since it is conveniently right next to my neighborhood which is another plus. We usually go around late happy hour time since it is a place for me to relive my stress after work.

The bartenders are friendly & ALWAYS seem to try to make a smile or laugh come out of you. =] 

GILROY PIZZA is one of my favorites with extra mushrooms which comes w/white sauce, italian sausage, tomato, pepperoni, & mushrooms"}
{"text":"Pts is a sports bar and is as you would expect for a sports bar. What I like about it is their happy hour and their house draft beers. It's a nice place to go with friends for beers after work."}
{"text":"Love this location because it reminds me of the old pts before the golds. Serena is a great bartender and I'll definitely be back to see her!!!"}
{"text":"Why does this place charge for pool tables, if I'm eating and drinking I literally cannot stand being charged for playing your pool tables. I feel like you can waive that if I'm spending 40+dollars in food and drink, like charging for the pool table at that point is just nickel and diming. I'll go to the lodge, there are literally 20 bars within a mile of here. Never coming back."}
{"text":"What a great place to go unwind from a long day staring at a screen. The staff is always really friendly. Waitress remembers me and my drink order each time I step in, which isn't very often to be honest.  There's something to be said about how clean the place normally is as well. Only downside is it gets busy and maybe not enough staff. But I understand and wait my turn, especially if I'm not in a rush. Decent food too."}
{"text":"Bartenders/service was ok, steak I ordered was medium rare. What I got was some chewy way over cooked possible microwaved piece of mystery meat. Never again. The place was really nice and bartenders were nice, except when I sent my food back and cancelled my order altogether. Then no one could make eye contact with me and did great at making me feel awkward, still hungry after the one crouton I ate."}
{"text":"I have to say, the petite brunette bartender was a bitch. She walked over without a smile and asked what I wanted and when I asked if it was happy hour, she scoffed and grunted, \"yes\". What IS IT with rude bartenders and servers around here?? The drink was relatively strong, which is why I gave it 2 stars but it made for an uncomfortable experience. Such a shame since it's only a few blocks away...I would have been a regular too..


MANAGEMENT: It would behoove of you to do reviews of your employees every once in awhile. There are SO many people looking for jobs these days. I KNOW you can get better people in there. I am such a loyal customer, tip well, and love a good drink but it pushes me away when bartenders make me feel cheap. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Oh goodness, I don't like writing reviews like this but I think someone needs to balance the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place.  

Ok, so we don't go to gaming restaurants that often, maybe 2 times a month, but we have been to a couple so we have an idea of what they look like, how they run and what to expect. 

Let's talk about the food first.  It was trying to be a \"nicer\" restaurant than most bars, I could tell with my $12 bbq chicken salad.  It was literally half a small plate of mixed greens with some limp gross red onions, a chicken breast on top and then half a plate of tortilla chips.  Why would you put half a plate of tortilla chips on a salad plate?  Plus, there is nothing for the chips to do, no dip of any sort, so I asked for a side of guac and was charged for it.  Theme of the night.

The boy ordered a chicken sandwich, and oddly enough they put two whole chicken breasts on the one sandwich.  Not cut up either, just two giant slabs of overcooked, underseasoned dry chicken.  He took one home and I used it for dinner tonight, so I guess it's not a total loss, but it definitely was a bit dried and boring.  

So the food was way below mediocre, and kind of odd at the same time.  The \"cook\" was out in the bar flirting with the bar tender, there were only about 3 people in the giant restaurant at about 7:30 on a Sunday night, should have been a clue.  

Now to the part I feel a bit odd talking about, but our waitress, at the end of the night, told us it was \"company policy\" to only give away one free drink for \"every $20 played.\"   I put in $10 and the boy put in $20.  Because I actually won money, I never put in more, so I had to pay for all my drinks.  The boy lost some money, but only got one beer free.  This seems kind of ridiculous, the only reason I go to these places is because I get entertainment and a free drink, clearly the food isn't a draw.  If I knew I was going to be paying for all my drinks I would go to somewhere I knew had good food and charged less.   Quite frankly if this is how every PT place operates, I won't go to another one.  I understand having to operate a business and make money, but when 90 percent of gaming places let you drink for free, why would i go to some place that charges me for everything.  I also felt it a bit odd that the server didn't say anything until right when we got our check and then she seemed super apologetic about it.  

Needless to say we won't go to this or any other PT place again.  The Lodge has better food and gives away free drinks no matter if you win or lose.  If you don't care about food, service or value, then by all means, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very pleased. I needed to stop somewhere while my car was getting detailed that had Wi-Fi and A/C lol. I stopped here Danielle was very helpful and made sure I was good. Although they were out of pancake mix, I had a hash brown, eggs, toast and sausage platter. The sausage patty's were really good; I rarely eat pork but this was satisfying. I will like to come by in the evening and check out the wings to see if this is as good as the one in Centennial. I love this place is 24hrs"}
{"text":"this is my regular hang out. i have had my ups and downs here. it changes as the staff changes.  my hubby and i were here a lot for awhile, then had multiple bad experiences and stopped coming. when we finally returned all the staff had been replaced and the service was much better.  we usually get good service now because we know people that work there. but i have to admit, sadly, that we have pretty shitty service from the ones we dont know.  we still come here because it is convenient, we like the people we do know, and this is where our friends come.  but i am disappointed with the service from the new staff.  they take too long to greet you and its hard to get refills.  the waitresses do not come around often enough and it can take awhile sometimes to get your food and drinks.  i like it much better when the people we know are serving us, needless to say.

however, i have liked every food item i have ever ordered.  the food is delicious! especially if you have had a few drinks ;) the best time is to go during happy hour when you can get the pizzas half off with your PTs card. but i still like their tots better."}
{"text":"Went to this location after work tonight.. walked in and there was a great atmosphere. Not many people, but it was late.. sat down with my friends to have a late night meal. While finishing our meal my friend noticed something crawling next to her on the booth. I kid you not, it was a cockroach.. we caught a picture to show the manager. We immediately got up and asked for the check and informed he waiter about the cockroach. We were told a manager would come speak to us. Eventually somebody, not sure if it was a manager or not, came and gave us our check and told us he had taken our drinks off the check. But never addressed the cockroach problem.... never apologized. I asked him if this was the first time anybody has complained or if this was a first time thing. Said this hasn't happened before, but i didn't believe him considering he took our drinks off the bill almost routinely. I don't recommend this location AT ALL"}
{"text":"I can never go wrong at a PT's pub. Good food and cool service. Love coming here. Yes at all odd hours. Well it is Vegas.. The city that does not sleep.. OK one of the cities.... Love the drinks and late late happy hours.. And it's near the house now that's a plus.."}
{"text":"Uhm Aaron rocks!! Quick and attentive even though it is ridiculously packed in here right now. 3's only because he isn't a frequent bartender .. :("}
{"text":"At first I hated this location but Joe and Kevin are the only reason why I'm changing my previous review. Those bartenders are awesome and recognize me and my BF when we come in and joke with us. 
We love coming in here on our nights off and seeing them. 
Thank you Joe and Kevin for awesome service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I came here to kill time as we were waiting to eat at a sushi place across the street. Since I didn't actually order anything here, I can't really comment on the place, though my companions really seemed to enjoy their happy hour drinks at amazing prices. The bartenders/servers seemed nice and the atmosphere was your typical sports bar/pub with some billiard tables."}
{"text":"The service was above expectations and the food was adequate. The bartender was attentive to all the guests and actually impressed us. Go CHACHA!!!"}
{"text":"A friend talked me into having lunch there again so I did. New lunchtime bartenders that actually care. Service 100 times better."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and had the fish and chips because I figured it would be quick and easy and I had a small break between clients.  It's your typical pt's pub with very few people in there.  The usual bar atmosphere.  The fish and chips were your standard tasking bar food.  The only thing I could say bad was the bartender was more concerned with texting on here phone and cleaning windows before she got off. I had to literally walk to the other side of the bar and interrupt her texting on the phone to place our order in.  Would I go back....probably not unless I wanted a quick beer during happy hour."}
{"text":"Up late and I knew I needed some hot food. It was a long night of taking care of business (actual work, not out drinking) and a burger and fries just sounded right. Temp? Medium... Wait no, medium-rare. Felt a little worried about the decision this being 4:30 in the morning and all and it's just a chain bar. But that was the best burger I've had in I can't remember. It's a subtle thing making a medium-rare burger, and too many think it's easy, just to do it wrongity wrong wrong. I had to thank the Cook, Devon, for doing a job well done (or medium-rare). [the burger was warm all the way through, juicy as they come]"}
{"text":"Went there to watch hockey and have a few drinks and snacks, sat there at a table near the bar and got zero service. There was 1 waitress working for the cup playoffs and instead of taking orders she was doing stock. We left after 15-20 minutes without her even even coming over. I got menus from the bartender within 2 minutes of getting there. Would not return."}
{"text":"Cool bar. Has lots of space. Yhey have decent food too, but ghey did get our order confused.  We were looking for snacks, but yhe food came out and became a meal for some of my fellow attendees. We didnt mind, but we did have a dinner party and most likely had too much food that evening. Probably better to go during there happy hour or later at. Ight when the place is livelier.  We came around 4pm and was not super busy. Unless you hate crowds then go at this time. They have plenty of parking g and the staff is pretty cool. Didn't really get to chat with them. For those from reno it has a similar setting to flowing tide, but is bigger."}
{"text":"Gambled over $100 between the two of us  and STILL got a tab for our cheap beers. Apparently it's \"company policy\". That policy just lost them my business-and the business of others. 

Machines didn't hit at all, either. 

2 stars for being a close hole-in-the-wall with decent bartenders."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has good ratings food takes forever and Steven the late night bartender will leave you thisty waited for over 45 min for pizza , ignored after that . only 20 people inside and maybe one other person ordered food . would not recommend. luky there are other locations near by."}
{"text":"Nasty acting bartenders, I may not have ordered alcohol but everyone else in my party did. C'est la vie.   Take money and appetite somewhere where people don't have an issue doing their job. 

I apologize, half a star wasn't an option."}
{"text":"I love going here for their happy hour. Its real laid back and they have a pool table. I really love the bartender Manny. Hello Manny if you read this lol."}
{"text":"Free pool? Happy hour till 7? No hipsters, studded white belts, faux/mohawks? Sign me tf up!"}
{"text":"First time at a PT's despite a bunch being scattered across the valley. Very clean inside with nice, modern decor. We sat at the bar and were helped immediately by a very kind, blond woman. To our surprise, we came in during Happy Hour so our pizza was half-price! Or only about $11-$12. The pizza was delicious, btw. It was called \"the Gilroy\" and came Chicago-style with a zesty ranch sauce instead of the usual red pizza marinara."}
{"text":"The fat white bartender working graveyard is extremely rude and has horrible service!"}
{"text":"This Is one of the nicest PT''s I've seen yet, a bit bigger than the other ones. The staff are always friendly and the food Is delish!!! you can sometimes find \"Eye Candy\" on the weekends ;-)"}
{"text":"Best PTs. Can't believe it's taken me four year to find this pls e. Also breakfast is half off from 6-10am everyday. Tiana is amazing she works midnight to 8am. Pure class at this location. Food amazing and great drinks at a normal price. As we know most of Vegas over charges. They do not. I'm now a regular. Thanks to tiana."}
{"text":"Bartender is always friendly and super nice. They have an awesome philly steak sandwich. Pool table in the back. Nice bar in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday and was told they have a new happy hour from 5-7 on food and 50% off drinks. I went with the burger ($7) and a large stella ($4) and both were excellent. The main reason for even writing this review is we were both blown away at how good the burger was for only 7 bucks. It was nothing crazy just a basic burger but done perfectly which is pretty hard to find these days here in vegas.. Excellent value and great new happy hour, i shall be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place during a Gorman Football game, which was going on down the street.  This place was packed to the hilt!  There was literally no room to walk around, let alone find a place to sit.  Luckily, I scored a seat in the rear corner of the bar.

I ordered a drink and wanted to try their Double Stacked Sliders.  Wish I could remember what was in the Sliders, but I can't.....let's just say it was a long night.  I can tell you that out of the 3 Sliders, I really liked one of them and didn't care for the other two.  The Fries were OK, not great.

Despite the large crowd, the bartenders were on top of their game and the service was really good.  The food was hot and fresh and my glass was never empty....for this, they get 4 Stars.  If it was purely on the food, it would get 3 Stars.

Will I return?  Sure."}
{"text":"My favorite PT's in Vegas.  Close to the strip get a jumpstart on getting my drank on and head to the strip.  As long as the bartender and waitress knows you they check on you frequently.  Gotta remember they not in best part of town so they get the worst of the worst customers too."}
{"text":"Always good service and friendly faces at this local PT's. It's right down the road from my place. Tino is our go to guy for great service and good conversations. The Gilroy pizza is the bomb and one of the tastier you can have anywhere! The burger is good quality and even the chicken wraps are worth a try. Very laid back ambience and just a place you can throws some back and enjoy! They have video poker/keno and if you play they will come you some drinks which is cool. Always look forward to going there and cannot wait to go back !"}
{"text":"215 & south on Decatur

The wings are great.  Salads are ok (this isn't a salad place).  They just released a new fried chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, on jalopeno infused bread.  It is the greatest sandwich I have had in the entire Las Vegas and surrounding area.  So good, highly recommend it.  Stacked high and it fills you up big time.  Service is awesome, the waitresses are super nice and cool.  Clean, fun and really great food!  Whoever the chef/s is/are, really deserves a thank you for making consistently awesome food whenever I stop by.

The only thing I would change are the prices.  It's a little pricey, averaging about $10+ a plate.  Pizza's are $16.  Apps are pricey too.  This is a bar/restaurant/lounge folks.  But I guess it is worth it due to the fact that the food is fabulous.  Certainly not stopping me from visiting."}
{"text":"Hi everyone, Ta'Lissa is the best service here..she is very attentive..everytime I come here she is prompt and on it..I rather sit aside to get the quick service. And this PTs is always bumpin! Show up people! Ta'Lissa good job gurl!"}
{"text":"I've been here too many times. When I worked down the street coming here was a breeze.
This is what this place has gotten me... a friend for life.
 A job. A lost a friend :( and I once sat here for over 7 hours or so drinking and talking about music until the sun came up. And that my friends is a strange experience walking out and the morning sun kisses your face.
I use this place to meet old friends, get new friends. The food is pretty good and I've won good here and rather....not talk about it moments.
My co worker (the one who got me a job) comes here so much that everyone has a nick name for him and whenever I meet up with him he's like a celebrity. 
I also Love that this one is big for a few pool tables.. And a separate seating area for certain meet up groups (So I've seen).
Bottom line. When the advertisements say this is my PT's.. yeah.. it's this one for me."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, before I started using yelp even. The bartenders are always polite and will find some way to get you talking or laughing. Its a great place to go relax after work and just sit and drink with some buddies."}
{"text":"First time at PTs and I had a good experience. The waitress Aimee was very attentive and had a great personality. Since my sister knew the cook, Charlie, he came out personally and made sure our food was right. We just missed happy hour, so that was the only disappointment. The crowd was diverse and it was not packed where it was uncomfortable.

The restaurant was clean and newly remodeled. I ordered 2 cocktails that both tasted delicious and flavorful!

Thank you PTs for the great food and experience with your staff.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice layout and the service is always great!  Chef Carlos is great too, he makes good food and he is super friendly, he's a little soft spoken but it's always a pleasure to see him because he always says the kindest things in a very polite manner."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad !!!!! The girl bartender was so unprofessional and so slow   Just giving attention to the drunk boys that where totally past out ! That's a big no no to alcohol awareness!! That's why so many kill people in Vegas!! Besides that our food took over 30 min to arrive   We just ordered a 2 sandwich. They came dry cold and nothing close to what the menu said.  I sent back mine with raw onions witch supposed to be with grilled onions and canceled my order  not hungry anymore after waiting for so long.  The bartender said well .... You had order after a big order so you had to wait \"\"\" seriously??? They only deliver 2 pizzas before me !! I was watching!! She gave me the check with beers included and my friends meal charged after we were gambling all the time !! No Comp for gamblers?? Never seen that in a bar ?? I gambled $60 , With max bet !! Please don't go here if you care about service and quality of food !! I'm reporting this !! 
That was on October 29th 10 pm"}
{"text":"Your extra board sucks! However, she was pretty and respectful.    My food order was messed up in every way you could imagine. Krystal.  Not good at her job just good looking.  Having my wife in the industry does not allow me to not tip.  She got 20% plus anyways.  They would be awesome just train them better!! And I hope management Reeves this. Nothing against this individual I just believe that PT's has not trained their extra board accordingly.   I know of several individuals that have left PT's to go work in other places because of how their staff is treated. Whoever's in charge suck it up and take care of your people, you are not taking care of your people therefore, nobody will want to work for you.   I guarantee Krystel would walk at the first opportunity to get out of there.  Look what happened at Mill side??????"}
{"text":"Thursday nights: Karaoke :) Awesome-ness
Every night from 4-7 and after midnight pizza, beer and shots are 1/2 off.
Football games: $2 Beer.
Their Gilroy Pizza is PERFECTION."}
{"text":"I like PT's but not this one .. Bartender didn't take care or give you any clue about the gaming discount for drink and they're charged  me all the drinks and food full price event I gambled. I should have free drinks Cus only 1 drink .. I pay for the hold bill food and drink with gambled with them .. When I asked he said nothing we can do with it lol thank you mr. Bartender .."}
{"text":"This location makes the best \"Big O Burgers!\"  I usually go late night, so props to that cook, but the day time one is great too!  The burger tastes seasoned and salty, some might not like that, I certainly do.  The onions are carmalized perfectly!  They always build my burger with care :)  I always ask for ranch and extra chipotle mayo on the side for putting on my burger and dipping my tator tots in.  Right by my house and perfect for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"Bathrooms are disgusting and id say just one bartender is rude. She has braces and never smiles or says anything about the specials. She mostly works nights!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the PT's that's scariest in town.

Given it's location by the 95 and Trop., it's kind of scary to go to after hours.

Nothing beats PT's happy hour after 12:00 a.m. 

The bartender was nice but nit very fast.

And they have shuffle board here!

The bathroom was decent for a bar."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great specials!! 
They have 1/2 off on pizza, beer and shots every night from 4-7 and after midnight. $2 Beer on football nights."}
{"text":"Finally some good service!!  You have redeemed yourself.

Moved out here close to 2 years ago and was looking for that pub or bar close to my home, somewhere that I can call home, and somewhere that would treat me well.  This PT's is located fairly close to me and was actually one of the first PT's I've been to.  My first couple of experiences at this location wasn't so good. I had experienced everything from bad food to poor service.  Nothing is worst than sitting at a bar and never being acknowledge.  At least twice, me and friends just walked out. We almost felt like they didn't care about new customers.  Then I started hitting up other PT's around Las Vegas to realize the issue was just this location. I had great service and a good food experience at other PT's.  I'm even at a PT's located in the southwest at least once a month.  Why can't I get that type of service here?  I almost swore that I would never come back to this location. 

Fast forward almost 2 years later and I decided to give this place a try again. Honestly, I was hungry one night, was in the mood for their \"Mardi Gras Chicken\" and didn't want to do dishes at home.  I told myself that if I got the bad service like I did the last couple of times, I'd never come back.   Well, PT's didn't disappoint this time.  Not only was the service 10 times better, but the food here was just as good as the other PT's.  I'm not stating that PT's has food to die for.  The food at PT's consist of your typical bar grill type food, which means usually fried food.  This is food you are to expect at a pub/bar anyway.  Their Mardi Gras Chicken, Wings, and Nachos are a must try though.   

6 times a charm I guess!  I just hope my last visit wasn't an anomaly.  We'll find out soon."}
{"text":"George was really friendly and kept asking if we were doing good. His margaritas are the best! Highly recommend this pts."}
{"text":"Nice place but with only one bartender you have to be patient to get a beer 
The food is good and the bartender was very professional 
I love PTs but this one is not the best by far in my opinion"}
{"text":"Service and Staff are friendly and fast. Quality is consistent, clean building and good atmosphere. I would like to give them 4 stars but their corporation is way too proud of their mediocre food and portion sizes. Food prices are way too expensive for what they serve you. If you want to run a good business then have your prices match your quality and portion size."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. It looked dirty and my drinks were super weak. The bartender struck me as one who just got out of bartending school or one who thought I didn't know what my drink should taste like. When I told him it was too sweet and to make it stronger, he told me he had to follow measuring guide lines. He then upsold me to a double shot and it was still too weak and tasted too sweet. I swear these drinks were all mix. I went to a different pts the night before and didn't have the same issue at all. I've told bartenders before that my drink was weak and they fixed that on the next round. This guy just seemed lazy some how. It's like he didn't want a good tip and was cool to settle with weak one he got in return for his weak drinks. The bar needed to be wiped down too. It was gross. Oh, and he didn't give me a napkin with my drink. I know that sounds petty, but it makes a difference to me."}
{"text":"I love the Gilroy pizza! Seriously!!! This is the best pizza ever!! Thin crust and yummy goodness! I m in heaven!!"}
{"text":"PT's deserves 3 stars for the potential I believe I can explore the next time I come here. This time around it wasn't impressive at all, but I'm willing to give it another go. I came here to have some beers with family that were visiting from out of town and only wished my hub had picked a better spot for the occasion.

We started with ordering from only 2 beers they had that evening blue moon and shock top and then ordered a spinach cheese dip that us girls split. The boys had between them a burger with fries and cheese ham omelet. 

I already knew from looking at the overpriced menu the food was going to sucketh greatly and I was right. The burger my hub ate was living in the freezer AKA frozen patty meat. Gross! My uncle had an omelet that had an avalanche of cheese on it, which he scraped off. At that point I think anyone consuming that amount of cheese would have diarrhea... Am I going TMI on you? Yes, because I want to spare my fellow foodies this food tragedy.

I will say that I personally enjoyed the safest choice which was the spinach dip and beer, but that's about it food wise. While chatting with the peeps I did hear some awesome tunes playing in the background that I was definitely diggin' and think I would have enjoyed them more if I was playing pool.

So in a nutshell I will be coming back to PT's to play some pool and throw back some beers with my pals but will seriously be declining on the food."}
{"text":"I love this location. Derek is a great bartender. He's super hot, very funny and friendly. Salads are really good too. They were playing Justin Bieber as soon as I walked in so it was an overall great experience. Ummmmm....that's really all I have to say. I'll definitely be making this place a regular spot to get drunk."}
{"text":"Sorry PT's......I've been back multiple times since my first review and let me just say that it has been lacking in service since then. I came here for lunch today and it wasn't very busy at all. It took them about 25 minutes to get us our nachos. I asked for our check once we got our nachos which took about another 10 minutes. I like the food, but the service needs a lil help."}
{"text":"Stephanie is a great bartender! Best night I've had at this location! Hoping to come back to such great service and hospitality."}
{"text":"We heart this PT's Location! We love the staff here, they are the Bomb Diggity! Every month they have different specials so it's not the same ol menu. The PT's happy hour is awesome, 50% off all drinks and pizzas.

It's one of the newer PT's that I've been to. It's not a busy street, and the only time I've seen it super busy, to where you have no place to sit, is after the Bishop Gorman games. The only difference about this location, besides our awesome server ;), is if you're used to going to PT's and their other locations, they do not have an enclosed area for dining only, like at the other PT's. Doesn't bother us, might bother you.

Thank You and Good Night :)"}
{"text":"I didn't know PT's could differ much from one to another. After all, they're a chain that sells alcohol and food?  

We came here on a Friday night a bit late at 12:30am. I loved the layout of this place. The place wasn't lonesome like other PT's. There were a lot of people hanging out and they seemed to be a bit more social as well. Pool tables are a nice touch. 

Food:
Pizza- 1 star. The crust is like cardboard with no flavor. I'd skip this entirely. 
Chicken strips- 4 stars. \"Spicy\" gets you the buffalo sauce. Yummy flavor and great crunch. Definitely the winner. 
Nachos- 3 stars. 

Service was not bad. It does get busy however due to the HH from 12-2am. 
Of all the PT's, this one might be worth coming to."}
{"text":"Casual locals bar with food, video poker, a good selection of beers, and all of your favorite sports events.   Open 24/7/365"}
{"text":"This is the only PT's I've been too...or better...the only one I remember. I think I went to another location a few years back. 
Walking in the bar was dark. Not normal bar dark, but almost pitch black dark. It smelled of smoke (I was expecting this) but the ventilation was actually decent. 

I stopped by for a happy hour for a friends birthday. They were running a nice beer special, but I was only here for one. I also had the pretzel bites. They were nothing special, but good bar food. 

I'd like to come back to this PT's or another to see what it is like on a weekend night. This location also had a couple pool tables, and a couple nice big TVs as well."}
{"text":"PTS also has great food!! Not just drinks! I love their chicken wings! I come here often when I dont want to go to a club and would rather enjoy a chill environment with music and a couple drinks. Their pool tabs are a blast when I come with friends and we challenge each to some friendly competition. Great local atmosphere.  You cant go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"We only come here for 2 reasons 
1. Wings  
2. Its close to the house.  

I only have two requirements for me to enjoy eating a whole bucket of wings with no shame. They need to be EXTRA CRISPY and don't bring me disgusting ranch dressing. What is wrong with people, BLUE CHEESE is the only thing that pairs well with wings. Its like a good Cab with a steak, there is no other way to eat wings!

PT's shockingly delivers on all of my wings needs. I only have one problem and thats with the bartenders who take the order. Sometimes we get lucky and we get a bartender who will see the desperation in our eyes and the seriousness in our voices and and will make sure our order is extra crispy with blue cheese. But unfortunately this is NOT the norm, bartenders here seem to hate when you have any request that requires any extra work on their part. We have sent our wings back on a number of occasions.

Although I lament over my dissatisfaction with the service I STILL come here for my wing fix."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and come to this PT's frequently. A couple of days ago I was there with a good friend of mine and had very rude service. We don't gamble but do drink wine and at times order food. Our glasses were empty, and we asked the bartender for another glass while she was at the register. She said in a rather rushed tone, \"Can you give me a minute?\" I said sure and then a little bit later she very rudely put the glasses down and shoved them towards us and didn't say a word. She gave us a rather bad look as well. Trust me I don't review on Yelp, but my friend who works in an industry where she is out with clients drinking and dining was appalled. She told me she would be calling the manager. Usually this bartender is friendlier than that night, but I would have been embarrassed had I taken friends or clients there for drinks."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. 

I came in with a group of 8 for lunch. When we all walked in NO ONE was in there, so we assumed the service would be fast since we were kind of on a time crunch.

I came in for a lunch break and it took them ONE HOUR to get our food.. The alcohol took like 10 mins to come out. Yeah, 1 hour. That's way too long for a group, considering we were the only people there. Extremely disappointing. 

I ordered a quesadilla that was supposed to come with avocado, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and some other stuff. IT ONLY CAME WITH CHEESE! Seriously?! I could've gone to the grocery bought some a 100 pack for tortillas for a few bucks, some cheese, and put it in the microwave. I paid $10 for that crap. No thank you.

Come here if you want to wait long, get crappy food, and crappy service. Other than that, I absolutely say stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Buckets 'O Amazing...that's all I have to say.  They have buckets o burgers, buckets o fries, buckets o tots....it's basically buckets o fun! haha!  and buckets o tasty...and finally buckets o cheap!  I don't live in Vegas, but you may as well call me a local.  This burger/pub food chain is perfect for that greasy burger fix.  They are all over vegas, so it is so easy to visit them.  Also, since it is a local joint, forget about long lines and a pricey menu.  The last time I was there, our party of 4 was out within 1 hour, completely stuffed and satisfied for about $10/person.  Oh, PT's thank you for consistently being awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered a half pepperoni, half sausage pizza

It was okay. You can tell the sauce was just pure tomato sauce with little to no spices.

As far as service, not bad.. Friendly staff & not too much time spent waiting"}
{"text":"I've been to many PT's and of course this is one of the newer and cozier places to hang out.

Whenever my Air Force buddies are here form out of town, this is the place we meet up at. Everyone loves it because the ambiance is perfectly dim (to set the mood), there's always tables available (so far at least), never loud to the point of voice raising (I scream enough at drunks at work), and they provide two pool tables to throw down at. Happy Hour is very convenient to me (5pm-7pm) since i'm usually off the base around 4. Plus i have never seemed to have a problem ordering drinks here by far.

If you're around the area, let me know! :D"}
{"text":"Walk in and the allure of Vegas instantly melts.

This is the anti-Vegas. Californians, you've been warned.

I LIVE TO TELL MY ORDEAL:
Came here to celebrate a birthday and the place is clearly geared toward locals and is a divey watering hole. Everyone in the group except myself was a local so I was like, \"Oh HELL no, why here?\" I was in Vegas for business for 2 nights and this is one of the last places I'd go to while in the City of Sin. We had a pretty swell time and the place was dead when we walked in around 9 pm. 

I was unaware that PT's is a chain of bars. It has your typical bar amenities: lounging areas, pool tables, and ESPN blaring throughout the place. Nothing over-the-top and the only remnant of Vegas is the gambling screens surrounding the bar area.

Their beers and other poisons are great as well as their appetizers; I had a bowl of cheese fries, which were very crispy and very cheesy, just the way I like 'em :-) They even have great steaks and sliders to cheer you up 'cause you'd rather be on the strip (I was suffocating and we didn't leave until 4 am, Jesus Christ).

Our server was an ANGEL! Wish I remembered her name. Prompt and friendly service, complete with a genuine smile (it was in her eyes too).

I'm sure locals sick of the strip would dig this place (my group did).
Food, beer, and service was great!! Atmosphere was boring as fuck, unless you really love pool, which was the only thing keeping patrons entertained.

Californians, remember we only come here for the strip (and swag up their freeways)."}
{"text":"Poor service. I was excited to go and take my husband to this location for the first time. We understand it's a Sunday and playoffs were beginning to start at 12pm. We walked through the door at 11am and placed a order To go and for one bucket of chicken nuggets and fries. The waitress got the order wrong and only ordered a basket which was not what we wanted so we placed a second order for the same thing and waited or a whole hour. Nothing was done I finally asked the bartender to just cxl my order and refund me my money. She said she doesn't have the cards for that and her manager would be there in the next 20-30 min I finally get my order and the bartender says I don't know if you still want this but here is your order. We took our cold orders and left. This is the worst PT's I've ever been to. I would recommend you spend your time and money elsewhere. The bartender stated to us there was only 1 COOK on duty and 1 BARTENDER. That's why our wait was so long. FYI-not my problem or the other 30 patrons waiting for orders."}
{"text":"Came here to use our bogo entree coupon which you can get from time to time for signing up for their mobile program. (Free)  Had the spinach dip app. and it was really good....comes with a mix of chips and toasted bread, the dip itself has a cheesy top layer and spinach cheese gooey mix beneath. ($9.99)  Had the club wrap ($9.99) which is a healthy portion of ham turkey and bacon.  It comes with fries which are pretty tasty too.  Todd the bartender does a great job making sure everything is taken care of in terms of drinks."}
{"text":"I like it. I do. Just not a whole lot.

Hit up this PT's just a few nights ago for an outing with coworkers. We all arrived shortly after 9 PM on a Tuesday night. There were a few patrons at the bar, but other than that the place was empty. It does indeed have a smokey smell, but it looks really clean and new. There are definitely nice place to sit around tables on couches. The bar area is large a well-lit. There are pool tables and a beer pong table.

My friends and I mostly came for the beer/drinks. We sat at a table near the billiards section as many in my group were playing pool and beer pong. 

I was starving, so I actually had to eat. I selected the Jalapeno Sliders, that come with three mini burgers and some french fries. They were quite tasty, not greasy, not overly done. The jalapenos gave them a nice kick. They were good - but everything on their menu seems pretty pricey to me for it being bar food. My sliders were 9 bucks! I don't mean to be a cheap-skate but usually when I see a bar menu there's *at least* a few items around $5-$7. But not on PT's menu.

Overall I'd come back if I were hanging out with coworkers and this was their choice. But I doubt I'd be back just because I felt like it."}
{"text":"I've given this Pts sooooooooo many chances bc they're  right up the street but the service is consistently bad  and never fails to disappoint. Lets not talk about every empty space around the bar was cluttered w dirty plates! This place is Smokey under staffed and just rude!!  After waiting 15 mins w/o being acknowledged we left! come on Pts get it together!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. Tino is by far the best bartender I've had in Vegas! When I come in after a bad day and just need a beer, I leave happy and relaxed. In a busy bar he remembers my name and drink, which I've yet to find here. If you want a good local bar with amazing customer service, this is the place to be! Seriously I can't say enough good things about Tino, he's the best! This is going to be my new local bar to go to"}
{"text":"This PT's is nothing special, but consistent, which I can appreciate. They have two HH's per day, one from (I think) 4 - 7, and the other from midnight to 3am, and during HH, their wells, drafts and pizzas are half price. They have an extensive draft selection, and the pizza, which is on a very thin crust, is usually pretty good. 

That said, the music is my only real complaint about PT's. I understand the music is coming from the jukebox. I understand that other customers are selecting what is being played, and that unless I play it, I likely am not going to hear \"my\" music; what I cannot get next to is the fact that, at times, the Bartender turns the music up to levels so absurd that you cannot hear your companions without yelling at one another! In a location that has such a pleasant atmosphere, otherwise, this is always a source of frustration."}
{"text":"great chill spot....
clean location located in the middle of China Town.  
I typically meet a friend here for cocktails and pool.  Lots of pool tables and spacious enough so that you aren't on top of each other.  The jukebox has a great selection of music also....which makes for more fun playing pool and tossing back a few.
Happy Hour starts at 5!  Bartenders can be a lil slow sometimes but Im singing and playing pool so I can wait a few minutes :)"}
{"text":"I love all the PT's locations throughout the valley. I like that this one is in Chinatown, so it's a cool spot to visit after some delicious sushi. 

I like their Happy Hour deals they have late at night. The place tends to get busier then, but it's still a very casual and locals' spot. It's a lot more relaxed than the pretentiousness of the strip places. 

They have great deals during their Happy Hour, so it's best to go at that time and enjoy your favorite drink with some bar food. As bar food goes, it's actually pretty good. Their pizza, wings, and sliders are all tasty, and they're even tastier when you've had a few cold beers to go with them!

The bartenders here, as is the case at other PT's, are really cool people. They're pretty good about suggesting things when you wanna try new drinks, which I think is pretty cool. Plus, they seem to know a lot of their regulars, which is extra cool. 

All in all, this is the place you want to go to when it's late at night and you want to have a drink or a casual bite. It's cool, the place is relaxed, there's a jukebox, and prices are fair. Win!"}
{"text":"This was the first pub I've ever been to. A number of friends who hang out here a lot invited me late last month for talks and drinks. I was a little ignorant about their menu (portion-wise, which drinks were best, specials etc.) and didn't know what to get. Thank God for their really nice bartender who gave a helping hand and suggested I try the strawberry shortcake drink. It was fantastic, not too strong, not too sweet, just hits the spot! Our little group also ordered some hot wings. Now, I'm not usually a fan of anything spicy but I managed to take on 3 legs and wanted more! The food here's great. They had pool tables, couches, a bar, music and television. 
I'm not really a 'bar' kinda girl but depending on who I'm going with in the future, I might decide to drop by to unwind at the end of the night."}
{"text":"A friend and I met here for lunch & drinks, everything was soooo good. I had a bowl of chili for my lunch and a Blue Hawaiian for my cocktail. The bartenders are we're really nice and mix drinks very well;)!! My friend had hot wings and a Blue Hawaiian as well, we enjoyed our lunch and cocktails very much and had a really good time."}
{"text":"I was in and out for a drink.  Not really much I can say.  A friend wanted to buy me a drink before my weekend escape."}
{"text":"I love this PT's!! Awesome perks for being a gamer!! Got to go to the VIP suite @ T-Mobile Arena to see a concert! Was SUPER amazing!! Even food & drinks included, such a fun night out! Thanks PT's!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of pts all over the city and the service I received at this one was way below what I expected. The bartender was complaining about how hungover she is and she could fall asleep standing up. We came here for happy hour and hour hungover bartender didn't offer is any specials or really even acknowledge us. I doubt I will ever return here."}
{"text":"Came back to this place for another time. The bartender alana was very friendly and had a great positive attitude. I will always come back here anytime she is working! I highly recommend this place especially when alana is working"}
{"text":"HOT MESS. 

I had been wanting to check out this PT's for a long time and finally my boyfriend and I stopped in for drinks and food before a movie...
We actually only stopped in and then left after waiting around 20+mins for someone to acknowledge us. 

Yes they were busy but they were helping people who had walked in after us, which is SO irritating to any customer. The busser and two bartenders didn't even say hello or apologize for the wait at all. We sat down near the door at first but no one noticed us so we then moved to the actual bar and still no one noticed us. 
The bartender was running around like crazy but seemed to be avoiding us, the bigger guy behind the bar was moving so slow and not really any help to her, maybe he was new?

We knew we were doomed for a bad experience so we just left. 
We might give this PT's another shot sometime but doubtful."}
{"text":"This is my bar!!  I love this PT's it's so small and has a neighborhood bar feel to it! The manager is very nice and  love their happy hour!! They have pretty good slider as well, and the pool is only $5 for the hour so I definitely recommend if you are in this side of town."}
{"text":"My favorite PT's. It's the nicest and cleanest PT's I've been to in the whole Valley so far. The place is huge! All the staff is super nice and on top of your drinks. Beers are served on tall blast chilled beer mugs; super cold and crisp. Their food is sooo yummy. I personally love their pretzel bites with cheese and honey mustard sides. The burgers are also super juicy and delish. 

PT's has a Beer & Bites point program; a reward program based on dollars spent, points earned. I think the program is a cool thing because you get special discounts. My friend had her card with her and my humongus beers were like $5! I really enjoy my beer and watching TV at the bar. The TV screens are not huge and view sucks in certain angles but they always have a variety of channels playing."}
{"text":"I liked coming to this location a lot cuz I liked the bartender George a lot. Now he isn't here anymore . They lost a good bartender and I probably won't be coming back to this location due to George no longer being here cuz of a douche bag customer, and the new bartender is a smart ass."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great beer! The service is always great and the staff is very friendly. The happy hour deals are the best! I'd highly recommend PT's."}
{"text":"Love this bar Everyone is friendly and it always has great music and they actually let you play and win some money !!!!! Love the food !"}
{"text":"Pretty much every Pt's is the same. Of course you have you main bar, a few tables and chairs, and all of them have at least two billiards tables. Stocked with a full bar they pretty much have any liquor or brand you can think of. The food is ok, but my favorite dish is their buffalo chicken tenders."}
{"text":"There are many locations thru out Lass Vegas, i wouldn't be surprised if there were more than 20 locations. Drinks are reasonably priced, better than the Strip of course. The food is just ok. I had the chicken strips tossed in buffalo sauce with a side of ranch. The fries  are just ok. But any PT's i go to always has friendly bartenders. 

Each PT's I've gone into also have pool tables, which i believe costs a dollar per game and you just slide in quarters into the pool table. Every PT's is 24 hours."}
{"text":"It's a given that I don't visit many bars, so I was pleasantly surprised to see sofas at this one. Didn't get to personally take advantage of their happy hour because the heavy smoke hanging around gave me a headache (not to mention I was already buzzing it from Round 1). Although I don't drink much, I can still tell a good deal when I see it. $12 for THREE drinks. Man. I paid $17 for ONE the next night. Oh, Vegas. My friend had recommended the Garlic Parmesan Fries, so next time I'm at a PT's I'll definitely have to give it a try. Hopefully there will also be an open pool table too."}
{"text":"Love it! Great happy hour after one visit I felt like a regular! Don't miss the happy hour! Great beers n pizza! Absolutely my fave lil spot."}
{"text":"I hate giving reviews, let alone bad reviews, but something has to be said, so here it goes...

I went in at 4 am a few mornings ago (I think it was Tues/Wed) to get something to eat. I ordered an omelet and wasn't expecting much. As I looked around, I saw that the guy cooking my meal was this older, chubby, scruffy looking guy taking out the trash. I didn't judge, but again, wasn't expecting much. I gambled a little bit to pass the time, and in about ten minutes, one of the best breakfasts I'd ever had in my life was presented to me. The omelet, hash browns, and toast were delicious. Fluffy, tasty, beautifully cooked. The older guy who I'd almost misjudged cooked like an angel. Based on this experience, I knew I'd come back. I almost wanted to go back there and kiss his feet or something. No joke.

Fast forward to this morning (Sunday, June 4, 2017, 4;30 AM)

I ordered the exact same breakfast and was brought out the worst plate of \"food\" I've ever attempted to eat in my 30 years on this planet. The first thing I knew was that the omelet was inedible. I tried, but just couldn't: burnt, sloppy, a disaster. That thing couldn't be served in prison on ANY planet. I'm not joking. So I tried the hash browns and immediately threw them up onto the plate. Question: how could anybody fuck up hash browns THAT bad? They were drenched in some kind of margarine or something. One of the worst aftertastes ever.

Anyway, the bartender was cool enough to notice my awkwardness and offer to refund the whole meal. HE was cool as hell and this experience was not his fault AT ALL.

In all, I would have given this place FIVE STARS a few days ago, and I still might. Just get the masterfully talented old man with the magic hands (who deserves to be king somewhere) to teach everyone else how to cook. Because he's a SAINT.

On that note, I just hit up McDonalds on Sunset to rid my mind of any memory of that plate of dog food I unfortunately just had in front of me. It took an egg McMuffin, HASHBROWN, and a sweet tea to make me feel less nauseous. But I still might puke. If I set foot in my bathroom, I'm pretty sure I'll be tempted. So I'll stay out.

Attention PT's: don't employ anyone who CAN'T COOK... as a COOK.

Thank you"}

{"text":"Annie disappointing bartender doesn't look like she wants to be here . My glass has been empty for 30 min I had to approach her and tell her I needed another one . Who doesn't check on their customers?"}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders and surprisingly good wings for las Vegas.  Good around the corner bar"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this PTs and I have to say it is the best one. Maybe it is because everyone knows me since I've been going there for so long, or perhaps it is the cheerful and upbeat attitude of the entire staff. Or maybe it's the awesome food. Not quite sure what it is, but I don't mind dropping $60 in a machine while I'm here. Always feel welcome and helps me unwind."}
{"text":"My bf and I have been here a few times and we love their pizza. Its half price during HH and we always get pep & jalapeno and its always good. Its thin enough so you're not stuffed and its big. enough for 3 to share. My bf always orders draft beer  - great prices and I either get draft or order a mixed drink. Not too strong not too weak. They have pool tables and lots of bar seating. Its very chilled out and the bartender is always friendly. its been the same guy the last few times we've been. I'd def. go back to this place."}

{"text":"Pizza, Pizza!  And 1/2 price drinks!????  That's right, 12am-2am it's half off pizza ($9 now) and half price drinks.  This place was jammed when I walked in, literally not a single spot at the bar.  What an incredible atmosphere and great musical selection.

I decided to try the BBQ Chicken Pizza and some beer.  The pizza is a massive 16\" and comes loaded with ingredients with the crispest crust.  Delicious!  All drinks being half off means you can party until your hearts delight.  Gina was unbelievably receptive to my demands, and spot on with the refills.  She actually remembers me from over 2 months ago and even pointed to the seat that I was sitting in.  Who does that!?

Please stop by this Pt's during happy hour for a guaranteed great time.  Every person that came to sit next to me said hello and greeting me with a smile.  I can't say enough about Gina and her infectious smile and charming personality.  It is a certainty that I'll be back, especially if she's working."}

Our bartender was an older guy) this last time we went we had a girl bartender who would barely acknowledge us, was too busy flirting with a customer on the other side of the bar and charged us wrong.   Made us want to rethink going, or at least not go until the other bartender was there.  He makes sure to check on you, see if you're happy with you're food or if you need another drink."}
{"text":"I usually love PT's and this one is great because it is close to work. My last visit was kinda different. 

Stopped in after work to grab 1/2 priced drinks and food after a long day of work. Sat at the bar and was served right away in it's normal fashion. Then once we all ordered our drinks and were looking at the menu the female bartender was like \"oh are you looking for happy hour specials? I think you might be, well we have changed our 1st happy hour from 4-7 to the new time of 3-6.\" The time now was 7:25. I was so pissed that no one told me sooner. She \"claimed\" that it started 2 weeks ago and she wasn't sure which ones. I told her they need to get on that because their radio commercials, and banners still had the old time. I then checked yelp and happy houred and neither were updated.

How do you serve people that always come to your bar and not tell them what has changed? Such bullshit. We stayed since we had already ordered drinks but she continued to make our time spent their miserable. She talked on her cell phone, ignored the people at the bar, and was unsure how to make common pt drinks. And it wasn't even busy AT ALL.  Then when one person asked to leave she put all our drinks on one receipt. And was really confused when we asked to split it. 

I will continue to go here but now only for the late happy hour and never when that Bartender is there."}
{"text":"This PT's location makes me love thus chain bar again. Was here last night with a few friends and had a great time. 

Not crowded, the bartender Scott was really funny and always there for a refill, and the whole place is clean and cozy.

Was worried that this place was closed down when I looked for it on Yelp, and that my trip across town would be a huge waste. My Henderson friends reassured me that they were open, and they were right. 

If this location wasn't so far from my house I would be here every night."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday night 8/28/16 the place wasn't busy 10 people at the bar and another 10 in the large pool table area.  I took a seat at the bar while waiting for my YELP best friend (Mimi) and the bartender served me an IPA, nothing out of the normal yet. 

Once my friend arrived thou service took a turn for the worse, the bartender who served me earlier was socializing and didn't come over until 10 minutes after Mimi sat down.  She ordered her beer of choice Stella and I had another IPA we talked and chatted roughly an hour then went to pay our tab.  \"Our\" bartender was oblivious to us working the other side of the bar and the other bartender on our side was on her phone.  I tried calling them over and waved my hands,  to get their attention.  Finally Mimi approached and asked the  bartender who was on her phone if we could get our tab and the lady responded that she wasn't the one who served us... really??...   She then brought the tab over and we paid and went on our way.  

Something is definitely missing at this location.  More than likely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"On NFL playoff weekend after a Saturday debacle going to a sports bar in a casino on the strip, and getting gouged - we decided on sunday to go to a locals place. Glad we did. 1/2 price happy hour. Decent service. Great pool tables and no $3 sodas. A great time watching sports on their big TVs at half the price."}
{"text":"Great place. Amazing food and pretty good service. Eat here for lunch all the time. The specials are usually pretty awesome. Had a pulled pork patty melt today and a pretty good Cuban Sandwich last week."}
{"text":"Ordered an appetizer.... 20 minutes later it came out cold. I sent it back. Of course, I was expecting them to give me hot food... Rather after 20 min of waiting on my hot food I got my check and an apology.. W.t.f. Thanks"}
{"text":"My favorite bar to chill at or go meetup with some friends for drinks or a quick bite to eat after work. I never have a disappointing experience at any PTS location I've been to, but this one by far is my favorite. The staff and all the bartenders are kind, there is never any drama, and the food is always good and served in a timely manner! Thank you for being the best bar and restaurant in Las Vegas! You never fail me :)"}
{"text":"One night, I was hanging out here with a couple of co-workers from a job I was working at the time. It had been someone's birthday and the Decatur & Hacienda PT's was the de facto meet up place for after-shift celebrations. But everyone else had long gone home and we were in there talking at the bar, the last ones to leave, as the sun started to rise outside. 

At some point the jukebox starting playing \"The Lumberjack\" by Jackyl and I started making fun of it because, let's be honest, any song that has a chainsaw solo is required to be mocked. 

Well, this must have been one of the bartender's favorite songs or maybe his cousin was in the band or something because he came over to us, looked at me like I just insulted his mother and said \"So what do you listen to, Yanni or some bullshit?\"

The question put me off balance. I wasn't expecting such a passionate defense of \"The Lumberjack\" from our bartender (or from anybody else on the planet for that matter) and I was dumbfounded at the egregious fallacy of logic by which he implied that, because I don't like my music to feature power tools, l must be some kind of New Age candy-ass.

Apart from that, it's a PT's. If you've been to one before you know what to expect. Probably got more amenities than most. They got plenty of room and a lot of pool tables and a dartboard and a Golden Tee I think. You can have a good time here, but if you feel the urge to goof on crappy butt-rock, then just make sure you are out of earshot of the bartender."}
{"text":"Never been a big PT's fan... but stopped in here for a drink in the afternoon. It's just like every other PT's in Vegas which is why I'm not a huge fan of PT's. However, they are reasonably priced and have plenty of TV's and gaming.
Diane was the bartender and she's great. Definitely recommend stopping in while she's there. Very friendly and great service... I'll be stopping in again when in the area."}
{"text":"I don't know why out of all the Pt's, this one is the mot popular one out of my group of friends.  It's always poppin, maybe because its in CHinaTown, the spot where everyone usually hangs out before or after partying.

Danny the bartender is pretty cool. He seems to be everyones favorite.  What I like about Pt's is their 12-4am happy hrs.  Pool table fills up quick on the weekends and they serve pretty good food.  Warning: Their hotwings are pretty hot or maybe I'm just a wuss, but I'm just sayin' though to warn other wusses like me.  And oh pretty hot girls come here too, just sayin'."}
{"text":"Had some good food & cold beers.
Food took way too long, but they made it right for us, and I can't complain.
Get the chili-cheese tots bucket, well worth it!"}
{"text":"Overall a cool locals place to hang out.

The drinks weren't that expensive...I think I averaged about $5-6 a drink, but I never got an itemized bill to total em out.

The waitress seemed a little wet behind the ears, but she was friendly and helpful.  Wish the drinks were a little heavier handed, but again, that usually comes with experience.

Food was pretty meh, but it's expected.  A bunch of fried foods that weren't very memorable, but the prices were ok, and it fits the bill for convenience sake.

They have pool tables and games to keep you entertained, and the pub is overall clean and inviting.  Check it out sometime if you haven't already :)"}
{"text":"Service isn't bad but it's not great either. 

I'm generally the DD, so I don't usually drink and order a water, maybe some food. We stopped in around 930 PM on a Wednesday and it wasn't super busy but just enough to keep the lone bartender and server steadily moving. 

JD ordered a small summer shandy and some wings with curly fries. I just had a water with lemon and decided I didn't feel like eating much. This seemed to slightly annoy the bartender. The food took about 15-20 minutes to come out with the wrong type of fries, but the bartender realized this after a moment without anyone mentioning it and curly fries were brought out a few minutes after. The wings looked good! Decent in size and nicely sauced. Fries didn't seem soggy. No complaints from JD. 

A little 4 card keno while we waited and watched whatever was playing on their TV's. We were in there for maybe an hour. It's not a bad spot to unwind. I just can't stand how it wreaks of cigarettes and that I do after coming here too. The ventilation needs an upgrade."}
{"text":"This is now my new local PT's and I cant be happier. The PT's is not much different from the rest but it's the staff that make it better. Great bartenders, servers, and cooks. Can't go wrong with the happy hours at 5-7pm and 12-2am. Keep the Jack flowing and the popcorn chicken pizza coming and I will be a happy man. I will be back very shortly!"}
{"text":"Came out to PTs Saturday night for my good friend's birthday party, and had a good time.

PTs is always good for food, $5 an hour pool, and good drinks.  

They have a killer half off happy hour special at midnight, too!

LOVED that Karate Karaoke was there!!  Had a blast singing all night. This place has better acoustics than some of the places I've been recently, and everyone sounded great.  

Bartenders were nice to me, and my husband.  I hear that one of them was not so nice to someone in my party but all of my interactions were good. 

Clean bathrooms, and very spacious.  I enjoyed myself quite a bit."}
{"text":"Ever keep going to a restaurant because the food is so good that you try to overlook the lack of customer service? If you have, then you'll understand my frustrations with this establishment  

The nicest person to me there is the cook, so at least I get along with the person who truly matters  

It'll come to a point eventually where I won't be able to overlook the rest of the staff's ability to treat a regular"}
{"text":"This is solely for the worst customer service ever. The bartender on this specific night was rude and portrayed herself as racist or just a straight up hater. My family lives nearby and are regulars at this location. They prefer Ashley and have never dealt with this until tonight. I'm not going into details but the way she answered our questions, including a girl sitting next to me, was very demeaning. It's like, people come here to have a good time and eat some bomb chicken wings...why ruin it with your bad attitude? Bring Ashley or a bartender like her during all shifts, thank you! She needs customer service 101. Zero tip given! You give what you get....bye Heather!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, I always go to Sierra gold on jones and 215 and they never let me down. They have the same exact menu. Horrible service, Scott the grave bartender won't even step out of his bar area to refill our waters. We're literally sitting next to the bar at the tables! Just bad overall!"}
{"text":"This PT's location is quite popular with my previous co-workers, and I've been here a few times to attend late-night going away parties. Located off Centennial and Losee, PT's Gold is a solid local's bar. The bar is updated and always has plenty of seating. It's never smoky in here and the people that come here are the relaxed, quiet variety. My get-togethers here usually are timed perfectly to coincide with PT's Late Night Happy Hour, which runs everyday 12AM - 2AM with half-off drinks and select $5 appetizers. I've never had the food here, just beer! On my recent visit I enjoyed a humongous draft of Heineken for only $4 (HH)! Service is great here, even with a large group of people. I'm sure I'll be back for another bon voyage party.

{"text":"Looks kinda sketch from the outside but the inside of the bar is surprisingly well kept and updated. I came here with a group for New Years Eve because simply put, PT's is the only bar around offering a happy hour all night long on NYE in Vegas. I cozied up to the bar and was immediately seen to by the bartender - I had a big boy Coors Light ($2.75 HH) in my hand in no time. 

I loved that this PT's had a crazy diverse playlist. Any bar that plays \"Stillborn\" by Black Label Society is fine by me. There's quite a few pool tables here and even shuffleboard! Service throughout the night was great. Employees cleared empty glasses from our table multiple times by the pool tables and asked if we needed anything else. As midnight approached, we were handed small cups of champagne and party favors.  

My only complaint is that I smelt like an ash tray after leaving the bar. :( Most PT's bars I frequent do not have this residual effect. All in all, I had a great time here for NYE.

{"text":"Come here quite often and usually the service and food is fine. Not tonight. Disappointed  in service from the bartender i dealt with. She took forever to greet me.and when i finally ordered my drink the first thing she says is just so you know you have to put 20 in and play dollar hands for me to comp your drinks.  I came to play and have a few drinks and i have money to pay for the drinks i order. I didnt need her rudely telling me to gamble a certain amount as if she was gona expect a complaint if i didnt get comped drinks. Every bar tender ive dealt with here was cool but this night was not cool. I came in around 1045"}
{"text":"Local bar, cool bartenders. I come here after work to grab a cold ones after a long day. Lots of regulars and food is always good. Love their chicken wings and Gilroy pizza. Overall never had an issue at this location."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been to this PT's location for happy hour after midnight a couple of times due to its central location for all of us to meet and I have been pleasantly surprised every single time. This location is tucked away on Warm Springs behind the gas station; however, there's always plenty of parking available.

The first time we went, the kitchen was closed already; however, it wasn't a big deal. The bartender here (I forgot his name) is always super friendly and interactive. He even tried to replicate a hand grenade drink that we had during a trip to New Orleans because we told him about how we missed that drink! 

It's usually relatively \"lit\" and we have met random friends here. I prefer this location because it's never too packed or completely empty.

5/5 if you ever want a simple night with friends off of the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends from work to do our fantasy football league. This side of town is still brand new so the bar is spotless. We sat in the back near the big screen tvs and had the whole area to ourselves. 

From 4-7pm, with a PT's card, all alcohol and pizzas are half off. We got 2 BBQ chicken, one Italian style, and one Popcorn chicken pizza to nosh on while picking. Many drinks later, a bucket of wings, and a few more items and our bill came out to a very reasonable price. When it comes to hanging out with the guys, the damage can be massive. Luckily, HH helps alleviate some of the burden."}
{"text":"Went in for the happy hour and im very impressed! the barman knows his stuff and the drinks are about as cheap as ive seen in Vegas. The people at the bar are in good spirits and great conversations can be had with anyone.

The only knock on this is that the service wasnt the speediest ive ever witnessed. It took us about 15 minutes to get the check and I was almost late to my next engagement. But that was just a minor flaw in the scheme of things, ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Todd, the Bartender is amazing.  He remembers my order and provides for a great experience every time.  The waitresses are rude otherwise.  If you eat the wings or pizza make sure you got an easy out to a bathroom within 30 mins of eating because the spices kick it up a notch.  Love the fact thaf they got Stone IPA on draft, but wish they had a bigger kraft beer selection.  This place is never crowded.."}
{"text":"This PT's is just down the street from my favorite sushi place, Goyemon. During regular dinner hours it can be an hour or more of a wait to get a seat at the bar. However, you can check in and give them your number and they will call when your table is ready. That's what brings me to this PT's near Hacienda / Decatur.

This PT's itself is just another PT's and you'll find one every couple of miles here in Vegas. Most PT's get 3 stars. This location only gets 2 stars since it's a little more run down. Still got a great happy hour from midnight to 3am!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst PTs I've been to in town. We waited till happy hour (12am) on a Sunday to order garlic Parmesan fries, at 12:25am we still didn't receive our order, we decided to check up with the bar tender that put in our order, we finally received our fries at 12:37am. 37 freakin' minutes to get our fries, upon first bite we could tell the fries were old and sat under the heater for at least 15 mins before they got out to us. They were horrible and the garlic Parmesan they used was incredibly overwhelming and slopped on-top of the fries with no desire to make it tasteful. It couldn't get any worse right? 

After getting our second basket of make up fries, we all dove right in, after picking at the fries I was fortunate enough to pick one up and dip it into my ranch discovering a long black string dangling from my fries, I realized, it was a disgusting long piece of black hair!! We all wanted to puke. Probably one of the most disgusting feelings ever. Sent the fries back a second time and obviously didn't order another batch and made sure the bar tender took it off our tab

--Also we could tell the waitress Christine was super happy with her job and really enjoyed checking up on her customers. She definitely made sure we had water, ranch, and forks after numerous times of asking her --definitely check this place out if you like slow, bad customer service and disgusting hairy food."}
{"text":"Use to come in and hang out all the time! Had a great bar tender named George and now he's no longer here? Anyone know where he's at? I will not be coming back in here. The lady here tonight was rude and not very respectful. George always greeted me and always had a smile on his face. They lost a good customer tonight."}

{"text":"I was in this location last night. I was wondering if someone could tell me the policy on gambling and comps at this location. I spent a little over $500 just gambling last night. I played anywhere from $1-$100 per hand. I ordered a pizza with two toppings (which didn't look up to PTs standard so I did not eat one bite), I had 2 beers and some shots. My tab was just over $70. I was with a friend. I understand her drinks not being comped because she was not playing but I was charged for both beers and my shots and my pizza (that I didn't eat). I paid my tab. We met another gentleman sitting beside us and played a little more. The three of us did a shot and we were charged again? What is the policy PTs follows. If I can't get a beer playing $100 hands I will not be back. I will add that on the second tab my friend did question the bartender and he did comp those last three shots but we had to ask!!"}
{"text":"I've never been so impressed with a bartender in my life. He's incredible. He's cleaned the bar and gets my cocktail and he does it all with purpose.  Larry is an asset to your company."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this particular pub for the steaks since I was a young girl.
I didn't notice that it had become a PT's since then, and decided to go in anyways.
The steak special and price obviously changed since PT's bought out the location, but those weren't the only things that changed dramatically.

I've come here three times in 2015, and three times too much.
In the time I've come here, I:
-Have had experienced very cold side dishes (Basically, the veggies were so cold that it felt they were defrosted for a minute in the microwave and then plated.)
-Staff that is attentive, but has attitude.
-My order being wrong.


Other than that, the 50% off happy hour is awesome, and I love that, but not enough to justify rating this particular location more than one star."}
{"text":"i had the worst experience i came to make a bet and watch the basketball game. first when i arrived the door was locked at 230 in the afternoon. so when i came in i placed my bet and ask the mellisa if i could get matches she told me that they didn't have any(which is kind of strange every pt's in the valley u have been to stay stocked)so i ask one of the people sitting at the bar so nellis stops me and yllls at me i told you that no one here has matches or a light. so i walked to the store next door and got a light.i came back only to find that the door is locked and now she will not let me in i ring the bell and no answer so i call the restaurant thinking she may be in the back comes to my surprise  she tells me she will call the police if i don't leave and she is fearful of her life. it was the worst experience i have every had and i enjoy all the pt's  in the valley this one happens to be the one close to my house i never thought i would experience any such disrespect. so i called one of the other pt's and they told me oh no the door shouldn't be locked and provided me the corporate  number so i will call to report  mellisa  i will update on the situation."}
{"text":"Horrible place music not extensive feels like a whites only bar. Bartender worst ever after door closed would not bother to let people In as simple as buzzing people in (Bartender Cathy) and horrible service on top of that not even busy. 
Will not return and I live walking distance."}
{"text":"Came here because my friend came to Vegas and we had 1 hours to kill. I bought a pitcher and got a pool table for 1 hour. Prices are really cheap. Bartender was nice but never tried to strike up a conversation. Good place to hang out. They have pool, darts, and TVs around. Dim light and drinks gives it a nice relaxing atmosphere. This place is perfect if you want a low key night or for a quick drink before you head to your main event. May come back because my friends live in the area."}
{"text":"After a long night at the show I work for, I was exhausted, but still down to hang out with my coworkers, one of who was dying to go bowling. Eh, compromise, we'd all go out for drinks and do bowling another time. I went here with 3 of my coworkers, Tasia, Antonio & Tony and Tasia's bf Cody and his friend, James, this morning (midnight ish) 4/13/11.

Thanks to Industrial Road being closed, we had to go a roundabout way and I was about ready to just go home when my coworker, Antonio, who I was following, finally found the place. My coworker Tasia was already there and apparently knows the manager. The bartender knew her by name. I guess it's just that sort of place.

After midnight, drinks and pizza are half off. Between my two Guinesses at the CMYE the day before and my pina colada that morning, I thought I should slow down and order my staple - water. We ordered a half pepperoni half cheese pizza. It was $7 something thanks to the after midnight special. There's not a chance in hell that it's worth $14. It's a super thin crust thin pizza that 6 of us split. It was decent but nothing mind blowing.

I wanted to try the lasagna, but I needed less carbs so I ordered the chopped cobb salad for $8.99 with blue cheese dressing. It was okay - not the best, but it was definitely edible. At some points, the dressing sort of tasted like bleach, which is not a  good sign.

Cody ordered himself a bucket of mild hot wings and fries. He and Antonio were dying over how spicy they were... James and I agreed that they smelled faintly of Tobasco. Crybabies.

One cool feature of PT's is that you can buy juke box credits and order the next song directly from your smartphone. Cody was basically in charge of the playlist the entire time we were there. 

Another thing this place needs is seating for large groups. The tables only seat 4, and are attached to the wall. We had to pull up two barstools and cram around the table to fit all 6 of us, to share the pizza.

I finally left around 2:10 AM because I was getting stupid tired. I had a fun time but the food here is way overpriced."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Las Vegans and PT's. Without fail, when dinner is mentioned, somebody says, \"Let's go to PT's!\" WHY?! 

On July 3, (7/3/11) we got drenched in the downpour at work. I wanted some hot food after such a crappy shift. I texted my coworker friend Matt to see if he wanted to grab some dinner. Unfortunately, he didn't want Hawaiian or Mexican and this was one of the few places that showed up on Yelp as being sort of a half way point between our houses. GAWD.

This is the third PT's I've eaten at in Las Vegas. It must be a requirement for PT's bartenders to keep people waiting or to ignore them. I went up to the bar, asked for menus and was handed one menu. We decided that we'd split the party bucket of boneless chicken wings in mild sauce. Why so much food? Two individual dinners would run more than $20 whereas a bucket containing just chicken and a lot more of it, would be $18. Obvious choice. Right when we ordered, we were presented with a check - we split the cost and left a tip. I've never been to a restaurant that is only dine-in, that makes you pay and tip before you even get your food. 

When we got the wings, I got that weird crampy feeling in my stomach - the one I attributed to the sauce being crazy hot the last time I was at PT's. This sauce wasn't even spicy and it was hurting my stomach. Clearly there's something else going on. It makes me wonder if they use MSG or soybean oil. No bueno to both!

Asking for a water... geeze. It irks me when I go up to the bar and the bartender is pretending to be busy, fiddling with the register, in a nearly empty restaurant, then walks off to the farthest part of the bar, away from me. What sort of customer service is this? When I've already tipped at least 15% prior to even gettting my meal, I expect not to have to stand at the bar, like a fool, until the waiter decides to come over and take extra long making a simple water. I'm pretty sure it's because they're not likely (with me) to get a tip on a water refill, but still, customer service is severly lacking at ALL PT's.

The next time somebody says they want PT's, my answer will be a resounding \"NO!\""}
{"text":"They suck! PT's charged me for drinks while I was playing video poker for $1 per hand. It's an off strip dump so you would think they would want to attract people with deals, drinks, food etc. No wonder the place was empty. They didn't have food and suggested I order delivery from a place close by. Bartender was not attentive and the ace was empty on weekend night. 

About 3-5 minutes away I found Village Pub. My drinks were free while playing video poker for 25 cents to $1 per hand. Had a really good meal for about $8-10 and they had actual customers which I considered a good sign.   Bartenders were interacting with customers and it seemed to have a relaxed atmosphere. I ended up staying for almost 3 hours. 

Will pass on aPT'S in the future. Village Pub and Winchells are better options"}
{"text":"Eat elsewhere. Seriously. $11.99 for three freaking chicken strips and fries! I thought other chicken strip places were expensive, where you get three sauces, bread, a lot more fries, and 6 strips for $9.50. 

The strips are just your standard, frozen, mass produced cuts of chicken, pretty bland and not even worthy as bar food.

The bartender on staff, and kitchen staff that delivered the food were nice, and on point. It's just tough to give PT's any stars when the prices are so damn high."}
{"text":"I have no idea why it insists that this location is closed... I'm a regular here and I can assure you, it is most definitely open for business!

Midnight to 4AM all drinks are half off. They have pool, darts and it's never over crowded. You'll never want to go to another scenester bar again.

The only down side is if you're looking for food after 1AM, make sure you grab it before you hit the door. Their cook leaves around then and no food will be served."}
{"text":"The bartender for happy hour is really nice but the one before had a sour attitude.  Otherwise a really relaxed experience, good food and good drinks."}
{"text":"The bartender who took my order was A++. The food and price of said food on the other hand was way below par. You could go right down the street to farmer boys and pay half the price for a three egg breakfast and it taste 10 times better. I only stopped here because it was close to my oil change and I wanted to kill some time while having breakfast."}
{"text":"Horrible. And i mean horrible service. When you order drinks and have them taken off tour bill cause they never arrive? When management has 1 waitress on hand at 730pm on a thursday? Pts sucks-but this was even bad for them. They make buffalo wild wings look like a 4 star establishment. Avoid at all costs!!"}
{"text":"I love this location! There are some many Pt's in Vegas, but I go out of my way to this one. Its on the east side of Vegas across the street from Wayne Newtons house(Mr Las Vegas).

Whenever I am in the mood for hot chicken fingers, this is my go to spot.

There is something in their sauce that I love. After all these years in Vegas, I still love PT's chicken fingers.

Its a bit smokey as the bar area allows smoking, but I will deal with the smoke for good food!

Definitely recommend for good bar food!"}
{"text":"Went to this PT's on New Years Eve to meet up with a few Yelpers as well as some other groups. Fantastic drink specials.Vodka clean for $3. Happy Hour was running all night on this NYE. 

Big center bar area with gaming, then they have pool tables on one side, beer pong and shuffleboard on the other. I didn't notice any food options.

I would never have found this place on E. Tropicana close to the 95 fwy if it hadn't been for this meetup. Interesting group of people were here and all seemed pretty cool, even the guy falling asleep at the bar. They gave out hats and stuff for NY's too....but I left before midnight so I could watch the fireworks."}
{"text":"Well the truth is one bad apple can often ruin a whole barrel.  I generally enjoy most of the staff at my local watering hole. However,  one crappy bartender has decided my currency isn't as good as other patrons. Said bartender has soured my attitude about going there just on the chance that ****** is working behind the bar. The worst part of it all is everyone else that works there is awesome.  I don't like your poor attitude,  your weak drinks, and your service sucks. Thank you so much for being so incredibly rude to me and my friends and family you lost my buisness.  I don't come there to order your crummy attitude."}

{"text":"I was introduced to my first PT's experience by friends quite recently.  Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages, I cared only about the food.  And my experience was mixed.

I opened with a Fry Bucket of very good Beef Chili drenched in Cheese Sauce with Twister Fries, along with Port Stickers.  The Pot Stickers were pan-fried Pork Pot Stickers on a bed of Asian Slaw.  Both were very good starters.  But the appetizers were originally delivered with no silverware, plates, or napkins, and one water short.  I counted 10 televisions in one dining room, but all were silent.  

Alas, for the next round of eating, something was lost in translation concerning my ordered entree.  Instead of initially receiving Pastrami Reuben Sliders, I was presented with a Reuben Sandwich.  Since the latter sammie was prepared on Marbled Rye Bread, which I do not at all like, I elected to send it back to have my original order honored.  Eventually the sliders arrived, sporting mostly lean pastrami, sauerkraut, Swiss Cheese, and Thousand Island Dressing, along with a side of Onion Rings that were mostly batter.  The sliders were tasty and each bun had a nice soft split top.  

The Fry Bucket was almost a meal itself, and I discovered that good comfort food is served here."}
{"text":"very disappointed in the the amount of food they are charging a arm and leg for. 10 jumbo wings for $11.99 comes with fries. wings are no where near jumbo and the amount of fries that comes with it is equal to the \"bucket of fries \" for $7.99.  beer good. wait staff is great especially Natasha & Angel are the best.this site won't let me give 0 stars so one for food but I'd give the 5 to the ladies.Upon speaking with Jen she graciously made the night and meal right. thanks Jen."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I had high expectations after reading some recent reviews here. 
Draft beer selection is OK and happy hour is half price all drinks, so the jumbo sized brew is a bargain! One bartender was working, which may be the standard on Mondays (??) We had great service and never felt abandoned. The female bartender was friendly and easily joked around which is great. 
I tend to shove PTs at the bottom of the list because of the smoke factor, but it wasn't an issue during this visit. Luckily, most of the customers weren't smoking, but it's to be expected at a tavern! 
I'm more of a PTs Gold/Sierra Gold kinda gal, but would return here if in the area again."}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed. We walk in to the bar and waiting almost 10 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged us. He said he would be right back. 5 minutes later he was.We ordered drink # 1 and finished it. Waited about 10 minutes and then he came back and we ordered another. I drank that down and then the wait begins. Almost 15 minutes later, he came back. I was fuming. This is a customer service industry. Another thing that made me mad was that their was not many people there..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been a PTs regular all over town, but this location is seriously lacking. I came here tonight with my mom for a bite to eat. We walk in, sit down at a table, and is greeted by the bartender with a smile. She leans over the bar in the direction of our table and asks for our drink order. We order water and Diet Coke, and then since I already knew what I wanted I ordered a pizza. Once we were served our drinks we were not checked on until the pizza came. No biggie, but we could have used refills. Pizza comes out and just by looking at the top, I can tell its burnt. The cheese was bubbling on top, and not in a good way. The slices were black on the bottom and too crispy for my taste. We again were not checked on at all until we were about halfway through leaving the burned chunks on the plate. The bartender finally came over for refills and the check, but didn't ask how the food was. We left the final two pieces that we couldn't eat face down on the pan and when the bartender came back just asked, \"are you done with these?\" She clearly noticed it was burned to a crisp but didn't acknowledge. I now sit at home with an extremely upset stomach texting my mom who is also suffering at her house. No plans to visit this location again."}
{"text":"The female bartender is a raging bitch!!! Snarls at you when you order a drink or speak a word to her."}
{"text":"Best local bar in town.  The staff is amazing.  They do it right here.  Ashley, Tino, Heather, and everyone else here know what they are doing. I could not ask for a place to do it any better.  I know I am in the right place anytime I come in."}
{"text":"PT's is a franchise in the Las Vegas area.  There is a PT's on virtually every corner of this town.  

Having said that, this particular bar has my undying loyalty.  

This bar is where I go for a relatively quiet beer.  It's a great place to go after a long day.  The beer is relatively cheap, especially by Las Vegas standards.  The food is great.  In fact, the wings are on par with Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of quality as well as price.  

The atmosphere is what you make it.  If you want to saddle up to the bar and tie one on quietly, it's easy to do.  But if you want to play pool, darts, sit at a couch in a lounge-esque environment, then you are still in the right place.  

Thursdays are great for karaoke.  If you feel the compulsion to get up and show off, feel free.  If the need to silently heckle the drunken warbling of fellow patrons overtakes you, then the venue is large enough to whisper jokes to your friends.  

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and, frankly, fun to be around.  Even when the place is busy, they make patrons feel as though they are the only people in the bar.  They listen to your stories, but be prepared for competitively entertaining stories from them.  

This is my Zen place.  This is, and will always be, where I go to unwind and relax with friends.  There's something for everyone.  The beer selection and the drink list are acceptable, to say the least, especially considering prices.  

This is a great place to come and drink.  It's also a great place to go for a evening full of stories and shenanigans."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite PT's the bartenders are amazing and for being a smaller location of this franchise it's very welcoming I have always enjoyed my outing here"}
