{"text":"They are promoting Filipino style Lechon, when infact it is no where near it..the pig has a smell as if it has been dead for days before they roasted it, I was so embarrassed and ashamed when my guest noticed it and commented on it.I will never ever buy from this bbq house ever again, and I will never recommend this place to anyone! There are far more better places out there where you will be happy with, NOT this one. I can't restrict anyone from getting food here, but pls be advised that you have been warned!"}
{"text":"Gave me the wrong order when I repeatedly said I want chicken was given pork. Reasonably priced and not really authentic Chinese food. Will not be retiring as I can get better quality and quantity of food for a few more cents at the plaza nearby"}
{"text":"Sadly Taste Good BBQ does not \"Taste Good\"

$5 for a rice box with 1 protein and tofu or veggie plus soup or bottle water. This is just so cheap and obviously you get what you pay for.

BBQ pork was dry and tasteless, did not taste good at all.

The store itself was not the cleanliness.
