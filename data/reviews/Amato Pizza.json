{"text":"GROUPON USERS BEWARE! 

Well, it's amazing how fast things can change. I walked in with my other Groupon on December 24 and was promptly refused service by a disgruntled manager/owner who pretty much told me to get lost. I tried to reason, showing him the fine print on the voucher-but that went nowhere. I left after he said: \"I DONT HAVE TIME TO MAKE 'GROUPONS', IT's gonna take 90 minutes, im busy, I tell Groupon to fix ad and they didnt, come back when im not busy!\" 

And it's not like this is my first time going to Amato's- this established has delivered for my various work events (..they are angels on the phone btw), I've picked up/paid retail for their pizza in person, even used 1 Groupon in the summer (..3am in the morning) and no problem whatsoever. 

Needless to say, I will not be returning in any capacity.

Best of luck to all my extended Groupon familia."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious! Super friendly guy making the pizza. Although a bit more expensive than other pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place in Toronto. No question. They never skimp on the toppings and the service is great!

I am vegetarian and i have never had a problem finding a few different tempting options here. It is not cheap but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Meh. The pizza is okay, but this is the second time they've delivered my pizza and screwed up the drink order. The first time they didn't include the drinks at all, but I figured that, while annoying, it was an honest mistake. This time, I ordered diet pepsi and they gave me two regular 'Our Compliments' Colas. For those who don't know, Our Compliments is the Sobey's store brand pop, which is significantly cheaper than Pepsi. My problem is that Amato charged me $3.00 for two drinks, then swapped out what I thought I was getting for a discount brand soda. 

Not cool, Amato."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza. Worth a stop by if you're in the area, but not necessarily go out of your way to go.  When ordering a whole pizza, takes awhile but I guess that's the price you pay for freshly made. Restaurant itself could use some cleaning...which is the only reason I deducted a star."}
{"text":"New owners! Real nice guy. The pizza was really good. All the veggies in the world on top."}
{"text":"I am so very turned off by the quality of food and delivery customer service of Amato.

I ordered my meal at 11:03pm and after an hour and 30 minutes (12:36am) it finally arrived at my door. I call an hour and fifteen minutes into my order to see where it was and the man on the line told me it was going to be there at any second. Fifteen minutes later I finally receive my order.
Not only was I missing the can of pop I ordered and paid for, and not only did the man at the restaurant give me a roundabout excuse about the lateness of the driver (that my street is apparently a confusing, one-way street, which I can assure you that it is not) but the food quality was disgusting at best.
There was no flavour to the pasta, there was barely any chicken in it as well. It was super oily and I threw it out after four reluctant bites. The complimentary bread that came with the pasta was stale, which really confused me as to how it took so long if I had a super sub-par meal with bread that wasn't even fresh. 
I will never ever order from Amato again."}
{"text":"F(*&^ The Tourists

We ordered food from Amato on our first night in town and it was worthy of a second order. However, when we made our second order, when it came to our hotel door it was more than $10 higher than what was quoted and what the menu stated. Add to it the food was WRONG and the person on the other end of the phone was rude. 

Called the concierge and the menu has been pulled. Decent food, but the screw the tourist attitude is a LOSER!"}

New owner is doing a great job. Expect to find good pizza and friendly environment."}

I get a call a half an hour later (pizza was expected in forty minutes) that they can't send me the pizza. I'm just a stoned gal who wants some pizza late at night, they should have told me when I ordered they couldn't deliver to me. They were extremely unapologetic about it and rude.

Twenty minutes later I get a call from their delivery man, 647.701.2008 that they are downstairs with my pizza. I told them our pizza was cancelled and was confused. He had no idea. He hangs up. I call back, and say my roommate will still take the pizza, he starts yelling at me and \"to go fuck my roommate.\" if I could give them less than one star I would. I ordered a pizza and got ringed into a circus where I was verbally abused."}
{"text":"I would like to thank the person employed by Amato's Pizza that has allegedly stolen my husband's credit card number and used it to buy fuel for his/her car, and just tried to order take out using it.  We used this card one time in Toronto, for pizza take out from Amato's to our hotel room.  In the time since, the card was used twice in the Toronto area. Thank God for American Express fraud service.  Can you let the person know that the card is now listed as stolen?  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Stumbling past Amatos on a late night coming back from Kensington or something else in the College-Spadina-Queen belt, I am often tempted to stop in for a slice.  Maybe it's the booze talking, but nothing looks more appealing than the lurid glow from Amato's windows.

I think I've had Amato pizza during the day exactly one time.  It wasn't very good.  It didn't seem like the pie was put together well, and the veggie toppings slid off from the slice almost seemingly in disgust.  I remained unenthusiastic.  

Many late night trips later, I can't tell you what's compelling about Amato pizza after going to a show and having some drinks.  Maybe the thrill of eating outside standing over a garbage can, or the potato pizza that is literally topped with french fries.  Whatever it is, I can't deny that a slice from Amato soaks up the booze and fuels my walk home just fine.  And I think, for my part, that is the way our relationship will remain.  Cordial but distant, until I decide I need to drunk dial Amato one more time."}
{"text":"I work in the area and used to pop in for a slice a few times a week. A large part of their business is the single slice market. Well, the prices used to be under $4 so there was no PST. They put the price up to $4.01, so it costs an extra $0.32 in taxes, for what? A two cent profit??
Didn't seem very customer service oriented to me, so I emailed them. Big surprise, no reply!
The last few times I was in, the slices were all curled up on the display racks like they were dried out from sitting out too long. 
I have to agree with another reviewer also, the place is really dirty.
It's too bad that they've gone way down hill over the years.
Consequently, they've lost my business."}
{"text":"Oct 2016: Had to edit our review, this location has gone downhill fast and we will never order from here again.  Don't bother wasting your money!"}
{"text":"UNETHICAL WORKING CONDITIONS FOR STAFF

Overall, Amato is not as good as Massimo's, which has opened up a couple doors down.

Pros: Excellent selection, pretty good hours.
Cons: Pizza is so-so, and Amato has a horrible reputation for ripping off their own staff!

Regarding the rip off, google \"Giuseppe Colantonio lawsuit\" to read the deets and watch the Youtube video which indicates Amato owed workers over $75,000 in unpaid wages back in 2006.

Even if the pizza was good, I would not support a business like that.  Mediocre pizza and Massimo's close by makes that decision even easier."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch from Amato's yesterday and the Delivery was in decent time about 40 min. I ordered 3 mushroom soups at 4.95 each. They were like eating warm buttery watered down milk with mushrooms with really no taste but butter.

Also ordered a Chicken Pollo Parmigiana Sandwich, 2 slices of pizza doe. Very hard, tough to chew and dry. the chicken wasn't bad for sure not the best.

All in all a very disappointing product to serve. Would not order from here again since this food was an F on my food scale.

What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Just ordered via Just Eat service.....

Placed order to be delivered at 6 pm....it arrived at 4:49 pm.

Initiated chat with Just Eat........he was useless.    Said I needed to provide feedback to restaurant (so here I am) and he did not offer to do anything else until I stated I would never use the service again. Only then did he say he would contact the restaurant (as he says, he is only there to mitigate between clients and restaurant).  I also said that they put the dressing on salad and not on the side as requested.   Restaurant offered to send another order and keep salad.  I guess they don't even want the wilted salad back - as its wilted!!!

Update - restaurant finally called.  Basically argued with me about the sale and did not want to send another.  Said that how they make it - whatever!   He said he would only send another pizza at 6 pm  .....  I told him to forget it and i would NEVER USE JUST EATS AND NEVER ORDER FROM AMATO AGAIN!      No wonder they have 2.5 stars!"}
{"text":"As a local to Amato I hoped that I had found a source for pizza slices for my home office days. To my dismay I have yet to have a piece of pizza from Amato that left me wanting a second.

I'm glad Gelato Pizza has opened, hopefully GP allows Amato to keep their well established stale / old pizza slice niche."}
{"text":"Highly recommend by the hotel I was at but the Pizza was not very good and sort of had a frozen pizza taste. The tiramisu was HORRIBLE... Paid $8 for a frozen piece with frostbite and looked nothing thru advertised."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on customer service....I never actually got to try the pizza!
I attempted to order a pizza and called the restaurant at about 11:30 am to place a pick up order. I was told by a male employee that they were very busy and my pizza would not be available until 1pm (I mentioned that I would be using a Groupon and this information came after that....first sign of something wrong). That seemed odd to me, but I went ahead with the order and asked them to have it ready for 1:30pm (I was heading to a meeting and was initially hoping to pick it up on the way, but with the later timing decided I could pick it up after my meeting). I called in again at about 1:45pm before heading over just to confirm that the pizza would be ready. A female employee answered and she had no idea about my order. She said that there were no pick up orders there. Then she asked if I had a Groupon and went on to say that I would have to come in and place an order. I certainly was not going to go there and wait for hours for my pizza!  If indeed their policy is that the order must be placed in person with a Groupon (which I don't believe is noted on the Groupon) I should have been told this when I called in at 11:30, rather than saying my order wouldn't be ready until 1pm (1.5 hours? I highly doubt that they were THAT busy!). Needless to say we went elsewhere for lunch. What a waste of time!"}
{"text":"Delivery driver was very rude. Tried to demand a tip when he showed up almost 2 hours after I placed the order. The order was suppose to arrive about 1 hour after I ordered it, he was an hour late! Very poor way to treat customers. I believe most people in the service industry deserve to be tipped, but not when they can not adequately provide you the service they are offering. Also a tip is a privilege not a right."}
{"text":"There's now a sign on the window that says 'St Clair Pizza, Opening soon' I hope its as good as Amato was!"}
{"text":"After the first slice (I took out 4 that day) I would have given this more like a 2.5 stars but when I heated up the fourth slice for lunch the next day it was starting to grow on me (I am sure the scale would confirm this).  This is an obvious choice for a pizza place when the buzz of Kensington market, due south, becomes a bit too stifling.  Let's face it, I don't think I have ever met a slice of pizza that I didn't like but when you're forking over your hard earned dough (pun intended), you want to walk away satisfied.  Amato has some pros and cons that are as follows:

Pros:

1.  Slices are large-around the same size as Pizzaiolo and maybe even a bit larger, and there are some meagre alternatives out there, so size is important. One slice with regular toppings (pepperoni green pepper mushroom, for example) will set you back $3.99.  A gourmet slice will set you back $4.50 (the spinach, feta variety, for example).  But for normal appetites (mine is a little bigger than normal), once slice could be a meal.  With 2 slices you will  definitely be full (even me).  
2.  Toppings are quite fresh-not like fresh off the farm fresh but suggesting decent turnover fresh- and varied. The sauce (which brings me to one of the cons), is quite flavourful with a definite garlic-y hit.  There was also a decent amount of cheese along with the toppings, which is not always the case.

Cons.

1. Sodium.  To my homemade food most of the time taste buds, the salt content in this pizza seems really high.  It's probably built into the not quite homemade tasting dough and it's a solid demerit point.
2. The dough, while tasty enough, is a little sponge-y.  Can't quite describe the issue as it tasted fresh, just not like it was freshly rolled out in the same kitchen that the pizza was baked in.
3. Quantity of sauce-the sauce content on these slices was SORELY lacking making for a rather dry and as already mentioned, overly salty, pizza eating experience, especially when you are going for multiple slices in one sitting, like I am.  This is a shame as it seemed from what little sauce there was that Amato has a good recipe going, but they skimp on it considerably.  Others have commented in the same way, so I know I am not alone here.  And of course the sauce seems to get totally sucked up by the highly absorbent crust.

So there you have it.  Maybe not the best slice in Toronto but definitely a serviceable slice and at decent value."}
{"text":"Amato has been the original long standing gourmet pizza chain in Toronto before all their competitors.  What you get is lovely thin crust with oddles of toppings.  They a ton of meat, veggie and even vegan options.  The college location is a bit divey but they have great service.

You can not beat a slice and pop for $4.99!  Amato is a must on your cheap eats list!"}
{"text":"New owners! So friendly. Food is fresh. Had the calzone and it trumped the ones I had in Italy! Family owned"}
{"text":"A 2 hour wait from completing the order until it arrived at the door, and we live about a 5 minute drive from the restaurant. When we called after 1 hr. 15 minutes, they claimed that suddenly they got \"really, really busy\" and that our order just left the restaurant. 30 minutes later, no food, we called again and they claimed their delivery car \"broke down\". 

One pasta dish was to have shrimp and scallops in a rose sauce with peppers on linguine. (Fettuccini Pescatore
Shrimp, scallops, mixed peppers and green onions in a tomato cream sauce) NOT ONE SCALLOP was in this dish. However, there was an abundance of shrimp, which is unusual in any restaurant. Still, we wanted shrimp and scallops, and we did speak to the restaurant twice on the phone so they had opportunity to inform us if they were \"out\" of scallops today. Disappointing.

Sandra Insulate is to have crushed hazelnuts, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes. I guess they didn't think we knew what hazelnuts looked like, because there were no hazelnuts, just a pile of pine nuts instead. The crushed hazelnuts in this salad give a very different and distinct flavour than a pile of whole pine nuts do. Disappointed again.

Garlic bread with cheese for $4.95...don't waste your money. It looked like a small pizza with just garlic butter and cheese on it, it was way over done and burnt on the bottom. Totally unacceptable. Extremely disappointing. It was garbage. Not even the dogs wanted to eat it. 

Don't waste your money ordering from this location. Amato generally has gone way downhill in Toronto over the last 10-12 years, which is disappointing. I used to enjoy their food and felt the prices were reasonable for what you were getting. They can pull off a decent pizza when they make an effort. 

Calling to complain at this location is pointless, the woman answering the phone barely speaks English (or so she pretends). So, they get a crappy rating to sit on the internet forever. Seems fair given after 2 hours I had such terrible stomach pains from being way past the point of hungry and then was forced to eat sub par food that I paid a decent buck for. 

Another crappy restaurant in Toronto...I wish I could say it was a surprise but honestly, I've had more bad experiences eating out in this city than positive ones, so it doesn't surprise me. My expectations are already pretty low given the number of bad meals I've been served in a restaurant or had delivered to my door, but this one was extra pathetic. Garlic bread with cheese is something an 8 year old can make and not ruin, yet a \"professional\" restaurant staff cannot handle it! Putting the right ingredients into straightforward dishes is also a really basic life skill, the fact that they cannot manage it really does not bode well for their future in this business."}
{"text":"how can a pizzaria go about completely effing up a slice of plain cheese? just ask amato queen east! .... crust that is still doughy and overly salty, sauce that barely tastes like anything except canned paste, and barely any cheese to speak of. looks okay, but tastes unfathomable, no bueno."}
{"text":"In town for Festival and after leaving one club Friday night, we ordered a large pizza and wings for delivery to the hotel. We were told we had to order pizza because the kitchen stopped cooking pasta at some random earlier time. 
We were told the pizza would arrive in 45 minutes. Approximately TWO and a HALF hours later , our pizza was delivered to our hotel. Somehow the pizza was burnt and cold at the same time. The wings were dry rubbery and cold as well.
We called the restaurant  and no one answered. Saturday morning we called and the day manager stated we had to call back in the evening after 6 to make a complaint. We called after 6 and the manager argued with us stating 45 minutes was just an estimated time. He never apologized for the cold pizza or the wings. He told us he would not send us a new pizza and he would not give us a refund so what did we want.  We wanted him to at least apologize and offer to make it right. He refused to acknowledge anything was wrong. He finally said we could come pick up a pizza but he would not have it delivered. We told him we did not live in Toronto .. If we could drive there to pick up a pizza we would have made our complaint in person . We told the manager we were really disappointed in his customer service and were merely trying to give him an opportunity to correct the situation. He was rude and ugly on the phone. We told him we would let the hotel know of our experience because the hotel has his restaurant listed as highly rated for delivery for guests. He responded stating he has been in business for over 30 years and our complaint will not break him.

We advised the hotel concierge to remove this restaurant from their list of food recommendations as the service and food quality do not meet the level of service the hotel guests require or expect."}
{"text":"Besides the pepperoni and cheese you have spinach and feta. And a rather wild assortment of twenty or so pizzas on display for the vegetarians and carnivores. The emphasis here is more on the topping flavours because of a thinner crust.  A slice and pop is about $5.  

The rating system of Yelp asks me if this place is good for kids.  I don't know, I mostly go here after midnight when it's full of drunk and stoned university kids.  It's good for them though.

Add the red-bottled hot sauce yourself.  It is usually beside the pop vending machine."}
{"text":"Delivery ordered the XL (18\") Pollo Basilico pizza. (Pesto, chicken, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes)

This is by far their greatest pizza, and honestly the only one that's probably worth buying, as I'm not a fan of their tomato sauce. Toppings are plentiful. A bit pricey at just over $25 before tip, but this is one of the only pizzas in the city that I can say is definitely better than the Dr. Oetker Ristorante frozen pizzas at the supermarket.

I really don't get all the hate, but then again, most people order the more traditional pizzas."}
{"text":"I was looking at the options around College and Yonge for pizza, and the reviews of anything in the area seems to be universally horrible. I think I understand now. The reviews really need to differentiate between slice-to-go and made-to-order

Most of these horrible reviews are by people who walk in and order a pre-made, and then re-warmed slice of pizza. Of course it's horrible in that case. Unless it's relatively fresh out of the oven, it's not going to be good. 

So, I walked in and took a look at the pre-made slices to get an idea of what they do. The crusts look good, and the ingredients look fine, though these aren't what I came for. Watched them stretch out fresh dough behind the counter for a minute; not frozen or premade, the dough is prepped individually, not in bulk. 

Ordered a Mediterranean pizza and sat down to wait. About 15 minutes later, fresh pizza in a box, ready to go. 

The pizza's really good. A nice bit of brown on the cheese, and a good, crisp edge crust. Cheese out nearly to the edge, and hardly touched with tomato sauce at all, which is really the way I prefer it."}
{"text":"I live a few doors down and it's dangerously close! There have been many times where I'm coming home from classes and stop for a slice from my favourite pizza place. I recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for pizza in the area, 10/10!"}
{"text":"Totally disgusted by what just happened to me by this location.

Okay, the food is okay. That's literally the only reason I gave it two stars. The delivery service, on the other hand, WOW...

I ordered $14 worth of food online, and only had $3 in change for a tip. I added $1 to the bill so I could leave a (in my opinion) very generous $4 tip for the driver.  When he showed up, literally 1.5 hours later, I opened the door, he was so angry he was shaking, and said to me, before I was able to give him the $3 cash  \"LISTEN, next time order from Pizza Pizza, it's not worth it for me to drive here for $1. It's not worth my time and I don't want to work for free\". I was floored. Disgusting. Never again will I ever order from here."}
{"text":"My first delivery pizza from Amato was so incredible it almost prompted a thank-you call. The guy who made my pizza wrote \"Thanks! Eat more Amato!\" on the plain white pizza box and signed his name. 

Not the cheapest delivery pizza, but well worth the few extra bucks. They serve pizza by the slice, as well as delivery, and have several locations around Toronto."}
{"text":"ordered it through doordash. the delivery was prompt but disappointed by the food. ordered a pasta with marinara and cheese. its been 2 hours since i had it and i'm still feeling the heartburn. wayyyyyy to oily. and the oil tasted stale as well. the bread had no butter along with it. there was no parmesan cheese with with the pasta either. needless to say, i won't be ordering again or visiting this place."}
{"text":"Amato on Yonge St. is a horrible little hole in the wall restaurant doesn't deserve your money or your patronage! My gripe isn't with the pizza, which was actually quite okay, but the incredible rudeness of the staff. Last weekend, after a movie, we went in using a Groupon for an 18\" \"classic\" pizza. First off, nobody greeted us, in fact, we were ignored until we called them over (they were very busy chatting with each other).

It wasn't clear as to what \"classic\" meant or what toppings this Groupon entitled us to, so we asked what our options were. We got a snarky response of \"anything up here\", which I took to mean the top row, but we weren't given any further clarification. We wanted a basic pepperoni, mushroom and onion pizza, but we didn't see one display (and I couldn't discern what some of the toppings were) and some of them weren't labeled, so we tried to get more information. Another guy came over and made some sense so we put in our order--the one without the label and the mystery toppings (additional ingredient was bacon). We sat down to wait. According to my husband (who faced the cash desk and the pizza ovens), he felt that he was getting dirty stares and glares from these 2 guys, for whatever reason. That alone, made him want to get out of there (in addition to the uncomfortable seating and sports TV blaring loudly).

When the pizza was finally ready, we were summoned to the cash desk. I was given a hot pizza tray to take to our table (all of 10-15 feet away). You would think they would put it in a pizza box if they aren't going to bother to bring it to our table. I was incredulous--it was hot enough to be uncomfortable to hold and I wasn't even sure I should take it. And hoped I wouldn't suddenly drop it if it really was too hot. Of course our order came with no plates, napkins or cutlery--we had to ask for those too. These guys shouldn't work in the hospitality industry.

According to other reviews I looked at, after the fact, they don't like people who order with a Groupon! They treat you like a second class customer (should have read these first before buying the Groupon) and dismiss the fact that you could conceivably like their pizza (or other food offerings) enough to come back again and again. Why do they bother offering these deals if they aren't interested in getting new (and repeat) customers? 

Also, the Groupon voucher asks Groupon users to be generous with tipping (which we usually are), but these creeps didn't deserve one red cent--you get a tip for good service. Just before we left, the first guy came over and asked how the pizza was (no doubt thinking he might still get a tip--are you kidding me!) Needless to say, we couldn't get out of there fast enough and will never, ever, ever set foot in Amato again. I let Groupon know, but they haven't replied back. Maybe they don't care, even though I mentioned that this negative experience would probably factor into my not wanting to purchase Groupons in the future.

Amato has also had issues withholding staff pay, etc. so that's just another reason to avoid this place if you care about how a company treats its' staff and customers.

Do yourself a big favour, buy your pizza elsewhere--there are plenty of pizza places with great pizza that'll treat you like a human being. These guys don't deserve to be in business!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. I wouldn't dine-in, especially during the summer. It's hot. 

Prices are fair. Taste is good. After eating here I can't ever bring myself to eat Pizza Pizza again. I shall return. If you want good tasting pizza and don't need to be pampered with service, come here."}
{"text":"**Delivery Review**

I discovered Amato Pizza haphazardly when I took over as EA at my previous employer.  We had  monthly birthday celebrations in the form of pizza and cake in the boardroom.

I had never had a \"white\" pizza prior to Amato, which consists of potatoes, italian seasoning and a cream sauce.  Yeah that's right - Bannock isn't the only one who can slap potatoes on some dough and call it pizza.

Delivery is usually within 45 minutes and the staff are all very friendly."}
{"text":"So I call them at 3:20am (mind you it says online they're open until 4am) and I ask if I can place an order. The man says \"Sure, what do you want?\" When I start saying I want a pizza, the man interrupts me and says \"Sorry, we're not taking any more orders!\" So then why say proceed in the first place? I was obviously within the time limit, 40 minutes before they close, and I was given a \"GO\" to place an order before the man changed his mind. Obviously a horribly run business and rude. Never again eating from this s**t-hole. I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"ok I want to preface this review with an apology for being lazy - I didn't feel like walking the 1.5 blocks to Amato's myself, so I ordered delivery. It's shameful but creates the launch pad for this review....

So typically I walk in to the college st. amatos and get the potato slice and it's like a tasty mix of potato, cream sauce, cheese, and onions.  But when I ordered a large delivery potato pizza, it was not the same, and the onions were missing.  The taste was similar, but lacking, and the garlic sauce was wayyy greener in colour  and less creamy than usual. Also the delivery guy looked unfamiliar (I seriously frequent this place often enough to know the staff) and definitely not Italian....

So i'm trying to figure out if they've switched owners and \"let things go\" or if their delivery just isnt' as up to par as their slices.

I was obsessed w/ that potato slice for awhile now,  so i'm hoping this not so great pizza is just the universe paying me back in the form of a \"one off\" for being too lazy to walk there and get a slice."}
{"text":"A favorite destination when visiting Toronto.  Excellent flavor and many topping combos."}
{"text":"I really like the tomatoe sauce that they put on their pizzas. Very flavourful with lots of garlic. When the slice comes out the oven it's piping hot. I'm intrigued to order an entire pizza next time. The service on the other hand could use some improvement. This is more of a greasy spoon dingy type of place to grab a quick slice or takeout. Thwir garlic dipping sauce is amazing too for all your garlic lovers. You'll need some excel polar ice or some breath mints afterwards."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning. Reported it to the Dine Safe, they sent an inspector and the establishment was in fact outside of sanitation regulations. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"this was the single worst slice of pizza i have ever had. the place is FILTHY and really expensive. just go to panago on bay street!"}
{"text":"The pizza slices that they have available generally look like they've been sitting there for many hours.

Eating one doesn't change that impression.

After a couple of attempts to get a good slice of pizza from here, this is now the pizza place of last resort.  They need to clean the place up and put some fresh pizza in the window."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago with some friends for a late night snack.  We had a white pie and a deluxe pie.  Although the pizzas were alright, nothing spectacular - they are more of the thick crust variety - I was absolutely grossed out when I saw rats running around the back of the store.  I kid you not, even though the place was busy it was as though the rats were not afraid of humans, literally having a ball with the sacks of flour in the back room.  I used to order from Amato's a lot, but since that incident and the news story about unpaid wages I have not been back."}
{"text":"This is where our local Amato Pizza delivery comes from, and that is what this review is based on.

This pizza is miles above the other available options for pizza delivery in our area (Diamond Pizza, Pizza Pizza, Domino's, Amaro, 241, Free Topping PIzza, etc.).

You can just taste that the dough and ingredients are higher quality. I just wish it was more customizable, more well done on a regular basis, and that it arrived hotter! Insulated bags, anybody?

My faves:

1. \"Potato Alla Cream\" - the white pizza: cream, olive oil, onions, potatoes, rosemary, mozzarella & parmesan

2. \"Margherita\" - tomato sauce, basil, oregano & double mozzarella

3. \"Barese\" - tomato sauce, mushroom, onion, red peppers, garlic &mozzarella

BONUS: Mr. Rosie S.'s fave: 

4. \"Carnivore\" - tomato sauce, pepperoni, ground beef, bacon, mushrooms, mozzarella.

Both Mr. Rosie S. and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Bruschetta in the summer (not so good in the winter)! Loose DIY-style! Tomato, garlic, fresh herbs & extra virgin olive oil are sent separately, then you top your own garlic focaccia yourself! Yumyumyum!"}

The cashier/cook speaks fast with a thick accent so it's a little bit of a challenge in communication but she's very pleasant and helpful. 

The pizzas are definitely a solid pick. I ordered a medium, regular crust (you have a choice between thin, regular and thick) #36 Calabrese with tomato sauce, Gorgonzola cheese, roasted red peppers, hot sopressata (similar to salami) and mozzarella. I added chicken for additional $1.50 (you can also build your own pizza). There are two booths that you can wait for your order or dine in. I noticed that they have a decent selection of drinks - San Pellegrino Sparkling Fruit Beverages, Brio Italian Soda, Arizona Green Tea with honey and ginseng, Red Bull and even Ensure Plus (for those who need a nutritional boost). I wish I had brought my phone to take more pictures and to use their free wifi. Pizza didn't take long since I was the only customer.

I decided to wait till I got home before I tried the pizza (just a few blocks away), I wanted take a picture first. It seemed like a small size pizza which was ok since it was only for me and my hubby. The pizza was a little greasy (from the meats and two kinds of cheeses I'm sure) which I didn't mind and fixed with minimal blotting from a paper towel. The toppings were delicious with just a touch of heat, a little bit of a crunch from the red bell peppers and the cheeses were melted nicely giving a good stretch when you pull the slices apart. There was nothing special to the crust until you get to the edge where because of  the oils and a few errant pieces of grated cheese make it crispy and oh so satisfyingly good to chew on. 

There are many items that are available that are not listed on their online or printed menu like burgers, fried rice, curry with rice, french fries, and poutine. Oh and they do sell massive \"slices\" (1/4 of a Jumbo sized pizza) for around $4 each, a nice way to try different pizzas at once. I'm sure I will add a star once I find more items off the menu that I like. I will definitely be back to try their panzerotti (think calzone except fried), 2 for 1 chicken wings, and bruschetta. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"base this review solely on the experience of eating inside the restaurant itself.  or perhaps takeout place would be more appropriate.  there are tables and chairs, but the guy warming up your pizza will not bring it over to the table or ask you how your meal is.

its really funny, because this location is no more than two years old if that, and it looks like its been open for about twenty. with random paintings (surely picked up for a buck or two at the local garage sale - they do have some charm mind you.) hung haphazardly along the cheerless coloured walls, the cheap equally hapless tables and chairs, and top-of-the-processed line of condiments for your slice residing on a table at the back it feels purely functional.

i dont even know if i should expect any different, hoping for something more fresh from a pizza place.  i always find it disheartening to know im going to be paying for something that at first glance looks like a rubber reproduction of its original tasty self.   

the pizza was slightly thin; i prefer less dough to more, so that was in its favour.  the ingredients on mine were sopressata, blue cheese and mushrooms i think - not a bad combo.  when i walked in, there was one slice labeled, which some of you more herbivorous eaters out there would be pleased to know was, of course, the vegetarian slice.  (here here, you guys deserve the cheering section when you can get it.)

another funny thing is visiting their website where you get a black and white photo of Master Chef Gino Amato!  this looks like it was taken during prohibition on the streets of new york (probably here though) as gino stands, suspect, the butt of a cigarette in his left hand and leaning atop a sandwich-type board that looks more like a converted bedpost.  on it is advertised a nice plate of (im sure) homemade tiramisu, and although they currently offer this as a dessert on their menu, i would venture to say that its current incarnation is a far cry from the mastery that gino claims to have used in creating it way back when.

to their credit though they have quite a selection of ingredients, pastas, salads and a couple of traditional entrees like veal parmagiana. to be fair, the best way to judge this place is by ordering a pizza fresh to take home or get delivered so perhaps one day therell be a reworking of this review.  ive done this before, remember not being floored by it then, but that was a long time ago so i dont feel just in commenting about it either way."}
{"text":"Lots of great looking, exotic slices. Roughly priced the same as Pizza Pizza Puke Puke. Adequate amount of seating. Alas the great toppings and excellent crust are ultimately scuttled by the lack of a good zesty tomato sauce.

Why can't anyone get pizza right in Toronto? Why?"}
{"text":"For $5, you get a quarter of a regular pizza and a drink... not bad!

Came here on a Saturday afternoon since my uncle decided to show relatives around the city.  Apparently he used to frequent this pizza joint when he was in university (I go to the same school as well, but never really ventured out this far).

I got a slice of the Bianca pizza and the rest of the relatives got an assortment of slices.  The Bianca is just eggplant, artichoke, and cheese.  I actually couldn't finish this quarter of a pizza (it was cut in half after heating).  It was only a few hours later that I realized I was really thirsty... guess they use a lot of salt in the pizzas....

Overall, the pizza is fine.  Great value for the price.  Just make sure to get a drink.

The owner, on the other hand, was very grumpy and looked very disinterested in taking our orders.  I'm not sure if it's because it was an extremely hot day, or maybe that's just his normal disposition (based on the other reviews).

The decor could really use a lot of work.  All the furniture is dated, and the booths inside the shop have seen better days.  The bathroom, oh man, the bathroom... so much graffiti on the walls and just very minimal cleaning.

I think this pizza joint has seen better days.... it could do with a renovation."}
{"text":"I love pizza.  My family has always said I should marry a pizzaman because well...I love pizza.

I do not love Amato.

There was too much sauce and it was salty

Most of the bacon was all fat

not much of a crust, you know the part of the crust where some people like to dip it in sauce?  Yeah, that crust wasn't that different from the crust under the pizza.

I got pizza here because Fresca was closed.

The pizza here reminded me of a bad pizza experience at King Slice, where there was equally bad pizza."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment, paid $40 for two pizzas, ate one slice and through everything out.  It honestly tasted worse then a 7 dollar Delissio from shoppers, which I wish I had instead.

Sauce tastes like it comes from a grocery store shelf, crust have no texture or character, cheese was budget.  I am asking just eat for a refund.  I never leave reviews, this spot was just so bad I have to earn everyone."}
{"text":"Favourite pizza place. 3 stars because they sometimes screw up the order but I look past it if they bring the garlic sauce. The garlic sauce makes the pizza taste 10x better. I cant remember which location does it better - Yonge or College, but I've tried ordering from other locations and it was the worst decision I've ever made. My friends and I always get the Capri. They confused it with Caprese once and it wasnt the same, although they sound similar... Tried the meat lovers and vegetarian and they both were crap, even with the garlic sauce. Stick to the Capri, and ask for at least 4 garlic sauces. It will make your Friday night."}
{"text":"I have traveled across the United States looking for the best pizza man can make.  I have had pizza at two place in Canada and this is the second one and my opinion this is worse than frozen pizza you buy at the supermarket and cook yourself.  

I had a really bad feeling when I called in to place my delivery order and the person tried to get me to order a medium pizza ($17.00) instead of a small ($13.28).  The size of the pizza is good and the price was a bit high for the poor quality of the food.  The food was 100% tasteless."}
{"text":"I have to say, I don't often eat in here --- the tables etc do look a bit tired.  I suspect this location does get a lot of business from take out or delivery.

We have always enjoyed their pizza slices - my husband usually gets something with pepperoni and I love their pesto slice with potato, garlic and onion.  I know it sounds a bit different, but if you ever had it -- well it's great!

We normally ask for the slice to be heated a little longer and then enjoy with limonata or brio.

Good crust - great flavor -- pretty consistent!"}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza ever. The only thing I can say good was it was hot/ tasted bad, and wings were not tasty and scary to look at. Came to 32 dollars and delivery guy thought his .6 miles warranted a 8 $ tip, no. I hope this place goes under so a new mediocre  place can open. 

Feel free to contact me."}
{"text":"The patate alla crema slice calls to me every time I pass by and I can never resist. Very big slices for cheap, and excellent blends of flavors. I love it!"}
{"text":"Hungry and half lost, we wandered in the front door of this pizza spot after a few drinks at some bars down the street.  There was a nice older Asian dude behind the counter who helped heat up our pizzas. For some reason I really needed a certain slice but was bummed it didn't have mushrooms on it...so dude added mushrooms!  What a guy!!

A weird thing happened tho.. as we sat in the booth and ate, I couldn't help but notice this old guy in the back of the restaurant. He was like the owner or something.  He kept going back and forth from watching his old school tube TV to clicking around on his dusty IBM desktop computer.  It was like looking through a time travelling window back to the early 90's... weird.

Anyways, the pizzas were pretty good. Just seems like this place gets no love for the delivery service.  But if I ever end up back in the area, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I'lll eat pizzaoioiolo If it's the closest thing and I'm lazy as it's pretty decent. But I would take Amato's carnavore over pizzaoioiolo's gianni-ola any day of the week.

This is a good late night eat that I generally find hard to resist when it's on my way home. which is very often. I also just like the old italian guys who work there. They sit too close to the television. They are funny. I don't know why."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Canada I've had so far..and I am sorry to say, but this country is not known for good pizza. My plain slice used a very good kind of tomato sauce with leaves of basil for extra taste. Very good. Did not taste like other plastic pizza I have had. I will try to be back."}
{"text":"Placed an order online. Got a call from an employee claiming the transaction didn't go through. They asked for my credit card number again. It got stolen. I had to cancel my credit card and claim 3 transactions."}
{"text":"This place is not to be eaten at. The Pizza is so GREASYYY and undercooked. They obviously don't no how to cut lettuce cause the salad is huge like the pieces of lettuce in it, the cheese they put on the salad tasted like it's gone bad. Just the food is bland, greasy and very unsatisfying. It's the type of place you would go if you where in middle school for lunch on Fridays ,horrible. BE PREPARED TO BE DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Toronto (or almost anywhere). The place is a bit low-end street casual, but the pizza recipes are by far the best I've ever had. I'm a picky eater, and was introduced to this place by a friend long ago; it wasn't the type of place I'd normally walk into. Normally there will only be one thing I really love at any one place, but I've had a variety here now and every one is very unique and amazing. I've had pizza created by top chefs before, and this place beats them all by far. Unlike most places that offer what tastes like the same pizza with different toppings, each pizza here is a different taste creation (so try their recipes rather than changing or making your own). I've only eaten the vegetarian pizza here (and there is an unusually large selection of those) but based on the variety I've already tried, and the unexpected uniqueness and taste combinations that are a night-and-day difference from other pizza places, I'd risk suggesting those into meat will not be disappointed either. I can say that I've very often driven 45 min (one way) just for pizza here (and I take a full one back with me as well). Joe is definitely a master at making pizza; though I've occasionally been a bit disappointed by some of the other workers not making them quite the same way as Joe does. This place made me think of pizza in a whole new way; there's no comparison to the dough disks with stuff piled on top from the chain places."}
{"text":"Looked for a decent tasting pizza place around my area (Little Portugal). I have lived here since December 2014, however recently started a new position in my field of employment.

I went here for a quick slice of pizza at lunch and have recently returned for another. Pizza is tasty and considering it was a reheated slice, I would imagine the freshly bought pies are ever tastier!

Also, delivery is free which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I don't quite get the very negative comments about here. Thus, I think they are mostly related to the owners being rude or not smiling. And I get that too, Mediterranean background might have a role here. Anyway, I ordered Pollo Basilico which was full oy mushroom and other ingredients and it was a decent pizza. Paying $4 for a quarter of a medium to large pizza is financially justifiable to me. 

There are 8 tables inside and some more outside too. The restaurant and decoration definitely need renovation. Uncared furniture is a turn off for such a place. 

They have an offer going like: one regular pizza + drink = $4.99 tax incl.

The pizzas are probably made in the morning or occasionally when needed, they are served after reheating, but still are crispy and have thin base. So you are not stuffing yourself with useless dough. 

It's a decent place I would say. Definitely a 3 stars rating."}
{"text":"AMAZING pizza. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. one of the worst. I had someone hang up on me as I ordered, I called back only to have \"15 minutes\" shouted in my ear. 1.5 hours later, a pizza *almost* worthy of the wait showed up. Never ever ask for delivery or anything you have to interact with the employees for."}
{"text":"A much better option that nearby Big Slice.

I tried Amato Pizza yesterday past 12am.  The pizza is quality, for a grab & eat pizza joint.  I really liked their veggie pizza.  Their white potato pizza was good too.  They only sell double slices here for about $4.50.  Their buffalo hot sauce makes for a nice add on to the pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Terrible, terrible, service! I ordered a pizza with their convenient online order for a birthday dinner. I received an order confirmation at 6:44 pm, by 8:00 nothing, even though I was promised deliver by 7:40. When I called, no one knew what I was talking about and they were less than helpful. I suggested that maybe there was a problem with their online order service, the guy just said \"yeah, maybe\". I suggested he get rid of the online service from the website if it did not work. He said \"okay\". If I didn't know any better I'd say the guy had no idea what was talking about.  Like I said terrible service. And the pizza looked like it would be so good! The owners need to get a clue."}
{"text":"Just got wings and pizza which somehow came to $60. The food took a long time to come and the pizza was ice cold. The hot sauce was spilled all over the wings because the lid wasn't closed properly so my friend couldn't eat any (we asked for it on the side). 
I called to explain all of this and was berated by the rude onsite manager. For $60 never again!"}
{"text":"I'd call Amato's a last resort but it's not even that. I think I'd rather go hungry, or at least walk down to Pizza Pizza or Big Slice.

Amato's pizza is just not tasty. The last slice I remember having here was sometime in my first year of university, and it was spinach and feta...which is kinda hard to screw up. Yet the spinach was dry and crusty, the feta was old and cold, and the pizza was hard as a rock.

The food tastes awful and no one cares to fix it. There are so many good pizza places in this city, and even on Yonge street. Go to them instead, hopefully Amato's will shut down and free up the space for a better restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before coming here.

I walked in because I found the smell alluring, but the pizza I discovered there was too expensive and not up to par. While the staff was nice and accomodating, the place was extremely dirty, stuffy (even with the door wide open), and disorganized.

Not going back there again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Ok! I am very surprised with all of the bad reviews on here. I get the pesto with chicken pizza. It is divine. I used to walk by this place not giving it a chance for years. Recently tried it and now I'm hooked. Interior and service needs improvement but the pizza is awesome!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. Terrible customer service , they don't care about the customer. I waited 2 1/2 hrs for my pizza and they wanted to still charge me. The driver had the audacity to flip me off.  Bad just really bad!! I. Thought I was getting punk'd. It was that bad, unreal!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from there tonight. We live about 10 minutes from the location but they still offered delivery to our area no hesitation. first they took over an hour to deliver and when the pizza came it was cold and the box was wet. We called to complain and the guy who answered the phone was incredibly rude. Yelled at me on the phone and said that the only reason I was calling was because I wanted a free pizza. After I told him he was being rude he just told me I was wrong. After about 5 minutes of this I decided the conversation was going nowhere and politely ended our conversation. Won't be ordering from them ever again. Giving them one star ONLY because to write the review they require at least one star."}
{"text":"My friend left her purse in the store and we went back to ask if he saw it.
He was incredibly rude so we just looked around. After, he started getting really really in our face. Cursing us out and getting in my friends face. He was right in her face and all she wanted was her purse with all her identification, money and cards. He was so close to her he looked like he was ready to hit her. She didn't back down and I tried to calm it down. 
That's when he got in my face and both of us still didn't swing at him or even want to fight. I was getting angry that this creature was calling me out and getting right in my face. 
We just wanted her purse that had all her belongings in. That's all. Nothing else. We threatened to call the cops if he went in our face again when we werent doing anything. 
He at that moment pulled the benches back and there was her purse. All we wanted. He kept screaming at us like we actually did something wrong. Calling us names and accusing us of everything. He wouldn't calm down. Just kept screaming. So I screamed at him till he shut up. 

Pizza was garbage. I'm not using curse words on here to describe it so I'll just use garbage. 
I wish I could give it lower than a star. I give this garbage place a nothing. 
Dude is garbage. Customer service is garbage. 
Never going back and telling everyone as a warning how rude and horrible this place is."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I arrived late at night when many places were closed, and the hotel I was staying at recommended this place. Honestly did they even try the food here before recommending it? 

I ordered a delivery for a chicken parmigiana plate with a side of tiramasu. The chicken was disgusting, it smelled foul and tasted like rubber. It was so unpalatable that I couldn't finish eating it and threw it out. I then went on to the tiramasu - it was frozen. Yeah. I actually thought for a minute that it might be tiramasu cheesecake or tiramasu ice cream cake. No, it was tiramasu that was taken out of the freezer and somehow even after the 30-45minute transit to my hotel, it was still frozen. Other than this, it was fine to eat.

Incredibly disappointing experience. I was starving when I ordered but ended up throwing out the meal because it was so bad. And I never throw out food. I chose to go to bed hungry instead of consuming whatever heap this was."}
