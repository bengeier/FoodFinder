{"text":"Horrible! Save your money and time and do not eat here! A disgusting smell of burned arrived when our food did! Ugh deserves zero stars!"}
{"text":"$25 for all you can eat, not too bad unless you have a small appetite.  Easy to get parking and it was not busy on a Saturday night.  You only get beef and shrimp, hoping for pork and chicken as well.  Also they provide butter to grease the grill and I hate butter.  Use oil or be non stick (which it was, sort of).  It's not terribly fancy, but functional.  Service was good, no issues.  I'd go back is there was more variety on the all you can eat"}
{"text":"The absolute WORST service I have ever had in my entire life.  They did not give me the proper order on delivery, I called in for the correct order, he told me I was a liar and that I had the right order.  Then told me hang on a second, and had me wait on hold and then hung up in my ear.  This was supposedly the owner of the establishment.  Will never ever order from here, it is also 2-3 dollars more expensive on every dish at least than most restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the Beef Satay Soup number 16.  Reasonable price but was just OK.  I detect an oxo cube finish.  Don't go for the decor, and don't travel along way for the food, but the waitress is very pleasant.  Service was fast, although apparently being Caucasian helps.  Didn't see any evidence of that, personally. I think there are better spots close by."}
{"text":"Went here to try the Bahn Mi Vietnamese subway Sate Beef. Bread was fresh, beef was very tender and tasty, and the best part was the price for less than $5. I'd give the bahn mi 5 stars, but the server that doesn't even smile and lacked warmth took one star from my review. Also, I didnt like the fact that she was walking around with her pants so low on her hips I got a glimpse of a plumber's butt. But I wouldn't mind coming back for their Bahn Mi, maybe takeout would be a better option."}
{"text":"I don't even know if I should be giving this restaurant any stars.  From my first impression I can honestly say I don't ever want to come back.  Most likely the owner is the server.  We were ignored from the get go. He got this old cauccasian couple menus first even though they came in after us.  They got their tea first.  We waited quite a while for our tea. Food takes a looong time for a Vietnamese place.  The usual wait is no longer than 10 minutes for soup dishes...so dont know what's up with that.  Guy takes our order quickly and rushes us and the grabs the menus as though we're being a hassle for him.  Another table comes in after us and he greets them with a warm friendly greeting and showed them the daily special menu. WTH?? And they got their tea ASAP!! 

So the food comes out and I ask for a small bowl for my baby and his response, \"K.\"  Whatever!! So not coming back!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place the other day, it is a spacious restaurant with approximately 50 tables in which two were being used.

The waitress/hostess was extremely pleasant/friendly, handed my menu right away and took my drink order and food order.  I had time to look at the layout of the land, well that really bad mint paint interior has to go, it's been around for years, and every table had a two stickers with numbers written in felt pen some kind of peeling away.  Other than that your typical Vietnamese restaurant. 
 
Just as I immersed myself on more thoughts of the place, the waitress brought me a complimentary eggroll to celebrate their anniversary. What anniversary I asked but she whisked away before she could answer.

Minutes later my meal and my Vit coffee came, I ordered the lemon beef and eggroll on noodles.  It wasn't spectacular, and the shredded greens look pale green.  It was just all right, the beef was pretty tasty and it was filling but it wasn't something to write home about.  My coffee was okay too...

What I did notice from this place more than anything was the kind and warm service from the waitress. Would I come back, no... There are far too many Vietnamese restaurants in the city that have nicer presentation, decor and tastier food. Perhaps she should apply there?"}
