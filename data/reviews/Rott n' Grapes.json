{"text":"Went there tonight for the happy hour, excited because it was nearby and looking for another cool wine bar. Asked a number of times about the happy hour and they didn't seem too clear. I tried to confirm a number of times that I wanted happy hour price and looked at the flyer posted on the wall that said five dollar wine until eight. Asked again for happy hour and ordered a drink. When we got our bill each of our glasses were $11 and not five dollars. They said they could take one dollar off each class. That is ridiculous!  I won't be back, bummer. We were talking about having events there with the new area they were opening but I think I will pass."}
{"text":"Great new little place in midtown. Small but cozy, with some nice outdoor seating too. An impressive wine/beer list too. It would be cool if they had some draft beers too, but I appreciate the extensive bottle selection. Very friendly service as well. They also have a pretty killer happy hour, goes till 8pm!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Amazing wine and beer lists, and the best service. The new patio is the perfect addition and HEATED!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastically cute and unique wine  ( and beer) bar.  It just officially opened last night.  The name is from the owners love of Rottweilers and wine!   I tried a few wines and the owner ( Patti) picked great options as I told her my taste preference.  It is not a snob bar...it's a FUN bar!  They even put thought into having phone charger outlets at the bar.  ( Ladies...  Purse hooks!)  Anyway, wanted to yelp this because I LOVE small businesses and wine... And dogs too  so I was excited to finally see it open!  It's located at the Landmark Towers off Central.  Crowded or chill ...give it a try and I bet you will enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The people serving are extremely friendly and they have a wide variety of wine and beer to choose from. 65+ wines and 45+ beers. Great neighborhood bar! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such a great find!!! Great selection of wine and beer, with small bites AND live music. Owners and staff are super friendly & fun atmosphere! We will definitely be back...New fave place!"}
{"text":"Hello miss patty, this is Pearl, i just wanted to update you on how well your business cards are going. i pass them out as i Uber. im amazed at how many people like to drink wine i am outvof my second batch, need some more."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. Keith and Patti were welcoming and knowledgeable. They made us feel welcome and treated us as a regular. The wine and beer selection is off the charts. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"May not have an extensive menu but the wine they offer is great! Very good variety at good price! Happy hour til 8 pm! Makes you not have to rush for good prices! Plus they are business people living their passion so give them  a shot! Great conversation, games, wine, snacks!"}
{"text":"Amazing wine selection and service! I told the  bartender Jason what types of wines I preferred. Needless to say, he had some great wine suggestions. I will definitely be returning to this little gem in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I simply cannot say enough about the great customer service provided by owners Keith and Patty, and the rest of the crew at Rott 'n Grapes! I was planning a small meetup with colleagues in town for a conference and contacted 4 craft beer places to inquire about their space and ability to provide something unique for us that isn't normally on their menu. Of the 4 venues I contacted, 3 of them either didn't respond or said, \"sorry, we don't really do that\". Keith and Patty responded quickly and enthusiastically, and started looking into ways to make our meetup great. As the RSVP list grew and grew, in part due to Keith and Patty's willingness to work with us, they managed to provide us with *everything* we had requested. I asked for more than I had any reason to expect and they did it all!

The service the night of the meetup was excellent, and the whole crew kept up great service for our large incursion for 3 solid hours. The interior is small, but the outdoor patio was able to accommodate our large group, and we were kept cool by the evaporative cooler. I loved that the bar also opened up directly onto the patio, so we didn't have to squeeze inside to place our orders. Everything was perfect the entire night. I highly recommend Rott 'n Grapes for their stellar customer service and selection."}
{"text":"A really small, but fun and intimate bar. It's really, really small. Don't let that deter you, however. This is an excellent cozy date spot. They have a wide variety of beer and wine. I discovered a really excellent New England IPA her Called Boom! Dynamite! I wandered in here with a date and played Connect Four and a movie trivia card game. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"One of our favorite new local bars. We love taking our dogs for a walk with a stop over on the way home for a beer or cider. Their pup friendly patio is awesome (the puppies love visiting too!). The staff is always friendly with good suggestions for drinks. Also, I'm happy they now have beer on tap! Great selections and happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place. 75+ at least different wines by the glass. They will gladly let taste till you hit one you like. Very knowledgeable. Great vibe. Fantastic beer list as well and great apps to go with the wine. This is my secret back street hideout!"}
{"text":"Cute little place to grab some wine or craft beer. Cozy as hell and staff is pretty friendly! Would definitely be a great date spot! Only gave it 4 stars because it can definitely be a little overpriced."}
{"text":"The selection of wine and beer is only exceeded by the hospitality and service. Patty and Kieth are extremely welcoming. They know their beers and wines inside out. A very friendly and welcoming place. I'd give them another 5 stars if Yelp would allow that!"}
{"text":"This place is too cute for words. A quaint little bar neighboring the Landmark. The owners, Keith and Patti are warm and welcoming. Their passion for rescuing pets is enduring. Stop into this cute beer and wine bar and say hello. Play a round of connect four too. They have mini games for sitting at the bar and life-size games for patio fun. I'm definitely giving them my business again and again."}
{"text":"Great wine/beer list. Friendly staff. The atmosphere is perfect. Small bar with indoor seating and a nice patio area. Very comfortable. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to check out this place on a Monday night and the second we saw it, we fell in love! The atmosphere was so welcoming and the owners were all very personal with their customers along with the bartender. There is a large variety of fantastic craft beers and tasty wines. There is a wonderful social atmosphere and you can play board games as well which is awesome! I almost didn't want to write this review because I want this place all to myself, but this bar is too good of a place to not tell you all about it. Definitely go check it out, they will make you feel apart of the lie family!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this new addition to the neighborhood! 

The prices are awesome and the staff was very knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Awesome vibe and super friendly people.  Stellar wine and beer list. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for wine and beer lovers. They have something for everyone! And dog friendly as well. A must stop if you love hole in the wall places. Wait staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance! Cute little Spot! Variety beer and wine selection. Staff was very friendly! Nice place for a date or simply to have a game of jumbling tower with your best friend like I did."}
{"text":"Really helpful bartender who helped me navigate their menu. Dog friendly patio area with plenty of dog enthusiasts! What really sold me was the service at this place. The bartender went above and beyond to ensure I had a good experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great new wine/bar place.. Manny and Patty were awesome. Really knowledgeable about the wines. Music was a plus... can't wait to come back and bring friends"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one for writing reviews but mostly just reading other ones already there but I wanted to make sure I reviewed this place because it was so fantastic. Cute and intimate spot with old school games like connect four, amazing wine and beer list which was great for both me and my boyfriend, prices were actually reasonable for the quality of product and the owners/bartender were so personable and knowledgeable. We came to celebrate my first half marathon and found a place that is easily a new favorite to relax with some great wine and company in the valley. Will definitely be making this a regular go to spot."}
{"text":"Flat out loved this neighborhood wine and beer spot. Quaint cozy and inviting. It felt like we walked into a friends party. The bartenders had a smile and shared some of their favorite brews. We missed the live music but heard it was amazing. We had several types of beers like the Schilling Ascender ginger, Maui coconut porter and the Ginger lemon  rattler. Not sure if I spelled them right but neither disappointed. Cool music selection. Looking forward to making this our spot a few times a month. Loving the Rotty pics since we had one named Apollo (RIP). Haven't tried the light bites yet but I'm sure they won't disappoint. So you there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love everything about this place!  Service..wines..beers..prices..food..all great!  Can't wait until the other location opens up!"}
{"text":"Tiny, cozy space and huge beverage selection. I loved the overall atmosphere! The drink list was super impressive, and I loved the cider options! Reasonably priced. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Rad rad rad... 

Love this place and the patrons are great.  Always happy to move over and make room at the bar if you need a spot.  The owners are so affable, you can tell they are passionate about their place!  

They have a HUUGE selection so bring your glasses if you need them to read small font. However, they are happy to help you find what you are looking for so there really isn't a need to read the menu.  Service is on point and the crowd and ambiance makes it an easy choice every time.

Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Brittneee she does dishes so well and rott n grapes is the best
Ever in the land this review is hard to write cuz i haven't had enough to drink good thing I'm at a bar.
The End"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to chill and hang out. Great wine and beer selection and the owners are very nice and friendly. And now they have someone playing a guitar and singing on certain days. They also have a cute lounge across from the bar."}
{"text":"My wife surprised me with my 30th birthday party here. The bartenders were super friendly and the food was great! Highly recommmend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Threw a 30th birthday and the owner checked up on us the entire night. Great drinks, great staff, and great location. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So happy we checked this little place out! The service was awesome, the beers were good and the prices were reasonable.  

During this awesome time of year in Phoenix, going to bars that have an indoor/outdoor atmosphere is the best! There is seating for about 8 people inside the main bar area and then across the way they have a lounge with a tv. Outside they have a few benches and 4-5 seats at the bar. 

Dogs are welcomed and they have treats. 

I'm a sour beer drinker and was happily surprised that they had a few options for me. The other super cool aspect was that the sours were less expensive here than anywhere else I've been. 

Just a heads up, the location is a little tricky to find. It is between the Landmark and Yama Sushi House. 

We will definitely be back! Check it out when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Very friendly bartender who gave my pup lots of attention, great beer and wine list, awesome happy hour deal, and dog friendly. I enjoyed the feel/ambiance of this place and that it was aways back from the road. Could probably stand to have a little bit more patio furniture, but I'm glad to have found this local watering hole"}
{"text":"Cool little place, but it takes a while before you order and pay and get your wine. Also, this isn't like a bar where $6 means $6, tax is annoyingly added. I was also suckered into paying $5 for some weird licorice-like shot that tasted bad. The menu online is clear cut and seemingly sorted by price but in-person it is all over the place and confusing. Happy hour is great and goes until 8pm. -1 star for having gender-oriented discounts. This is not a place to stop and get one drink, it's a place to get multiple and hang out at the bar or patio with your friend/partner so you can run a tab and chat. Good for a date, not a group since there is very limited seating."}
{"text":"Cool off-the beaten path bar that serves bottles of beer and wine only. We went to have lunch at Yama and were walking back to the car and couldn't pass by this \"alley bar\". We came at the right time because it was happy hour, so beers were cheap ($3-$4). They have a ton of craft beers to choose from including local stuff. The place is quite small, but they said they were planning on installing a patio which could help with that. Definitely a good place to kickback and have a few cheap craft beers."}
{"text":"Rott n' Grapes has become one of my new favorite places. You like red wine? White wine? Bubbles? Pink wine? They have it all. But wait, there's more!

They have craft beer! And lots of it! Everything from stouts to ciders. 

Head on in to the cozy and intimate space at Rott n' Grapes! Happy hour is until 8:00pm everyday!"}
{"text":"Here tonight for a friend's 30th and the staff has been absolutely lovely and attentive and they have a great entertaining space!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night after hearing about this new place on Yelp!  It is a tiny spot, but cozy and lively atmosphere.  The beer and wine list are super extensive and they offer happy hour every day until 8pm - amazing!  I opted for the Ciderboys Strawberry cider and loved it - so delicious!  I can't wait to go back and try the Schilling Rhubarb Pear cider...we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Small hip spot tucked away downtown. They have an endless list wine, champagne, craft beers and little bites. My cab was delish. I can't wait to go back and try as many wines and specialty beer as possible."}
{"text":"Always have a great time here! Great selection and Keith and Patty are the best hosts.  From the colorful chalkboard filled with wine and craft beer options to the hand soap in the bathroom everything here is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! So many quality options for wines and beer to choose from. Our bartender Marissa made us feel welcome the second we walked in and was really knowledgeable with all the drink options they had. Will absolutely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Super cozy and cute. They have a great beer and wine selection and bartenders are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Neat little spot on Central, but it is small. Great selection of craft beer and reasonably priced, if you get a can or a bottle. Do not order a draft beer! They charge $9 for a pint of nothing special, and it is not included in happy hour pricing. My fault for not paying close enough attention I guess. When I asked the bartender about it,  he tried to convince me that spillage forced them to charge more. Ha ha. Weak. If you really don't want to sell draft beer, take out your 4 taps. $9 for an average craft beer draught, particularly at happy hour is ludicrous."}
{"text":"Best wine and beer bar in Phoenix. Service was outstanding. The selection was perfection. I will definitely be back soon. The owners are the nicest people ever. My bartender Mike was on point."}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful new neighborhood bar. They have happy hour until 8pm everyday--need I say more!?!?!

If you've ever been to the Wining Pig or The Pig's Meow, Rott n' Grapes has a similar small and trendy neighborhood bar feel. However, Rott n' Grapes is much better. It opens up to a cute patio area which allows the small space to feel cozy without being claustrophobic. 

They have a large wine, beer and cider selection. And the bar tenders were really helpful when it came to making suggestions.

A couple of months ago, the owners had a wine tasting at my apartment complex. They did a great job making the event fun and informative."}
{"text":"Awesome service and very wide selection of wine and beer at good prices. Happy hour is every day of the week until 8PM. The bartenders are very friendly. I highly recommend this place on a weekday or weekend night! If you have a dog, they also have a patio space"}
{"text":"Hubby and I headed over here on a Friday after I got off work. I really just wanted to chill with a glass of wine and get a bite to eat. I yelped and googled because we thought we'd try something new. I checked the website and saw $5 glasses of wine and $3 craft beers. Until 8pm? Done!

It's a cute little place, no doubt! The owner was super nice and the atmosphere was good and people were friendly. This place just confuses me though. I thought the happy hour advertised on the website was WAY misleading. I totally understand you have 80+ wines but when less than 10% of those are actually the advertised happy hour price, I feel a little duped. The beers were a very good deal for craft beers on happy hour which is why there's three stars and not two. The tapas looked good but also seemed a bit overpriced for what you got. 

I can't help but feel they have over extended themselves and the prices reflect that. 80+ wines is a lot to manage by the glass. I am wondering how much wine the end up dumping due to spoilage. If I order a glass and they open the bottle, they have to hope I drink a couple glasses or three other people come in the next few days and happen to pick that wine out of the 80 choices. The bar fits a small amount of people so I can't see that as being very likely. It also makes me question how fresh the wine is when I get the last glass.

Comparing to other wine bars, I am happier with a pared down wine list of good stuff with a couple of familiar wineries thrown in. I can take a risk on a new wine the bartender recommends on happy hour at $6. At $10 on happy hour, not so much."}
{"text":"Love this place! My friend and I have made this our Sunday meet up spot for beer and wine. Jason is almost always our bartender and is absolutely amazing. He remembers what we like and has suggestions whenever we come in, knowing what we've tried before and what new things we'd like. I guess we come too often! He's friendly, knowledgeable, and always makes our visit a good time. Wonderful, ever-changing selection of wines and beers and great happy hour specials. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We absolutely adore this place!! 
It's very inviting and chic at the same time. 
I learn something new about different wines but I absolutely love the what I call the conversation TV game lounge, adjacent just feet from their main patio. This is a little gem and we can't wait to see what they do with the new location."}
{"text":"Cool and quaint. Limited seating but a wide array of offerings. Just enough food to relieve the palate and form some great pairings.

Cool and hip offerings of bottle beers as well as some local upscale draught. Two TV'S will get the sports fan their fix. Pretty hipster with live music on Thursdays starting at 7pm.

{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome! From the owners Keith & Patti & their 2 canine kids who are Rottweilers, hence the name Rott N Grapes, to the amazing bartenders Amy & Sam who serve a huge variety of wines and craft beers... it's a cozy microbar with indoor & outdoor seating hidden in a mid century high rise called Landmark Towers located  on Central Ave south of Camelback...another plus is its within walking distance of the light rail station that also has bike rentals so no driving required! They serve a few delicious hors d'oeuvres that compliment the wine & beer served and if you're in the mood for sushi, you can have it delivered from Yama sushi located next door! if you like to socialize this place is for you! I would describe it as a speakeasy that serves alcohol legally....if you've not discovered this place yet, you need to... amazing happy hour from 3 to 8... CHECK IT OUT!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super friendly service from the owner and the wine list is amazing! They have draft beers as well as a menu with some appetizers, salads, and sandwiches. It is a small place though so keep that in mind. They have great happy hour deals on wine too. I think my wife and I have found ourselves a new wine bar that we will be frequenting quite often!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem! Michael took care of us and he was so accommodating! Such a fantastic selection of wines and love the story behind the owners and Rottweilers :) we will be coming back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place, amazing for such a little bar, great concept. Definitely a cozy spot with great wine selection and CHARCUTERIE BOARD to die for."}
{"text":"Fun spot to grab wine and beer! They have a huge selection of beers and wine so always something new to try. Staff knows their stuff also so if ur having a hard time deciding they can make recommendations."}
{"text":"Started coming here every Sunday as of three weeks ago  and due to the friendly staff and atmosphere, I've brought and recommended a good amount of my co workers to try this place out. Never disappoints! Affordable prices with great service and food. Great section of craft beers and wines... Highly recommended! The owners and bartenders are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very cool small place. Huge beer and wine menu. We sat in the bar but want to check out the \"lounge\" too."}
{"text":"What a great place for wine and beer and games and an amazing atmosphere! We sat outside on the patio in June and they turned on the fans and the portable AC and it was wonderful. They have awesome happy hour and yummy champagne. They are also opening a lounge which we can't wait for! Will definitely come back! The live music was lovely!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this cute place. Second time I have been here with a group. Patty G is the owner. So helpful and sweet. Manny was our bartender tonight. Met a distributor from TBK Beverage Company and checked out their wine, Sexual Chocolate. Cute name and great wine. Local.

Everyone is so friendly here. Definitely a place well worth hanging for a few hours after a hard day at the office."}
{"text":"This is officially my new favorite place in Phoenix! The selection of wine and beer is amazing, if you can't find something you like then it doesn't exist. The owners are incredibly nice people and so helpful when it comes to what to choose. Their happy hour runs until 8pm, which is perfect for someone like me who works until about 6pm.

They serve really great appetizers, but if you're in the mood for something of more substance you can order from Yama, Japanese restaurant right in front of it, or even Hula's Modern Tiki Lounge. They are dog friendly, and often times you'll see the owner's super two super friendly Rottweiler's hanging out.

I can't say enough good things about this place and highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Sam was behind the bar. Since they have so many wines and beer, he made the experience of choosing fun! A very small, but chill place to be! We really enjoyed ourselves! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is anything but Rott n'!

Such a great selection of wines and craft beers! The owners are always around and have solid recommendations for whatever you may be in the mood for.

What really sets this place apart, though, in my opinion, is their level of service. A friend of mine and I stopped in for a quick drink before heading to sushi next door, but were having a great time and didn't want to leave. Turns out they have sushi menus and will happily call in an order for you and the sushi place will bring it right on over!

Whhhhhhhhaaattt?! How amazing is that?!"}
{"text":"My favorite little bar! They hosted my graduation party and took such care of my guests! We had their new bruschetta and charcuterie boards and they were AMAZING! They have an extensive wine and beer list with new additions added every time we go in. Patty, Keith and Jason are the best and always offer suggestions they know I will enjoy (they know my palate better than I do!). Thanks Rottn, we'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place and always recommend it to people. My family and I walked in a few minutes before midnight on new years eve. The owner was there with her two adorable rotties. We had a glass of wine and sat with the dogs for a bit. It was a very fun and relaxing way to start the new year."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. They truly care about your opinion on everything, wine and food. You ask for something and they go beyond making you taste a few things you might like base on your order. 
They often have events. I haven't been able to make it but you might want to check their calendar. Sounds like fun and for a good price."}
{"text":"This is a great local bar!! Owners have a great sense of humor!! They will help you try any beer and know what you like!!! Great times and great music!!"}
{"text":"Good beer and wine. I like the feeling of being in a real bar in the city. Difficult to find in Phoenix."}

{"text":"Great little bar. If you know the Whining Pig, it has the same style and appeal. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Congratulations on your grand opening Rott n' Grapes!

European chic with a Spanish flair. Limited seating and cozy atmosphere. Huge wine selection along with beer.

Purse hooks, power and usb outlets along the bar.

To Go available and delivery coming soon.

Happy Hour specials daily. Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Super laid back.  good prices, great selection, and owner (Keith) is involved and makes sure everyone enjoys themselves."}
{"text":"Cozy, fun bar! Wide selection of beer and wine. The bartender, Mike, is awesome. He was very patient with me as I didn't know which wine to choose. He gave some good recommendations. Been there a couple times now and plan on returning. Also, they have Connect Four (one of my favs)."}
{"text":"Cute place but double check your bill before paying. My friend and I were charged for an extra $15 glass of wine that we didn't order and the bar tender insisted we did. 

***Update: Thank you to the owner for resolving this issue and refunding me the additional charge!"}
{"text":"My hubs discovered this little gem last year, our minds were blown.  Amazing selection and we got to sit barside and learn so much about the wines.  Knowledge staff, decadent wines, fun, ,cozy little place!  Will definitely make it a \"must stop\" on our yearly Labor Day weekend trip."}
{"text":"Amazing boutique bar and restaurant, upscale feeling, with a local vibe and price tag. Fantastic selection of wines and craft beers, from all over the world. Impressed by the rare/boutique Vineyards represented at Rott n' Grapes, with a lineup that changes based on exciting finds by the owners. Great happy hour \"hours\"; from open/3pm until 8am. Hey, not all of us get out of work at 5pm! Oh...and this establishment is doggie friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little wine and beer bar. Over 90 wines to choose from. Many unique varietals. The owner is nice and knows his wine. Fun games to play on the patio and in the lounge. Bar and lounge area are a little small, but when the weather is nice, the patio would be a great place to hang out out with friends and enjoy great beer and wine. Nice to see a local place like this pop up. It's hidden behind some other places, so look carefully so you don't miss it! They will be opening another location downtown, so excited to see what that will be like."}
{"text":"Wonderful time! Fun staff, refreshing list of wine and peer, fantastic energy, and whimsical set up. They'll let you get food from next door if you want something else besides what's on the menu."}
{"text":"They are finally open!!!! What a great addition to the Central Corridor area.  They are located next the the Landmark Towers.  If you are looking for a place to stop by before or after dinner, put this place on your list.  They have Happy Hour till 8:00!!!!!!  Prices start at $3 .  The space is modern, cozy and even tech.  My iPhone needed a charge so Patty (one of the owners) grabbed me a cord and I was able to plug in right at my seat.  The bartenders are friendly and very attentive. Owners Patty and Keith are super welcoming and friendly. Stop by and check them out.  Cheers"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best bars! Small but has an amazing vibe and food selection. Lots of alcohol choices and great environment."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place when a friend and I were looking for somewhere to grab an evening drink. This proved to be the perfect place to sit and sip on a great glass of wine or craft beer! The staff there were super friendly, too! The space is tiny but it only adds to their unique vibe. What even better is that they have happy hour until 8pm with great prices. Will definitely be adding this place to my regular routine!"}
{"text":"I went to Rott'n Grapes for the first time yesterday, and had an absolute blast! My friend and I came in for a quick couple rounds and some charcuterie. Well, we fell in love with the atmosphere so much that we ended up inviting a handful of friends, and made a day out of it. Jason was extremely helpful, accommodating, and friendly. Not only was the service impeccable, but prices too. This place made a huge impression on, not only me, but my friends as well. Will definitely be make this place a habit!"}
{"text":"Great venue. Very intimate bar and patio, and a sweet lounge space right next door for a bit rowdier crowd. YOUUUUGE wine list, and you can do flights for the indecisive among us. Easy walk from Camelback Lt. Rail stop. Hi Matt."}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood wine and beer bar. Great deal on Wednesdays, board and a bottle for $20 you get a bottle of wine and a charcuterie board. 

Fun place that keeps a large rotating selection of wine and craft beer."}
{"text":"A great local spot here in Central Phoenix. The owners and staff are very friendly and accommodating. Been here several times since they launched and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to have a drink with friends. Great part about it is it offers great variety from a budget friendly Happy Hour to being able to class things up a bit!"}
{"text":"Great little place at the bottom of the landmark towers on central and Camelback. Great beer options and friendly staff."}
{"text":"SO TINY! And on a summer evening, SO WARM. 

Their prices on happy hour are amazing. We had a hard time deciding between wine by the glass on happy hour or just buying a bottle. That's pretty good. 

Bartenders are wonderful. They make fantastic recommendations within your budget and have no problem giving you a quick taste before you commit. 

One of the greatest parts about this little spot is how happy everyone is when they're in here. That's a good feeling."}
{"text":"Super duper cute! Came with a few friends and had a great time. Had lots of wine and beer. And tried all the snakes. Great place to escape your busy day have a glass of wine and unwind!"}
{"text":"If I were to rate this venue based only on service and how the bar's ambience made it easy for me to \"let my hair down,\" I would easily give 3.5 stars, but for now, I can only say \"A-OK,\" due to the limited selection of food.  (An \"A-OK\" from me is still pretty good!  I rarely give four stars after only one visit, but when I do, you better believe I was impressed with service, food, beverages, low ambient noise pollution, and delightful atmosphere!)  Rott n' Grapes is listed on Yelp as a venue with tapas/plates, but it really is more of a \"wine and beer bar,\" with bar snacks as somewhat just an afterthought.  There's an impressive chalkboard written with multi-colored chalk, and with such a large list of wines and beers, I was overwhelmed.  What a relief when my eyes adjusted and somehow found Caymus Conundrum.  I was with a friend, who's never heard of Conundrum, but was willing to try a bottle (!) on my word (!!) that it was good.  Bartender Jason backed me up on how great the Conundrum line is, and with a free app from a selection of three with the purchase of a bottle, how can we go wrong?  With my friend's power of persuasion, he was able to get a credit for the app and have it applied to the charcuterie board, instead.  Another win!  (This was after my friend spoke to the other bartender about the possibility, and not Jason.)

There was a bit of confusion when Jason poured us a glass of red, when we told the other bartender that we wanted white, but Jason didn't even bat an eye, obtained a chilled bottle of white and immediately poured us two glasses, and then placed the bottle into a wine chiller.  The tiny charcuterie board (normally $15, but $12 during HH) came with extra-sharp white cheddar (my favorite of the three), triple-cream Brie, and Manchego; salted almonds, a mix of olives; a couple of dates; salami and prosciutto; and toasted half (?) of a small baguette brushed with EVOO.  We ended up asking for more bread, so thanks to Jason for indulging us!

If I were living in the area, I might return another evening, but I live 30 minutes away..."}
{"text":"We popped in just after happy hour but the amazing bartender Manny still honored my check-in offer for our first round of beers. You can tell that a lot of locals frequent this bar, most everyone was on first name basis with everyone else. This place is SUPER dog friendly and there were furry friends inside and out. The selection of bars and wines is impressive and the prices are reasonable. Glad we stumbled upon this little gem! We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing wine list great hidden gem Wednesday bottle and cheese meat plate 20 dollars. Music Wednesday Thursday Friday....."}
{"text":"I am so so so excited this place is finally open!

First, the name is awesome, and I don't even have to make a pun in my review because they've already done it for me. They are totally crushing the wine scene (ok, I made one anyway). 

It's somewhat hidden by construction, but you definitely want to check it out. It's a small spot, but really adorable. The set up has a wrap around bar that is both inside and outside. They plan to expand their patio, and I am really looking forward to watch their progress and growth. Dog friendly outside bar, as well, which I find very important. They have ample room to charge your phone, and wifi so if you really have to work late and NEED a glass of wine (me), this is the place.

Their wine selection covers all spectrums and beer is available in bottles, but don't go expecting a draught! 

I had an opportunity to speak with the owners, who I absolutely love! They truly care about the neighborhood and having a local bar for the community. They are willing to invest the time in not only their bar, but to get to know their clientele. 

and the best part......HAPPY HOUR UNTIL 8:00 PM EVERY SINGLE DAY.

I mean, come on. What could be better? A bar that you can ACTUALLY enjoy after work specials. 

I HIGHLY suggest trying this place out."}
{"text":"I love this place! Patty and Keith make everyone feel like family and the atmosphere is really inviting and fun."}
{"text":"Just a great place, with fun knowledgeable staff, and a fantastic selection... say yes to the baked apple cider!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here last weekend on the way home and it was great. They have a very small bar but it is cozy and also has an outdoor patio area. They can probably hold a total of 50-60 maximum indoor and outdoor which is nice because it keeps the crowd smaller. There is a massive amount of wines and beers here to choose from and their happy hour goes pretty late which is awesome. They are a new bar and deserve a five star. Great place!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5
Happiness - 5/5

What a fun little spot. There is probably more wine than square footage here. They have a huuuuuge selection - local, international and from all over the US. One of the co-owners was serving and was really accommodating, helping us pick out each selection. We sat outside, which is almost a must given how small the location is. I do wonder how it will fare in the summer with our heat in full force. 

The other customers were nice too. A few brought left over Easter candy (which really complimented the wine) and there were all sorts drinking there (from people in gym clothes to hipsters). 

They do have daily specials and happy hours, so be on the lookout for that."}
{"text":"Love this little local wine bar! Perfect for a laid back night with friends! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Your mission is to try a new wine or beer every day. This is the perfect time of year to start, as Rott 'n' Grapes has patio seating, including one of those outdoor bars that let a person feel comfortable, urban, and smug about the weather all at once.

The beer and wine lists are gratifyingly, challengingly long. They also serve solid food, so you can start with a nice beer after work (or after church -- open Sundays!) and segue neatly into lunch or dinner. I had some very nice meatballs.

Prices are incredibly reasonable -- you get all the thrills of being a beer connoisseur without having to contemplate a second mortgage on your uptown condo. Service on my first visit was SO NICE and everything combines to make me downright enthusiastic about a second, third, and fourth visit."}
{"text":"Great little wine bar with an overwhelming amount of options. (Never a bad thing). The staff is amazing and they do happy hour every day until 8pm.

Light snacks are filling and there are fun games to play if you're in the mood. When the weather is nice it's an awesome patio to hang out on and sip a vino with friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The bartender, Jason, knew so much about the wines and drinks. Given that we asked a lot of questions they made us feel welcome and as if they knew our tastes and figured out from descriptions very quickly. Check this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I accidentally wandered upon this gem after having dinner at Yama sushi. It was tucked away in the strip, and was darkly lit. We didn't even know if it was open or not.  
We walked into a packed bar,  I mean like elbow to elbow crammed! Within minutes the four bartenders gathered everyone around to give a \"thank you for coming to our grand opening\" speech. Woops! Guess we crashed the party. 
This place is cute and darkly lit,  but only holds 15-20 people.  It can't be anymore than 300 SQ ft. So be prepared for some tight quarters, luckily they are constructing some outdoor seatings. 
They serve strictly wine and beer,  and have an impressive variety listed on the chalkboard pictured. The four bartenders, maybe owners,  were as sweet and energetic as can be. I asked one smiley young man if they had any sour beers. Without even looking at the list he went through the sours with expert detail. He helped me discover a unique one called Uinta Gose. It had the tart bite of a sour, and an interesting salty finish that smoothed it out.  Delicious! They also carried one of Nick's favorites, Breckenridge Vanilla Porter. Attentive service,  and a great selection will have us coming back. 
Also, word on the street is that they have happy hour until 8pm. Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place, with three different areas to sit in! You can watch sports or play connect four and there's an awesome selection of beer and wine. Sarah, the bartender, is amazing and has spot-on recommendations! We will always come back here. Thanks Sarah!!"}
{"text":"Love this bar, right downstairs and super friendly! Great happy hour and love the people!!! Come check out the bartenders and grab a cold one!!"}
{"text":"I don't really want to write a review about this place because I don't want everyone else to find out how awesome it is and become too busy that I can't get in! I'm sure it'll happen anyway. 
This place is great, it's tiny and cozy inside and reminiscent of the Whining Pig further uptown but has a much larger and in my opinion better wine list and loads of craft beers too. 
The owners work the bar and are super welcoming and nice to chat with. They're dog friendly and relaxed which is a nice change from some of the more pretentious wine bars. 
They have a tv for showing NFL games and UFC fights. 
Looking forward to becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"It's new and it's tiny, but it's already one of the best wine/beer bars in Phoenix! 

With a daily happy hour til 8pm, and a surprisingly affordable canned/bottled beer selection, avid uptown drinkers can most certainly pinpoint where Rott n' Grapes draws its inspiration. 

The selection is top notch and with prices that'll make your jaw drop. I scored a Koffee Kolsch, one of my *favorite* beers, for only 4 bucks! There are plenty of other hard-to-find beverages. You WILL find something enjoyable. 

I love the atmosphere. Even if it's a bit cramped inside, the dim room + blue light + upbeat music makes me feel pretty gosh darn cool. There's currently a canopy for extended seating, with plans to add even more. The vision for this place is turning it into a groovy little lounge, and even before that vision is realized I think my friends and I will most definitely become regulars here. I've no doubt stellar staff like Amy and Keith will have trouble impressing anyone!

Perhaps what's most impressive is that it's only a couple months old, AND it's the staff's first bar. Taking ideas from other revered local establishments and improving upon them has worked wonders, and I look forward to Rott n' thriving for years to come."}
{"text":"No kitchen which is a real drawback for me as I enjoy some good food when I drink.
Overpriced.  A tiny glass of beer for what you pay for a full-size regular beer mug at other pubs.
Very small space and you can barely move around.
Noise level is too much for my ears. Not bad until you get people there.
Not for me as there are better places for me to spend my moola.
I was leaning more towards one star but I didn't due to the gracious servers."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place .. Great prices and my fav Wine !! Jason is so nice great service!!"}
{"text":"Keith and Patty are amazing owners and hosts! Thoroughly appreciated the knowledge regarding the wines and steering me in a different direction based on my palette. The wine and beer lists are extensive, delicious and you can't beat the happy hour pricing! Love the neighborhood feel - definitely adding this spot as one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Keith and Patty are crushing the #phxwine scene! Tons of great wines and craft beers. The new food menu absolutely rocks and the staff is always on point. Our 'go to' person is the wonderful, purple haired Sarah. Always friendly and knowledgeable... hasn't hand picked a drink I haven't liked. Looking forward to your next location opening in Roosevelt Row! Keep doing awesome things, guys... we're rooting for you!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood quaint bar with a wide beer selection. Wish there was more on tap but tons of bottles to choose from"}
{"text":"Awesome little gem! Def need to see! Great wine list and friendly staff! Be back for sure:)"}
{"text":"Great wine and service from Jason at Rott n' Grapes! It was my first time in and I was overwhelmed with the hospitality and service I received here. I can't wait to recommend this place to family and friends in the area. This place is one of a kind and a true gem in the Central Phoenix area. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Worst first and last experience! The guy behind the bar was rude and needs to learn how to treat people. The music kept cutting in and out and the place is way too small for what they are trying to do. I suggest avoiding this place.  There are plenty of better options in the area!"}
{"text":"The three stars is based primarily on price. We have been here three times and each time I have left feeling like their prices are really high. The atmosphere is good , the beer selection is good , but every time I leave shaking my head when I get the tab. Happy hour prices are good on the front end but they make up for it on the back end  during non-happy hour with a price gouge. Case in point on my last visit: we went to ****(Hawaiian theme bar and restaurant just south) for 2 16oz pints of FYITM (tasty double IPA). 
My tab after tax and tip: $11
Then we walk over to RnG for 2 single IPAs which were not even in a pint glass but rather a 14oz shaker glass. My tab after tax and tip: $24
Why in the world would I return for less beer at more than twice the price than a nearby competitor?"}
{"text":"Fantastic little place. The wine and beer selection is wonderful. We were welcomed by the owners and felt right at home. Plan on spending plenty of time there."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Came because of all the great reviews. And here is one more. This place is tucked away and difficult to find despite the address. It is a small place tucked in an alcove so you do not see it from the street. This place is divided in two separate buildings. You can go into the lounge which is across the alcove or sit at the bar. But once you do find it you will find it is worth it. Large selection of wine and beer, small plates, and  Happy hour till 8 every day. Friendly staff and people just hanging out. It is next door to a Sushi bar and they will deliver to the wine bar. A nice local place."}
{"text":"I came here and watched the Mayweather fight for free, when every other bar in town was charging a 20 dollar cover.  They have a great selection of beer and wine. They also happened to carry my favorite name brand of beer, \"Session\" by Full Sale brewing company.  The prices are a little steep to make it my every day watering hole, but the croud was friendly, the staff was friendier and I had a great time. I would definitely recommend this place for a good night out.  They are a bit hard to find your first time around, and the parking is a little difficult, but once you get there the kind of hidden nature of it adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.
Great wine selection, extensive beer options.
Owners are amazing.
Charcuterie board was great. Happy hour was as well. 
Highly recommend.
It's small.. so be in the mood for small but has so much to offer. Looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"Such a good spot for casual drinks friends! After seeing the great reviews some friends and I stopped by on Saturday night and were not disappointed! They have a wine and/or beer for everyone. I could have spent all night looking through their list and talking wine with the knowledgeable bartender. They even had connect four ( regular and super sized versions ) to keep us entertained. Also one of the owners informed us about the extension they are working on which we are super excited to check out! Will defiantly be back soon, thanks rott n' grapes!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find! We spontaneously decided to come in because we recently moved downtown and wanted to try a new bar. This place is awesome! Over 60 beers and an extensive wine list. The ambience is laid back, cozy, and fun. Staff is friendly and inviting. If you're up for a surprise, you can have the staff pick a \"mystery\" beer for you at a lower price. We had a great night here!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot! The owner Keith is awesome, so friendly and cool! Huge selection of wines. The Malbec's are my favorite! Charcuterie board was filled with different cheeses, olives and italian meats. Atmosphere reminds me of being tucked away in a piazza in Italy. Bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. Great place to bring friends, a date or just by yourself. Great find located in the breezeway of Landmark Tower."}
{"text":"What a cool little gem this place is. I love hidden places like this! 

It's a quaint little bar with an outdoor seating area, that I think is dog friendly. There's seating inside but not much. 

They have an enormous selection of beer and wine, some of the beer is on tap, some is in bottles, and some is in a can. They had 3 or 4 different sours, which was awesome. They also have a light bite menu in case you get the munchies. 

There are also some games scattered around. My friends and I played Connect 4, which was fun. 

Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My girl friends and I went here for Happy Hour on Saturday and we loved it! The whole atmosphere of the place is welcoming, our bartender was very helpful with getting us new things we would like that we hadn't tried. 

We just found out about Trivia on Tuesdays and we are planning to come for that once a month. 

You can't beat the happy hour though. Very reasonable. We didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"So I have been wanting to come here for a long time, -- --finally I did tonight, I freaking loved it, i wish it was closer to my house so I could walk, but it's only a 5 min drive. The bartenders are so funny and make you feel at home, their selection of beer is out of this world ha ha! Such a cool ambiance, super chill and perfect to meet with a friend or just have a chill date."}
{"text":"Interesting venue; very small & intimate, pkg a challenge but prob worth it...more snacks but can bring sushi in, etc."}
{"text":"Awesome little find. It's tucked away behind the sushi restaurant in front of some condos. The owners are really cool people and are very knowledgeable about their product. The options are endless for both beer and wine. I can usually find a beer I've never had with them. Very limited food selection that includes a charcuterie board and other similar options. This place is about drinking beer in a small place with good people. Do yourself a favor and stop in for some drinks before or after dinner."}
{"text":"I didn't even want to give it fine stars so people do not find this cute place full of cuteness. Small very small but awesome. The Asian bartender was awesome, nice and funny and knew his beer. Then there was an Amazon man bartender who was hilariously out of place..... but somehow fit.  So many beers to pick from, you can also buy to go. The bottles of wine are also to go. They have games to play and some food but not dinner style only snacks. Very nice place"}
