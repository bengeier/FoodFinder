{"text":"Not a bad place. It's in a basement and looks a bit ramshackle but the food is what counts. I ordered the Pork Griot and the meat was fairly dry but the fried plantain was pretty great. No real complaints, although given the choice I might give it 3.5 stars because the seating areas were pretty filthy and because the meat was a bit dry."}
{"text":"It's a busy little restaurant where everybody running around in unorganized symphony. We find our way through and landed into one of the noisiest table as it was next to the kitchen. Most of our order received on time with a little it of reminders for the missing one.  I wasn't keen on the salmon but my partner loved her steak which I highly recommend.   We were asked if we like to drink anything which we answered coffee ut it never came so I reminded the server in charge of our table for which he apologized that he had forgotten about it!  I might go back there just for the steak but not for the service of the ambiance."}
{"text":"Located in a scummy basement off of Cure Labelle, one can EASILY overlook Casa Creole... unless you know about its existence by a friend... who obviously... happens to be Creole as well.  I went with a take-out \"griot\" (pork shoulder) that came with fried rice and pasta. It was quite delicious and I enjoyed it... though I wouldn't necessarily eat it every day. I had a slice of fried plantain banana and it was very yummy as well. This plate was under $10, which is a bargain to say the least.  In the future they plan to move nearby and will provide more seating, which can only help their business some. All in all, worthy of a try. Woman was very nice."}
{"text":"First time going to this place looks run down from the outside. As usual I ordered the griot: the rice and the fried pork was delicious I got some for my boyfriend too and he likes it... I'll be ordering again the menu looks interesting I recommend this place if anyone is around Laval (on Cure-La Belle)...."}
