{"text":"I like this place a lot. My wife loves it like I do. Especially the sweet layer custard sponge cake, great indeed. The place is set up nice and the service is great. However I am a picky person and I would like more food choice."}
{"text":"I love the Spring Villa Dim Sum, especially the pork and fish rice, **salad seafood spring roll** yummy. They have early bird special, remember to be there early, there will be a long queue if you arrive at 10am... For sure will go again!"}
{"text":"So far this is the only dimsum place I have been to in the Toronto area.  Overall the place has a nicer/fancier feel than most dimsum restaurants and it's a little pricer than I've paid in other cities..    We ordered all the standard dimsum dishes and were not disappointed.  It isn't a cart pushing dimsum place, so everything is made fresh (at least I hope it is!) after you give the waitress your order.  We also happened to get the early bird special, which is the same price for the small, medium, large dishes if you leave and pay before 11am.  By the time we were leaving around 10:45am, the place was packed with a waiting line."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant for some times.  Very disappointed with its food quality and service now. There's one piece of the ginger and vinegar pork leg has the taste of nail polish remover, and when we told the manager, he just took the dish away, changed all the plates, didn't get back to us what's wrong or apologize....,.! I wasn't expecting or asking to get a refund, but at least he should address the problem. Also found another dish (shredded pork , sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf) the pork in it is old, a bit sour! Probably won't be back in the future."}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely terrible.    We went for a family event (new baby) with approx. 60 people on a SATURDAY evening.  Dinner started at 8pm, and literally from the beginning to end, we were hurried along the 10 courses at breakneck speed because (as we were told) we started late and the chef will leave at 10pm precisely.  As soon as you were done a dish, it was whisked away.  The entire time the server was saying how they have to hurry hurry hurry.    I have NEVER been to any restaurant where they had to be closed by 10pm on Saturday, and it's not like this place doesn't make enough business.    I can't believe that my cousin spent $2500+tax and tips to get this sort of service.  Surely 8pm is a reasonable dinner time, esp for a family event.  Anyone who's ever been to a Chinese party knows that dinner usually takes place from 8 to 10:30.  This is standard.  What's the point of providing dinner service if they're going to treat their customers like this?  Even though the food was good quality, it's definitely not worth it to come back, since there's plenty of other Chinese restaurants that have great food and doesn't try to kick you out as soon as you sit down."}
{"text":"Chinese food forChristmas eve dinner?  Obviously!  This place was delicious.  I had peeking duck for the first time ever and it was fantastic.  Yummy crispy skin with fluffy wraps and the second course was amazing.  The weird thing about this place is there is hierarchy for serving.  The people who bring out the food can't give it to you, you have to wait for a different server to come and place the food on the table.  Those servers present the food and serve it out into equal portions for everyone eating.  Great escape from the city to Markham for me."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday morning and enjoyed the $2.99 special. The restaurant was busy at 10am. We ordered the typical fare including hargow shiumai egg tart steam dumplings and chicken pao. Everything was delicious! Service was quick and courteous. As it was our first time here we were worried we had to pay and be out by 11am to get the $2.99 special however as soon as we ordered they date stamped and gave us the early bird allowing is to sit and eat without rushing. I can see this as my new go to dim sum place!!"}
{"text":"This place has the worse service ever. We placed our order at 7:30PM and now it is almost 9 only one dish came. Same thing with our tables beside us, only one or two dish after more than one hour.  Don't come back ever!"}
{"text":"Do not come here to eat!! Their menu does not match up with their food that they bring out and their waitstaffs are rude."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and upset! First of all, the parking was near impossible to find any spaces. We had to park in the \"alley\" behind the restaurant. Secondly, the hostess told us that the wait was only a couple of minutes but we ended up waiting for almost an hour. Thirdly, all of their VIP customers got seated ahead of us while we just sat there watching them. Finally, for all this heartache the food was not that great. I don't know why there is such a line up to go to this restaurant because personally I will never go here again. We were pressured to order our food and the food was extremely rushed. The taste was too salty and pretty pricey for me. Please avoid this place unless you like to waste your time and hard earned money."}
{"text":"Really delicious dim sum. Everything tasted fresh and was steaming hot. standouts included vegetable dumplings, spicy pan fried rice rolls, deep fried squid, deep fried fish with thousand island sauce (sounded weird but were good). The only downside is that the place is super busy but the wait usually is only about 10 mins. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Having driven by a few time, I decided to get the family together to try it out. We were looking for a new dim sum place anyway and Google has some good reviews. Unfortunately, this place is another we will not be going back to.   Don't get me wrong - the food was alright and the place was nice and clean but the staff was rude to the point of being bitchy and incompetent. If it was one or two servers/ hosts, I would write it off as just a bad day but five of them nearly caused both my mom and sister to go chicken killer on them.   In any case, we ordered about 15 different items and the food quality was good. However, it took 30 minutes for the first item to show up and then over an hour to get the rest of our order. I personally will go to a place at least  twice before writing them off but I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum, food cane fast and everything was fresh and warm. Flavour wise I guess it was average to above average...nothing really knocked my socks off but I had not real complaints either.  I enjoyed the milk custard tart and the lotus root pork wrap thingy (sorry forgot the actual name).  I like that unlike a lot of other chinese restaurants like this they had a good deal of space between tables so it didnt feel super crowded even though the restaurant was full. Service was a bit varied, some very helpful and friendly faces mixed with the usual kind of expression you expect at dimsum."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for dim sum and the food has been consistent. The fried squid is one of my favourites there, it's crispy and not tough. There is always a line during the time I usually go (which is around 12 or 1pm) but then again I would be skeptical about any dim sum place without a line up on a weekend at that time! I've had no problems with the service, they are pretty quick and efficient. I would come back anytime."}
{"text":"Nice place with really original Cantonese food. Easy to find and relax there with friends."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience!   1. Found a black coarse hair in my dish.  2. Brought us the wrong order.   3. Waited around an hour for the food to come.  4. Bad service.  See picture"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Its a typical Dim Sum establishment, with typical dishes and prices, although there are some unique/interesting selections. The overall quality is good. The only downside is that it is VERY busy on weekend lunch time (As are all Dim Sum places, which im sure anyone who frequents these types of restaurants knows well).   (Even if it wasnt so busy, i still would not give it 5 stars though)"}
{"text":"nice decor, and service. the food is as authentic canto dishes can be!"}
{"text":"Been going to Spring villa for a while now for special events...  And this mothers day was no exception...   Food here was good... Few dishes we ate were: Steamed fish Sweet and sour pork Beef and veggies Efu noodles Peking duck Chicken  And others  I went to work on the fish, chicken, and beef in order to get my protz in for the day!!  Food was delicious!  The only thing that I had an issue with was the tea cup...  As it was fancier cup than usual it wasn't very user friendly as my manly and rugged fingers couldn't comfortably fit into the handle (see pic). But to be fair I just think this was just for mothers day...   All in all spring villa is TooTuff Approved!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  Went today (Thursday) with by boyfriend and arrived at 11:15. It wasn't busy and we just missed the special in the morning, not that we knew there was a special. We were seated immediately and were greeted not only by the hostess who brought us to the table but by a couple of other staff members as we walked by.  We didn't actually have to flag anyone down to give them our order sheet; the waitress actually came up to our table to check on us. The food came very quickly and was hot and fresh. We ordered their soup (which wasn't on the menu but recommended by the waitress). It's usually a single serve but since we ordered a lot we actually decided to share it, which we told the waitress. We were surprised when she actually brought over a ladle and started portioning out the soup into 2 bowls and then removing the container from the table after she finished. Everything else ranged from okay/decent to very good. Service was excellent too.   When we finished with the soup, they actually came and gave us fresh bowls. Also, halfway through our meal, they switched our plates too (we had chicken feet so there were some bones on our plates). We never had to flag anyone down to refill our tea either. The waitress actually came by with hot water and refilled it without us asking.   Definitely one of the better dim sum places we've been to. Will definitely return to try other times on the menu. Losing .5 because of the trouble we had getting into the parking lot (we were heading south on Woodbine (the restaurant would be on our left) and there's no way to turn left into the parking lot so we had to turn left and the next lights and turn around) and the fact that I was quite disappointed with their Siu mai."}
{"text":"I like this place for dim sum food, in the weekends is very crowded and if you want to get the promotion (3$ for every size of dim sum) you have to get there before 9 and check out before 11 am which is some time bother some specifically after a busy week.  Overall is good specifically the congee soup with the crab and chicken.   I give 4 star because in spit of the other dim sum chinese restaurant they don't offer refilling the green tea pot."}
{"text":"They charged me $4 for soy sauce with Chinese chill pepper! Seriously?!?  Only found that out when I ask for the bill! Don't go to a restaurant that hides bad surprises!"}
{"text":"Went for Dim Sum with the SO, 2pm, so we missed the before 11am price. It was ok. I personally was not too impressed. Where as some dishes were tasty for certain, you don't get the outrageously beautiful presentation of the Crown restaurants, and the pricing is similar.   Service was good, tea was hot but $45 for Dim Sum is just too much, especially considering I liked the dumplings at Asian Legend  (of all places) better. I was thinking about them as I was eating the Spring Villa version. The crispy octopus here was really the stand out, and maybe the har-gow which was also really good.   A-ok. I would return for the discount price."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! I should of read the reviews before I went.  It was exactly as horrible as everyone said it was. Their hostess is rude and when we mentioned to her  that she let someone go ahead of us. She started to argue with us! What kind of service is that. Don't go if you don't speak perfect Chinese because they will let everyone else waiting in line go in front of you and you'll never know. Worse service ever. And there are plenty of Dim Sum places in Markham that we don't ever have to go there again."}
{"text":"My friends at work told me about this restaurant on Woodbine that served dim sum for cheap if you go early in the morning. There special is order before 10:45am, dim sum is $2.60 per dish.  So we decided we'll check this place out early one Saturday morning.  Normally we don't roll into a dim sum this early but to avoid the crowds we arrived at 9am. The restaurant was already at half capacity. Saw a lot of older people dining and reading their papers.   On the order sheet with picked a variety of standard dim sum dishes. Sui Mai, Har Gow, Sticky Rice wrapped in a Lotus leaf, Beef Rice Noodle Roll, Crispy Chicken & Shrimp dumpling (a new menu item), and a spare ribs & rice in a pot.   From all that we ordered I only liked the Beef Rice Noodle Roll and the Sticky Rice. Everything else was so-so in taste.   When we left at around 10:30am the restaurant was packed. So it pays to come early.   Taste was okay but for $2.60 for each dish you can't really complain. So the value is excellent.. just recommend getting here early to avoid waiting in line. It's a pretty popular place."}
{"text":"I have to say that even if I am Chinese and do NOT like dim sum quite much this has to be the only place I could bare to stand the food. I love that its clean and fresh and the food actually doesnt give me a stomach ache (most places usually do). Although I am a regular there and I know the hostess and management pretty well (due to baby showers and set table menus for dinner occasions) they are quite friendly to me and my family. I would suggest to those who are not regulars here to maybe slip the hostess with a red pocket so she remembers you and will be more helpful in the future.   Dinner wasnt quite so great I have to suggest though.. I have to admit the service when my family had a set menu for a few tables was quite impressive. They changed dishes and bowls with every course and helped with serving all of my family members AT THE SAME TIME! (due to most set menu restaurants they have only 2-3 people working to serve and sometimes one end wouldnt get to food as quick as the others) but at spring villa we all got our own waitress per table but the food was alright.. nothing special."}
{"text":"Service extra slow and uninviting on a Sunday morning.  Food was good but came out at snail's pace. Don't come if you don't have an hour to spare waiting for 8 dim sum dishes."}
{"text":"Came here once a couple years ago. We came in the middle of the afternoon to meet with family and friends. There were no other customers at the time except for us at the time. Our food and service was rushed and the quality was standard. For the price we paid and what we got considering the place was not even busy I feel this place fails.  I can't seem to forget the bad experience."}
{"text":"$3.00 dim sum before 11am. There are non-traditional items marked as new on the menu. As there were only 2 of us, in additional to the usual dim sum fare, we were only able to sample steamed chicken, fried fish cake and mango dessert . All dishes were quite salty and we left with an overwhelming thirst ."}
{"text":"Really nice Chinese restaurant for dim sum.  If you get in and out of there before 11AM, everything (except the \"special\" items) is $2.60.  Such a deal!  We ordered a bunch of food and didn't finish it, but you can always pack it to go.  We were there on a Tuesday morning.  Probably got there around 9:30a and it was already pretty packed.  By the time we left (before 11a), there were a bunch of people waiting to be seated.  This is on a Tuesday morning!  I heard it's much fancier and more crowded on weekends.  I'm glad we went on a weekday.  Definitely worth going to.  Make sure you go before 11am!"}
{"text":"Went here for New Year's Eve dinner with my family based on their reputation for good dim sum. I had been here for dinner once before and had a good experience. Their 5 lb lobster set dinner was of good value and great taste.   This time we ordered the dinner for 6 for $168. Let me tell you the portion sizes were so small, we had to order an additional fried rice. We only had 4 adults and one child! None of us have a particularly large appetite. Their set dish portions were so small that we got 5 person worth of food for every dish. Super skimpy on the portion size when it should have been based on 6 people. There wasn't even enough dessert goji berry jellies at the end!   No effort to rectify portions sizes once we mentioned we were onto their money saving ways. Just apologies and explanations of that's just how it is.   WOULD NOT GO BACK"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group for a celebratory dinner and was thoroughly disappointed.  We started off with a 10 person set menu, and added a few extras as we had a few kids, plus some crab balls specials.  Most of the dishes were quite bland, in particular was the lobster which was nearly flavourless.  The appetizer meat platter was boring and featured some extremely sour and green mango slices.  The steamed fish was a disaster as it was overcooked (we do it much better at home), a seafood soup with a pumpkin base was horrible.  Fried rice was also lacking flavour (worse was they topped it off with these shredded taro chips that were all soggy).  The only decent dishes were the crispy skin chicken, and the green bean dessert.  Service was brutally slow, as they had only 3 girls working the entire restaurant (our waitress was running around like mad looking after 4 big tables, having to do both serving and clearing tables), and the guys in suits stood around, took orders and refused to help serve most tables.  $600 + tip (2 beers) for 9 adults and 4 kids.  Not a good meal at all, and we won't be back for dinner for a long while.  Stick with the dim sum and you should be fine."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today with my parents for dimsum. We went for the early special around 9:20 am. Dishes were $3 each and the tea price was $1.50 per person. Maybe I haven't been to dimsum in a while but I've never paid more than $1 for the tea price hmm...  Service was quite good minus 1 person. Kept our tea refilled and came to collect our dishes frequently. Food wise, I can't judge well since I don't go to dimsum often but I enjoyed it mostly. The siu mai and shrimp dumplings were really good.  We ordered 10 dishes and our total came to 39 which is a touch expensive imo for dimsum for 3 people. When we go out for dinner at other restaurants, we can usually get a couple of dishes fo 40-50$ and have plenty of left overs.  The atmosphere of this place is really nice though so I'm glad I tried it, but probably won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"It's a good place for dim sum. Normally there's no huge Line up in winter. All S/M/L size dim sum dishes are all $2.99 if you order before 11am. The food is good and service is welcome. I recommend it for dim sum."}
{"text":"*5 star for food, service, and renovations* *-1 star for the new old crooner cited as \"entertainment\"*  Oh gawd Spring Villa! Why did you have to ruin a perfectly good evening by hiring a guitarist to go to every table and sing Italian Opera songs!?!?!?! If I wanted frickin Pavarotti or O Sole Mio belted until kingdom come, I would have popped in a CD...or gone to a concert. Certainly not Spring Villa...  We had reservations for 6pm and the dinner went splendidly until a man in a suit started strumming a tune as if he was alone in the shower. We all sat horrified...praying that Besame Mucho would end Mucho fast so we could get on talking. We paid the guy $5, really to get rid of him. There were only 3 other tables that he went to and yup...soon after he was back at our table again.  Apparently, the restaurant has hired him because people like that kind of entertainment. But honestly, I want to eat my BBQ in peace. The old guy is a good singer for sure, but I don't want to listen to romantic Italianetta's while I'm hacking at my Fried Rice. The ambiance just doesn't mesh. We had one old Asian guy who thought he knew Italian and started singing along with the guitarist (next table) only to have choked on something...Remix Italian Aria + HACK + COUGH + hack hack hack...  My entire family left before our free dessert was put on the table and I had a headache afterwards. I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of someone belching loud tunes. We had out of town guests and we could hardly talk over love music.  FYI. If you want to listen to this wannabe Julio Iglesias, than come here Monday-Wednesday from 6-9pm. Thankfully, Thursday to Sunday will be peace and quiet. PLEASE SPRING VILLA! DITCH THE LIVE ENTERTAINMENT!"}
{"text":"the dim sum was good, but the menu is limited.  tried the new chicken & shrimp fried dumplings. didn't like it. inside has a weird goey-ness (?) of which im not entirely sure it's made of. it needs more actual shrimp & chicken.  also got fish maw soup. it with a dumpling that literally filled the entire bowl. it was beyond huge. to the point where you wouldnt even call it soup. i had no appetite for it. my friend, ryann o. said the dumpling was literally a gigantic shui mai ball. LOL. he seemed to like it.  it was nice and greasy, but i don't think i'll come back here again."}
{"text":"We had some good recommendations to try the dim sum there.  The total meal cost was a great price, only for the early bird special however.  If we had gotten there any later, we would have paid regular price which is actually pretty expensive.  They were able to accommodate a large group quickly, and the service was good.  The food was fresh and was quick.  The restaurant was large, clean, pretty nice inside.  A higher class place that I think was well worth the drive.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my hands-down favourite place to go to dim sum. I've been going here since I was a child. Food quality is consistently high Every time I go, there is a long line- so prepare to wait.  If you want the early bird special on the weekend, go very very early. If you get there after 10, you probably won't get a seat until after the special is over."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time with family, table of 10.  I called the the day before when I made the reservations that dishes had no msg and menus were not fixed. They confirmed it with me. When we went, it was fixed menu only. Very disappointed.  We stayed anyways, dishes had no msg and were not salty. They were very good. We ordered a scallop dish but when it came out, it had no scallops. When we pointed it out to them. They said they would redo it. They never did, we waited another 20-30 mins and when we asked about it again. They yelled it us (manager and the owner) asked us why we ate it anyways.  They just shrugged their shoulders and handed us the bill. It was very poorly handled on their part. We never got a dessert either. We will not going their again."}
{"text":"I don't usually come to Spring Villa for Dim Sum anymore and I am glad.  Remind me why I stop coming here in the first place = Terrible service!!   Nothing really stands out here and the menu is limited.  Worst Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) I ever had. It was way overcooked when you try to pick it up all the skin falls apart.  Shrimp had no taste to it.    Food comes out super slow here as we have to wait for each dish to come out when we already finished the other.   Don't think I am coming back anytime soon.  Rating:  Service: 1/5 Food Quality: 2/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  3/5 Value: 2/5 Parking: 3/5"}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum places out there for sure. Is it slightly more pricy? Sure but not ridiculously so. The quality of their food and service also matches up to the costs which is totally ok with me. I like going here because although they do dim sum classics really well but they also make an effort to present new menu items that aren't typical and continue to reinvent their dim sum offerings on a routine basis. Here are some of my favourite dishes: -cha siu bao (bbq pork bun) -steamed beef honey comb w/ turnip- love the sauce here! -steamed rice noodle with mushroom (light but generous with fillings) -something with seaweed and purple rice- one of the more unique items -japanese style mango rolls -seafood pie with avocado  Of course these recommendations are to my test but I definitely recommend those who have been going to the same dim sum places over and over to give this place a go!"}
{"text":"This past weekend, my family came here for dim sum on a whim. Spring Villa has an early morning dim sum special where all dishes are $3 regardless of the size so on the weekend it can get quite busy. Expect to wait for a seat.   Unlike typical dim sum places, food is not pushed out in carts and displayed for patrons to select. The menu is a list of dim sum and you check off what you want, the menu items come out staggered as they are prepared.   We ordered the typical dim sum fare: chiu chow style dumpling, stir fried rice noodles with hot sauce, braised beef brisket and turnip, and oyster lettuce congee. All tasted good, but as far as dim sum is concerned nothing too special. I would recommend the chiu chow dumplings for the peanut lovers, it's very tasty, and the stir friend rice noodles with hot sauce was a favourite at our table.   The service was quick, our tea got filled up several times when needed, and the food came out hot. Definitely a good dim sum option in Markham, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've had for a while.  Not only did over half our dishes not come past the hour and a half mark, but we had to remind them twice and then eventually cancel the rest of our order because we were tired of waiting.  My friend and I were starving after waiting over 30 mins for a table and spending an hour a half there without most of the dishes we ordered.  The management apologized but seemed really indifferent to the situation.  Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time, and the dim sum quality has been consistently excellent.  Pretty good service too.  Worth getting up early on weekend mornings and get to the door by 9am."}
{"text":"One of the favourite dim dum, nice and clean. Special price for dim sum before 10:45am."}
{"text":"Spring Villa was a let down. I heard that this place had good dim sum, but it was a far cry from that. The only thing that compensates for this is that if you place your order before 11am on the weekdays, the medium and large dishes are the same price as the small dishes. Weekend waits are really not worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is fast, fresh and made well, not going to complain much!  The only dish I'm not a fan of is the ???..."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times. One time was at regular lunch hours and one time for the early bird special. I'll be a regular here from now on.  This place is more high-end than average. Prices are noticeably more expensive than the low/medium end stuff, but I think it's worth it for the most part. Their early bird special is $3 all sizes but it's for a reduced menu. This is a great deal. At regular prices, it's $3 for small and $1 increment for each size but with their full menu.  What makes this place stand out are 1) They are less oily than most places (on most dishes) 2) They seem to use less MSG 3) They have many unique dishes not found in your standard dim sum place 4) Their service is noticeably better than your average Chinese traditional restaurant.  They have many of your standard dishes like Har Gow and pot rice. To name a few unique dishes, I had red rice roll with vegetables inside, walnut dessert, congee soup with melons and diced pork/shrimp, and many others that are hard to describe in English. A few reviews I read commented about the lack of unique items. This cannot be true. I've tried many places in the GTA and Spring Villa stands out.   This place gets packed quickly. I came right at 9am for the early bird special and it was ok. If you come at 10am you may have to start waiting."}
{"text":"Came upon this place at the recommendation of an uncle.  Went with 4 other (non asian) buddies of mine two of whom had never had dim sum before if you can imagine that.    It's a pretty good experience.  They do a good job of keeping the place much nicer looking than the average dimsum place.  It seems more like a good Chinese banquet/wedding hall and it's not a very large space in general.  They don't bring the carts around so you choose from their menus which as of last weekend were all text based - but still fairly easy to follow and identify.    We got there around 1 pm on a Saturday and didn't have any issues finding parking or a place but that's fairly late for dimsum.  We had reasonably good service but this may have been because it was fairly late.  Not that this is always a fantastic indicator for authenticity especially in Toronto, but when we did get there, it was about 3/4 full and the guys I brought were the only non-oriental looking people there.    We ordered a number of dishes but the biggest hits were the sweet egg bun (not exactly sure if that was the name on the menu), the fried shrimp balls (though we made a bit of a mess of the red vinegar) and the braised baby bok chois which were specially ordered.  We (all guys) ordered a ton of food and we were all ridiculously full, and we surprisingly finished everything but the total came to an average of just about $20 including tip which was in line with what my uncle thought would average $15 and all in all quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today.  I haven't been here for a long time but it's just changed management, so we decided to try it out.  We only ordered 6 dishes of dim sum and they were all 2* max.   We ordered the basics, har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, beef rice rolls, steamed salmon fish head and shrimp paste squid.  There was something not right with each dish.  Beef rice roll was thick and not smooth, filling was ok.  Sui mai was not juicy, dry and bland.  Chicken feet was too sweet and pale in colour, not brown enough.  Squid was too sweet and cut up too small.  Best dish was har gow but not worth the price.  I can get much better dim sum at the lower end restaurants.    Service is ok here but it's because there's not many patrons, hence the 3* rating.  Not worth the prices they charge for this mediocre food.  They seem to have a lot of dinner specials, like sea cucumber in abalone sauce for only $2.99 each.  Peking duck for only $22.50.  Might give dinner a try but not coming for dim sum again."}
{"text":"As others have recommended, be sure to get here early (before 930) on the weekend to avoid a line at the door.   We really enjoyed the dim sum. The mushroom and pea shoot dumplings were really great. And my daughter loved the special BBQ pork and egg white bun."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time, supposedly new owners which I can believe since familiar faces are missing from the picture.  If you come for their early morning dim sum special (9am to 10:45am) dishes are $2.99 each. Be prepared to pay cash as the don't accept credit cards for this deal.  I think someone should have told management because they took my credit card only to come back 5 min later to tell me to pay cash (back to the new faces comments).  The congee was tasty, the fried squid tentacles were not too chewy but the rest of the dim sum tasted old. The steam spare ribs almost took out my front teeth trying to get the rubber meat off the bone. The pork dumplings could have replaced the rubber balls I get from the dental office as my treasure chest pick.   Doubtful I will be coming back...but I should have known as in the past there was a line up to come for the early morning dim sum special and this time...plenty of room to pick and choose your table...."}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law came here for dim-sum a while back, and suggested this as our lunch venue yesterday.  Having to wait for a table on a Saturday, while inconvenient, is a good sign.  This place offers ordering dim-sum from the menu, which makes life a little quieter.  If you're into the hustle-and-bustle of the usual push-cart dim-sum style, this will not be for you.  In other words: know thy dim-sum, or else you're better off with the other system.  Lunch started off well: nicer decor and place-settings, and a pretty good quality tea.  Variety is also pretty good considering that all the choices had to be printed there on one page.  They had a few choices that are a little out of the ordinary, which is welcome.  It's also arranged in a somewhat meaningful way by section.  Quality ran from good to very good.  No blow-by-blow, as I often hear the gripe that I'm too full of words.    Compared to other dim-sum places, Spring Villa is a touch more pricey.  But wait till you see their DINNER menu.  There's a 2-person 'Sweetheart' dinner choice that's $198!  They also specialize in specialty Chinese soups: there are about a half dozen choices, all of which are $98 (enough for 10).  Not going to get a chance to try either one this time!"}
{"text":"It's been over 10 year I have not walk into this place. The first thing I know he service is quick. Everything I ask for comes quickly.  The food is pretty still. Although we only had  Dim sum but it was good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This place was super busy on a Monday afternoon. We had to wait a good half hour to get seated. A good sign I guess.  Dim sum was pretty decent. Pricey for dim sum, but the service was good and you didnt have to spend time flagging down the ladies nor did you have to worry about being banged by carts squeezing by your table.  My favorites: fried taro, spicy fried squid and fried shrimp.  The runner ups: har-gow and wonton soup that came in an individual sized bowl with one large wonton that exploded into yummy goodness when poked."}
{"text":"It's Boxing Day & they're open! Everything we ordered was spot-on, we tried around nine dim sum dishes - my favorite was the pork & mushroom wrapped in bean curd. The place is clean and bright. I like it that the seats & tables are comfortably spaced & guests are able to move around easily, & the tables are large enough to hold lots of dim sum dishes. The green tea, chrysanthemum tea, & jasmine teas are excellent, the tea ware they were served in better than average. Customer service was both friendly & efficient. Full Marks! Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. We've been looking for a few alternative Dim Sum restaurants and decided to try this place after reading the reviews. Overall this place offers all the standard dishes plus some interesting twists on some tradition, deep fried tofu in egg noodle roll (worth a try).  But the reason I gave this place a three star is because all the food is bland. Every dish seemed to lack in flavor.   Otherwise, the service was good and they have a $2.99 special on all small, medium and large plates till 11am.  Stay away from the stuffed eggplant!  lol"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Cleaner venue and tasty dim Sum, improvement from century palace, the usual place my in laws like to attend.  Everything was great, except the bill! Its about 3x more than our usual Dim Sum place?! Came to $150 for 6 people Dim Sum. That is around $25 per person. Usually pay around $10 PP for dim sum...so despite good food and service, not sure I will return.  In comparison we went to Kwan Dim Sum a couple months ago (St. Claire and Yonge St) same  prices, but seemed worth it given the nice dining venue and slightly more creative food presentation."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese. great food and value. Service is above average and they have a special all plates $2.60 dim sum time. Worth going."}
{"text":"A bit spendy, but pretty good!  I stopped in for some dim sum, looking for my next great place.  Spring Villa does not use the carts, and does not have the variety of dishes of some places, but food quality was good, and the portions were a bit on the large size.  One of my dishes was the squid, which was surprisingly tough.  I was not interested in a jaw workout, so I passed on that dish.  The rest of the meal was good.  Due to the size of the portions, this is best as a group destination, where you can select a bunch of dishes and have the ability to sample a greater variety."}
{"text":"Service is okay and the food is okay. Did find a small piece of hair in one of our dishes as well as a piece of a metal thingy used for the Peking Duck in the bamboo container with the flour wraps but those are minor things. Been here for dim sum and dinner and I would say it's okay. Would be back."}
{"text":"First time and last.  All staffs have a good looking uniform but very bad service mind.  Fancy dim sum dishes, which over-necessities. Plus, they charge you for a TAB WATER. Luckily not located in downtown because they will not survive."}
{"text":"Dim sum here today. Great har gow but the rest indifferent though not overpriced. Attentive service in high end surroundings."}
{"text":"Came for a wedding in late September and found the experience generally pleasant. Food was well portioned so that it could be evenly split among the table. Quality of the food was okay/nice, typical wedding banquet food, nothing too extravagant or out of the ordinary. Decorations were done nicely, reception/foyer area and chairs/tables done well.   A few things I found odd was a lack of a \"dance\" space in the restaurant, which was probably because the space itself is already small, so any space would have gone to extra tables. The other thing was that all the drinks were self-serve on two tables near the reception. So every time you wanted another wine/beer/coke you would have to go to the tables at the front of the restaurant and get it yourself. They were severely understaffed, so service was very, very slow and you often had to flag down/remind a server multiple times for anything.  The mall does empty out pretty early, so the parking lot gets fairly empty by the time you leave."}
{"text":"Surprisingly I thought this place would be busier considering it was lunch time and a couple days after Chinese New Years, but luckily they were able to accommodate our very starving group of 7 without any wait.    Over the food was ok - nothing spectacular.  The dim sum menu seemed a little limited in comparison to other places I had been, but everything I tried was ok - nothing I didn't particularly like, but nothing that blew my socks off either.  The fried octopus was nice and crunchy and probably what I liked best.  I'm giving it 2 stars b/c I think they have issues with their menu.  Because I don't eat pork, one of the dishes someone had ordered was a chicken steamed rice in a banana leaf.  When the order came (I hadn't heard the order placed so I didn't know what it was so I asked the server if it had pork in it and she said no it was chicken, as per what the menu stated).  She then came back after I had taken a few bites to indicate it did have pork in it!!  But that was not mentioned at all on the menu - I double checked and it said chicken only.  So it makes me wary if the menu translates to what you are getting.  Had someone been allergic to something and the menu was inaccurate then there would have been a real issue.  It would make me not trust eating here only because I have no clue if what I ordered based on menu description was true or not."}
{"text":"Bad service! We ordered a dim sum and it tastes sour. We asked to cancel the order and would not like a new one. We will not want another one because it may make from the same batch. The server refused and said they cannot cancel the order. The manager gave us ugly look and stood beside us for so long and keep suggesting other dim sum for us. We just don't understand why cant we just cancel it. Why do we have to order something else."}
{"text":"Dim sum done right is a must in TO as restaurants are plentiful. Furthermore, price is key so that a customer base can be built. Spring Villa was a surprising treat as this location has changed hands many times. My family came here before 11am and so all dim sum was $3. The selection was plentiful and for the most part, up to par with HK standards. One thing that topped it off was a 3 layered Napoleon dessert drizzled in cream, assorted fruit and mango sauce. Not a traditional Chibese dish but a welcomes treat at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in ages. Place is still very well maintained. Nice Clean and Bright Restaurant. Staff were very friendly and attentive. We ordered around 8 dishes.   1. Deep Fried Taro Pastries. It was smaller than usual dim sum places. But it wasn't super oily, so that was a plus. Taste wise it was not bad.  2. Shrimp Steamed Rice Rolls. Again it was smaller than other places. Taste wise was ok as well.  3. Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab. This is a first for us to see it on a dim sum menu, so we tried it. It was a very nice presentation with the deep fried edible nest around it. Taste was quite nice.  4. Deep Fried Glutinous Pork Veggie Dumplings. The presentation was very nice. They actually shaped than into pears. Taste was good.  5. Steamed Chai Siu Pork Buns with Abalone Sauce. Nothing special, taste like any other bun and I didn't really taste the abalone sauce.  6. Steamed Haw Gao Shrimp Dumplings. They were huge, juicy and tasty. Very well made,  the dumpling skin was still fully intact when you pick it up.  7. Steamed Siu Mai Pork & Shrimp Dumplings. They were also huge and juicy and had a big piece of shrimp in them. Thumbs up.  8. Steamed Liquidy Custard Buns. I actually like the buns from long ago better. They had granulated sugar that was not fully melted and it had a sandy texture which I liked. This one was quite rich in flavour. It taste good, but one is enough for me, cause the filling is really rich and thick.   Overall, nice place to be for dim sum. But price is a little more than average places. It was around $35 for our 8 dishes. But I heard they had early bird special of all sizes same price before 11am. But we paid after 11am."}
{"text":"If you ever get bored of dim sum at Casa Imperial, Spring Villa is a good alternative to go to! They're also quite busy here, but if you know someone on staff, you'll be able to get a table faster. Still, I like the dim sum selection at Casa Imperial better, so if you're in the area, I would drive there instead.  But enough about that other restaurant. This place is great for lunch or dinner, with a solid selection of dumplings, fried rice/rice noodles/vermicelli etc, and lots of different dishes. Basically, you can't go wrong! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for some Saturday dim sum. We came before 1030am on a Saturday for the early special. On a Saturday, that is a difficult task. Overall, the food is decent. Nothing notable, but nothing bad. Squib and ribs are great. Congee is pretty good. The restaurant is very nice. Big tables. Lots of space. It is always very busy, so be prepared for a wait. It could be awhile."}
{"text":"so many better domain options in the area and slightly north of here. this place didn't do it for me. toronto as such fantastic dim sum, not sure why ppl love this place so much, the siu mai was dry, the har gow collapsed as soon as i touched it with my chopstick. oh the worst part was they charged us 15% BAR TAX on top of our regular bill for three cans of cplus. needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Order dim sum from paper and not by cart. But the quality isn't good.   Beef tripe was too chewy. The beef offals was chewy and lacking in flavor. Har gas skin is a little soft. Siu Mai was also soft and lacks flavor"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good deal for 2.99 (S, M, L) Also as long as you get your order in before 11am the prices remain. So if you sit down and get your order at 10:59am you're good!  Do note that they're pretty busy and often being super close to the wire with the time will lead to missing the $2.99 special."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this dim sum restaurant: great location (Woodbine/Denison), plenty of parking, great decor, not too many people lining up, discount before 11am, and best of all, AMAZING food. What else can you ask for more.  I always go before 11am to take advantage of their $2.99 for S/M/L discount. The restaurant isn't super crowded like many dim sum places that I've been to, so the wait was short, you're seat isn't bumping into somebody else's constantly, and the noise level is manageable.   I like their large selection of dim sum items. The prices are a bit high but if you're an early riser like me and take advantage of the discount then it's a great place to go to. Here are some of the items that I enjoyed: - #1 House Special Bun (M) - #21 Cow Organs (L) - #22 Chicken (L) - #36 Fried Taro Dumpling (M) - #38 BBQ Pork Pastry (L) - #46 Rice Noodle with Fried Pastry (M)"}
{"text":"We booked a birthday reservation at this restaurant for dinner for about 15-16 people. The restaurant was plentiful in accommodating our large numbers, and had no problem seating all of us at one table. It was slightly skeptical that the restaurant was almost completely empty when we arrived, but we tried not to judge a restaurant on it's cover. We wanted to eat delicious chinese food.   Since it was not dim sum hours, we ended up getting a set menu of about 6-8 dishes. Portion sizes were plentiful for our party size, but the pace of the dishes were too disjointed. Soups would be served mid meal, rices would be served after all the dishes have arrived, and great lengths of waiting for the next dish happened between some dishes, we were confused if another dish was coming or not. Despite it's turbulent arrival, the food tasted great, with some of the classical dishes such as peking duck done respectfully, aligning with traditional flavours.   All in all, the food was mediocre to slightly more upscale. The decent portion size was definitely a plus for a party of our size. If you're looking for a no fuss Chinese restaurant, by all means go here. If you're looking for a little more sophistication, you might want to look somewhere else for inspiration."}
{"text":"This restaurant USED to be my favourite dim sum spot.  Food was great, staff was efficient and friendly, and overall, the place felt higher in experience than most.   However they recently went through a change in ownership or management and now the food is OK...almost as good as before.  But the service is not as good now now and overall feels like a cheap restaurant.  The \"hosts\" at the front assigning seating are not good, the women delivering the food seem angry, but the two male younger managers (who I think are carry overseas from before) are still good.  I would give the food 4 out of 5 and service 1.  So overall 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Expect long wait time if you arrive after 10am for the early bird special. Had to wait at least 20 min before we were seated. Once you are seated they mark the time down on the bill so that they know you are part of the early bird special pricing. Food arrived pretty quickly after placing the order. Enjoyed all the dishes but nothing really stood out and its pretty much the same offerings like many other dim sum places. I find that many dim sum places no longer offer as many steamed buns like the sweet lotus bun which is one of my favorites. I still prefer Fancy Restaurant for my dim sum go to spot."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I got the better end in terms of service compared to some of the reviews I see here. It was relatively easy to wave down a waiter or waitress if we needed something (say, water/tea refill). We also got the bill relatively fast after we gave them the order form.  In terms of the food, it was overall good, but there were a few misses.  Positives: - Siu mai - Dough rice noodle roll - Veggie dumplings - Omasum with tofu - Stir fried mushroom and fungus  Negatives: - Curry cuttlefish (way too mushy, it just melted in my mouth) - Overall limited selection, but they do good with what they have  Total bill came to just over $50 for 8 dishes and a party of 3. Slightly overpriced for what I received, but if my friends and/or relatives suggest coming back here I wouldn't mind."}
{"text":"nice limited dim sum. the service to get your food out is very long, so expect a very long lunch time. the quality is not bad. the shrimp dumpling were over cook ,because when you try to pick it up, the whole thing were falling apart. siumai was good. chicken feet, hm... need more taste. bbq bun, too sweet custard (tan tat) is interesting, usually the top is yellow, this one is white. but the crust was quite nice. over all, the food was ok. you wouldn't be too disappointed. as I mentioned, limited selection, but ok. and the food come out very slow."}
{"text":"Food is just fair. Manager there was giving us faults information when we were ordering, but she neglected to admit she was wrong when we were paying for the bill. Asked for a recipt but was only given a transaction slip with a date stamped that was created from a calculator. No restaurant information, no gst number Poor service Fair food, not worth to go. Definitely won't go back again!"}
{"text":"If I was writing this review before father's day.  This would of easily been a 4.  But after some shady practices I know I won't be back anytime soon.  Pros: Dim sum is pretty good.  Cons: Shady business tactics absurd customer service  Let's get one thing straight.  The only reason you get to dim sum before 11am is to take advantage of the special price.  You don't line up early in the morning or wait for a table for sometimes close to an hour to pay regular price.  Most places don't have the specials on holidays but it's explicitly written on menus when it comes to this.  This is where Spring Villa failed.  We got their father's day morning right at 9am.  There was already a huge line up waiting to get in.  Once we got in that's when the trouble started.  As soon as we gave in our order sheet, that's when the servers told you that they were not honouring the special price for father's day.  There was no notice of this whatsoever.  We then talk with some people from the surrounding tables and they had no idea.  They were also told once they placed their order.  Pretty damn shady if you ask me.  Father's day is not a statutory holiday and if they were going to pull this, they need to let people know ahead of time before they place their orders.  The final straw came from a lady who took her father out who sat right next to us.  She actually called ahead of time to confirm whether or not they were having the special price today.  The man of the phone told her yes.  When she spoke to the same man at the restaurant he said he must of made a mistake because there is no special.  Again, shady..  He offered her a 10% discount after to make up for it. When it came time to pay the bill, she payed by credit card.  The same guy now says you have to pay by cash to receive discount.  If she paid by credit card, she would have to pay regular price.  Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!!!  This discount was agreed upon before with no mention of cash only.  I was pretty mad at what was happening behind me and if my little one wasn't there I would of made a scene myself.  It didn't even happen to me myself but it was one of the worst dim sum experiences I've ever seen.  When we left, there were tons of people waiting outside all oblivious that Spring Villa was not honouring the special price.  Just one big fail today.  The dim sum itself is pretty good.  There are some unique items that you don't see anywhere else.  It was just completely offset by their shady business tactics.  I understand that you don't have to have that special, but when you don't it should written somewhere or told to customers before they sit down and order.  I hope that lady files some sort of complaint.  I felt so bad for her.  I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The line-ups here on Saturday morning are pretty redonk.  Get here by 8:45 am if you want a seat when the doors open at 9 am!   Everything is made fresh and takes a bit of time for it to come out of the kitchen, so don't expect to leave before 10:30 am.  The dim sum here is carefully crafted and there are handfull of choices for the herbivore.  Marinted tofu, deep-fried salted Japanese squash, soy chunks in a curry satay sauce and even mushrooms and young pea leaves in rice noodles.  Finish off with a piece of the soft, fluffy Malaysian-style dessert cake.  Can't say too much about the dinner menu as there isn't much for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I love this place for dim sum! I went there at 930am which was a good time since it was still kind of empty. We ordered so much food lol, got carried away and forgot the special is only S/M/L and not XL XXL etc. The fried taro pork dumpling came first and it was melt in your mouth. The ha gao was good as well. The siu mai was meh. Shrimp roll, very slippery and yummy. The beef short ribs were tender and delicious. Spare ribs were ok, nothing special. The turnip cake was the right consistency and flavor. All washed down with palette cleansing bo lei/pu erh tea. The servers were nice and they speak Mandarin and Cantonese.   Special: $2.99 cash only for S/M/L and pay before 10:45am(special hrs 9am-11). The washroom was clean. Before you get seated, don't be seated near the door. We made this mistake and our food got cold faster.   Overall, I would come here again! Much better than other dim sum places in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Had dim sum lunch. Found everything very bland.  Food took a long time to arrive. There are better dim sum places. Wouldn't go back at all."}
{"text":"Their dimsum is very good! I always go before 11am - small&med&large all at $3/each!"}
{"text":"The Dim Sum here is quite delicious, there's a good selection, and is quality. Can be argued that it is kind of expensive for dishes, but it is cheaper before 11am. It's just quality chinese food."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Not only was the service slow but the waiting staff were rude. I don't expect much in terms of service when it comes to dim sum but this place has the worst service. Oh, if you don't speak Cantonese you're SOL."}
{"text":"Dim sum orders from a slip.  No surprises from the steam cart ladies.  The minced pork with peanuts chiu chow style dim sum is a gem.  Order the snow pea leaves stir fried.  Char siu bao have fluffy whit steamed buns that come in threes.  There is a pork bun in abalone sauce; order two pieces for each guest because one is not enough.    The manager is more than happy to help if you are not familiar with which to order."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese cuisine restaurants in Markham! Food is presented beautifully, the food itself is pretty great, restaurant is generally very clean--and all this without the snooty-ness that you get with a lot of the other \"high-end\" dim sum restaurants!"}
{"text":"Spring Villa is a great place for dim sum, provided that you arrive early for their $2.99 special (for S, M and L dim sum) when you place your order before 11AM. Otherwise it might be on the pricey side for dim sum.  The interior is nice and bright, and tables have nice table cloths and chairs has fabric covers, unlike the dingy looking dim sum places you find in downtown.  There is a tea charge per person, which some reviewers complain about - I just want to say this is a standard for dim sum places even in Asia.  Dim sum on the most part is good. Some items I ordered (such as the lotus leaf rice) were a bit light tasting and could definitely be better, but I would prefer dishes to be light tasting rather than too salty.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Wow the food is great!!!   Slightly higher priced but the quality of the food, the high level of service and the cleanliness warrants it.  The congee was very good, the dim sum was awesome and made with fresh ingredients.  The tea was tasty.  I will be back here for sure.  Job well done!!!!"}
{"text":"So apparently if you finish prior to 11am, all items are $2.99!!! No wonder the place was 1/2 empty when we strolled in around 12pm with a party 8. Needles to say we were seated immediately.   Let's start with the chrysanthemum tea we ordered, it tasted so off and smelled like dirty socks!  Out of my 30 years of dim sum experience, this was a first.  After we changed to a different type of tea, it was much better. No foul taste or smell.   As for the food, I didn't think it was anything special.  They served all the usual suspects and it tasted average to me. At regular price, I think there are better places like dragon boat.   Service was interesting, one of the manager came by to promote a concert taking place at the resto and asked us to buy a table when we had no clue who the singer was.  At the end, when I asked for 2 small containers to pack up our leftovers, the waitress raised her voice and told me I don't need 2, 1 is good enough. I'm sorry (not really) but I prefer my steamed vs deep fried items separate. This experience was also a first."}
{"text":"Spring Villa has changed owners and evidently chefs as well.  What used to be one of my favourite, yet pricier Dim Sum spots in Markham is now my most disappointing Dim Sum experience ever!  Sticky rice in lotus leaf was a giant pyramid of mushy rice with no leaf wrapper and a tiny bit of meat and squash hidden inside.  Siu mai and Har gao - the only positive thing I can say is they were huge, otherwise flavour and texture were all wrong.  Pork ribs with black beans - huge fatty pieces in a pool of oil... with a thread of metal - harder than foil - on one rib.  In fairness they did not charge for this dish.   The deep fried glutinous rice ball filled with meat was the tastiest item but again, was a massive pear shape and drowning in oil with every bite.  The only thing that made the experience bearable was that every dish was $3.    Buh-bye Spring Villa, you are NOT worth the drive to Markham!"}
{"text":"This was just so so, not sure what the others Yelpers ordered at dim sum.   Found many of the dishes to be average to bland,which makes me wonder, is a lack of msg added a good thing and the other places a bad thing?   Some bigger misses; eggplant & shrimp little flavor even though it looked to be covered in a black bean sauce, Japanese red bean pudding was not a pudding but jello, sticky rice with chicken was really bland no flavor from the leaf at all. Pork rice roll only had meat at one end of the roll he rest was just green onion.   Good: Japanese egg tofu roll- soft eggy tofu pan seared for a crispy skin with a hint of 5 spice, layered with a piece of steamed Asian veg then gently rolled with blanket of rice noodle.   All else was ok.  Wouldn't come back but it was cleaner than other places and had easy parking."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with the family for dinner and there were plenty of tables available (not empty but not packed). We ordered a peking duck - it's carved infront of your table and served with cucumber sticks, carrots, spring onions, and fresh pancakes. The duck along with the dozen other dishes we ordered were all good and the dishes came out at a remarkable pace. The service is also excellent, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"best milk/egg tarts here...when it comes to dim sum not every place will serve you decent food. but the food isn't bad here been here several times, and once for dinner. i recommend spring villa"}
{"text":"We didn't come here for their well known early bird dim sum, we come here for dinner.   We, party of 7, actually made a reservation tonight. It was a smart thing to do because for some reason tonight it got quite busy. It is really a good sign as it was snowing outside. It was a bit noisy but that is expected in any Guangzhou cuisine restaurants.   We ordered seafood and tofu soup, Peking duck - 2 course, 5.5 lbs. lobster with Maggie sauce, Chicken with chestnuts in hot pot, and fish with vegetables.  Let me tell you guys, this place knows how to cook. All the dishes we ordered tasted great and delicious!!!  After the meals, the servers brought us deserts; green tea and mango jelly and red bean soup.  I asked for more and they happily brought more to our table. So good!!!  This place, in terms of food in my opinion, is way better than Casa Imperial (which we dine regularly) and the price is competitive.   In a lot of my reviews for restaurants, I always end by saying will I come back again?  This place is definitely yes. The food here is unbelievably good. You don't bring your dates here but this is the kind of place you'd bring your relatives, grandparents and close friends.   Food:  5/5 Ambience:  2/5 Service: 5/5 Cleanliness:  4/5"}
{"text":"We are Vancouverites currently living in a small town in the U.S. and were desperately craving for some good dim sum... And we found it here.  First of all, the early bird special is amazing. 9am-10:45am, all dim sum items are $3. It's so great. We were there at 9:15, and seated quickly, but the restaurant was starting to get full. By 9:30, there were people starting to wait to be seated. Be there early! The two of us were full and the bill was $20, including tea.  The dim sum, it was fabulous. Up to par with what you would get in Vancouver. The skins of the steamed dumplings were all tender and not gummy, and the filling was abundant. To my surprise, I loved the BBQ pork bun- it's the cheapest item on the menu but it was so good. The bun itself was amazingly soft, and nice amount of filling. My husband loved the sticky rice wrap. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. And the greatest thing is that the dim sum here is not very oily- I've been to joints where it's so oily that you feel heavy after eating. Not here. Everything is seasoned on the light side, and the oil usage is minimal.   I will be back when in Toronto. Heck I might drive across the border just to eat here!"}
{"text":"This Dim Sum review is a year late but since I got some time to kill and my family is up in Toronto this week to enjoy this place along w/ many others, I thought I take a minute to do a quick Yelp.  If I had to choose between Dim Sum or dinner at Spring Villa, I would opt for Dim Sum due to the pricing aspect.  The tea offered is top notch, better than 80% out there.  Dim Sum served is very traditional, you will not find any extraordinary new or creative Nouveaux dishes but the traditional dishes offered are all quite good.  Service and cleanliness are also top notch."}
{"text":"Dimsum on Sunday morning  Food is yummy. Good variety. Comfortable seating.  Baby Friendly?  - No diaper changing table - Enough room for a stroller"}
{"text":"Came during early hours to catch up with friends and the restaurant was good! Food was regular dimsum but nothing fancy. It's a good quick go to place for sure."}
{"text":"If you're looking for new/unique dim sum items, you will not get them here. What Spring Villa does well is your typical staple dim sum dishes, but executed better than the average. A bit more expensive than other dim sum places around the area."}
{"text":"Spring Villa in my opinion is the default place to go for dimsum. They have an early bird special that starts at 9 and I've only been to it once as I would much rather sleep in. Food is good and you order from a menu and arrives hot- no cart service here!  I haven't been here for dinner so I cannot speak to their banquets or dinner items."}
{"text":"This is my dim sum place of choice out of so many different choices in Scarborough /Markham.  After discovering this place,  my standard for dim sum had definitely raised the bar.  The dish that makes me want to keep coming back is the stir fried mushroom and fungus.  It's a little pricey (mushrooms were 9$) but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Spring Villa is really a good restaruant for dim sum.   We went on a Monday for lunch.. and we still need to wait for a table! This is not the special price time slots and the price is a lot more expensive but this place is still pack with people!  Always more fun to go with a bunch of people, as we can order more different food, I love the steamed beef rice noodle roll as there is watercress inside.. the first time I ate this combination. The chicken pie is great too! It has that melt in your mouth yumminess! All the other dim sum dishes are all really good!  Really need to come during specials, then one can order more food and have a bash!  They accepts Amex, Visa and MC!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best dim sum place I have been to. The food was on par, not exciting. But what makes it really five stars is that they serve ALL chinese dim sum foods from your basic plate of Siu Mai to the fancier stuff like grilled squid tentacles all for $2.60 before 11AM... though they are very flexible about that time period. You can order so much for under $60 that you may not want to touch another plate of Chinese food for another week.  Make you get here early and just park down and order a bunch of junk. If you don't finish it, you can always take it home."}
{"text":"My family comes here for dim sum all the time. The taste is pretty decent and the price is reasonable when compared to other dim sum restaurants in the area. My favorites are meaty squid tentacles and fried taro. If I remember correctly, their fried taro has a avocado and eel in it. Very interesting indeed. Service here is just so-so. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been here before."}
{"text":"Toronto is known to have some of the best Chinese food out there, and this place is no exception. I went for dim sum, and had some delicious food! The short ribs were very tasty and juicy. The soft shell crabs were crispy and flavorful. The Congee was thick and rich. The \"Lo Pak Goh\" (Not sure the English name, something to do with radishes) was really some of the better ones I've ever had. The sticky rice in lotus leaves were on point. And my favorite dim sum dish ever, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, had a slight variation to it that had this sweet topping made of egg whites I think. The pork was delectable and the bun was soft, like biting into a cloud, if that's what clouds were like. No, this was probably better than biting into a cloud, because this bun, especially with that topping, was tasty! It was really awesome! Finally for dessert, we ordered this triple decker Napoleon pastry that was probably 9 inches tall (22.5 cm for you non-Americans), and it was the flakiest and puffiest pastry I've ever had. Cutting into it was like setting off a bunch of firecrackers as you listen to the cackle and pop of the pastry. It was great. And we got stuffed, brought home three boxes of leftovers, for about $70 (I freeloaded off of family, so I can't give a more precise cost analysis). Talk about quantity to cost ratio! Very enjoyable experience. Reason I'm giving 4 stars versus 5 is most likely due to expectations. As good as the food was, this mainly met my pretty high expectations given how many good Chinese food places there are around here. Definitely an awesome place I'd recommend to come check out."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for their dim sum. It's $2.99 per dish for small, medium, and large before 11am daily (including weekends). Tea charge is $1.5 per person which is standard.  Their menu offers a good selections of dishes. I was happy with the selections. Food quality was not amazing but very decent. Service was efficient; they were fast with bringing our food and refill the tea. Restaurant was clean and not super crowded; we didn't have to wait a long time for a table for dim sum on weekend which is a nice bonus for me.   1. Shrimp dumplings (hargao) was nicely done. Large shrimps and nice texture (not over cooked) 2. I quite enjoyed the Chiu chow dumplings (peanut, chives and peanut). It's a bit healthier and less greasy but still has good flavour.  3. Beef offal: was highly disappointed. It's supposed to be soft and tender but it wasn't. Don't think it was cooked long enough.  4. Steamed rice rolls (Cheung fun) with spareribs: was very different, only ever seen it offered here. It's quite filling and good flavour.  5. Egg tarts were just ok. I have had better.  6. Sesame balls with egg yolk: this was the highlight for me as the other places don't normally offer it. Deep fried sesame with egg custard inside. It's so rich and delish.  7. Congee was large portion and comforting on a cold morning. Overall it was a good first dim sum experience here."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for unique dim sum dishes and something to separate itself from other Chinese restaurants.. but it just did not meet the expectation from me  it was your typical dimsum dishes...  it seems to price itself as one of the higher end dimsum or chinese restaurants around... but meh... it was just so so ... it wasnt bad by any means.. its just very average...  keep in mind i came for dimsum only.. not dinner service... so i cant speak for their dinner service.  i just felt like i had a lot better dimsum, else where.. also the line up is not cool..  i probably will hit up other dimsum places before i come back here again."}
{"text":"mmMMmhhh.. had a nice meal. I agree the price is above average, but the service was good and all the food came came out fresh.  This was a Saturday late lunch. The only dish I did not like was the fried squid.. I like the fried battered one at rol san."}
{"text":"Went here for Dim Sum  Service is excellent in this place.  Food was okay, still above average fare, their shrimp dumpling was excellent, one of the better tasting ones.  I think I'll still go for Very Fair for the dim sum though.  The place was not packed like other places for the time I went.  I think that's because of the excessively high price.  For 2 people we spent close to $30 on Dimsum.  I still have to try their Peking duck, someone told me they were better than the one in Chung King.  No free wifi"}
