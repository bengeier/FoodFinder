{"text":"The portion as mentioned below are generous, however the heading \"Korean BBQ \" is misleading as this is not really Korean food.  Yet there are few better choices to eat on campus than here."}
{"text":"First of all I have to say that this is a pretty good lunch location if you're at the University and starving. The portions from this BBQ food court joint are gigantic, bordering on ridiculous.   I've seen Students regularly buying a single meal and sharing it, because there's so much food!  You have a choice from two side dishes that are usually some of the most interesting combinations of food that I've ever seen. They add two ice-cream scoops of rice, then pile the BBQ meat on top of the giant mound.  I have to say that It's a good thing that the BBQ is so delicious because these merchants will never win any hospitality awards for their unfriendly and grim demeanor. They appear genuinely displeased to serve you, but like I say, they make up for it with the giant pile of food.  My favorite is the spicy chicken and beef - which again is a huge and very yummy mess of food. Only other real complaint is that they changed from an excellent mixed vegetable side dish to cafeteria style peas and carrots - oh well."}
