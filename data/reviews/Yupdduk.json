{"text":"Had high expectation for this place as I love ddukbokki. We ordered a combo menu, which included  ddukbokki, simple rice dish (rice and seaweed) and steamed eggs. The ddukbokki did not disappoint, however the rice was rare... al dente! 
We also ordered beer.. three types of beer... domestic exported and premium... they charge premium for 'canadian' beer... when asked again... they just said canadian is premium....."}
{"text":"I love spicy food and this is probably the best ddeokbokki place I've been to in all of Toronto. 
I have to admit, my mouth felt like it had 3rd degree burns but honestly, the best thing ever!! 
Their egg soup, rice balls and ddeokbokki combo is great, highly recommend! Although, level 1 is probably all you're ever going to amount to..."}
{"text":"Oh dear, it was so spicy!! Wouldn't have made it through the meal if it weren't for the seaweed rice balls. All in all, tasted great!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something very spicy this is the place to go, their menu consists of Only 3 mains and many side orders that can be eaten as complementary to the mains such as deep fried dumplings, steamed egg, rice rolled in seaweed.  All their dishes are all known for their spiciness. They have mild, original, spicy, and very spicy.  I tried spicy since I can take a lot of heat and it was very delicious and bearable.  For the ones who can't take heat be careful with their food it can upset your stomach."}
{"text":"Rude customer services, I noticed how the waitress was rude, ive been to korea and seen this type of attitude where if our not korean and dont look like them, then they treat you like savages entering their territory....except your in our territory soo stop that entitled attitude of yours. Oh I was so mad, I didnt even tip her, and left......I didnt come in to receive such nasty entitled crap from the server, sorry and this place is dirty and there wasnt anything special, save your money and the unnecessary mistreatment and go to another korean resturant nearby that cares about all their customers."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the beer. A bottle of coors light is $6 bucks and although they have cheaper options for domestic beers, but they only have coors light and charge it as a premium beer which is $6 per bottle. Me and my friends went in and ordered 6 bottles of coors light assuming it as a domestic beer, but ended up getting charged for premium beers and paid $40 bucks just for the drinks."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment purely cause I was craving rice cake and good old Korean style street food.

The menu was small but honestly they served a  couple staple dishes which they specialized in. I got the thirty dollar combo which feeds around two or three people. The combo consisted of a steamed egg in stone pot, rice ball and seaweed as well as the big bowl of rice cake filled with rice cake, cock tail sausage, fish cake and cabbage... Oh and of course cheese.

It was tasty be sure to not pick super spicy cause it is quite intense. The level goes 1, 2, and 3. I opted for a level 0.5 which was also an option. The spice builds up after eating it for awhile so beware. I also saw people get milk to combat the spice.

Overall a filling meal. But to be honest since the stuff was pretty basic it was definitely stuff you can just make yourself. I would recommend it as a party to go take away sorta meal for big gatherings."}
{"text":"My taste buds were not ready..
WARNING: If you can't handle spice, DON'T come here or ask for the LOWEST level of spice.

Background info: I find kimchi spicy. 

I came here with my friend who loves (and can handle) spicy food. We ordered the spicy kimchi soup base with fish cakes, rice races, and cheese. It came with rice balls and steamed egg. I believe we got one level up from the least spiciest one. 
My friend and I were both dying. 

Keep in mind that I'm also the type of person that continues to eat spicy food that tastes good even though my mouth is on fire. 

Besides the food, the place itself felt \"sticky.\" Washroom definitely has to be maintained and checked on more often. The workers, especially the front staff, were a bit slow to order and carry out tasks. They didn't check up on us. 
Overall, the place looked pretty diverse - there were students and families. 

Price was decent for what we were getting too and how we had leftovers after."}
{"text":"I had heard many funny stories about people wiping tears away from their eyes and chugging milk to stave off the spiciness of the dukbokki here.  They have a branch that is apparently very popular in the US and seems to be doing very well (in reference to their Yelp page).  Those two reasons along with a Facebook share of my friend's experience here propelled me to give this restaurant a go.  

I went with my boyfriend for my first round and then again with my friends a month later. The first thing you'll notice is that decor isn't a main attraction. You'll find tables and chairs on the cheaper end of the quality spectrum, but they serve their function.  Most of their tables only fit up to three people each, so expect to be broken up into several groups if you come with a party larger than 4.  Mind you, when I went the second time with a party of 6 they originally said they couldn't serve us. Then, I pointed to two separate tables that were next to each other at the back of the seating area and suggested splitting my party into two groups, leaving a space between the two adjacent tables to ensure there was still a walkway to the washrooms for other patrons.  They finally conceded. In essence, I wasn't impressed that they couldn't suggest a quick solution like that (splitting parties among several tables) on their own and just simply wanted to turn away business from a large group.  If you come with a group larger than four and most of the tables around the room have been taken up already, don't rely on the servers who may turn you away. Instead, think about how you could sprinkle members of your group around the restaurant. 

As for their food, they specialize in super-sized shareable bowls of dukbokki and you can make a combo by adding steamed egg and rice balls wrapped in seaweed.  The bowl alone is about 20 dollars and my boyfriend and I felt it was filling for a party of 2.  The combo is about 26 dollars and my party of 6, which got 2 combos, felt that it was a decent amount for 3 people per combo - 2 people per combo if you're on the hungrier side.  Once you split the bill between 2-3 people, you're paying about 10  dollars each, so it has a reasonable price to portion ratio compared to the rest of the restaurants in the Willowdale area.  

The levels of spiciness range from 0-3 and you can up the ante with 0.5 increments.  When I went with my boyfriend, I got 1.5 as 1 is their most popular level for those who can normally take a lot of spiciness.  At level 1.5, the spice was starting to become unbearable half way through the bowl.  When I went the second time with my friends, I downgraded to level 1 and it was a similar level of spiciness you would find in most dukbokki served in Toronto, meaning that it's definitely spicy, but not enough to bother you if you're good with spiciness.  Therefore, my suggestion is to get at least 1.5 or 2 to really get a kick out of the spiciness.  They are known for their spiciness, so go wild! There are tissue boxes everywhere and they serve milk and beer to help stave off the spiciness if it becomes too overwhelming!

The quality of the food is just decent. They don't care about their presentation, so the dishes come out sloppily-made.  Tastewise, it's all dependent on how you enjoy the spiciness. I liked it when I was sweating from level 1.5 instead of when I was breezing through level 1.  The amount of rice cakes, tofu skins, sausages, and cheese in the dukbokki also varies. When I went the first time, I felt that there was more compared to my last visit with my friends.  The steamed egg and rice balls were nothing to write home about and was not even worth combining with the dukbokki. 

In all fairness, if you get tired of the lack of  spiciness with most dukbokki in Toronto, then visit this restaurant for their customizable spiciness.  Other than that, there are other types of food in the area that will provide better service, decor, and food."}
{"text":"This casual Korean eatery is located right at Finch and Beecroft. Came here as a party of 4 on Friday at 6PM. It doesnt have a lot of seating but we were able to get a table right away. The menu is basically only topoki and you add other toppings to it. We got the half topoki and half fish cakes set ($23.99 base price) with eggs ($2.49), vienna sausages ($3.49?) and at level 1 spicy level. There are 3 spicy levels and the dish is still spicy at level 0 apparently.

Waited around 15mins for it. We actually ordered it with no sausages because of my friend's dietary restrictions but they added them so she had to order another dish just for herself. That was a downer but we were able to pack up the leftovers afterwards. 

The dish itself is a pretty huge portion; basically a giant bowl of sauce with all the fixings. you don't really need to eat it with rice or anything as the rice cakes itself are carby enough, and if you are someone like me who isn't an absolute diehard for spicy food then you may steer clear of eating too much of the sauce in general. The food was really tasty; can't go wrong with lots of sauce, cheese and sausages. The rice cakes were really chewy which I liked cause some places will serve stale rice cakes and it can be obvious. I personally found it quite spicy and was leaking fluids from my orifices (nose and eyes) while eating it. Its the kind of spicy where you don't feel it unless you take a break from eating. The combo we ordered is good for 3 people or 2 very hungry people.

Overall it was a really satisfying meal and I would love to visit again with other friends for them to try it!"}
{"text":"I came here to try the spicy rice cake with cheese. I've ordered the combo. The dish was very boring, and the soup base was rather thick. The rice ball with seaweed was mediocre, nothing to write home about. I also found the restaurant a bit messy and seats have sauce on it. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon.."}
{"text":"First time here. We came here on a late night for a drink and maybe some snacks. I like the atmosphere here. Lots of energy. Very friendly service. This place is known for serving spicy Korean food. No vegan friendly options though. Their complementary curly fries is covered with mayo? cheese? idk some sort of animal products."}
{"text":"DONT COME HERE IN LARGE GROUPS. 

My friend who's korean took us here, a bunch of coloured kids that had no idea what we were doing. It was 5 of us and we had to wait 2 hours to get seated because there are so little chairs but so many people waiting to get food, and there's only a few items on the menu, which is ok and is easier for us to choose, the food was great and we finished it quickly, but I wouldn't come here again for a food many other restaurants can offer."}
{"text":"The food set is great to have with 2-4 people, recommend not by yourself as the sets they have are huge and for a good price that can be split among friends. However be very careful on level of spice as level 2 was still burning for both me and my friend.The service is eh because the waitress just sometimes sits down at one of the tables and goes on her phone and was unable to notice that we needed a refill on our beaker of water."}
{"text":"Didn't order the ddeokbokki like everyone else, but the spicy chicken. Was SO lip-burning spicy, but SO GOOD! We ordered it with the seaweed rice balls, and it went perfectly! 

Dishes are HUGE! Definitely can feed 3-4 easily."}
{"text":"Yummy! but expensive :( 
It's good if you go with friends to split the bill"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience! Has very good spicy rice cake, so good my cheeks are feeling numb! All you spice lovers must try this place!! My recommendation is to get the yupgi set!! Wait for everything to be served before eating anything because you will (need) then to enjoy the food! Make sure you add cheese to your yupgi toppling or your yupgi odeng!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here to try the spicy rice cake since I heard that it's a really popular place in Korea. There is no parking space for the restaurant, just street parking, but it was hard to find a parking spot. 
When we entered the restaurant, it was really messy and the empty tables were just left uncleaned, so we needed to wait for the waitress to clean the tables up before being seated down. We ordered the spicy rice cake combo and a dish of fried seaweed with noodles. The side plates they served were't quite clean and I didn't feel that this place was very sanitary.
The spicy rice cakes didn't taste very good and we were very disappointed with the fried seaweed dish..it tasted like it was kept in the freezer for centuries..
We ended up eating two bites or so and left to get real food."}
{"text":"Beware of extreme spiciness at this place! If you're not comfortable with extreme levels of spice, and I mean VERY comfortable, then this is not the place for you. If you still think you can handle it, then by all means, go ahead and try, but I've warned you!

Yupdduk is a Korean restaurant in North York that recently opened in the Yonge/Finch area. They serve only a few dishes so far. It is a chain restaurant and there are a couple of locations in the U.S., including in New York and L.A.

I wanted to try this restaurant because it was new in the neighbourhood and I watched a YouTube video about this restaurant prior to trying it out. I generally like spicy food and I knew what I was getting into so there was a part of me that thought I could handle it. Boy, was I wrong! 

I'm giving this a 2-star in consideration of everything about this place, including environment, service and food.  This place is still fairly new so it's somewhat clean; however, the chairs and tables have splatters of sauce, so I can see this place getting run down pretty quickly.  

The service there isn't great. I mean, when you ask for help, they'll come to you, but often you have to wave them down or walk up to the cash register.  Also, considering that they serve such spicy food, they could at least give a better warning or ask if we've been there before. We also had to go up in person with the water jug asking for more water. The waiters don't really check up on you to see how you're doing, and it's confusing regarding how to pay, so we ended up paying at the cash register. The good thing about this place is that they do provide several boxes of tissues lined up along their counter for you to take! We kept a box at our table.

We ordered the popular dish for two of us, which included a huge bowl of spicy sauce with vienna sausage, fish cakes, rice cakes, cabbage, and topped with mozzarella cheese. I think I ate maybe one of each of the above because the spice was just...that...deadly (to me at least). 

I don't see what the hype is about this place though. Yes, the flavours are decent, but it is essentially the same as any Korean spicy dish at other restaurants, except that it is 100x spicier. I feel like this place would do much better if the spice wasn't so extreme. It's hard to enjoy a dish when you're struggling with each bite. I will not be returning here.

Oh, and the waitress did say that they could make it less spicy, but even the \"less spicy\" was deadly. I don't even want to imagine what the regular spice is like! We even took home more than half of the dish and tried to water is down to make it less spicy, but that didn't work either."}
{"text":"I love the (nuclear) fire noodles from South Korea ([]) so many of my Korean friends recommended this place because it's supposedly to be just as spicy if not more.

When we went we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated and they wouldn't prepare our order until we sat down, which was kind of fair. We were a group of 6 and it was pretty full so that's partially our fault.

You can order the rice cakes in different spiciness levels (1, 2, and 3... 3 being the highest). We did 2.5 and let me tell you that it was spicy but a pleasant spicy for me. I can eat spicy food pretty well so if you can eat spicy food well like me, you might be disappointed because you can probably tolerate it well. If you cannot eat spicy food well then WARNING, you might cry! 

The good thing is that they refill the water jugs pretty often for you to grab and also sell little milk cartons to help you with the spiciness.

Overall I loved it but was a bit disappointed in the wait time and I guess I came in with high expectations of it being very spicy. But the fish tofu, rice cake, mini hot dogs topped with melted cheese was amazing!

I recommend this place to all of you~ make sure to bring some of your brave friends to try this place!"}
{"text":"A Korean friend reccomended as best Korean rice cakes if you like it spicy. I personally think H mart food court is best tasting out of all the places I've been to. I found this to taste similar to my favourite at h mart! Although much spicier. I got lv 2... It was bearable but I could definitely not handle any higher. My lips felt seriously burned. Did not enjoy the hot dogs in it. The cheese was yummy. My friend said it would be better with more cheese. The fish cake was large an generous. Not make veggies or other fillers which was nice. The sauce was thick and really tasty. The rice cakes were the largest I've seen. My friend thinks smaller ones are more flavourful but I dipped it In more sauce after each bite. The bowl is VERY hot temperature wise. Food also took more than 30 mins to arrive which was annoying. Also odd that the place has 5 microwaves by the entrance. Why??? The venue was also very very dirty with black stuff on the floor, wall, and tables. Its a large venue and was actually filled with other people."}
{"text":"This place can be found just west of the main intersection  yonge/finch. 
 
My friend and I ordered the regular deokbokki with cheese and Vienna sausage. It took a while for our dish to come out but well worth the wait. The food is very spicy but also has flavor behind it. Portions are huge, it could feed 3-4 people easily . they gave us a generous serving of mozzarella cheese (parts of the cheese was crunchy like it was pan fried before). The sausage we thought was going to be regular cut up hotdogs but they're like the tiny Vietnamese sausages. 

Restaurant is very clean and staff seemed to be nice. Definitely a spot for students, not sure if they serve alcohol but would go great with their food."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of friends and I have never been to this place.  I never even knew this place existed.  You only come here to get the spicy rice cakes.   The entire place is korean even the music is korean.   It did feel a bit as if I was in Seoul.  You get a bowl of rice cake and you can tell them the spiciness level.   Even mild can end up being spicy.  They put cheese on top of the bowl.  It also comes with steamed eggs.   It was alright just for the experience.  There are a lot of rice cake restaurants around the area now.   It was ok.  I'll try other places before trying this one out again."}
{"text":"the food was good but it's not that spacious, service was eh but I'd come back to get takeout"}
{"text":"I came here because I am a big fan of dukbokki. My friend and I stopped here in the afternoon and it was packed and so there was a short wait. We ordered the rick cake combo (with the steamed egg and seaweed rice balls) at 1.5 spiciness with cheese. The egg and rice balls came first and since we were really hungry, we did devoured it but tried to save it to eat with the rice cakes. With 1.5 times the spicy, it tasted really good. I can handle spicy and I find that this level is a good start if trying it for the first time. It paired well with the grapefruit chamisul. I will definitely come back ad try the 2x spicy if I'm feeling the challenge! Service was okay, there were some rowdy customers roaming around and outside the store during our time eating and that almost made me want to give it a 3 stars."}
