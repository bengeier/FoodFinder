{"text":"Order for takeout, salad used crap lettuce and burnt chicken, not very good. You can get much better food for the amount that paninis is charging."}
{"text":"It's hard to figure out where to start. Menu is the same as any other panini's so you know what to expect with the food. It's the service that is absolutely horrible. We walked in as a party of 5 on Thursday evening. No hostess in sight so we sat down at a table. After about 10 minutes of no service I went to the bar to let the bartender know we were there and ask if there would be a server for us. She assured me someone would be there soon. After the same person walked past our table about 5 times time wipe down other tables I finally got her attention. On top of looking like she was completely wasted on something, she was very slow. We realized that there was a \"normal\" server as she came up to the table a bit later.   Problem is she was working the entire room by herself. As others have mentioned, they run this place like a local bar where you have to know someone to feel welcome. The folks at the bar were being waited on hand and foot by no less than 4 bartenders while the poor slobs sitting at tables were completely ignored.  Management needs to wake up and do a better job at properly staffing the dining room!"}
{"text":"We always visit for the great service good food and great atmosphere. It's always nice when the patio is open. It's our oasis in the city."}
{"text":"Great place to go for dinner/lunch or just a drink any time of the week. Very clean and friendly on the inside. Bathrooms need updating but other than that no complaints. Food is always good. The patio is a nice place to be in the summer time."}
{"text":"As far as the bar itself: Locals who don't seem too keen on any strangers. You get the feeling that this is just another VFW or something with better decor and food (debatable...read on). 

The food: Salty. You know how when you get a little toasty and you're hungry, you seem to LOOOOVE salt? I think they have whomever happens to be the drunkest at the bar when the first orders come in be the honorary line cook for the rest of the day. everything COULD be good but it turns out to be almost ok. If you're drinking, you probably won't care. If you're getting take-out and planning on being totally sober, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Apparently this place doesn't give two craps about making a profit!  The first time my husband went here on his lunch, their horrible waitress took his and his co-worker's drink order and didn't return for 20 minutes!  

  They took a group of six there today to give the place a second chance and had the same HORRIBLE waitress (Dina).  There was a 25 wing for $15.99 special and he wanted two different sauces.  She told him she could do that, but only in orders of 6's (because it's SOOOO HARDDDD  to shake boneless wings around in sauce!!!!) so he ordered 6 of one kind and 18 of another.  SHE CHARGED HIM for FOUR ORDERS OF 6 BONELESS WINGS!  What on earth are you thinking, Panini's??  Then the party had to pay a forced gratuity on top of that - I guess she saw six people when she got to the table and figured \"Eh, no need to give good service to this table!\"

  He asked to speak to a manager about the incorrect billing and all that man had to say was \"Sorry you feel that way\"!

  And finally, a call to their corporate resulted in a \"I'll have someone call you back\" with no call as of yet.  On top of that, my husband has been sick to his stomach all night.

  Take your business elsewhere - even the Mr. Hero with its bulletproof glass had better customer service skills than this place.  Pathetic.  

  And Dina, honey, you might be better qualified to sweep floors somewhere."}
{"text":"Typical Panini's.  Nice interior.  Crowd can be a little strange, I think it just depends on the day.  
Last time we were there my friend and I got hit on by a man that had \"no game\".  We actually wrote him a list of all the things he did wrong.  We felt that we needed to do this for all woman kind."}
{"text":"Had my first visit to this particular paninis today and it was horrible. The food was sub par the waitress was unattentive and clumsy. We had planned to order a full meal appetizers and entre instead we waited 40 minutes for appetizers and decided that ordering food wasn't even worth our time. This is a great place to visit if you enjoy being ignored. The paninis in willoughby is great though and worth the drive to avoid this place"}
{"text":"I liked visiting Paninis during the Indian's game. While inside, you can see the Tribe play on four ginormous screens and a few little ones at the same time. 
The workers were very friendly and the food and service was pretty good. Sometimes we have had to wait a while but that was typically only when it was crowded."}
{"text":"Great food, delicious homemade chips and the Philly cheesesteak is awesome. LOTS of choices on the menu, it was hard to decide. 

 Place is clean with comfortable seating in several options.  Nice cocktail menu and looks like some great dessert choices too. Service was fast and friendly.  We were just passing through from out of town and felt very welcome.  Great first impression."}
{"text":"By far the worst of any of the Paninis in the area.  If you're thinking of the Euclid location, drive a few minutes farther East to the Willoughby location or farther west to downtown Cleveland.  The service was slow.  The bartenders didn't know how to properly make a manhattan. The food was good and consistent with other locations...only thing that saved 2 stars.  The place smelled and the bathrooms stunk.  Not sure what's going on at this location but no plans to go back."}
{"text":"The capicola and loaded fries are deeeeeeeeeeee-Lucius!!! May stop my heart in a few years, but come on. The capicola is very good then the loaded fries with bacon and cheese fresh out of the fryer and into the over for a few mins is phreakin unbelelvabily tasty! Try it! You will like it"}
{"text":"For some reason this location constantly burns the onion rings. After complaint after complaint I'm told that nothing can be done if I can't come back right away because it has to be fixed per shift and I couldn't get new ones the next day. Today's excuse was the owner came in so the order wasn't looked at to make sure it was cooked properly because the kitchen manager was busy with him."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a salad to go. The bar staff was really nice however for a chicken ceaser salad it took 20 minutes. Once I opened the salad I noted that the entire salad was the core pieces of the lettuce. It was awful. The chicken that they place on the side was really good...."}
{"text":"Came in to have a beer while I wait for my takeout. Everything was fine until I received my bill and noticed extra items that I did not order. I call over the waitress Leah nicely and explained to her what had happened. She immediately asked with attitude \"what's wrong?\" And had the worst look on her face.   While she was correcting the bill she was \"venting\" to the other waitresses and using cuss words. I could hear her cause I'm sitting at the bar looking at her. Totally confused why she is angry at me when she took the order incorrectly. I will not return in the future. I felt embarrassed for the slight."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Food was came out looked and tasted excellent. Service was slow. I order my drink and a menu. That was quick but trying to order food my server was nonexistent. Finally the manager came over and asked me if I was ready to order.  I won't even get into trying to get a refill on my drink. Why offer refills if you don't refill in a timely manner. When it was time for me to pay they were on the spot ready to collect. This was not a good experience for me."}
{"text":"Okay food.  Pleasant service.  One of the better establishments in Euclid."}
{"text":"Over 3 separate visits, there has been a consistent lack of quality. Servers are unattentive and will simply forget your order or refill easily. Spoiled salsa, stale chips, and 40 minutes of waiting just for the appetizers. Decided to not get entrees because of the lack of quality. Go to the paninis in mayfield or Willoughby if you can. In the time it took the appetizers to come out, I missed my children's 13th birthday, graduation from high school and college, and the birth of his first child."}
{"text":"Visited this place with my gf.  Great food and service was decent.  1 of 2 servers ruined the experience. Clean. Plenty of large tvs. I would go again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I'm a west sider and I am out here getting my car detailed. I walked over to paninis and asked if they had craft beers. The bar tender didn't know what that meant but they had dortmunder and head hunter. I ordered a sandwich and it was excellent. The servers were friendly. I think this is your average, suburb bar but nothing special to be honest."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to the other listing for this Paninis.  My (as well as many others) reviews disappeared like my paycheck at a Tijuana donkey show.  They dodged a bullet here because most people complained how the servers suck.  We come here a lot after work and they are pretty nice.  Not very chatty but get you a drink pretty quickly.  The food is really expensive for bar food and they hardly ever have specials.  Good place for a few drinks but if ya wanna eat Muldoons a few blocks past always has food specials but even worse service.  My advice, pound a few on the way home and safely get to the nearest Taco Bell, get a ton of food you don't need and shouldn't be eating and eat it in bed while watching anything with Tony Danza..."}
{"text":"Very impressed by the service received during an afternoon the staff Chelsea in particular was Awesome. Will definitely be back very soon! Great Experience!"}
{"text":"Came here on a 1st date with someone and watched the game on the patio drank a couple beers had a grrat time lots of fun an d funny people around.....the waitress wouldnt come back to our table after a while so we had to go get our own drinks and she had this stink look on her face the whole time but other than that it was great loved it and will go back some day"}
{"text":"Yeah....its OK.  It's the closest thing to a sports bar for me and my work friends to go to for beers.  Patio is nice for the summer months, interior is typical of a Paninis, and the food is above average given the price and the amount given.  I like their french dip or wraps, the pretzels are good too.  It does seem like the bartenders / servers really don't want to be there.  I don't even think a fart would make them smile.  

Sorry Angela, I wasn't on my game that night....lol.  I still have that list though, thanks!!  JK.  She's right, the people that go in there are spotty at times.  Some look borderline bummish where others are working professionals from Lincoln or Eaton (Go Eaton!!).  Still, its worth stopping in for a beer or lunch, but I would go to Grovewood or Bistro 185 for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is close to our house so we are here a few times a month. It is always clean and bright inside, very welcoming feeling. Service is fast and friendly, especially Cassandra! Tons of food options. Some are better than others but isn't that anywhere?  They seem to be going through a lot of manages lately - not sure what that's about."}
