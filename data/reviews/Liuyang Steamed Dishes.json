{"text":"Limited choice of dishes and all of which taste similar if not exactly the same. Salty and spicy in a unpleasant way. 

With all these said it's also got a greasy floor and fume-y air. And charge premium price for their dish.

Didn't know why we stayed, but hey the person whos reading this and considering this place. run."}
{"text":"it's not that bad as previous reviews. I wanted to try. and ordered spicy fish and shrimp hot pot. portion was bad. only a few pieces of shrimps. bad value but good taste. I would give four star if portion was good. tasty food. though."}
{"text":"I paid 35 for 3 dishes and 2 rice. Over priced and no flavor. I ordered pork and the meat was so hard that you can't eat it without getting stuff stuck in your teeth.

Service was the worst. They didn't serve water so we got up and served ourselves. We didn't pay any tip because we served ourselves and no one even took our order, we gave the order straight to the cooks in the kitchen.

If you are considering this place and see this post, go next door."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the most disorganized place I've ever been. The waitress who took our orders was also wearing an apron that made me believe she might be the cook, later on i saw her putting on plastic gloves to the back that made me also believe that she might also wash dishes. And yes, also a cashier. As you guessed, the service was slow. 

Our first dish came to us after about 20 mins of ordering, the 2nd dish came to us 20 mins after the first dish. And she forgot to bring rice. 

The portion was so bad compare to the price! see picture, that's less than a 8 inch bowl and cost us $13.99! 

I don't have any nice things to say about this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant if i could give it 0. I would give it 0 stars. As it is by far one of the worst restaurants in toronto ive ever tried. It fails on multiple fronts. Lets start with the most basic which is food. Which is the most important thing in a restaurant. The food is just not good period. The stinky tofu is tasteless and bland. The sweet and sour pork tenderloin is soggy and overcooked. To the point of it is probably unacceptable in most even cheap food court restaurants. And the chicken that is stir fried in claypot is oversalted to the extreme. With the tofu and pig blood part being oversalted as well. As if to cover that the chicken is not fresh at all.     

The 2nd thing this restaurant fails at is price and portion. It charges a very expensive price for the portion. Now usually this means perhaps the food has quality but since its established it doesnt the value is none. The portion is tiny beyond tiny.  

The 3rd part is the service. We went on a sunday at 2pm. When they were not busy and only had 3 small tables who were already eating. It took them 15 minutes to get our order after we were wavig at them thr whole time and them seeing us. This is ridicoulous. 

Overall this restaurant has failed on every level. I will be very surprised if they are still in business for long.  If you are in the area definetely dont try. And it is also not close to authentic hunan dish which it says is its specialty at all"}
{"text":"I would put less than one star if I could.  The waitress is day dreaming..staring into space. Nothing to do.  No napkins until asked and they were so confused.  Spoke in 3 different languages until they understood.  English, Cantonese and then mandarin.  Slow service.  They somehow managed to make the fried fish soggy.  Stir fried dishes were not stir fried together. It's toss some meat in, add handful of veggies on top and stirred.  Not actually cooked together. My fried noodles with veggies & meat had no meat...I did manage to scrounge up a small sliver from the soy sauce noodles. No wonder there was only one other table of patrons."}
{"text":"Love the noodles and the steamed dumplings!

I ordered the beef noodle soup, a bit spicy for my liking, but then again, I can't handle very much spice. The noodles were tasty. I was expecting pulled noodles, but they remind me of noodles made from a pasta machine.

The steamed dumplings didn't have the soup in the middle as expecting, but it's tasty. The skin is on the thicker side if you like it that way.

My only complain was the service, it was really slow. The restaurant was not even busy when I got there."}
{"text":"Just moved to Toronto not to long ago and decided to try this place after receiving a flyer in the mail. All I have to say is wow is place is awful. Ordered about $70 worth of food because my family and I like leftovers and we were so disappointed. Portions were super small, food was dry, over priced, not a place I would expect anyone to go. I should have went on yelp to see the reviews so I guess I learned my lesson. The person taking my order barely spoke English, I would not recommend this place at ALL"}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised by all the negative reviews here... I just moved into the neighborhood and came here (Friday lunch at noon) for a quick lunch with my fianc√©. Once I sat down and ordered I decided to look it up on Yelp. I was so nervous waiting for my food... thinking it'll be horrible... but it really wasn't! I would probably give them a 4 star but I do think that they deserve an extra star given all the negative reviews here. Maybe they changed to address their customers' concerns!

Re: service - we didn't wait that long, maybe we were one of the first customers, but they also had lots of take out orders, our food started to arrive within 10 minutes

Re: food - we ordered 4 dishes and lamb kabobs, they were all large portions and tasted good. Perhaps all our dishes were stir fry dishes so it came quick, I can see that some of their hot pot dishes will take a longer time to cook. Please see photos for detailed description.

Re: price - it's not on the cheaper side but the portions were large enough I thought it was ok. For me personally, all except one dish had a reasonable price. The spicy cabbage was $10 and usually in other restaurants it's one of the cheaper items, but this was the most expensive one from all our dishes.

Anyhow, I enjoyed my visit and I'm happy to come back. Give them a try. I will update next time if my experience changes!"}
