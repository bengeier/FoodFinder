Note burger - 5/5

Small store. Great burgers. HUGE burgers. The gotti burger was actually very good but we were not expecting the OG sauce to be sweet. 

The servers are very nice and dealt with our 15 person order very well."}
{"text":"I had high expectations, but the original gangster burger that I received was a big disappointment.  The burger texture was poor.  It was more like a flavourless slice of meatloaf, coated in sweet barbeque sauce.  The burgers are huge, but they aren't good."}
{"text":"Got the 8 oz gotti burger which came with mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and og sauce. Did not expect the og sauce to be sweet. This was the first sweet burger I had. The patty was pretty thick and cooked to medium rare. The onion rings I had were cooked perfectly, but the thing that will bring me back to this place are the chicken wings. Wings had a very sweet and tangy flavored sauce which I assume is the same og sauce they glazed the beef patty with. The burger itself I would give 3 stars but the wings earned the place another star!! Props from Cali!"}
