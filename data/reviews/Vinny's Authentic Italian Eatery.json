{"text":"We stopped here after a basketball tournament and I am so happy we did!  The service was excellent and the restaurant was so cozy and very clean!  And the food was delicious!  The bread was freshly baked and hot from the oven. The french fries were handcut. The kids were able to make their own pizza at the table and it was then cooked in the kitchen. And my eggplant parmesan was amazing. The portion was very generous and completely worth the price. Next time we are back in Middlefield, we will be stopping again!"}
{"text":"Great food.  One of my favorite places to go in Middlefield.  I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had lunch here three times now. First time food good, service average, liked experience enough to visit second time. Service was perfect as well as the food, mad us want to visit again. Third visit made at opening for the day. Mistake? Always garlic rolls served right away with drinks. Not today. Young lady said they were being prepared. We ordered salads and a pizza. Asked tree more times,most I'll not ready. I am sure most people would enjoy garlic rolls with the salad. We got them while eating our pizza. Waitress was not attentive, she ignored us and others customers she had. She set a bad example for Vinnys. May not return again. Many other restaurants available.why were the rolls not ready mister owner? Of course all the other diners didn't get rolls when seated. Will I get response from ownership? Will review again based on response."}
{"text":"Stopped here today for lunch. I think the place must have been an old Wendy's or some other fast food place. My buddy wanted to take me there. When I got there the first thing I noticed was the decor. Sort of weird looking. Just a bunch of like burnt pine paneling. Sort of odd looking. Also the waitress was not overly friendly (but efficient). BUT my meal was incredible. I know you may find it hard to believe someone could get so excited about a salad BUT this was probably the best salad I have ever had. It was the antipasto salad. I got the half order (no way I could have had the full). It was so fresh with virtually all my favorite things to eat. I live about 45 mins away from this place but the salad was so good I would drive there just to have this again. My friend had a turkey sandwich. He said it was great and the HALF order looked to be about 12\" long. Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"We are here 9/4/15. Service good and drinks were great. Good was authentic and fresh. Portions are huge so be prepared for take home. My only draw back was the decor. Seems like an old Wendy's and tough to get ambiance. Small drawback when food is this good we will be back!  Sangria was great."}
{"text":"Yesterday another reply from blaze t. Stating a review can damage a small restaurant reputation Any business needs to follow simple rules themselves Stay on top of your managers. Itis not the customers responsibilty.. i reviewed my experience accuratly.i spent 60 dollars for a terrible ruined dinner Will vinnys refund my money. I doubt it."}
{"text":"Not good.food is terribly salty  Over priced.servers do not smile.i asked for two more rolls and never received.prices are high for what you receive. Never saw a manager. Not very good for small town."}
{"text":"Another great experience at our favorite spot. Staff is friendly and the food is so fresh. Keep up the great work. If you haven't tried Vinny's do yourself a favor and stop in soon."}
{"text":"Just had Sunday brunch here. Don't do it!! We hav eaten here before, great Italian food fixed fresh. Brunch was the opposite. Payed 15.99 plus drink cost for pre-cooked scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage links. Pre-cooked French toast, waffles and chicken tenders along with breakfast casserole. The lunch items were macaroni with red sauce and soggy chicken parm.  No salads, dessert was a dinner plate presentation of store bought cookies and cake rolls. The biscuits were canned and set out at room temperature. This establishment is capable of much better.  DO NOT EAT SUNDAY BRUNCH HERE!!"}
{"text":"I am seriously impressed with Vinny's. I came here with my mom yesterday (12/1/2015) and I had nothing but amazing service and great food. Molly was awesome, brought us everything we needed was quick to get our order but was patient with the time we needed. The food was nothing short of amazing. The prices seem to be a little higher than most of the locations around here, but considering how much food you get its definitely worth it. Every bite was taken with a mmm, I am seriously impressed. If I could give 10/10 I would."}
{"text":"This was a great meal!  Fresh salad, delicious pizza.  The associates are very hospitable and friendly.  Service was excellent!  I will be returning to try the pasta!"}
{"text":"Really really good food.   Plenty of it.    I did not expect authentic Italian fare out here in buggy land.    Try it and you will be rewarded."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down.  Went for Sunday \"brunch\".  They open at 11 am but don't have food (if you can call it that) out until 11:45, and you still have to ask for things like serving spoons and syrup?  Ordered hot tea, had old lipstick on the cup.  Flies on the window sills.  The only thing edible was a bagel and very little cream cheese.  I spent 15.95 on a bagel!  Do not waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Not good. I decided to try the lagsania and it wasn't worth the price. And there is a bunch of peppers in it so it's kinda spicey. Gave them 3 stars for turning a old Wendy's into a lucrative restaurant also only tried one menu item so Im giving the benefit of a doubt other things will be better."}
