{"text":"Want a locally owned joint for breakfast and lunch - this is your spot.  Perfectly cooked egs - wonderful potatoes (ask for the lunch potatoes - lots of cholesterol, but yummy).  And the folks waiting on the table are wonderful, informative and just down home.  When I didn't like their jelly selection, a bottle of apricot jam was delivered to the table.  Crowded on Sunday mornings - so show up early or late.  I find it hard to believe that anything you order here would be lacking - a great diner - support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"This is a family run Cafe with a kick. They really work hard to get to know their clientele. Introducing themselves by first name when you come in. So you instantly kind of feel like it's a second home. The food menu is basic burgers and sandwiches. But they had a certain \"homemade\" quality to them that was comforting, and also delicious. The kitchen is wide open, and it feels like you're as much a part of the process as they are, no chefs hiding behind walls. I personally had the BLT, and it tasted just like my moms.

One thing that needs to get commented on are the unique potato skins. I know, I know, who hasn't had potato skins?! I promise you you've never had potato skins like this. They're thick deep fried cuts of hand peeled potato skins, no frozen skins here! These are made daily. If you want to be really evil and ask for a side of sour cream! They'll gladly accommodate any sides you need at no charge, just ask!

I left feeling full, and happy. It's not often you go to a restaurant with hopes of leaving full, and also leave feeling cared about on a personal level. Check it out Yelpers! Again though, this is like having dinner at your moms, you need to ask for condiments, and I doubt you have to but I bussed my own table. It was well worth it."}
