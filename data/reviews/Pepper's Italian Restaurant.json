{"text":"Granted, I've only had a small sampling of what their menu has to order, but I feel comfortable saying that this place is great!  The chicken is always juicy, the food hot, the seasonings balanced and the service helpful.  If I could change anything, the only thing would be to make the restaurant larger, as it is a bit cramped in there.  The food's worth it though!

They also have grape pie during the fall which I doubt you're going to find anywhere else.  It's pretty good."}
{"text":"Long time customer - my days of supporting are winding down

I have been going to peppers for about ten years. A lot has changed in that time; mainly quality. The restaurant seems to be doing well for itself between busy and tiny dining room, couple with a stream if carryout... The carryout is my biggest problem...

The last three times I have ordered carryout for my wife and I it's been packaged so terribly that by the time I get home (I live right around the corner by St Eds) it's spilling over into the cheap bag it's placed in. The styrofoam container is also the cheapest to go box someone could ever find as well. Couldn't you spring for a box that doesn't leak everywhere? A sheet of aluminum foil would help to as to better contain the food and also keep it warm. Again, I live right around the corner! Id imagine if I lived even a mile away half of the food would be in the car! My order was $35 for a small order of ravioli, baked ziti and a tiny slice of cheesecake. And you package it like this????

This place also charges you .50 for a sprinkle of bagged mozzerella cheese for the otherwise unedible side salad. That's embarrassing and they should be ashamed for up charging like that. 

You guys are being cheap, cheap, cheap!! Buy some higher grade to go boxes, heck even use it as an opportunity to to have your logo/name printed on it! Something!! The prices aren't cheap by any means! Cerinos is less expensive and once they opened I figured maybe peppers would wake up as it's some competition right? 

I swear every time I go here the prices keep going up too.

Sometimes the cheeses is nearly unedible and clearly that's due to keeping things around too long (must buy in bulk, freeze, etc) you can tell as soon as
You open the pizza box or taste the ravioli. Sometimes it's excellent. You never really know what you get.

But the to-go packaging is dreadful. Until they address this I'm not ordering carryout and I'm in no hurry to get back there. My biggest regret is not taking a picture of what it looked like. I spent more time cleaning my car and kitchen up then eating."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, great food, nice and small dining area. Don't waste your time at any large chain."}
{"text":"I got food from here last night and was very excited and craving some good authentic Italian. I got carry out which was clearly frozen generic garbage. The sauce on my lasagna tasted like sauce that comes on a $2 frozen pizza. I could only eat about a quarter of it..the only reason I could stomach that much of it was due to the fact that I squeezed as much of the sauce out of it as I could and smothered it in cheese. The eggplant Parmesan was semi edible but the sauce on the ziti noodles it came with was the same nasty generic frozen disaster that came on the lasagna. I will NEVER recommend or eat here again...which is sad because I love local and authentic...although a cute restaurant it was over priced disgusting frozen inedible garbage. I regret even having to give it one star."}
{"text":"Seriously good Italian food! Though the dining room is small, they easily accommodated our party of six as quickly as possible. 

And did I mention the great food! Why would anyone go to Olive Garden when there is a gem like Pepper's right in Lakewood?? Good service, lovely atmosphere with a mural by a local teacher/artist...Pepper's is a place we will absolutely return to when the cravings strike."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Italian food around. There is always a line around the corner waiting for them to open.  The quality of the food is always high and the portions are always large. the waitresses are very attentive, and the owners are often they're checking the quality of food and service as well."}
{"text":"Pepper's was one of the first restaurants we tried in Lakewood, and boy, were we impressed!  The homey atmosphere of the place is on equal footing with its delicious home-cooked Italian entrees.

A group of us went for yours truly's birthday dinner a few years ago.  I think we actually passed it up on the drive there.  It's definitely a hole in the wall, so keep your eyes peeled!

On walking in, I had to admit I was a little worried.  There isn't much seating as compared to other restaurants, and there is almost no room for patrons to stand and wait for a table.  They don't take reservations -- I'm assuming because the place is so small, and they would lose business.  But if you can suffer the initial squishing, you'll be glad you did.  The tables are actually turned around fairly quickly.

Pepper's is clearly family-owned.  Family photos adorn the wall and the counter where the register is.  A husband-and-wife team greets you at the door and helps the servers bring food, clear dishes, and make jolly conversation with the patrons.  The servers are friendly and attentive, and they know their stuff.  Although the tables are pretty close to one another, you get a vibe that every customer there is part of one big happy family, so it's not at all uncomfortable.  In fact, the restaurant itself feels just as cherished by the owners as one of their own children would be.

I've only had a couple of different dishes here, because the rigatoni and meatballs is so addicting.  They make a really great tomato sauce, and every time I think I'm going to order something else, I just can't.  I've had the ravioli before, though (because it comes with that delicious sauce) and it's just as good.  For an appetizer, if you can choose the tomato tortellini soup, DO IT.

If you don't want to wait for a seat, they do have carry-out, but I can't imagine the pasta being good for that.  We ordered the pizza to go once and couldn't complain (although my heart will always be with A Slice Above for pizza).

The food is definitely filling, but save room for dessert!  I recommend the pistachio gelato or the cannoli.

And the best news about Pepper's?  Now open on Sundays!  I couldn't be more thrilled."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, good prices, very friendly service.

This little Italian place is truly a gem in Lakewood. It's hard to find and not obvious from the street, but it's well worth the hunt.

Probably some of the best veal piccata I've had in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Local favorite!

This is a hidden gem. Its usually packed and with good reason - the food is great and so is the service!
Lasagna is amazing and the garlic bread is top notch. Their red sauce is so good you could drink it!
Service is always quick and courteous. 
A little pricey (16$ for lasagna) but its worth it - fresh ingredients and comes out piping hot and scrumptious.
Family friendly."}
{"text":"Carried out Eggplant Parm and Spaghetti w/ meatless sauce and it was delish! Will definitely have it again!"}
{"text":"Often, when I'm craving spaghetti, it's hard to find a place that has a good red sauce (or at least one to my liking).  So when I was craving spaghetti recently, I searched various local food rating websites, the Fox 8 Hot List, et cetera, to get a recommendation, and no Italian restaurant seemed to get glowing reviews like Pepper's.  Now I understand why.

I had gone to Pepper's with my family a few times years ago, and we liked it, but for some reason we stopped going.  I think some people in my family were too claustrophobic to dine inside, and we sort of forgot about it over the years.  So, we ordered carry-out this time.  Everything was delicious, and my spaghetti with Italian link sausage was perfect.  The sauce was just thick enough, and very savory.  The portion was the right size for one hungry sitting.

I only wish that they had more pasta options so that I don't have order toppings individually (which can get expensive).  But overall, everyone enjoyed their food -- only this time, from the comfort of our spacious home (not to say that the restaurant isn't charming!)."}
{"text":"Very nice local gem of a restaurant.  Cheerful waitstaff, good menu variety.  I had the lobster mac and  cheese - very good.  Meal with tip (entree, two glasses of Malbec, salad upgrade) was $40 for one, so it's not a bargain basement place.  But the \"feel\" is very nice, and remarkably European.  Certainly worth it if you like genuine Italian.  Expect a wait after 7:00 most evenings.  A few dollars less and I would have rated it a 5, but the locals like it, so who am I to niggle?"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Pepper's. We went at 7 on a Saturday night with no reservation and the wait for inside was 30 minutes (not too bad). It was a nice night so we sat outside immediately on their 4 table patio. We had great service from Becky out there.  We both really enjoyed our meals (husband - chicken parm and penne with meatball for me). The sauce was really good and the food was tasty and hot. We also shared a small app and a bottle of wine and our bill was 60 so not too bad. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area. We did not venture inside past asking for a table so I can't really vouch for interior decor or atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not that impressed at all. The food was ok, the ambiance a bit on the cheap and tacky side. Wait staff was friendly but sounded more like cheerleaders at the table than people you can trust for a recommendation because no matter what you asked about they said it was fantastic. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My daughter took me to peppers for my birthday againest her friends protest. We were so disappointed. The place is so small only 8 tables yet we had to wait an hour for our food. Then when we received it , it was so bad that after tasting if we couldn't eat it at all and asked for something else to replace our dinner and it got worse. The booth we were seated in was build so bad that we kept hitting ourselves coming in out. Don't waste your time ar rhis place! We  are sorry we did."}
{"text":"The best way to describe Peppers is that it has a family atmosphere/feel to it. I say this for 2 reasons: 1.) it doesn't have much more seating then your grandparents dining room. I'd say it's maximum seating capacity is 30. 2.) the staff is extremely friendly. During my last visit one of my friends playfully flirted w/ our elderly server & she played along, it was quite entertaining. 

The selection & quality (which is obviously the most important part of this review) of the food is excellent. To be honest I've only ever had 2 dishes, the baked ziti & pizza. 

The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of the extremely limited seating. The first time I dined there I came w/ 7 other people which I not recommend. Thankfully a kind party of 3 volunteered to move to a booth so that we could be accommodated. It's a perfect type of place to take a date due to it's quiet & intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Although the food may be good the customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  My friend and I called to order a take out,  she has an awesome Irish accent however the girl who answered saw fit to mock her after setting the phone down.  If you're going to mock someone make sure you put them on hold first. When she asked to speak to the owner she was told they were not there.  She later called again asking for the owner or management and again was denied. Will not be going back and letting people know what kind of employees they have."}
{"text":"Its a shame about this place. The food is without a doubt amazing. I have had multiple orders messed up. I don't understand why they just can't get it right. Three times I've had screwed up orders. It's a shame. I will still go back but it's with a heavy heart. We waited 40 mins for the original order and then placed a new order but then we got annoyed because we waited so long already. Cancelled the second order and left empty handed. At least as a sign of good faith I would've given the original order to us. Instead of wasting it. So weird"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant! Awesome selection for all different tastes. The lasagna is to die for. The baked ravioli is to die for. The fried mozzarella is awesome. A little on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the large spaghetti with tomato sauce and two meatballs. Loved it. Bread and a tossed salad are served with the pastas and entrees. My guest had the vodka sauce, but liked the tomato sauce better so he mixed a little into his dish. The cannoli shell was just a little soggy, but not terrible. Wish they were made to order. Wanted the grape pie, but only available in the fall. Still a solid restaurant! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to add. If you're looking for a small, family run Italian restaurant with good food, stop here. There needs to be more neighborhood restaurants like this on the west side, and I leave full and satisfied after every visit. The service is sometimes a little slow, but it's always friendly and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Best grape pie hands down!!!!!!! A must try if you never have....
Love where it's located, small and quaint. Good service and friendly little neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Peppers in Lakewood is the north end of Boston authentic oh Italiano perfecto service so DiLisio Foodo I don't know my Italiano but I love Pateros Elek will"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Italian restaurant in Lakewood and maybe even all of Cleveland! Since we moved here from California, we have longed for a place to call home. My husband and I eat here almost weekly! I'm obsessed with the vodka sauce and grape pie!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner. There were only a handful of customers in the small establishment, but I over heard a staff member say they were short handed. Thus, we found ourselves waiting for drinks to be filled, boxes, and the check. However, the food was delicious! The Veal Marsala was so tasty and there were two large pieces of veal. Others in my party also enjoyed their meals. Large plates are definitely large, and loaded with good food!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place in Lakewood...what a great place!

GOOD STUFF:  Hidden gem of cheap good Italian food in Lakewood.  Nice family runs it.  The bottles of wine are insanely cheap (I mean its like buying the wine right from the liquor store...who needs BYO when its this cheap on the menu)

BAD STUFF:  Small place and wait can be long...but worth it.

PRICE:  Cheap.  Two people with wine around 30-40$.

OVERALL:  Can't believe I didn't find this place before.  Tough to find but well worth the trip.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Yum! LOVE this place. Sausage w/peppers and onions app was fabulous. I had chicken marsala which was very good but I was so obsessed with my pasta. I probably will have dreams about their house pasta sauce. Might be my favorite of all time.  Also tried a friends pesto pasta - AWESOME. Would definitely come back to order that. Concluded with tiramisu and cassada cake. I am not even a cake person but we all shared between 5 of us. The cassada is from the angels. Get it. Love the intimate atmosphere but if you want seating right away might be best to get there right when they open. We fit 5 in a booth and it worked fine but we were pretty cozy. Highly recommend this wonderful mom n pop italian gem."}
{"text":"I generally trust Yelp's restaurant rating, but this place gave me pause. Never have I been so shocked and disappointed by a 4-star rated restaurant. The service was adequate, the $9 wine pour was generous enough, but the food was just this side of inedible. We both ordered $24 entrees of veal marsala and veal parmesan. The pasta and veal were cooked well enough, but the marinara sauce was sickly sweet and the marsala sauce tasted like alcoholic maple syrup. Judging from the other 1-star reviews, this is a feature, not a bug. If you are looking to contract diabetes, this might be your place, but it's not Italian food they're serving you."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on NYE, and it was amazing. The food was authentic and delicious, and way too much for one person (makes great leftovers too). We got there not long after it opened, and I am so glad we got there early because by the time we got our salads, there was a wait for tables (the restaurant is not very big - but it gives a very intimate dining experience, which I loved). I got the chicken parm, and OMG, it was so big. But it was still super tender and the breading was great. I ended up taking more than half of it home because it was too much."}
{"text":"I'm a very big fan of Pepper's. It's the kind of place that I often fantasize about around, say, 4 pm, when the late-afternoon fatigue/hunger sets in. \"Where on earth,\" you think miserably, \"can I get a comfort meal that will help me successfully eat my feelings?\" Pepper's!

It's a tiny place, and I've never had the opportunity to dine in, but the food is great. The portions are way too big, but that's never been a problem for me, because as you know I get great joy out of eating leftovers. The pizza is among the best in Lakewood, which is funny, because you don't really see Pepper's boasting itself as a pizza place. But I'd highly recommend the pizza. Also high on the list: chicken parmigiana, baked ziti, anything with tons of red sauce.

You'll feel at home here, and find yourself thinking about going back soon afterwards."}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this place for 3 years and I just recently ate here for the first time. My boyfriend and I had a fantastic first time experience. This is a perfect date night spot. Small and intimate- it is as small on the inside as it looks like from the outside. 

Our waitress Audra was great! She explained all the sauces and how they are made in house. I also inquired about their infamous Grape Pie and she explained the process for making it and in what season they offer it on their menu. She was great at suggesting her favorite items while also mentioning which items would be on the heavier side and which you could take home because there is enough food to feed 3 people (ha ha). 

We ended up ordering the Veal Parmesan and Lasagna. Both meals were piping hot and that Red Sauce! Oh that Red sauce is damn good. Even something as simple as their house made italian dressing was very flavorful! I had a hard time deciding because so many items sounded delicious. Next time I visit, I will need to try the Chicken Romano."}
{"text":"OMG. Best italian food, ever!  Kudos to Yelp!  Never would have tried this place if not for the reviews. 

I didn't come in here looking for lasagna,  but after seeing the pictures on Yelp, I had to give it a try. Deep, rich red sauce smothered the tasty combination of noodles, sausage and cheeses. Simply delicious. 

My wife had the vegetable lasagne. Looked like the stuff that comes out of the Stouffers frozen lan, but tasted incredible. It was the best vegetable lasagna we had ever had. Covered in an alfredo sauce, so tasty. 

Place is really small. We came in on a Wednesday night at 6:00 and got the last table. By the time we left a bit after 7:00, there were people waiting...on a Wednesday night!  They have obviously eaten here before."}
{"text":"I've been in love with Pepper's for about ten years now. My mother & I would always go eat up there every weekend & get pizza for carry out. They have amazing food & the portions definitely fit the price you pay for them. It's perfect for a romantic date night. I wish it were a little big bigger though because if it's crowded you do have to wait. The wait staff is attentive & pleasant. The ricotta is my favorite thing to order but the pizzas are equally as amazing."}
{"text":"Beat service and food in Cleveland/Lakewood! Joe did a great job in the patio tonight! We were pain in the butts and he was so kind and kept feeding us bread and smiles! A+ service!"}
{"text":"Prices are high but REALLY GOOD FOOD! 
the sauce and complimentary bread is really good..  The sauce is extremely good. The bread is pretty fresh.

For starters we ordered the sausage pizzalio which was decent

We ordered the deluxe pizza and chicken Romano for main course which is pretty good!!"}
{"text":"Lobster mac and cheese was bland and overcooked. I'd read all these great reviews and since I live nearby, wanted to give my patronage to a local business. Bad idea. The pasta is mushy from overcooking before the baking process. The cheese sauce is bland with with no seasoning whatsoever. The actual lobster is plentiful,  but rubbery. The bread crumbs aren't truly toasted, so they leave a wet, doughy taste. This was for a takeout, so maybe this just isn't the best takeout item. There was also a pretty good wait for it, about 25 minutes. I doubt I'll be trying Peppers again."}
{"text":"We went back to Pepper's last night and had a slightly different experience than our first time there.  The wedding soup is good and the Caesar salad dressing is yummy.  My boyfriend ordered the Rigatoni with pesto and grilled chicken, and I ordered the Fettucini with tomato sauce and grilled chicken.  His pesto sauce was completely tasteless.  It desperately needed salt and a little more olive oil.  As for our, \"grilled\" chicken (and this is a HUGE pet peeve of mine) it was pan-friend.  It had little brownish spots on the outside of it and it was huge chunks.  Huh?  It was seriously the ugliest dish--looking at brown spotted chicken sitting atop green pesto sauce.  No 'curb appeal' to that dish!  After this experience, I think we've learned to stick with the basic red sauce Italian dishes here.  That's the best piece of advice I can give to new diners who go to Pepper's."}
{"text":"Let me throw this out at you.  I can cook Italian.  In fact, I deem it a specialty of mine when I'm trying to impress the lady or her family.  But, you're not going to find much better nor authentic Italian on the West Side of Cleveland.  

A small mom and pop shop hidden on a main road of Lakewood.  I wouldn't have gone there had it not been recommended to me by a friend, because I never would have seen or read about it anyways.  It's like one of the biggest secrets that I don't even want to share on Yelp.  

My mother's one of those people who loves Chicken Marsala, orders it everywhere trying to find one as good as hers, and is always disappointed.

She loves Peppers Chicken Marsala, and only Peppers Chicken Marsala.  And hey, you make my mother happy?  You get five stars.  Done."}
{"text":"The food at Pepper's was absolutely delicious!!! From our appetizers to dessert & everything in between! Our waitress was so wonderful!! She was sweet, funny & very attentive. The inside of the restaurant is casual/cozy but we loved it. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for our first time and got pizza . It was delicious !! This is \"real pizza\" if you know what I mean. Absolutely loved the sauce. The staff was also very nice. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time early this week.  Was very excited after reading the reviews.  We arrived by 5:30 so we did not have a problem getting a table but the restaurant filled up fast!  Happy hour was in swing so we did enjoy a healthy glass of wine at a very reasonable price.  I ordered the eggplant parmesean with penne pasta aglio/olio.  The dinners come with a salad which was ok...nothing special.  The eggplant was delicious...wonderful!  The pasta was way overcooked which was really disappointing in an Italian restaurant and really lacked flavor.  Lots of garlic but I don't think the water for the pasta had been salted at all.  I had to add quite a bit of salt which is something I never do.  One of the ladies in our party had the lasagna which she enjoyed and the other had the chicken piccatta that she liked as well.  Salted caramel gelato finished the meal and it was good!  Only gave a 3 star rating because of the pasta being well overcooked but would try it again in the future.  FYI that the tomato sauce is on the sweet side."}
{"text":"delicious. i mean this was terrific. the sauce reminded me of my favorite \"local\" Italian place that used to be in Canton - Angello's. 

I had Chicken Parm and I can't remember the last time I've had Chicken Parm that I liked as much as I liked this. It sorta irritates me that they aren't closer to where I live because i would go here 2-3 a month (or more for pizza). 

Danielle had the Penne w/ Vodka sauce which was also quite tasty.

I could complain that the place is really small and cramped, but so what. the food was still perfect and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Glad we finally got the chance to try this place! Dined with our two kids, ages 7 and 8. Tried the calamari app which was decent although nothing remarkable. Rather bland but the marinara on the side helped. Followed with salads that were fresh but I could have done without the typical bottled dressing. My lasagna came piping hot. It was tasty and large. Definitely worth the price. My husband had the chicken piccata which was also a very large portion. The chicken was very moist, and the sauce wasn't gummy like it can sometimes be. Kids had meatballs that they devoured in minutes. Our server was friendly and efficient. I'll choose Pepper's over Carabba's now."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend for my birthday.  Had Italian Wedding   Soup and Mushroom & Cheese Pizza.  Delicious!  Home made just like my Nana made!  Excellent food and good prices.  You get a lot to eat!!  Kind of small but service and attentiveness to meal prep is remarkable.  Did not have to wait long to be served.  A place I would go back to.  I am Italian and do not find too many Italian Restaurants that make sauces and soup homemade.  This does!  Great choice of deserts as well.  Teramisu was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"There are a few places we go for Italian: Pepper's, Bruno's, and Murray Hill. Pepper's has great traditional Italian food. The lasagna is perfect and they're pizza is one of the best, but pick up only and it gets busy on Friday  and Saturday. Dessert is a must. My favorite so far was a chocolate Pana Cota, but now it is the seasonal grape pie."}
{"text":"I love Peppers!
I found it and decided to try it once and now it is the place I got for Italian on the west side.
The Piccata and Parmesan dishes are excellent. 
Smaller place, but best value around."}
{"text":"Great food! Some things are overpriced. I will eat there again. Service was good! They are always friendly. They seem to cater to their regulars. Cassata cake is awesome! Brownie is HORRIBLE! It taste like a little Debbie cake from the gas station. Gross!"}
{"text":"I've been having a wicked pasta craving lately, so I finally had a reason to come here. Lakewoods parking is always a deterrent for me lol. 

Just a little aside but it's crazy how many Italian places are closed on Mondays, which maybe why at 5:30 in the evening the place was almost full.

I ordered take out and the girl on the phone was lovely, good service. Get this she takes my order puts me on hold a quick second and checks with the kitchen for a pickup time. Brilliant. 

She told me the pickup time would be 15 minutes, I walked in 14mins later and it wasn't done I sat on the bench for one minute before she walked over with the order. Talk about perfect timing.

One thing I was wondering about was the grape pie. Everyone says that it's only there in the fall, but it was on the sign when I first walk in listed with the desserts on a chalk board. So now I have a reason to return.

The Food:
~Large Tomato sauce Pasta (linguini) and I added two meatballs. Very good, not enough for two ppl unless you get an appetizer too, I'm thinking the stuffed peppers. Also I wish they had like Parmesan cheese or something maybe they do I should've asked but yeah meatballs need cheese. I would order this again, hell I probably will next week.
~Garlic Bread: plenty of cheese here, very good went great with the pasta. It does come with two small (salad dressing container sizes) sides of sauce so you won't suck it all up from the pasta.
~Pasta came with a side salad, very good quality veggies, the lettuce was very green and red, good mix. Some places have that bs iceberg, not here.

One thing I didn't get was the rolls I think that the menu said it included rolls, maybe not I could be wrong. So the rolls and smaller portion than expected, still wasn't enough to take a star away.

I may update when we finally dine in. It's very small and the place fills up fast, I wouldn't recommend anything more than a four top, idk how this place would be for a big party. Unless there's a room I didn't see. 

Great place totally hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I think if you know what you're in for, you'll enjoy this place. Don't expect it to be the best Italian food ever. Don't expect super authentic. But to me, the food was tasty, the staff was nice, and the experience was enjoyable. 

This place is TINY and the decor is kind of cheesy (like 99% of the Italian restaurants in America). The menu is big enough, good amount of variety. I got a side salad and it was lame but honestly, I've come to expect that of small restaruants (iceberg lettuce, whatever). We got some tasty rolls and butter with our dinner, though, and that was nice. I really liked my food (spinach ravioli with vodka sauce) and my boyfriend enjoyed his (shrimp ravioli, I think?). The price was reasonable, the service was fast. The desserts were good, too. Some of them are from a local dessert shop. 

Overall, I won't go back here all the time or anything but I think it's a good Italian restaurant on the West side, when I don't feel like going out to Little Italy. It was cozy and friendly with decent food at a decent price. Don't go in expecting to be blown away. I think my expectations were low because most hole-in-the-wall Italian places are almost exactly like this place. That's not exactly a selling point but also shouldn't be held against it, if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Beyond delicious! Anne is the best waitress in the city. Literally there is not one complaint that could be made!"}
{"text":"The high points: Their house Chianti was good and a very generous pour and the coffee gelato was amazing plus the environment is cozy, sweet endearing to me.

The opposite of the high points:  The place is tiny seating 24 people.  The tables are close enough that if I had extended my arms I would have been touched the person at the next table not to mention I now know every detail of their conversation despite the fact that they tried to keep their voices down.  There is nowhere for those waiting or picking up carryout (although it was a lovely day outside).  I was seated at the table closest to the door and for my entire meal a 6 ft man literally stood over my table while waiting with his party for a table.  Seriously?

The bread, salad and entree topped off by a $30 check earned a thumbs down from me.  I could have done better at any chain Italian restaurant.  The salad was generous in size but it seemed like a bagged iceberg lettuce salad and a bottled Italian. Underwhelming. Then there was a single herb dinner roll which I found not enjoyable although it seemed homemade.  I asked if they made their pasta and the answer was 'no'.  Not some of it, but zip, zero although they noted that all sauces are homemade.  I debated between their special, the pasta primavera and their pesto.  At the recommendation of the server I opted for the primavera with shrimp.

The serving size was fine but much smaller than other local family Italian places but since it was blah, that was a gift.  They served very little penne pasta topped by a generous medley of steamed asparagus, zucchini, cherry tomatoes and some other veggies.  And by steamed I mean quickly blanched, crunchy veggies absent of any seasoning.  Hard to believe that a true Italian place would serve a pasta dish with no flavor at all not even the obligatory fresh garlic. Seemed to have been tossed in plain old cheap olive oil. sans seasoning.   I did eat it but only by a generous doctoring with parm cheese, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes all of these on my table -- and I now know why!

I have not an drop of Italian blood in me and on a bad day I could have made a much better Italian pasta dish.  Perhaps I made a colossal mistake not ordering something laden with cheese and Alfredo so I'll own that but why put food on the menu if is bland and flavorless?  Rhetorical question. 

Okay, I'll stop.  The good news is that the meal was so lacking in satisfaction that I indulged in their coffee gelato which was amazing."}
{"text":"I normally try not to use the term \"best\" while reviewing on Yelp but Peppers has made me reconsider that. After searching for a great pasta dish in Cleveland for years I finally stumbled upon this little Lakewood gem. Here's what you need to know-- the restaurant is very small.. But not the \"it's kinda cramped I don't want to eat here\" but the \"this is a perfect spot for a date\" kind of small. The restaurant is owned and ran by a local family. The seasonal grape pie is a reason to go by itself (the family closes the restaurant for a day so they can HANDPICK the grapes)- yes you read that right.

But how's the food you ask? Well folks, Peppers has BY FAR the best pasta sauce I've ever tasted. I'm the type of person who doesn't usually order just spaghetti and sauce at a restaurant because in my opinion it is simply to easy to make at home. But Peppers changed that for me. Their no-frills spaghetti with marinara is to die for. Get a cup of the tomato bisque on the side and be ready for the most epic Italian food you've ever eaten (in America at least)."}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian food in Lakewood but there aren't many options. It's a cute place to go and has a good atmosphere. All of the food I've had here is pretty good."}
{"text":"A wonderful mom and pop aurhentic Italian restaurant that is hard to beat.  Perfect place to bring the wife for a romantic meal. 

Portion size are large? A total understatement, they're HUGE.

Had the eggplant parmasean (sauce on the side please) and it was deeee lish..."}
{"text":"I am shocked at all the good reviews here. This was some of the worst Italian food that I've had in a long time. We had the deluxe pizza and chicken marsala. Both had no flavor and we're totally uninspiring. It was a very crackery pizza dough that was soggy by the second slice. While the portions were generous this may explain the 60 pluss clientele. Many leftovers walked out of the door while we were there."}
{"text":"Two big things here: 1. Best pizza in Cleveland FOR SURE. A large is HUGE and 2x the size of other 'pizza' places.

2. Grape Pie. Eat it before you leave our planet. It's a game changer. 

Everything else is great from what I can tell as well. Atmosphere is so mom and pop which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wow, peppers is really amazing. I've been going here since they first opened and they really have increased their prices. They make you feel like family, and Louise is so sweet. You need to get the baked ziti, and don't forget about the grape pie."}
{"text":"This is a nice family run italian place. Only complaint is the wait can be long and parking is bad news. All of the food is pretty good. Some sort of fettuccine chicken dish I had was good but the taste of the sauce was a little bit off or unusual."}
{"text":"I only ate the vegetable lasagna but it tasted pretty bland and was doused in way to much Alfredo cream. But the tiramisu was quite good."}
{"text":"Not one to give 5 stars very often but this meets the criterea. Quant, friendly and comfortable. Service was.prompt, food hot and and was delicious from first bite until the last. Owner stopped by my table to ask how everything was, when asked, she identified something in the sauce that I couldn't quite identify. I highly recommend this find."}
{"text":"There are some places that you might pass right up if someone hadn't tipped you off.  Pepper's is one of those places.  But once you are in the know, oh my lord- you want to make this one of your go-to spots.  Pepper's felt as familiar and as warm and as comfortable as going to your grandma's house on a Sunday afternoon.  Yet at the same time romantic, and a quintessential date spot.  Very small, intimate setting with checkered table cloths and tea lights.  There is also a tiny outdoor patio with about 4 tables.  I was there on a date and we opted to sit outside on a warm spring night. We were the only ones out there.  The date scores major points for picking a great first-date venue.  And his parents are off-the-boat-from-Italy, so he MUST know his Italian cuisine.  He had the lasagna, I had the penne vodka.  Our server told us that their vodka sauce used to be just a once-in-awhile \"special\", but because it was so popular, they started to make it a regular menu item.  I got the \"small\" portion and my date asked why I don't order the large?  Our server explained \"She's on a date!\"  She knew.  (FYI- the small was pretty friggin' big as it was.)  The food was quite simple- nothing fancy, but sometimes simplicity is key.  Don't get me wrong, I like crazy, exotic food ventures which combine all sorts of flavorful and adventurous tastes, but sometimes I yearn for the tried & true.  We also shared some cannoli for dessert.  The cannoli was perfect- not overpoweringly sweet, but quite delicious, rich and it left me wanting more.   (Oops- I forgot whether I was just describing my date or the cannoli, but whatever....that sentence works for both.)   I'll go back.  And I'll keep you posted on Date #2."}
{"text":"This place is just too cute. Wine bottle prices are so reasonable. They have a blend I suggest trying. Their food is good. The only reason it is not five stars is because the food is not omg to die for. It is good Italian food. The vegetarian lasagna is my fave."}
{"text":"Amazingggg place! The service was great especially with the place being busy. Many options, wish there were more, but then I wouldn't know what to choose! I had the chicken Alfredo basically, just because I was craving. Their bread is great to start off with while waiting for the food. The interior is also a sight to look at while waiting. I don't know what else to say except that I can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Where do the reviewers come from?

Ordered Chicken Parm carry out.  $16 and some change.  Not exactly cheap.

Definitely nothing homemade about this.  Absolutely frozen breaded chicken patties.  Severe let down.

Could be the worst chicken parm I've ever had.  And this was at the end of a 14 hour shift so I was good and hungry and would have eaten nearly anything.

I've been largely disappointed by almost all of the \"authentic Italian\" places around Cleveland, and this is  no different.  There is absolutely nothing authentic about grabbing some frozen patties, and throwing some sauce and cheese on top.

Get your act together!"}
{"text":"Peppers is definitely a hidden Italian gem in Lakewood.... While small on appearance the taste is quite bombastic. Went on a Sunday evening with some friends and it was nice and quiet. Staff was very attentive and they took our drink and food orders with the utmost haste. Please check out the photos I posted and believe me when I say it's fantastic... Def will return again only wish they hadn't run out of the Italian wedding soup.... Also kudos on the calamari I didn't get in there quick enough to capture a photo ...

If you're on that side of town you should definitely come check out peppers"}
{"text":"We were extremely impressed by the atmosphere, staff, all of the food and we highly recommend. Wine portions are generous, and the garlic bread is to die for.  Cayla was exceptional, we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Peppers probably has the best Italian food I've had in years. Take-out is always a perfect choice since I live close. Never not seen this place busy. Wish they were open 24 hours a day and delivered! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is great. This is my second favorite Italian spot to Bruno's. This is a very homey mom and pops type of restaurant. I think the only thing that could make it better would be lower prices since they increased their prices a while back."}
{"text":"I love Pepper's! Best Italian food in Lakewood. Our server was so warm and friendly and the food was amazing. I love how it's small and has a homey feel. I can't wait to go back and get the calamari!"}
{"text":"This is a special place. It's not often today that one can dine in a small \"mom and pop\" restaurant. One is readily made to feel welcome and comfortable here. How delightful.

There are not many tables or booths, so on a busy night like Saturday, you may have to wait a bit. No problem.

I was ready to give this place 5 stars before I'd even ordered. So, how was the food? Well, just let me say it's a bit above average.

Our spaghetti was NOT al dente - unforgivable, really, in an Italian restaurant. And our waitress, a lovely person, failed to bring us dinner rolls (they were on most other tables). Well, it's not like she does this every day - WAIT, she DOES do this every day.

So, although I'd love to give this place 5 stars, the food and service were both 3 1/2 stars, so it receives a resounding 4.

I still love this place and plan to return when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for dinner. Heard some good reviews from others, I decided to give it a try. It's located on a corner off of Detroit Ave in Lakewood. The place is like a Mom and Pop store with traditional red checker tables. For a family style restaurant, you can't really expect anything too glamorous. The place had probably like ten tables and very tight space. 

The ambiance is family-oriented and there are old school pictures and decorations. For starters, we shared their cheesy garlic bread which tasted good. We also had their house salads and Italian dressing is the creamy kind which is my favorite. For dinner, I picked their alfredo penne pasta with a side of their italian sausage. The sausage was actually a bit dry and it tasted alright. It wasn't the greatest and I've had better. The pasta was just kind of bland. It was overall comfort food that I needed.

It wouldn't be a place I would die to go back to but I'd go again because it was a small cute place to grab some family style comfort food. One plus I'd add is that you can get unlimited refills for your beverages and a patio area."}
{"text":"I love Peppers! I hAve been going there since I moved to Lakewood over 8 years ago! But now you can't get to go orders on about half of their dishes! You can't even order what's probably their most popular dish, chicken parmasan!  The owner won't make some dishes to go because of complaints . I agree with one of the previous reviews. Don't take a complaint personal and ruin It for everyone. You have atleast 4 out of 5 stars on every rating site. You will always have complaints on reviews. Unfortunately people are more likely to write a review if they're upset about something rather than something positive. You should let the customer make that decision after you warn them that sometimes a dish doesn't travel as well."}
{"text":"Wholesome, authentic, amazingly delicious. Friendly staff and owners very welcoming and appreciative of business.  Very  cozy setting, family style. You will eat until you're stuffed. Huge wine pours, everything you want in an authentic Italian restaurant. Very impressive."}
{"text":"Love this place! Dinner with friends. Started with cheese garlic bread with sauce as an appetizer. Cheesy and great. 

I had lasagna, husband had veal Parmesan, friends had veal Marsala. Absolutely huge portions and delicious. If you leave here hungry, it's your fault 

Deal chicken brought us here but we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Locally owned and operated. Service is always efficient and courteous. I am a huge fan of the Margherita pizza and anything with their red sauce.  It's not often you see people waiting at the door at opening time, but it happens consistently here for a reason!"}
{"text":"The baked ziti was yummy. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce. We got carry out and it was fast & hot. After seeing the tiny inside I am intrigued by the dine in option. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places! Service is AMAZING and the food is better than any local Italian that I've had! The Grape Pie is to DIE FOR! It's small and crowded but it's worth any wait and they always work very hard to keep the wait as short as possible! If you haven't tried Peppers I suggest that you do! :)"}
{"text":"This is a small indepedent mom and pop Italian restaurant with amazing friendly service. Food is above average. Pasta selection is limited to rigatoni,fettucini or penne. Vegetable lasagna is delicious. Marsala is good. Fried beans as appetizer is passable. Desert menu is tasty. Probably one of the better single standing Italian restaurant on the west side. Saturday night that we went was surprisingly empty.  
Parking could be a problem. 
Bottom line: was there anything in this place that would make me crave to go back immediately:-NO.......or may be yes for my better half's love for veggie lasagna :-("}
{"text":"Everything comes from a can... Except the pies. Awesome pies..
Ex worked there.. 
Great family n service though..
Bout it.."}
{"text":"From walking in the door and meeting Mandy, to the owner Bob walking by our table and checking with us it was great. Anita our server was amazing! Small home feeling like your mothers kitchen. We had the chicken alfredo and tomato basil pizza. It was fantastic!. Prepare to wait bit its worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Italian spot. Meat sauce is amazing, dont understand why people love olive garden when there is family owned places like this."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian Restaurants in the city, quality Italian food and service, the only downsize to this restaurant may be its rather small. The pasta is exceptional."}
{"text":"We were a part of three at this corner neighborhood restaurant that we picked out from yelp reviews.  It is definitely a neighborhood joint.  Staff are friendly enough and the menu offers a lot of choices.  My son got the veal Parmesan and as he is just two years out of college he thought it was fine, looked like what he got in the dorms.  Salads were barely average.  My pesto and my wife's margherita pizza were so overwrought with Basil you would have thought they grew acres of it.   I love pesto and occasionally make if myself.  The pesto was about as good as I make it and I am German.  I ordered it with sausage and the link was so big my wife started squirming.  But I do admit it was a great tasting sausage.   My wife's pizza did not appeal to us.  We found both the crust and the sauce to be overly sweet.  Sauces are generally acidy and one trick is to use sugar.  Old man Carino taught me to put whole onions in the sauce while cooking it which seemed to work with his pizza sauce.  But maybe added sugar when I was not looking. This place is fine and if you live nearby I could see being very happy to have it around, but we were hoping for better based on the reviews."}
{"text":"Here we are in Lakewood with the only Italian place to eat at as far as I know (RIP Eddie Cerinos), a place that has been there for years. The inside looks very small, crowded, and very much like a mom and pop kind of business but let me tell you the Italian food here isn't a joke. Don't take this dodgy looking restaurant lightly, it puts out some serious good eats. Me and the girlfriend had a calamari appetizer which was amazing. Not chewy, overcooked or undercooked, just right. The famous margarita pizza was spot on. No complaints. Keep it going Peppers."}
{"text":"I want so badly to say that my husband and I loved this place but we just did not. 

Small, independent restaurant in Lakewood that has the feel of a small Italian restaurant in NYC. What could be better right? Well a lot actually. 

The service was so so. Our server was nice, a little overzealous with the black pepper but if I had an awesome button press battery operated pepper grinder I might be too. The place is tiny which means it's hard to hear anyone speak, and if you get seated close to the door all you will hear is the conversations of people waiting for a table. Normally this is a good omen for the food to come. Not so much. 

Let's start with the salads shall we? All the pasta dishes here come with a salad. It's your standard house salad consisting of iceberg lettuce, carrots, cucumber and tomato but add in some baby greens. I love baby greens however not with iceberg lettuce. They just do not taste well together especially when the iceberg was limp. LIMP! 

The entrees were more of a colossal fail than the salads. My pesto pasta was GREASY and way over-spiced. It felt like I was eating straight cloves of garlic. I had to put so much cheese on the pasta just to make it less slimy and to tone down the fire-garlic. I also ordered Italian sausage with my pasta. Which if you look how ordering meat with a pasta goes it appears it comes as an addition to the dish. No. In fact the sausage came drenched in red sauce. That sausage was the only thing we had worth eating. It was mild but spicy, tender, juicy and meaty and cooked to perfection. The red sauce was on the sweet side of sweet and low so we won't even get into that disaster. My husband's food was no better. The alfredo was RUNNY and bland. It was like cream. Just cream. No garlic no cheese and most certainly no flavor. 

And here I must add when I see large and small on a menu when it comes to portion size I expect there to be a difference. I really didn't see one my small looked like the same amount of pasta on a smaller plate. Not worth the extra to go for the large. 

All in all there are so many better cheap independent italian restaurants out there to eat crappy pasta. Find somewhere else to eat.

Don't miss:
The sausage was yummy. I think it would make a good pizza.

Hit or miss:
Getting a table

Avoid like the plague: 
pesto
alfredo 
and eating at this atrocious Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The perfect, family friendly, Mom&Pop joint.  Peppers offers a cozy, casual dining experience.  This is Italian/American food at it's most flavorful and least fussy.  Another great locally owned, and locally run restaurant to make Lakewood proud."}
{"text":"Went to Peppers for the first time Monday night...amazing! Service was very friendly and the food was excellent! I love that it's so down to earth and it really reminds me of restaurants I've gone to in Europe! My husband got the eggplant Parmesan which he inhaled, I got penne with chicken and Alfredo. Our server suggested we get a large for two extra bucks, I'm glad I did, it was awesome! We really wanted dessert, but we had just drove from Michigan and were too tired!! Thanks again, Peppers, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love Peppers best Italian restaurant  in Northeastern Ohio. Family owned and operated,  You can eat in or carry out. The food is excellent, the  dining room servers are courteous and the kitchen staff is on top of it, NEVER disappointed with the service or the food!  The home made GRAPE PIE IS FANTASTIC! The TIRAMISU just melts in your mouth, Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a GEM in Lakewood. My husband heard about it at work so we decided to go for an early dinner around 6:00 pm last night. My husband ordered the lasagna with meat sauce & I ordered the lobster Mac. Both dishes we saw were one of their popular dishes on Yelp so we tried them. My husband said this is his new favorite restaurant. We will be frequent customers. Great service great food. Very small restaurant though so we will come early every time we come. Only negative I can say is the restaurant was so hot (maybe from the ovens) my husband had to walk outside halfway through his dinner because it was so hot. But that doesn't affect anything we will still come back."}
{"text":"Used to be our go to place when we wanted good food and an intimate environment, oh how things have changed! What had always been a pleasant dining experence has turned into a tension filled lesson on how not to run a restaurant! All of the waitresses that we enjoyed chatting with are gone and replaced with what appeared to be children. The host and one of the cooks spent the entire time we were there staring each other down and making threatening gestures towards each other,how freaking enjoyable! I am a student and my lovely girlfriend paid for this with her hard earned money,for which i will always feel guilty! The neighborhood is awful,but was worth coming to in the past but with the new personel and tons of internal strife which sucks you in the second you walk in,its not worth the effort! GOOD BYE PEPPERS!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area.  The restaurants in little Italy aren't terribly exciting, and tend to be overpriced.  The chain restaurants in the suburbs tend to be hideous affronts to Italian cuisine.  This place is a genuine Italian restaurant serving very good food.

The food is flavorful without being too heavy like most American-Italian restaurants are.  While they do serve pizza, and while the neon sign in the window makes it look like primarily a pizza joint, this place is far from it.  The atmosphere is very cozy.  This place is perfect for a quiet, romantic dinner.  They serve real food...the entrees are outstanding...and they have some amazing concord grape pie when it's in season."}
{"text":"This place is thus far provided the best Italian meal I have had in Cleveland. The restaurant is very quaint and genuine. The restaurant is quite small so expect a wait, especially if you are eating earlier in the night since this place seems to be a favorite amongst older crowds. The food is amazing and very reasonably priced. I recommend the lasagna, but I've heard great things about the pizza as well. 

Pepper's is officially on my list of places to take out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"Pepper's Deluxe Pizza was very good and well worth the wait on a Saturday night for a table in the small dining room.  The toppings definitely stood out--abundant and very fresh.  The only thing lacking in my opinion was a little more sauce on the pizza to help tie all the elements together.  We also tried the Homemade Grape Pie after hearing about it over and over while we were waiting--it was okay, but not something I would order again.  Overall, though, the quality of the pizza makes Pepper's a solid dining option, and ordering for take-out would be a great way to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some high quality pizza or pasta in Lakewood, Peppers is the place to go. I wouldn't recommend dining in because the restaurant is super small & frequently crowded. It's not uncommon to see people waiting outside for a seat. The restaurant doesn't open until 5pm, but if you're looking for pizza it's worth the wait. The crust is hand tossed, sauce is super sweet and thinly applied, the cheese is always thick (with the right amount of grease) and the pepperoni is crispy on top. We usually pick up a salad or the fried zucchini sticks too. I've tried my fair share of their pasta dishes, but with Peppers the pizza is too good to pass up. But don't forget desert--they have extensive options. I recommend the tiramisu or cassata cake. Maybe both ;)"}
{"text":"Like most, I'd give this place 4 stars.  Awesome food, but only OK service.  It seems to be family owned, and the younger family members were waiting tables, which might not be their strength.  But, the food and atmosphere make up for that -- overall a good experience there."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade comfort Italian food. Just GOOD, makes you want to eat until you are stuffed. Large selection the menu. Good wine list too. The staff is friendly and wait time is reasonable.

Only negative is the size inside. You are basically sitting on your neighbor and people are constantly bumping into your table when being seated/leaving/going to the bathroom. But the food is so good i am willing to overlook this!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. We went for my wife's birthday and everything was delicious. We went at 530 on Saturday and had a 30 minute wait so plan accordingly! We will return every chance we get. Come hungry!!!!"}
{"text":"Just think SMALL. Great for dates and 4-6 people. Be prepared to wait BUT it will be worth it. Pizza is is sone of the best, if not the best in Da'Wood. Space and parking ( OK it's LKWD) are crippling them."}
{"text":"I arrived at Pepper's slightly before 5pm and there was already a small crowd forming outside the door. We were seated right away and placed an order for a medium pizza, fried calamari, and baked manicotti. The staff was extremely friendly and checked up on us often. About four different people came up to our table to make sure we were okay and the food was good. The calamari was nothing special. The sauce was thin and the breading was mediocre. The pizza (medium deluxe) was ginormous. It easily could have fed about 3-4 people, and was rich with lots of toppings and good stuff. Needless to say, I only had a couple of slices before throwing in the towel. The baked manicotti came out hot and piping, but it wasn't seasoned very well and lacked flavor. The staff was amazing and very friendly, and the food is okay. Not a bad spot! I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've had. Ordered the fettuccine alfredo with sausage, which had a nice kick to it. The service was also primo. Very comfortable setting too. No TV's distracting you either."}
{"text":"Love this place, my \"go to\" when someone is in town.  One of my top fav pizza.  The only downfall to this place is that it's very small and quite popular.  Family owned and you can tell, the staff is so friendly.  So you may not get seated on a Friday or Saturday during peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out this place for some time now and finally the Mr & I did over the weekend.  We went on a Saturday night around 9pm.  Its a small place so if you're going with a large (er) crowd you may want to call ahead to be sure they have room.  We ordered a small pizza as appetizer, delicious!  The crust reminds me of how you would make a \"pie\" crust, not your typical pizza pie crust.  We both ordered house salads with Italian dressing...your standard but good.  I ordered the housemade lasagna, which was TO DIE for!  Make sure you are hungry b/c its a huge serving.  It is served in a brown ceramic dish and comes out pipping hot!  My husband ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce.  The sauce for both meals is on the sweeter side.  We both had enough left over that we were able to take some home and have for lunch the next day.  We finished off our meal with some gelato.  I was torn between ordering gelato or getting a cannoli but quickly found out they were sold out of the cannoli's.  We ordered 4 small scoops, yes 4!   Blood orange, coconut, chocolate and tiramisu...all so tastey and hit the spot!  

I would recommend this place if you are wanting/craving some good home cooked Italian food.  I plan on going back again for seconds!!  

Another perk from our 1st dinning experience here, I ordered a glass of red wine and go WAY more than I normally do when ordering wine from any restaurant!!  Very generous!!"}
{"text":"amazing eggplant parmesan! i also love their tomato sauce. i get the meatless one and i love it, but i'm sure the meat one is great as well."}
{"text":"I love this place.  You walk in and feel right at home.  Everyone is incredibly nice.  The sauce is a delicious combination of sweet and spicy and I love the Italian Wedding soup.  
The server has been there for quite sometime and is quite fun to talk to but she can be forgetful and when the place gets crowded you have almost zero chance of getting your water filled or her attention.  However, the decor and the atmosphere make it almost impossible to get mad or frustrated."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday July 2 after being on the Goodtime3 . Food was outstanding! I got the spaghetti with meat sauce and added a meatball. No need to get the meatball because the sauce was loaded with meat! My beautiful wife got the eggplant and had it for 3 days after! Only thing I would like to see would be Italian bread in place of rolls.I live in the Akron area but I will  go back again!! Thank you!  Service was also great! Got a pizza to go and it was outstanding also"}
{"text":"Pretty standard pizza - better than a chain for sure but nothing exceptional . I've been here several times for takeout. Last time I called for takeout they declined taking my order because they were \"too busy\" in-house. Like WTF!? That's not allowed. Looks like it's time to find a new local pizza joint that actually wants my business!"}
{"text":"Best Italian I've ever had. I come here every time I'm in town. The meat sauce is to die for. Must try the lasagna but you honestly can't go wrong with anything!"}
{"text":"hands down the best italian in cle

little hole in the wall that can seat about 20 people, do yourself a favor GO HERE!!!
honestly you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.
My fav is the baked ravioli and the bread is BOMB.
The service is second to none and i always leave super satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love peppers! Whenever i want italian food this is my go-to. The bread is always fresh, and the vodka sauce is so yummy! One of my favorite spots in Lakewood."}
{"text":"There aren't many Italian restaurants in Lakewood, so I'm very glad this place exist. It's not like one of those modern restaurants, this is a little place with character and a fabulous staff. You'll find some award winning dishes on the menu like the lasagna and the BLT Pizza. The prices are fair and definitely affordable."}
{"text":"This is a great, local, authentic Italian restaurant.  The space is small and generally is crowded (for good reason).  

The Eggplant Parmesan and Italian Wedding Soup are both amazing and I would recommend trying both.  

My only complaint about Pepper's is that they have a very limited dessert menu.  They make a grape pie (which I have tried and don't care for), but they don't have tiramisu."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Peppers and I'm glad we did.  It's a really small place with only about three booths and nine 2-person tables that can be reconfigured to accommodate larger parties.  We lucked out as there was no wait when we arrived.  I ordered the chicken romano and my wife had the eggplant parmesan.  Both came with a salad... Sort of.  It was a bit of green and single tomato with a slice of cucumber quartered then strategically placed around. I could have upgraded to a better salad for $2 and next time I probably will. That's probably their evil master plan.  Their italian dressing was very flavorful. The entrees arrived and the portion sizes made me happy.  The chicken was tender and juicy and the alfredo sauce was some of the best i ever had.  The eggplant was prepared perfectly - the breading was just crispy enough to eliminate any sogginess that you have at some restaurants  and lock in the flavor of the eggplant. The entrees were absolutely fantastic and prepared flawlessly!  When we left Peppers was now crowded and clearly a favorite of the community."}
{"text":"Do you remember the time when you were a hungry poor immigrant proudly residing in the $400 apartment in Parma with brown carpet and smelly Indian neighbors? Well, I do. Vividly. 
Back then, I, constantly, in the mode of the survivor, would have loved \"Peppers\", this tiny mom-pop restaurant on Madison. Because all I cared for in dining experience was satisfying hunger and kindness of the service. I was grasping on the kindness in general, desperately planting its seeds around me by over tipping waiters and never complaining about some terrible food, hoping for it to bloom and grow in my world of a 20 year old waitressing through  the college as well. 
Times have changed. Kindness is no longer enough. I sort of demand good food nowadays. Because I've seen it, eaten it, I know it's around.  \"Peppers\" left me anything but hungry. It included amazed at what the restaurant with such a generic mediocre food was getting away with.
The atmosphere was wonderful, the food was not Italian. It was a poorly disguised Midwest attempt at authenticity.
I've tried that calamari before out of the 5 pound frozen bag at Sam's club. My side salad included Iceberg lettuce, one tomato and quarter of the slice of the cucumber (not even a slice?)
Conclude all of this with wonder bread rolls and over-breaded, over-creamed and cheesed entrees. 
But kindness and wine were being poured generously. The owner itself brought us a tray of cheap hard candy inviting us to indulge.
We felt as grateful as orphans being fed free Christmas dinner in the times of the Great Depression. 
Only we paid hard -earned cash for a below average pseudo-Italian dinner in 2011. Not gonna happen again.

Up-side : cheap and cozy and friendly
Down -side : Not as nealy authentic as \"Mama Santa\" or \"Dolce Vita\" in Little Italy. Limited seating, stressful parking
Summary: Why would you do it:?"}
{"text":"Located on a corner of a building, parking on street.

Small inside, about 4 booths, a few 4 tops and a few doubles. A small area on the sidewalk outside with a few tables for when the weather is nice.  

Good hot toddy in the fall! 
Loved my grilled chicken salad.  Very fresh and a lot of chicken!  I asked if they could season the chix, and they did.  Chicken Parmesan was very good, and a large portion.  We had leftovers from both meals! 
We love the plain warmed rolls they give you.
And in the fall, the best thing ever is THE GRAPE PIE!
Hands down the best pie on earth!"}
{"text":"Worst sauces I've ever tasted. You'd do better buying a jar of Prego. I had a Marsala that tasted like it belonged in a cheap China buffet, not on pasta. Dont trust these 4 and 5 Star reviewers."}
{"text":"YUM!
Yum, Yum, Yum! 

Did I mention that Dinner was YUM! 

We ordered the garlic bread with cheese - YUM!

I had the eggplant parmigiana- YUMM!!!! So good

My husband had the lasagna - very good taste. 

Both meals came with a salad. 

The restaurant is on the older side, very small and has boarded up windows - don't let the looks fool you, the food was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Truly great food where they seem to pay attention to what you actually want.  Example:  I went there with a friend who was on a diet, so he ordered one of their large salads without dressing, meat, cheese, and all the other good stuff.  Not only did he not receive a chintzy salad indicative of the chef's disdain for special orders, he received a custom made salad that was obviously loaded up with extra fruit, veggies, etc. because that's what he wanted.  So impressed!  I've tried many items here, and the moral of the story is order anything - it'll be good.

I am typically a late night diner so I've never had the long wait here that other people mention, but I wouldn't be surprised or unhappy to wait for a table.  Also, despite my late night preferences, they have never made me feel rushed.  Everything here is quality and it is in no way overpriced for what you get.

Also, I really love that the lasagna is made with only pork, not beef, because it reminds me of the lasagna my Italian family made when I was young."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service.  Good eats.  My husband got the lasagna and I got their baked ravioli.  Both were delicious!  They also have a nice little outdoor patio if you like to eat outside.  Will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Cue the Godfather theme music... 

As we walked in to this little Italian gem we were immediately greeted by a friendly bald man with kind welcoming eyes. One of the things I am learning in my short time in Lakewood, is that the proprietors of the restaurants are genuinely grateful that you are patronizing their establishments. Nothing starts the experience off right, like a friendly smile. 

It's a very tiny little place with enough space for about 8 couples. We were immediately seated and the hostess rattled off all the local beers they had available. My wife ordered a Pinot Noir and I opted for simple Coke (I'm a cheap date.)

Onto my meal. For me, the hallmark of any Italian restaurant is the Chicken Parmesan. I ordered that with the Creamy Tomato Tortellini Soup. The soup itself could have made a great meal. So hearty and full of flavor, and just the right portion so I wasn't getting full when my meal came.

Then came the Chicken Parm. A gigantic butterflied  breast the size of a baby's head. Covered in marinara and cheese on a bed of spaghetti. It tasted as wonderful as it looked, juicy, succulent, and delicious. And the pasta... Usually for me, pasta is more of a garnish for the chicken, but to Peppers' credit I actually finished my pasta before the chicken. The sauce is very flavorful, with a hint of sweetness. Perfect.

In the end I was too full to consider dessert, despite the wonderful selections they offered, cannoli, gelato... But alas, my stomach was filled with a perfect Italian meal and at least for this time, I would have to leave the gun and the cannoli. Next time, it could be an offer I can't refuse."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to restaurant for pizza!  I have tried some of their other entrees, which are good, but their pizza is a must.  They are also known for their grape pie - for good reasons.  The staff is incredibly friendly and is small enough that they will get to know you if you frequent the restaurant.  The place is small and gets filled quickly, so get there ahead of time if you plan on going on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Very good food at reasonable prices. Ordered the battered Zucchini for appetizer.  Delicious and they give you a ton. My daughter had the ravioli and I had the lobster mac'n'cheese. Both were awesome.  One flaw, the water was not good."}
{"text":"lasagna is the best thing on the menu, have had it like 5 times 

huge wine glasses"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Incredible meatballs and meat sauce, awesome portions and the Italian sausage and veal parmigiana was excellent. The cheesy garlic bread was also wonderful."}
{"text":"Some of the most overpriced, lowest quality Italian food I've had. I had chicken marsala and the sauce was waaaay too sweet. My boyfriend had romano chicken and it tasted like a frozen meal. I have to say, the calamari was good, but walking out with an $80 bill and nothing but a lot of talk about how great the concord grape pie was (spoiler alert...it was gross) I was totally disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best things about Cleveland is that you know what true homemade cooking is from so many different cultures.  I don't have an Italian mom, but my friends's do - and I felt like I was at home and welcome at Peppers.  This includes their staff, clientele,and food.  Mom and Pop at its best."}
{"text":"Good food!!! Not great but acceptable, for Lakewood. Big portions, and reasonable prices.  We will be back.  The only reason i didn't give this place 5 stars, is because the service was too slow."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm with a side of penne with tomato vodka sauce. Both sauces were VERY sweet tasting. And I don't mean sweet as in awesome--I mean it as literally tasting like sugar. Not authentic Italian sauce, and judging by 95% of the other reviews, no one really seems to know what that is. I was thoroughly disappointed after reading the reviews thinking I would find a little gem on the West Side. Ah well, I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"A wonderful family owned and authentic Italian restaurant!!  Definitely ranks in the top 5 of Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! I don't usually go the Mom and Pop restaurants--the waxy tables, the assorted old art on the walls, the rickety lattice wall that barely hides the kitchen--but this place was great for the money. The pizza was really outstanding, with so many toppings they were falling off our plates. The service was a bit slow, but that was probably my own hungry skewing my perception. The prices were affordable, and the atmosphere is cozy. Great for visiting relatives or a family night out."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best Italian food, ever! We are driving across the country, from California to New York and found this place by chance...boy did we get lucky! Excellent service, so warm & friendly and the food was amazing! Fresh, and cooked to perfection. Romano chicken and lasagna were to die for! If I could give this place 10 stars, I would."}
{"text":"This was some of the best pizza I have had. I'm visiting from out of town and my Dad took me out for dinner. Service was friendly and fast. Definitely coming back here next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"best italian food i've had in a really long time.. if you go there. be prepared  to eat. haha.."}
{"text":"the seating is cramped .. the wait for food a bit long .. but the spectacular service + the quality of the food more than makes up for both .. reasonably priced for the amount of food they offer .. had debated between the manicotti + the veal parm but the choice was made easier when told they did not have any veal to offer that evening .. the manicotti was wonderful .. calamari appetizer did not disappoint .. (other dishes on our table were pepperoni pizza + chicken picatta .. all diners in our party raved about the food) .. took a piece of their seasonal grape pie home & I gotta say it is one of the most interesting desserts I have had in a very long time .. this was my 1st visit here base on recommendations from a co-worker .. glad I took her advice to check this hidden gem out .. I will be back .. warning: the place is small so if they are busy be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop restaurant that truly delivers that homey feeling, food, and friendliness. The service was excellent and you just feel transported away from suburban Lakewood. When I say the service is great I mean when they ran out of the beer we wanted, the owner went to thy sour across the street to get it. When the server realized she made a mistake with my Alfredo order which made it come out later (no biggie to me), she bought us dessert. 

We tried the award winning lasagna and ravioli which were both delicious and fulfilling. The red sauce had a nice sweetness to it. I've also tried the audio sauce which is heavenly. Finally the cassatta cake is from the bakery down the street, KB connections, and it's perfect. I will have to come back and try the grape pie when it's in season."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Pepper's! If you haven't been, get there now! Super quaint Italian restaurant that can't be beat. Everything in their menu is amazing, and I always hold a special place in my heart for a restaurant with a heavy wine pour:)

In the Fall they have a Concord grape pie. I'm not a pie fan at all... but am so excited when this is in season because it's so good! Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and had one of the best meals, and best experiences of my life. The staff is so friendly and fun, the food is out of this world, and the atmosphere is awesome. Lived in Lakewood for a long time now and think it might be the best place in town. Prices range from super affordable to a bit high but there's an option for anybody on any budget here. The lobster mac n cheese is bonkers! - can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lasagna lasagna lasagna lasagna lasagna... Garfield would never go home to John if he discovered this place. The sweet red sauce dresses a mound of noodle and cheese snuggled by delicious morsels of sausage. It is layers and layers of flavor. Think like inception styled flavor. It reaches higher levels than an elevator. 

We wrap our journey up here with can't beat it Cassata cake. If I was to send you on a journey through Lakewood it would begin here. 

The pizza is a solid choice too. Loved the veggie pie. Crust was good. 

Cute quaint little Lakewood spot.   Lasagna is a MUST!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Very small on the inside so you run the risk of having to wait a long time or settle for take out. But the staff is nice and the pasta is great. Small family restaurant perfect for dates or dinner with the family."}
{"text":"This is a great tiny Italian nook on Detroit. 

Upon walking in, I was knew I was in a mom and pop family Italian restaurant: Frank Sinatra was crooning in the background with Italian pictures and tchotkes all over the walls, like grandma's well maintained basement. The place is tiny: seats no more than 30, with 3 tables for 4 [it would be difficult to bring a group larger than 4 here], and the rest 2seaters and no space to wait inside. 
 
The service was great: better than typical mom and pop restaurants, and our waitress constantly refilled our drinks. There was 2-3 servers for less than 10 tables. 

The menu had the more common Italian dishes, veal parmeseans, spaghettis, lasangas, with cheeses and meat, ravoli, and pizza. 
They also offer 4 sauces: a meat, a tomato, an alfredo, and a pesto. I had the tomato sauce: it's rich, a tad spicy, not salty nor watery, I loved it. The plate of gnocchi, the daily special, along with a cup of soup or a salad, for $9, and quality of the food, was a great price. The rest of the menu was also very inexpensive, no item more than $15-20. A plate of spaghetti was only $10 ! 

I'll be sure to come by again, especially for that value."}
{"text":"Worst \"Italian\" food I've ever eaten.  Ever."}
{"text":"I dined here with three friends for dinner on 2/6/16. We missed the first seating (5:00 p.m.) and waited about 40 minutes for our table The waiting area is very limited with a bench and one chair so we stood with others and waited. The size of the restaurant adds to its charm and it brings to mind small cafes in Italy. The smell of Italian herbs permeates the air and the pizza baking in the oven can make your mouth water. We were seated and promptly greeted by our server who handed us our menus and took our drink order. The menu is extensive,  featuring mostly chicken and veal entrees along with pastas, ravioli, and lasagna. The meatballs are wonderful! 
 
We ordered, and chose wedding soup as a starter. The warm rolls were delicious and one was dotted with olives, the others were plain or had a cheese topping. The salads are mostly greens and spring mix topped with grape tomatoes and choice of dressing.

Our entrees included: chicken marsala, with a side of penne, spaghetti with meatballs, a pizza with pepperoni and onions, and ravioli stuffed with meat and cheese. ALL of the entrees were DELICIOUS! Hands down, the best Italian meals that can be gotten outside of mama's kitchen. 
We were too full to order desserts but Cassata cake was the feature and it look delightful. 

We left content and satisfied. I would highly recommend Pepper's to anyone who appreciates good Italian food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place a couple of years ago on the way to a show at the Beck,  and for the life of me couldn't find it again. The other night, I learned that this charming little italian joint on the corner of Detroit was Pepper's, and it's just as lovely as before. Adorable atmosphere, fantastic service, pretty decent Italian food for about $15 a plate, and the Cassada cake is great!"}
{"text":"Peppers is amazing! I'm so sad that it's been on my list and I went so long without trying it. I read reviews that described how small the restaurant was, but I didn't realize just how small until I saw it in person! There were maybe 8-10 tables total so I would say big groups are probably out. I also heard the hostess on the phone saying they don't do reservations or call ahead seating. The waiting area consists of 3 seats and almost no standing room, so keep this in mind if it's too cold to wait outside. There were a lot of people getting take out, so that's a good option if you don't want to wait. 

My boyfriend and I visited this past Saturday around 6:30 pm. We did wait for about 20 minutes, which is actually less than I expected with the size of the restaurant and number of other people waiting. Once we were seated, we were greeted immediately. Our server was friendly and prompt. 

Now for the food: I had such a hard time choosing! There are so many awesome sounding options and I can't wait to go back to try some more. My boyfriend went with the lasagna and I ordered the chicken Romano. Both were beyond delicious! The meat sauce with the lasagna was so good and was exactly what I want when I order lasagna. The chicken Romano is basically chicken parm but with white sauce and cake with a side of pasta Alfredo. Both dinners came with a salad and dinner rolls, which were also very good!

The prices were a little high in my opinion ($17 lasagna and $19 chicken Romano) but the portions were decent. Although we did not order any alcohol, the beer was $5 and the wine looked to average $10 a glass. 

Overall a great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good pizza in Cleveland, which can be very hard to come by, this is your place. Their pasta dishes are amazing too, it's definitely their sauce. If you dine in, it's a little cozy (and by cozy, I mean congested) but the food is totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Have only ever had their take out. Order is always correct and ready quickly! I have to mention Joe...always polite and laid back, never rushed. Very appreciated!"}
{"text":"I've had several take-outs including pizza, lasagna and wedding soup.  They're all beyond superlative.  My only criticism is the salad; the very, banal, ubiquitous iceberg and carrot premix.  And although they add some veggies like cucumber and tomato, it's not nearly enough compensation.  No restaurant the really prides itself on their menu (like Peppers!) should ever use iceberg.  They might give some thought to upgrading the salad to match the quality of the main meal.  Used mixed greens, greens and spinach, or sweet butter."}
{"text":"As you walk in you get the feel of a small Italian joint.  Atmosphere was great space is some what tight.  Would hate to be in there if it were crowded. Service took  a little longer then normal and but once we got in there and got order the food was delicious.  Even though my order got messed up I ate it anyways and glad I did. However the tea was the worst thing I've tasted in my life.  You can tell they make it in the same pot as the coffee. Lol.  A great place to try if you're in the area"}
{"text":"I live less than a mile from Pepper's, I pass it at least once a week for the last year.My friend wanted to go there for her birthday dinner. I'm glad she did, actually, I wish I tried the place sooner. We got there a litte after 7pm on a Wednesday. It is a tiny restaurant. I had cheese stuffed egg/spinach ravioli topped with olive oil and garlic sauce, I was in heaven!! The bread was amazing, there are three different ones - garlic roll, herb roll and olive roll. Since it was my friend's birthday, we ordered a slice of chocolate cake with caramel frosting. They came out with a candle in the cake and sang happy birthday!"}
{"text":"Lets start this off by stating, I love food. Almost all food. But out of all the \"types\", Italian is my least favorite. Let me count the ways:
Meat Sauce... ew. 
When growing up, my family's version of Italian was mixing a can of Prego with a can of Ragu and microwaving precooked, starchy noodles. 
I can only handle so much sundried tomatoes. 


I fell in love with Peppers. The menu is simple and to the point. The pesto was not too overpowering, and I didn't feel overly full  after eating a small bowl of linguini. The highlight was the concord grape pie. Amazing. I crave this all the time. They wait til fall to literally crush tons of concord grapes to fill these pies that I honestly believe are the best kept secret in Lakewood. You have to arrive around 5 or you won't get a seat. Everyone's so friendly I don't completely mind waiting. All this writing has got me working up an appetite. Guess who's getting takeout..."}
{"text":"This place is tiny so be prepared to wait for awhile during dinner hours or whenever it is nice out.  There are maybe 15 tables so there are not many people shuffling in and out constantly.  The place is older but quaint and honestly kind of reminded me of being at my grandparents house for dinner.  I think that is what adds to the charm of this place!  If you are lucky enough to get a table, you will not be disappointed.  

They are famous for their lasagna and unless you are really hungry, you will be taking some home.  The portions are HUGE and you could easily split with someone.  I have been their twice and both times I have gotten the veggie lasagna.  Usually it is made with white alfredo sauce, but I get it with their wonderful red sauce! You really can not go wrong either way.  Both times it was amazing and they fill it with a good amount of veggies such as carrots, broccoli, and peppers.  Entrees are served with salad and bread, both of which are pretty decent.  I have always heard that they are well known for their pizza, so I want to try that next time!"}
{"text":"I Love this place is amazing  the spaghetti and  meatballs are delicious it reminds me of the godfather. Magnifico"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant- friendly staff, great food and an excellent price. The spaghetti with meat sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"For those who don't know about it, Pepper's is one of those \"sleeper cell\" Italian restaurants that you absolutely must go to. The cheesy garlic bread app with their signature house marinara sauce is incredible. And their lasagna is the best I've ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"The best ma and pa Italian restaurant in town. Veal parmesan is crazy good and takes up  
 Whole plate so you can take home for lunch the next day or a midnight snack."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Everyone was so friendly and very good when asking about substitutions. The pizza was amazing. Shared a Margarita Pizza that we crushed in a single setting. Wait is slightly long but the pizza made up for it as did the atmosphere. Totally would recommend if you are in Lakewoood or in the Cleveland area"}
{"text":"Great food and staff is very nice. Authentic cooking, the lasagna is to die for. Mixed green salad, not the plain old lettuce. New- frozen wine. Just make sure you ask for water too"}
{"text":"By far my favorite italian restaurant.  Their red sauce is amazing and I always go for the Chicken Parm.  Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Their spaghetti sauce is the best, delicious. It has a taste of red wine in it that smacks your palate like WOW!
Very good pour on the wine, nice portions. 
Excellent service.  Manager or owner comes around to the tables to ask how everything is - as it should be if they really care about their restaurant.  
Some say it is pricey but that is what you pay for with  good quality food.  
It is small and quaint.  
Wonderful place!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny, so be prepared to wait. BUT DONT LEAVE!!! Ive never been to Italy, but I feel like I have now! The whole atmosphere is so cozy. Everyone is so friendly. The food is INCREDIBLE! I got the fried mozzarella - YUM! And then I got penne with the vodka sauce and it was so creamy and a pure taste of heaven."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this place based on the fact that it only seats about 20 people.  The reviews however were fantastic.  I gave it a try.  I was not disappointed!  I had the pizza which was amazing.  I can eat much more than the average person and I still got the meat sweats after only 3 pieces.  The rest of my group had Lasagna.  They all said it was one of the best they had.  Very attentive staff.  If you love to crush amazing Italian food with large portions, this is your place. Peace."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place on Yelp when we decided to go out for Mother's Day dinner and my mom chose Italian. Our usual Go To Italian restaurant is Bruno's but since it was late, we looked for something closer to home. This place did not disappoint!  We did have to wait to get seated, because the restaurant is pretty small and it was full when we got there, but the owners/staff were so nice and they gave us a complimentary order of garlic bread for our patience and \"good attitude.\" It came with a side order of their marinara sauce and we immediately fell in love. The sauce is to die for! It has a slow cooked, rich taste with pops of red wine.  It was so good, we were fighting over who could finish the sauce with a spoon. My entire family is vegetarian and they had enough favorites to choose from, but it is definitely not a very robust menu.  But, what they do, they do amazing! After the delicious dinner, our server recommended the Grape Pie. We are usually not dessert people, but it sounded different enough and it came with such strong recommendations that we decided to try a piece. WOW!  It was amazing and nothing like what we imagined in our heads. One piece was perfect for 5 of us to share! 

We will definitely be going back to Peppers when we have craving for home cooked Italian food!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant!! The food was soooo amazing and the owner was so sweet and nice to talk to! Loved it and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"You know who has great pizza?  Peppers!

Seriously, it is so wonderful and unique.  Never had better pie anywhere else.

I've only done carryout, but the cute inside seems worthy of butt-parking for an hour or so. It smells delicious!"}
{"text":"If you want homemade everything and sweet homemade sauce this is the place for you. Very small and expect to wait but soooo worth it."}
{"text":"This is the smallest restaurant I've ever been in. And the best Italian restaurant I've ever been in. Pretty simple menu in terms of protein - chicken or veal with various sauces, but the chicken portion was big. There was lots of white meat cooked perfectly. The pasta sauce on the side of pasta was superb and you have your pick of sauces for that as well. Really homey and warm family-like atmosphere, but expect to wait."}
{"text":"I been waiting to come here since reading reviews, Peppers has meet my expectations plus some. My wife had the Chicken Parm. big portion she could not finish. I went with my go to Italian dish Lasagna and IT WAS OUTSTANDING. This has become my new Italian. Oh btw I came from North Ridgeville. Thanks Peppers ! ( I know you wish you had more seating :) )"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! It is a very small restaurant with the nicest, happiest employees. Everyone from the hostess to our waitress to the manager were so friendly and welcoming. The food was exactly what you want when you are craving Italian food. Everything we ate had that \"family recipe\" taste. The lasagna is a must!! If I lived in Cleveland, I would be eating here every week."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, especially for being a little hole-in-the-wall spot. I've ventured out to Peppers a few times now, and all the important things are consistently great.

Service- friendly, down-to-earth and attentive. It's not just one employee, but all employees give you that warm and fuzzy feeling.

Food- Lasagna, ravioli, chicken parm... whatever you get it's going to be good. They have a great sauce and the quality of food is outstanding overall. Everything is seasoned perfectly. If you're lucky enough to be there on a day in the fall when they have their grape pie, do yourself a favor and get a piece to eat there and another one to take home. It's that good.

Price- A little higher than other restaurants, but for the quality and taste of what you're getting it's worth it.

Decor - not the most modern, but it's not so tacky that it detracts from the overall experience. It's a cozy little spot.

Lakewood is lucky to have this place!"}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by saying that I dined at Peppers once before and remember the experience as a good one.
However, this past Sunday was a complete disaster.

We arrived at Peppers around 7pm on a Sunday night. We were seated right away and the place was about half full for a late Sunday dinner. We ordered a drink and our meals fairly quickly and then waited. We watched as our waitress calmly chatted with a table across from us for a good 10 minutes. When she did bring the bread and salads I should have hoped that she talked longer and forgot to bring this part of the meal. We received 2, literally 2, very smalls rolls. The one that looked the most edible, my boyfriend snatched first and left me with something that looked and smelled like old olive bread. I ate 3 bites, drenched in butter, decided to give up and move onto the salad.

The salad was the next disappointment. It was very obvious that it was a bag of iceberg lettucs with precut carrots. Ugh! Could have gotten that from the grocery store. The balsamic vinagrette dressing I ordered came in the two seperate bottles which were incredibly hard to poor and ran down the side of the bottle onto my hands. 

A few minutes after our food arrived. My boyfriend ordered veal parm with penne pasta. It was a large portion and he said \"it wasn't bad\". I ordered the fettuccine pasta with pesto sauce and chicken. To me, it tasted incredibly bland and the chicken tasted frozen. I sprinkled my dish was salt, olive oil and cheese multiple times to try to get some taste. I was so disappointed because I was really hungry and the last time I ate here it was good. It also didn't help that the whole time we were there the microwave in the kitchen kept going off. We could literally hear the microwave door opening and closing and the timer going off repeatedly. That probably should have been our first clue that our meal was going to be a letdown. Maybe we came on the wrong day at the wrong time, but the whole meal was such a disappointment. For the prices they charge (veal parm =$19.95; pasta with pesto and chicken =$14.95) the quality of the food should have been much better."}
{"text":"Great Meal. Super cool retro Italian cafe. Will certainly go back. And last but not least, Veal! Cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My friend and I came across this place on Yelp last night (a Thursday). We were down the street shopping and wanted something local. We were not disappointed. 

Fair warning though, it is definitely small. You might have to wait for a table. Not a problem at all. The staff gave us menus while we waited and even chatted and joked with us. The wait wasn't more than ten minutes. 

We both got the lasagna--their signature dish. It came out piping hot with sauce still boiling. (It does take a bit to get food but that's because it's actually prepared and made for you). It was so good and filling. 

The wait staff was friendly and prompt. Such a little jewel in the neighborhood that I am definitely glad we took a chance on. 

We will be back."}
