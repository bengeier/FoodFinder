{"text":"Never been in the area and decided to stop with some friends. Cool atmosphere, very nice help, food was perfect! Black and bleu burger was very good and recommended. Great stop!"}
{"text":"They really changed this place around.  It's an open environment.  Made to look like a man cave.  Food was tasty and decently priced"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food, the friendly staff, the overal ambiance of the place- it's all spot on.  It's a great place to go to grab a bite to eat and/or a drink with friends and just relax.  

 For the true American man who like to sit on the couch and watch some good old fashioned TV while they eat, they've got TV's everyehere and couches, yes i said that correctly, COUCHES as well as arm chairs with detchable trays. Or if you're just looking for somewhere to bunker down with some friends for a couple hours to watch your favorite teams on a big screen with a few beers then this is the place for you.  They have couches and beer bongs.  Need i say more?

For us women out there that might be looking for a little more ambiance than big screens and couches in our dinner plans, they've also got regular tables, booths and outdoor patio seating where you can just sit, chat and take in the awesome food and decor.  They have 2 huge, awesome fireplaces- one in door and one out door that are just beautiful to take in.The sayings on the walls are hilarious so take a second to read them all (my personal favorite is \"I drink to make other people more interesting\"  ;-)), there is framed underwear outside the restroom doors (a thong indicating the women's room and boxers indicating the men's room) and just in case that all wasn't great enough- there is a little bit of framed eye candy in the restrooms as well.  Don't worry it's nothing graphic that you would want to hid your childrens eyes from, but just enough to put a smile on your face ;-)  

The food is really quite good- kind of like bar fare with a little bit of a high end twist- and it really works.  I've been there 4 or 5 times, have had something different everytime, and have yet to be disappointed.  The drinks are awesome as well.  I highly reccomend the \"Bee's Knees\" if you're into mixed drinks- it's a bit sweet so you'll probably only want to do one or 2 of them but frankly, that's all most people have with dinner anyways so it's perfect. 

And for those of you that were concerned with the waitress' dress code... that is a non-issue anymore.  They have standard clothes on these days so no need to shy away from coming back.

My only 2 complaints would be that I wish they had some more healthy options on the menu.  And once they address that, they should move closer to my house ;-)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  I came for the beer (decent selection, not great), but I was more impressed with the food. I had the Yard Bird sandwich and it was delicious. Place was not crowded (at lunchtime) so I'm wondering where everyone is at?  I would definitely recommend it and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, great food and awesome atmosphere!!! We ordered the bourbon chocolate cake and it took a little time getting out, the manager came over and said it was on the house!! And boy was that cake good!!! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Honest review from someone who has been here quite a few times over the years...

As a guy, I would be lying if I said I wasn't slightly disappointed when they went from scantily clad to mostly clad.  At least they are still easy on the eyes (how do they do this?).  Anyway..in my opinion the food is overpriced but decent.  Not gourmet, but decent.  The best thing on the menu is the Yardbird chicken sandwich with tater tots.  Very Good!

I do like the atmosphere, patio is nice, as are the fireplaces.  Nice place to take a date.  But the seats at the bar are so worn and rickety, you are constantly wondering when they are going to collapse and make you look like a fool in front of the cute staff!  For the prices they charge, could they at least replace the chairs??

Overall, a nice place to hang out with consistent, albeit not exceptional, food."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times and have been disappointed. If I sit at the bar, I don't get served unless I get loud and yell to the bartender that ignores me that I would like a beer. 

After a bad experience with this place, I gave it another shot because it's by my house. Some friends and I went in for dinner around 8pm. One of my friends is loud and was commenting loudly on how cool the place was. We were seated and waited. And waited. The manager came over and asked us where we came from and why my friend was so loud. I explained we had not been anywhere and he was just like that. She told us we were drunk and wouldn't get served. I stated this was fine, we were looking to have dinner not drinks. She stated we weren't welcome to stay because my friend was obviously drunk and they didn't want \"people like us\" there bothering the other guests.  No one was drunk or even drinking.  Fine with me, we left and I haven't been back. Never will return.  I surely hope this is not how they treat all their customers."}
{"text":"They have great food and awesome prices during happy hour. I have been here for both lunch and dinner and it's always been busy. I really like their smoked salmon appetizer and the wings are great too."}
{"text":"You MUST try the duck wings. Soooooo good, and a really good portion size for an appetizer. There were 5 wings (which actually looked like legs). They were full sized, too. They looked like chicken legs.
I had the lamb burger, which was really good, with the Cajun fries. My friend had the chicken salad with grilled chicken instead of fried chicken. 
Everything was very tasty, and our waitress, Omorese, was super friendly."}
{"text":"Everything was great.  Great atmosphere.  Friendly people.  We had a party of 16 and they were able to accommodate us.  We sat at a booth, but you can also sit at a sofa table or recliners."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last night for the third time and I have to say it continues to be one of my favorites.  There's a new fall food and beverage menu that is out of this world, and my girls and I always enjoy ending our evening sitting around the outdoor firepit sipping cocktails.  I wouldn't have recommended this restaurant to families last year due to the barely there outfits the waitresses USE TO wear.  Luckily management recognized they were alienating an entire demographic and the ladies now dress more appropriately which will allow me to start bringing my kids to enjoy the big screen tv's and indoor fireplace.  All in all this is a great place with great food and great people."}
{"text":"I love the revamp! So glad to see guys as servers and the ladies with more tasteful uniforms! Well done (considering it used to be trashy)! I also appreciate all the awesome beers on tap!! The fire pit outside is pretty awesome too :)"}
{"text":"I started working at Brickhouse when they first opened in Cuyahoga Falls. It was an amazing experiance and I loved every second of it. I made some amazing friends and had a blast everyday at work. The managment was pretty shakey when they first opened. We had like 3 managers within the first 6 months. But our bar manager was AMAZING.The drinks are poured strong, and accurately. The kitchen staff works very hard. And the girls bust their butts.
As far as the food goes; COME ONE PEOPLE... Its a bar! Its not a gourmet 5 star restraunt. The burgers arent that good. The Kobe is just ok. The Mahi Mahi is delicious (in the fish sandwich) The philly cheesesteak is sooo good. Make sure you get peppers and onions. Chicken in waffles is good as well. Drunkin pork chops are moist, perfectly cooked, and the sauce is amazing. All of the apps are good. The wings are kind of average ( i am a wing snob )
Since I havent been working there I see they have added more items to the menu.
Cant wait to go in and check them out.

To the women who was like \"omg there was T & A EVERYWHERE!!!\"
Come on. We were never aloud to have our butts hanging out of our shorts.
And yeah ok some girls might have big boobs and heaven forbid are showing some clevage. I just think its so funny how narrow minded people can be.
'they must all be hookers!\" Yeah right lady. Every girl likes the outfit, wears it proud with confidence, and busts her ASS on a daily basis. I made soooo much money when I worked there. And no, not because I was showing the world all of my ASSets. But because  I am nice, I work hard, and I am a great waitress.
So suck it!

Brick House Girls + Brick House Food  rock"}
{"text":"Very slow service. I had the bison eggs Benedict that I had to send back because it was cold and had no sauce. They did take it off my bill but I will not go back nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before. Never been bad...but, not that great either. 
Today, however, was a whole new level of terrible.

After a few hours of work, I stopped on my way home to grab a late lunch and catch some of the game. The place didn't seem too busy. Plenty of seats on the floor and maybe 6 people at the bar.

As I walked in, 2 hostesses were waiting by the door having a conversation amongst themselves and 1-2 other staff members. 

After a few minutes of standing there...neither addressed me. I shrugged it off and sat myself at one of the 4 sides of the bar in front of one of tv's that had the game I wanted to watch. I had an entire side of the bar to myself. 

A few minutes later, a bartender took my order: a cup of coffee and a breakfast plate with eggs over easy, hash-browns, bacon, and a waffle. Shortly after, when I looked up, I noticed that the channel had been changed to a different game. I waited for her to return to ask if it could be changed back. In the mean time, a cup of coffee was placed in front of me by another person who quickly walked away before I could ask for anything. The tv remained untouched...

I sat and drank the coffee and squinted at another tv across the bar to try to catch some of the game...Finished the coffee and waited a few more minutes before yet another person stopped to ask if I needed anything...I replied \"yes\" and asked about the TV and if I could get another cup of coffee. Her reply was simply, \"sure\". She then quickly turned around and walked away. 

25 minutes later (now well over 45 minutes since I sat down) the person I placed the order with arrives to tell me that my order was mixed up and would be out shortly. She apologized and said that the meal would be no charge. I thanked her and asked for a refill on the coffee...

A few minutes more and another cup of coffee finally shows up. 

Another 15-20 minutes will go by before the \"chef\" personally delivers my order. 

The \"chef\" apologized, said that they were very busy and that there was a mix up and that it meal would be \"on him.\" He placed the plate of food on the bar in front of me and quickly turned away to converse with some of what I assumed were his personal friends that had just sat a few seats down from where I was...they asked him if the game that they wanted to watch could be switched to the same tv I attempted to watch earlier. He said, \"of course!\" And, magically, the channel changed almost immediately to the game that his friends asked about.

Meanwhile, as I stare at my plate, I began to ponder over what exactly in the fuck I was looking at. I recalled that nearly an hour earlier, I had ordered a breakfast plate with eggs over easy, hash-browns, bacon, and a waffle. However, what I was looking at seemed to be brownish/black eggs over burnt to a crisp over french fries,(not hash browns), cold to the touch bacon, and waffles (the waffles looked fine)...no syrup...actually, no one asked if I wanted any condiments at all...nor any ice water...or anything else.

I pushed the plate away and again waited a few minutes for anyone to approach so that I may address the issue(s).

After a few minutes more, I placed a single dollar down on the bar, stepped down, put on my coat and left...completely unnoticed.

I will conclude with my final review:

IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS PLACE IS A GIANT STEAMING PILE OF BULLSHIT.

Thank you to the hostesses for not breaking away from your group discussion to seat me.

Thank you to the bartender(s) for taking my order In whatever timely manner accommodates your personal needs. 
Really, the coffee was fantastic...especially, when it's 30-40 minutes between top-off. 
Also, things like water and condiments would have been nice. But, I totally understand, you probably were just too busy...

And, thank you \"chef\" for personally delivering this visible plate of shit to my seat at the bar....for explaining away all the my time that you wasted by being too busy and too confused...And offering to personally pick up the tab...then immediately turning your back to take time out of your busy, confusing work day to converse to no end with your personal friends a few seats down.

I never walk into a restaurant  expecting anything for free.

What I expect is a shortlist of very basic criteria:

Reasonably polite and swift service.
And, that the food to arrive in a timely manner, well prepared, and as closely made to the way I might have ordered it. 

Today, none of this very basic criteria were even closely met.

Your pitiful explanations and pitiful offer to pick up the bill is NOT what I expected nor does it make up for your absolute incompetence In nearly every way (I mean the waffle didn't look too fucked up).

I wish you the best of luck and that we may never cross paths again.

Sincerely,
One less person for you to push your terrible service and terribly prepared food upon.

Update: still shitty"}
{"text":"Not sure why they are not rated higher. Staff is amazing and always friendly. Have yet to eat anything that wasn't seasoned well and cooked perfectly. 

Meatloaf beats my recipe which is hard to admit. Drink prices are reasonable and food is priced for the market. 

Im a once a week kinda guy there which doesn't happen anywhere else. Check it out for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my top three restaurants in the area to go to. When I tell people that I get surprised looks and it's because this place has evidently changed a lot in the last few years and it has been for the better. The atmosphere is great, servers are attentive, the manager has stopped by our table probably 1 in every 5 visits we have had. The food is amazing, really a lot if bang for your buck and the beer selection is extensive. Personal favorites of ours are: meat and cheese board, Greek meatballs, the chips appetizer, stuffed meatballs, duck wings, their new pulled duck pizza, and pork chops! Yum yum yum. And if you're getting dessert the magic brownie is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"What just happened?

I hate to give out bad reviews, and I rarely do. But this place is not good. 

2 stars for the cool atmosphere. 

Food???? Marinara Sauce that is way to peppery and clunky. Moscow Mule from a mix? and then poured into a stainless steel mug? Never heard of such a thing. (Moscow mules are known for their copper mugs)

I got the parmesan tator tots. I almost laughed my tail off! Frozen tator tots sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

Our Halibat had zero taste, no seasoning, just a slab of fish. 

Think these guys are missing the boat on the food, the atmosphere is nice, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Nice place to watch the games. It provides for a relaxing atmosphere with good food. Kind of a more upscale sports bar. The staff is friendly. They also hire hot chicks with skimpy clothes to wait on you."}
{"text":"I would rather take my money and go to Malloys. $5.50 for a beer is a joke when I can get a pitcher for $7. Atmosphere aside the food is on the high side with burgers starting at 8.99 and going as high as $15. A dinner for 2 with beers will cost you $45-55 and you will be underwhelmed. Save your cash and go some place else. It gets 2 stars cuz like I said the \"Atmosphere\" is nice = sometimes there are really pretty girls there and my sons stare at their...  That aside- not worth the money right now. If they would lower prices by 10-15% then we may get a third star."}
{"text":"The food is good - specifically the pork chops. However, the service is awful - we got our appetizer with our main course. The server also rolled her eyes when we asked again for something that was previously requested. A prior visit, we also had a server who continuously offered potatoes when we asked for no carb items."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother and the atmosphere was very nice. He got the ribs and I got the mahi and both came out with nice presentation and flavor. This is probably the best/most relaxing sports bar in that area of town."}
{"text":"I was I could give zero stars. Watching the bartender spill beer on her self, grab lemons with her hand and just putting them in a cup for the customers, putting ice in our beers ( is that a new thing?), and she never washed her hands. I know they have a hand washing sink back there. Food not cooked to order, medium doesn't mean well done. 
Waiting over 15 minutes just to get the check with our wallets out. Figure I would kill some time with this bad review. Don't waste your time just go to Applebee's across the street. At least the manager walks around there asking you if you need anything."}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out. I don't eat at to many places that gives you the great vibes brick house does. It is a little pricey . Could drop the prices a little"}
{"text":"Has a very comfortable, casual atmosphere - good for date night or dining with kids. Has a very deep craft beer list and some nice craft cocktails. Food was good, I had the Drunken chops with glazed BBQ sauce, wife went with Mahi-mahi. Would have been nice if entrees included side salads and a small bread bowl. That would have been more consistent with price and expectations."}
{"text":"Great beer selection!  Plenty of good local beers to choose from along with other varying choices.  It was big and cozy... we sat at two couches with TVs all over the place.  My boyfriend loved it right away.  Definitely a guy's sports place.  We ordered the calamari for appetizer and were pleased.  He loved the drunken center cut pork chops.  He was pleased to see they were bone-in and cooked perfectly.  I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out medium well.  The service was just okay... At one point, it seemed like the whole wait staff had disappeared when we were just trying to get our check.  We would definitely go back to watch a game and have a beer and maybe grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"We come here every weekend. Great food and service!! Try their thirsty dog leghumper beer."}
{"text":"Never had to pee so bad in my life. Here's my story...

Brick House is airy and rustic inside with a wood burning fire pit. We came at lunch and it was not busy. All of us opted for iced tea and we had a round on the table within seconds. The house salads were fresh and crispy...honey mustard dressing a bit sweet for my tastes. With just 2/3rds of a glass of iced tea our server asked if we wanted refills...we brushed him off and kept talking. I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich with fries. My colleagues both had the daily special chicken pot pie. As we waited another full round of iced tea arrived. We muttered our acceptances. The mahi was especially juicy and flavorful. In fact I hadn't had such a good piece of fish in this area. The pot pies were flaky and large, nearly 8 inches across with chunks of chicken breast, potatoes and carrots...this was savory goodness. Another round of iced teas arrived and I finally yielded, excusing myself to the restroom. The fries are seasoned well and plentiful...I felt like we got our monies worth for such a decent fish sandwich. As we prepared to pay the check, yet another round of iced teas arrives....this time in to-go cups! Good god man, apparently they need to get rid of this batch of iced tea!! Lol

Overall very tasty dishes with good service...will come again and perhaps drink beer next time."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.... server was average but attentive... I loved the atmosphere and the set up of this place.  We will be back more than likely!"}
{"text":"I stopped into the Brick House this evening for a beer and for a dinner and was slightly let down.  I've had multiple trips to this place and their saving grace is that the bartenders and wait staff is usually extremely pleasant.  Tonight they were very inattentive and seemed to ignore me for the most part.  There were some ride and obnoxious people at the bar that took a lot of their attention and a motorcycle gang called \"Switchblade Club\" that occupied the outside area.  The kitchen was slow at turning things around.  Also I was sad to learn that the were it of the daily special which was the chicken pot pie.

I will go back to this place but am in no hurry."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night to watch the Indians play the Cubs in the World Series. I was pleasantly surprised at the fireplace and couch seating that you don't typically see at similar restaurants.The food was tasty and the service was great. The pretzel appetizer and Philly cheesesteak sandwich were both yummy! Great place to grab a quality meal and watch a sporting event!"}
{"text":"Got the steak and eggs with the \"filet mignon\". Eggs and potatoes were delicious but my medium rare skirt steak came out well done and burnt. Sent it back right away and whoever grills is pathetic and was still the toughest piece of steak. Not to mention the plate that it came back out on looked like it had microwave juice on it..... 16 dollar entre should be 11 with that sorry excuse of a steak. Other than that the service is great"}
{"text":"Never disappoints always has something awesome to drink and eat. Great place to stop while shopping or to catch the game."}
{"text":"I don't recommend it, food was less than Ok and service was terrible although the place was barely empty."}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch on a Sunday . Can't go wrong with a $2 mimosa. Food was good and service was excellent. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was delicious and juicy. My boyfriend has the fried chicken Benedict and that was good as well. Overall no complaints and will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Eating on couches or lounging in comfy recliners....uh yea thats totally awesome. Tons of TVs with lots of sports...a roaring fireplaces inside and outside...five stars for ambiance. 

We came here when they first opened and werent impressed...now a few years later, I am a fan. 

They offer brunch on the weekends with two buck mimosas. The variety is great...def a meat based menu which is perfect for my carnivorous boys. I had the duck hash...I just plain heart duck. My over easy eggs were a little overdone. My son got the special the consisted of pork cop, rib and wings....he loves the sauces and the pork chop was cooked well and not over done. 

Service is prompt, friendly and efficient. 

This maybe our new fav brunch spot."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing!  The food is fantastic!  I love that almost everything is great i can pick at random on their menu and be satisfied with the results.  Definitely a place to check out and the seating is quite comfortable as well!  :D"}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars - we decided to give this a try around 4:30 on a Friday.  What restaurant doesn't anticipate early diners on Fridays?  We walked in, were greeted by NO ONE, not even a \"Please seat yourself\" sign.

Obviously our first visit, we didn't know what to do, we literally saw no waitresses walking around anywhere, though it appeared one was having a chat with some other employees/male prospects in the middle, and the bartender was super busy at her bar.   The tables we saw all had empty drinks, so we turned and left.

Way to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat, great food and great service.  I have heard so many of my friends say that haven't come here because of supposed hooters type atmosphere and nothing could be further from the truth. Do your self a favor and stop in and try it you won't be sorry.  The meatballs, blue & white chips snd the kobi beef pizza...YUM!"}
{"text":"After receiving an email for their Father's Day free brunch special, I decided to call to make a reservation.  Once the hostess/whomever asked how many were in my party, I stated '2', and immediately the tone and demeanor changed.  Her tone and verbal demeanor implied I was lying regarding my party.  Immediate response, as I am one of the two options provided, was thinking of those single fathers who might want to take their child out, or for parents who want to get away and be alone together.  Immediately turned off of this establishment.  Beware of others if you are thinking of this option."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Very relaxing and great for any sporting event! I wish would have come here for at least one browns home game this year but if they keep up the fantastic service, food and drink I will be back for next football season. This is also a great place to just relax with friends. They have an area with couches and t.vs. You can reserve ahead of time. This would be great for a birthday party as well. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and it's still my favorite place. The servers are friendly and the atmosphere is perfect for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Great service, drinks, and food.

Stopped by today after not being here in a long time. I love the couches while allow for a relaxed feeling while dining - check them out!

I had a French Martini and it was fantastic. We had the Blistered Shishito Peppers ( thanks Yelp for a free coupon). They were pretty good. Just enough kick to know they were a pepper. 

Next I tried the Beet Salad and added Avocado. It was fantastic and the goat cheese was wonderful and I tried it with the peppers too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Tried the goat burger special. It's apparently made with goat, lamb and beef on what appears to be a flatbread bun. Burger was burned on both sides and the bun was also charred. Fries were good though. Service was really good tonight."}
{"text":"My husband & I visited the Cuyahoga Falls location yesterday for brunch. Usually, we are very happy with each visit to the Brick House but yesterday changed all that. The only redeeming quality was the awesome service we received. The food was way below the quality we usually expect from this restaurant. I had the steak & eggs. The steak was bland. I usually never add anything to my steaks in a restaurant but I had to add salt,  pepper, & A1 to give my steak enough flavor to enjoy. My husband had chicken & waffles. He's had this entree before. Usually, the chicken portions are quite sizable. The chicken that came with the entree yesterday? Tiny, little chicken fingers. He also ordered the cheese potatoes which he has had several times before. Those potatoes are NOT the same. Absolutely no flavor & barely any cheese. As usual, I had the $2 mimosa. Kind of hard to mess that up. My husband had the bloody mary.  He's had it before. He had to request steak AND hot sauce to add to the drink due to it's incredible bland flavor. We mentioned our dissatisfaction to our server. She apologized & explained the restaurant has switched owners who decided to switch vendors. What a terrible idea! You switched vendors no doubt to save money but kept your menu prices the same. Therefore, the great quality meals we happily paid extra for are not even available now. Your quality has decreased and you expect your customers to pay the same? Hope your bonuses are nice at the end of the year because you lost two customers to earn it."}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Ordered a lamb burger medium well, got a burnt kobe burger. The cajun fries were std and the side caesar salad was average. Ate at the bar and staff was friendly but inattentive (never got offered water refill) and obviously took my order wrong cause the bill said kobe burger even though the bartender himself recommended the lamb burger.... Oh bother"}
{"text":"The food we got was mostly mediocre too.
I thought the price was kinda high for the quality we got.
Happy hour is until 6pm and then craft beer prices sore!"}
{"text":"You have great food!  But! It's absolutely wonderful when we have Tiffany as our server!  She's kind, extremely helpful and knowledgeable about what we ask for/need!  We will be asking for her whenever we come back, which will be very often!!"}
{"text":"Best pork chops ever. Asparagus done perfect. Side salad worse salad ever all core.. skip it. Wings amazing crispy and fresh. Pretzel sticks and sauce amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend with Boyfriend and we really enjoyed it. We really liked the low-key atmosphere complete with fireplace, a dozen flat screens, recliners and tables that used super-comfy love seats as their booths. It was rather quiet on Sunday evening, and we enjoyed relaxing at our tables -- it kind of make waiting for food easier. Service was just fine, and I appreciated that my waitress made sure to bring me another water when mine was gone, even though she was carrying another table's food in her hands as well. We got the Sweet n Sour Tails for an appetizer and while they reminded us of a similar dish at Red Lobster that we like, they were really nicely done -- not too hot, but the heat could be adjusted by eating the fried jalapenos for those who like it hot. I chose the special of the day, the Mahi Mahi fishsticks with fries and fruit salad. Boyfriend chose the pork chops and mashed potatoes. Everything was really good -- it's one of the few times I've heard my boyfriend say that everything in his meal was good (and we've been together for 9 years, so that's saying something). And I really enjoyed my fishsticks -- they were high quality and yummy. Even the fruit salad had some extra care put into it with strawberries, watermelon, mint and grilled peaches. I'd definitely like to come back here again, and from the looks of their drinks menu, that'll be one of the things that I'd like to try next. :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and steak is fantastic! Sides are good too. The kids menu items are priced really well and taste like real food! Love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here tonight! Dakota was awesome. He was super chill and easy going which made the environment extra comfortable. The patio area was dark and comfy. The fireplace gave it the perfect touch. The food was delicious. Chicken & Waffles (big portions and didn't disappoint - must try!), Twice Baked Potato and Grilled Chicken Chopped Salad. Doug, the manager, even stopped by to make sure everything was going well and that we had everything we needed. Thanks guys, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"As a guy the ambiance is exactly what I would want. It was amazing walking in and being seated at a couch instead of a booth. They asked what sport I'd like to watch and turned on the Indians game for us which was awesome. 

The food we found good but not great. I ordered the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the waitress kept trying to take it from our table before we were done. The burgers are huge and tasted great to me but my girlfriend ordered hers with items on the side. The burger came how it is normally prepared and had to ask for her sides 4 times before she got them. 

I'd go again but I'd be more prepared and specific on my orders."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience!!! Saturday night on their outdoor patio was great, had lots of TVs and watched the Indians game. Got the pretzels and the deviled eggs for an app and they were amazing!!! I got the black and blue burger with caramelized onions. They cooked it to a perfect medium and my sweet potato tater tot were extra crispy and came with creamy ranch. Also had the smothered porkchops and a turkey club. Both were amazing and described perfectly on the menu. Our server was Adam and he was very helpful with a menu and seemed to be at our table like every five minutes asking if we were OK. We had a great time and will be back for sure. Highly recommended $-$$"}
{"text":"Was visiting form out of town and stopped here for dinner. I liked the different seating options, and would have opted for the couch dinner tables but I was by myself and thought that was a little excessive for just me, but its great to have the options. I had a blackberry collins while waiting for my food and it was delicious! Very good selection of unique drinks and a huge beer list (part of which updates based on the season). I ordered the potato soup which was homemade with huge chunks of potatoes and the \"Steak and Shrooms\" for dinner. My server was very attentive and responsive. I will definitely recommend this place to others in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  I went the night the Buckeyes beat the Ducks.  The wings where great - fried crispy.  I tried the caveman and BBQ sauces.  I like the caveman sauce - flavor and kick.  I also have the meatloaf.  It was moist and comes with a mushroom gravy.  You can sample the draft beers.  TVs everywhere!!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have had great experiences but the last time inbound it humorous that when I asked what IPA's they had on draft the server said Budweiser, you're typical hire a attractive girl that knows nothing of her job."}
{"text":"I love it here the burgers are awesome and the zombie drink is fucking amazing two if those and you can't walk straight also got chicks what more do you need and it's a sweet looking place to always a good time"}
{"text":"Inconsistant service... but always a table or a couch whenever we show up.

We keep forgetting to go when there are large sporting events... but this is really a sports bar with a larger than expected menu.

You have 4 options of seating... the bar... tables / booths... couches... recliners.

The tables at the couches are a bit too tall for me... it feels like the kiddie table... so we stick with a regular table if possible.

Service varies... sometimes the staff could care less... but there are 2 waitresses that are really good with refills and check backs.

Tonight we started with the cheese board... never enough bread... more than enough \"stuff\" for 3 or 4 people.... strong brown mustard that never feels at home with the Brie or the Goat or the Cheddah... but over all a good $10 buy

Our favorite for a while was the deviled eggs... oh the joy of great bacon!

Hubby's fish and chips were OK... not stellar... but good.

My black and blue burger was a perfect medium with a nice amount of grilled onion and just enough blue cheese.

We were too stuffed for dessert and sat back and marveled at the table full of beer bongs... almost as amazing as the group sitting outside by the fire in 33 degree weather... but this is a beer joint after all!"}
{"text":"Love the patio. Service was good. I've liked the place in general. 
The avocado toast was disappointing.  The bread wasn't toasted, there wasn't much avocado. The bread was too thick."}
{"text":"I got the french toast and potatoes wedge, it was a solid choice. They have an interesting brunch menu, which essentially gives you a breakfast item and a lunch item (e.g. chicken and waffles). They also have $2 mimosa (I think you have to buy a brunch item though, but odds are that's why you are there if you want a mimosa). The mimosa was good, especially for only $2. The brunch menu was a little pricey, but overall it was pretty good. I'd go again."}
{"text":"(Ladies, FYI: I know this is more of a \"man's place\" but you still get the same awesome service as the guys [to be honest, I think we get better service...HAH!], and there's definitely no 'weirdness' if you go in with a bunch of girlfriends)



Quite possibly the best laid-back atmosphere. Possibly biased because I'm a Texan (and this is a Texas-based company), but the service here is amazing, the food is pretty darn good, and the environment is awesome.

Jessica, my favorite waitress, is quite possibly the best server I've ever come across. It's like she's a freaking genie. I've set down half-empty cups, went back to reach for it again and find a full cup never realizing she had been there. Super attentive and the sweetest personality, she's the main reason I keep coming back again and again.

The food is good. A solid 'tavern-style' menu....lots of fried goods, finger foods, and even some decent more traditional entrees (which I honestly didn't expect). 

The pretzel sticks are a must as well as the sweet and spicy shrimp (deep fried hot peppers anyone?! LOVE them). Huge fan of the deep fried zucchini as well.

As far as main meals go, the salads suck. But let's be honest. You don't go to a place like this and order a darn salad. The mahi-mahi is shockingly good. Flaky, sweet, cooked perfectly. Goes great with cajun dusted fries. The burgers are all fantastic with the Black and Bleu being my absolute favorite.

I'm really looking forward to trying their ribs and their chicken&waffles on my next couple of trips!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice atmosphere, the filet is horrendous, I thought they brought me a ribeye. The patio is great you can even smoke near the fireplace."}
{"text":"We just moved to Cuyahoga Falls and wanted to give this place a try we have been here twice now and no complaints about absolutely anything. The first time we ordered the butchers board appetizer (AWESOME) and then we both got burgers which were also perfect. The second time we sat outside I got the the chicken pot pie (which I could probably eat every day for the rest of my life) and he got the turkey club which was not only great tasting but awesome presentation. The service was above and beyond both times; greeted by host and seated immediately upon walking in and asked preference  of seating, waiter did a great job of timing everything we got drinks and then the appetizer and then the meals and didn't wait at all OR feel rushed. Great food, great atmosphere, great service :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here so many times, and I can honestly say I've always walked away completely satisfied with what I ordered.  I've tried different appetizers, burgers, pizza, salads, sandwiches, and desserts, but I have to say my absolute favorite thing to order is the chicken pot pie.  I've taken quite a few friends here, and they love it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Akron is not a place known for having many restaurants with scantily-clad women serving as waitresses, such as a Hooters.  Such overt sexism is normally reserved for the strip clubs.  Last year, a growing chain named the Brick House opened up what is most like an upscale Hooters on Howe Ave. in the Falls, just a few hundred feet northwest of Chapel Hill Mall.  In day 4 of the Alcoholocaust (what I'm calling my last week in Akron), a friend and I went to visit this place to watch the Tribe game and get drunk.

This is a man's place.  If you are a woman, there's a good chance you won't enjoy being here - especially like the guys do.  We came into the place to see girls ranked anywhere from 4-8 on a 1-10 scale dressed in short shorts and shirts exposing part of their stomachs.  My friend and I would intentionally order beers from the lower racks just to see them bend over, but they are only dressing that way to tease you.  They aren't supposed to bend over completely, which is a let down for a lot of guys (I'm here for the game and beer, so it wasn't a biggie).  They have a large number of TVs within the place, as well as a lounge area for the guys to just chillax.  And, of course, there's the average-to-hot waitresses to socialize with.

The first thing we noticed (other than the girls) was how much money was shelled into the layout.  The bar had a fireplace, an expensive paint job, upscale lighting, and an all-wooden patio.  No other place would throw in $1 million to make a dining and/or drinking experience this nice.  The next thing we noticed was the beer selection.  The beer selection is impressive for a chain.  They have the shitty domestic beers, but then you work your way up to microbrews such as Thirsty Dog, Hop Devil, and Pilsner Urquell.  They also have an average menu serving food of average quality.  We ordered some wings that were dipped in 4 different sauces and served with celery.  The wings were acceptable, but it was really obvious that they were frozen at one point; they had that formaldehyde-ish taste that Wing Street and The Lube have.  Everything here is quite overpriced, despite the better-than-average selection.  The average price for a beer was $4.50, while the average price for a shot was well over $7.

At the end of the night, the Tribe blew a 3-0 lead thanks to the wonderfully predictable pitching of Joe Smith, and we were hammered.  I was even talking about how much I love Yelping (which I never talk about with non-Yelp friends unless they ask).  While I has happy with the girls and the selection, a $20 tab for a Washington Apple, a Hop Devil, a PBR, and wings might be a few bucks more than at other bars I can be found at in Akron.  If you are into an upscale drinking experience and are fine with restaurants that exploit the female body such as this, then this is the place for you.  If not, you are better off staying home."}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere and good food.  They have some cozy couches, recliners and lots of TVs.  Food is reasonable and tasted great.  I just moved here from CA so the waitresses 'outfits' didn't seem hooter-ish to me but I can see now that there was a lot of short-shorts and cleavage for OH maybe.  Will definitely return and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at Bricks!  The food was delicious, you have to try the sliders and the ribs.  Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Friday visit to celebrate a friend's 50th birthday. Talked about glory days over beer and burgers with a few pals. Calamari and zucchini fried appetizers were crispy and not overly greasy. Enjoyed the jalapeño and cherry peppers accompanying the calamari. Three of four folks got burgers and one person opted for the wild mushroom pizza. We killed two beer bongs of Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper's porter goodness. My burger was tasty but overdone. Medium rare order was cooked well into medium. Tater tots were a great side. Service was pleasant and attentive. Can't give 4 stars when burgers get overdone. Nice place, good servers and overlooked burgers."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner on a Friday night with friends.  Our friends wanted to sit in a booth, but I would have loved to try out the couch options.  Couches?!  How often do you get to sit in comfiness while eating out?!  Awesome!  They also had a nice patio option with fun decor and a fireplace.

When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that craft beers are $3/pint during Happy Hour.  The selection was above average...esp at that price!

I had the Turkey Club with tater tots.  It was ok.  Nothing wrong, nothing special.  I was excited to see that it included their signature deviled eggs as I am a deviled egg fan.  Unfortunately, they were not to my liking.  My husband enjoyed his burger.  So, that may be the way to go.

I would recommend Brick House.  Definitely try out Happy Hour in the luxury of couches."}
{"text":"I didn't have a clue that this was an upscale version of \"hooters\" when I went. I had the worst experience that I left and will never return.

I sat at the bar and their tap spewed out all over me twice!  it took them about 20 minutes to get me a drink of water.  After getting beer spilled on me twice, I left.  They didn't care- they were clueless & rude."}
{"text":"First time there and it was good. Prices are alittle pricey but food was good. We would return when we are back in that area.."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! It has a huge, open-concept dining area with a big fireplace and some tables have couches instead of chairs.

I liked the variety of food and drinks they offered. We had fantastic deviled eggs for an appetizer. My boyfriend got duck wings that were tossed in this DELICIOUS sauce... LAWD. UGH! I got a bacon BBQ burger which was really great! And my sister got the bison burger. She didn't like it too much... she asked for medium rare and it came out well. She is also never impressed with anyone's food but her own LOL. 

One thing they do here that I think is clutch for a good restaurant is they make their own sauces with their personal twist. They had a red pepper aoli and cilantro ranch, both of which were bomb af!

The waitress (Savannah) and other staff were super friendly and attentive!

I really want to try more of their items, so I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This Brick house has gone Family Friendly and the waitresses are dressed like  every other restaurant's waitresses now.  So to the reveiwer who found the sight of the waitresses legs \"gross and disgusting\", it's safe to come back now.    

Anyway, the strength of this restaurant is its wide open setup that makes it an excellent place to catch a game.  The large square bar includes a number of craft beers.  

As for the food, mine has been mostly mediocre.  The burger was overcooked and the fries ordinary.  Fish was pretty good.  I go back occasionally, especially on game nights."}
{"text":"One of the best waitress/waiter staffs in the area. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Great food. I will suggest my favorite, the Bison Burger and cajun tater tots."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The food was incredible, from the apps to the desert. They have an excellent selection of beers, a great atmosphere, and again the food is terrific."}
{"text":"Waited several minutes for the waitress to come take our drink order. There were four of them waitresses sitting at a table, talking and eating.. So it's not like she was busy.  Slow service... 
This place the food is overpriced for what you get.  Nothing special about the quality of the food.. 
Wish I went to Applebee's instead.. 
Won't be returning.. The music is to loud."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat very well prepared food & relax in wonderful furniture.  Inside is very comforting & the outside is great for those people that can't stand freezing cold air conditioning."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit this establishment for a while now and finally did a few Sundays ago to watch the Indians play. I will have to give it repeated visits to write a fair review, but the initial visit was very good. The layout of the place is not what I expected at all. It's difficult to describe, but it's very open and airy. There are tons of TVs everywhere pointed in every direction imaginable but not intrusive. There are tables, a few booths, and a few seating areas that seem to be a chair and a beer rail pointed at a TV. My main stay took place at the bar area and it was just fine. Large square bar with TVs viewable from every seat, and extensive beer list, and friendly tenders! This seems like a place that wants to be known for its burgers but I have this problem... Whenever there's fish-n-chips on a menu I must order it. Theirs has a deep thick coating of batter and sits atop a pile of delicious (almost) shoestring fries, perfect for covering in malt vinegar. I will most definitely come back on another Sunday to watch the Tribe and order a brew and burger."}
{"text":"After not being home for a year after deployment this was my first stop as it WAS one of my favorite restaurants. Took my elderly mother and my best friend here and had TERRIBLE service from a very young female. After we asked for various items numerous times and waited for the check for over 30 minutes, I asked to speak with the manager. The waitress came up to us as the manager was speaking to us and finally dropped off the check while rolling her eyes at us. We then got my card back and finally received the bag we had asked for and she rolled her eyes again at us. At this point I had had enough, this is no way to treat customers especially those that after being gone for a year and returning after deployment should be treated. They lost a very loyal customer tonight."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Brick House, but like many others, I felt slightly let down by my experience there. The menu looks great. The atmosphere is phenomenal, giving you the option to sit on a patio, at a table, on a couch, in the \"man cave,\" etc... The drink menu is great. The food, however, lacks quality. I ordered a medium rare blue cheese burger with the tater tots, based upon the suggestion of my waitress. After a pretty lengthy wait, the burger came out well-done, and served on a sub bun! It was certainly not the circular wonder-patty, I adore so much. I was willing to move past the rectangular shape of my patty and give it a shot taste-wise, but the beef was just dried out and generally awful. 

That's not to say I would never come back to the Brick House. It seems absolutely worth a try with friends for their drink menu and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool with couches for seats at some of their tables.  The food was really good with lots of interesting choices.  They also have an excellent beer selection. My only complaints are the waitress had no personality and the syrup jar was really sticky."}
{"text":"I started with a tomato bisque soup which was pleasantly light and slightly tart. For the main corse I had the bison burger cooked medium. The burger was cooked very well but not seasoned well. I did not have it with the jalapeño cilantro dressing so that might have been why. I finished with the chocolate bourbon cake which was super delicious! I'll definitely be back for another piece."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Brick House restaurant. First, the atmosphere is nice. Second, the waitress was attentive and nice. Third, the food was just ok. I've been on a mission to find a place that serves pizza with a nice, crunchy crust. I thought a pizza made in a brick oven might be just the thing, so I ordered their $10 pepperoni pizza. It was just ok.  I'm a retired teacher, and the pizza reminded me of my school's cafeteria pizza.  The pizza was unevenly heated, and the cheese was a little overwhelming. I'll try the Brick House again, just not for the pizza."}
{"text":"Sitting here and not wanting to wait until I leave to draft this review. This place is cozy, sofa seating is nice. That's where it ends. Really inventive menu with no follow through on the quality of food. My fiancé got the steak and eggs which was a joke for $15. It looked like a senior's portion at some crap breakfast restaurant like Perkins. I got the wedge salad and a bowl of Mac and cheese - can't really screw either up I guess - but nothing memorable.
Yeah, the girls are wearing nothing - but I couldn't care less...its more the creepy old married men without their rings on that upsets me. Don't you have somewhere else to be, old balls?
I'd pass if you are thinking about a visit to brick whatever."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Very busy but we sat at the bar and had excellent service. The deviled eggs were delicious! We had a bison burger with sweet tots and a lamb burger with regular tots. Both burgers were good... the bison burger was more traditional. Tots were good but sweet potato ones could have cooked a bit longer. All in all a win and I will come back again for a weekend brunch try."}
{"text":"First time there tonight. My boyfriend and I were not greeted by anyone and stood at the door for a little bit. The atmosphere is cool and updated. We chose to sit on the couches. We had a male server which seemed to care less and wasn't too friendly. I chose the ribeye which is a special on Tuesdays. It was suppose to be 12 oz but more like 6 oz. It was ALL fat. I told my server and the manager came to the table. All she had to say it the ribeye is a fatty cut of meat. I didn't want to spend $18 on a steak made of fat. Save your money folks. This place isn't anything special and food is MEDIOCRE. I will not return. Manager wasn't very understanding. I didn't even want a discount. I just wanted her to be aware. I work in the food industry and I'm a server. This place needs improvement. Only thing it has going for it is the cool design. Cook at home folks."}
{"text":"Came back here after a Yelp! event to have dinner with family. We were not disappointed! Not only that, we ordered WAY too much food and had to take home lots of leftovers. Even though my son was one of the diners. He eats!  See his review here too (Mark B). We had four appetizers to share. We should have stopped there, it would have been enough. However, we each ordered dinner too. All but one were delicious. I thought the fish 'n chips were bland. I love to \"drown\" the fish in malt vinegar, as I did here. Even then, it didn't have enough flavor. Other than that, definitely a place for some non-standard casual fare. The wait staff was over-the-top friendly as well. Very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the best happy hour in the area has changed. There beer specials are fine if u like domestic beer but if u want a good craft beer go somewhere else. Too bad I like the bartenders and the TVs but u can fine those at most bars."}
{"text":"Definitely underwhelmed... Stopped in early on a Friday night, because we were starving. Got seated right away but the hostess was not very friendly. The place was empty, but there were probably close to twenty servers, either standing around or coming in for their shift. Our waiter came over, didn't introduce himself and asked us what we wanted. Since we were pretty hungry we ordered the Mozzarella Bricks and a brick oven pepperoni pizza. When our waiter brought our plates for the appetizer, they still had food on them from their last meal. So we asked for new plates. Instead he took them back, washed them, passed the stack of \"clean\" plates I watched him grab ours from, and delivered our original plates, still wet. I let that go, since at least they were \"clean\" now. After the appetizer, my drink was gone. I made eye contact with my waiter three times while he stood about ten feet away talking with a group of other waiters. No drink refill. The pizza comes. Again, underwhelmed. We were CRAVING a brick oven pizza, which is why we chose this place. The crust was the only good thing. The cheese was like a brick (pun intended)! The whole pizza tasted almost like plastic and it was really small for the price. Just good enough for two people. It should be noted that halfway through the pizza, when the waiter decided to come ask if it was okay, I finally got to ask for my refill. He brought the check before we were even done with the pizza. Didn't ask if we wanted anything else, a drink, nothing. My boyfriend was not impressed and won't be back, but I think I would like to try again for maybe a burger. The wait staff (that I came in contact with) didn't seem very friendly, but maybe it was just the day? I can't speak for the whole staff, but next time I will attempt a weekend and see if the staff is any better."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar atmosphere. Lots of tv's playing local sports games. Armchairs are available to sit in over in one corner and some tables have couch type of booths available. There is also a nice patio to sit on. The food is pretty good, again mostly what you would expect from this type of establishment, mostly sandwiches and fried food. The fried zucchini with sriracha ranch is a favorite of ours. My husband loves their chicken and waffles. I'm partial to the fish and chips, but the burgers are pretty good too. The Philly cheese steak is not good. I have to say that we have had multiple appetizers and everything has been good. Calamari, zucchini, pretzels, shrimp. But if I stray away from the fish and chips or a burger I'm usually disappointed as far as the entrees go. My husband never gets anything other than the chicken  and waffles, so I can't speak on his behalf. But everything else I have had has just been ok. I'm often underwhelmed when I look at what the entrees have to offer, I would love to see them expand their menu a bit."}
{"text":"Not your average menu, which keeps us coming back. Comfy couches and seats at the bar with lots of t.v.s to watch every game. Not a bad seat in he place. Consistently good food. Highly recommend the Kobe pizza, the garlic tots, meatballs, and the black rum bbq wings. Very good desserts. Bartenders here make great mixed drinks, too."}
{"text":"I gotta say, this place is my new favorite spot. I've never been to brick house pre-revamp, but I've heard some horror stories (from women) and I gotta say the new uniforms are better suited to the atmosphere. Covered up women allow the restaurant to do what it's supposed to do: dazzle the fuck out of you. Decor is simple, tasteful and upscale, and the food is amazing. Drink selection is one of the best I've seen. Beer for years, cocktails are mixed right. This isn't applebees though, so your wallet is gonna take a hit. Two cocktails and chops ran me $40. Absolutely. Fucking. Worth it. Stop reading, go there. Now."}
{"text":"I have visited the Brick House Tavern + Tap a total of 3 times - the first time was shortly after it opened.. the second, a year later, and the third was a week ago. 

The first time was... awkward, even for my male companion, who should have been the one enjoying it. That visit was shortly after they opened, and employed  scantily-clad women to chat up the male customers as they perused the menu and stole quick (but obvious) glances to check out the warm, um... atmosphere.  

Not to be deterred by serving a table for two which included 1 female, our  fetching young server made herself more than comfortable, sitting down for a chat after taking our orders. Really? We had gone to lunch to try the food and have a conversation while not having to prepare and serve our own food. Apparently we sent a signal that we wanted to discuss our upcoming holiday weekend (only one of the various pleasantries attempted) with a skinny, surgically enhanced stranger clad in bare-midriff. It was so awkward, both of us declared it ridiculous - so much so, that it was at least a year before we returned. In fact, neither of us remembered the food. I guess that should have been a tip-off for any future visits. 

Visit #2 - I don't recall what my friend ordered, but I had a piece of fish. A really really large piece of fish. Large as in - I now think I know where the word \"codpiece\" came from. I was certain that upon lifting this piece of fish, I would find the lost city of Atlantis beneath it. As far as the flavor - meh - pretty much bland - but I think i was turned off by the size. I'm not fond of taking \"fish\" home in a takeout container. I might as well toss it into the trash. Upon further inspection, I found it to be eclipsing a serving of haricot verts and some sort of potato hash - neither one being a side dish I would go back for. The best thing about this visit was the noticeable change in servers. Gone were the briefly-attired females.. replaced by respectfully dressed male servers throughout the dining room. So there was that. 

Last week - This was a \"joke gift\" visit. A friend had purchased a gift card, not realizing that the place was no longer a thinly veiled Hooters restaurant. 
I hoped for the best when I opted to stick with a wedge salad, and requested dressing on the side (the choice was bleu cheese), and SANS bacon. My friend ordered the ribs, and we asked for the Sweet and Spicy Tails appetizer, described as follows: crispy shrimp, cherry peppers, fresh cilantro, lime & sweet chili sauce. 

The appetizer arrived, and we were thrilled when we first saw the portion size. Thrilled until we realized that there were only 5 very ordinary medium-sized shrimp  for which we practically needed a search party, among a huge portion of crispy fried onions. We are not onion lovers, so had we realized the appetizer was mainly  the onions with a couple of shrimp, we would have likely chosen differently. 

Our food arrived, and my friend pronounced the ribs \"OK\". The real freak show here was my salad, which was not just a wedge, but possibly an entire head of iceberg lettuce, chopped into 3 portions and placed core-down on the plate, with (can you guess?) bacon decorating it. I started to point them out to the waitress and she looked closely, declaring them to be pecans. Yikes. Absolutely bacon. The dressing was from a bottle. No bread was served, other than two pieces of toasted white bread (fresh from the wonder bread wrapper, no doubt) that came with my friend's rib entree. 

The one star? For the interior - the large fire in the oversize see-through fireplace as you enter is warm and inviting. The place was nearly empty on a Thursday evening, while the other area restaurants appeared to be packed. Brick House really needs to upgrade their food to bring me back. So much great indie local fare, why bother with a chain restaurant serving very average fare?"}
{"text":"Many TV's, so it was a great place to watch the football games. I enjoyed the soft pretzel appetizer, but I would avoid the wings - not good. The entrees were good enough and what I would have expected from this style restaurant. 

There is also a great beer selection, including many local options on draft."}
{"text":"Service was great and the servers were the only 5 star attraction of the restaurant. My wife ordered a filet salad and the steak was so far from a filet it wasn't even funny. Come on really you may be able to fool some but after reading this hopefully no one else gets snookered by this. Say on the menu exactly what you're serving. We probably will not go back after the first trip. Looks like a cool place to hang out and get a beer but the food is questionable!"}
{"text":"Great! Very tasty!!! Love the chicken and waffles! Highly suggest it!!! Make sure to get those! Also, make sure to get the zucchini curls!! Soooo good!!!! :) love the atmosphere as well. Sometimes it's a little loud so keep that in mind!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience. The food is also always very very very good! The duck wings are out of this word and so are the drunken chops. One of my go to restaurants. Love it!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever andI use to be a server so I am more sympathetic to their jobs but this place had awful service! The waitress was not very professional and rude to us. Our food came out very late and we never got refills. We were very disappointed and will NEVER eat here again! Its a shame because we loved the food. Te waitress is a blonde in the pictures here. We even complained to the manager but he didnt do much about the horrible service. Do not eat here if u plan on going to the Orchestra or being on time some where else afterwards!"}
{"text":"Before I write this review you gotta know I'm a little biased. I'm a vegetarian. However, I feel that I need to let other vegetarians out there know about places that are not willingly or able to satisfy our needs. As with the other reviews Brick House is definitely a guys type of place: lots of meat, huge selection of beers, big screen tvs with games, and waitresses dressed in booty hugging shorts. 

I've been here a handful of types mostly with groups after sporting events. If I were a meat eating, beer drinking, sports guy I would give this place 5 stars. However, I am a gluten free vegetarian girl that can eat a salad here. Fun. On the plus side the mixed drinks are pretty generous and delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was pretty good, I was not a huge fan of the meatloaf I ordered. Overall place was excellent and the drinks were good."}
{"text":"They just released a new menu over a week ago and the servers still haven't learned it.  Mind, it's not that different, so it's not like they had a textbook to memorize.

The biggest disappointment is that the new menu, while laminated and pretty, does not suit the market area or the decor.  I get that most people like the couches, but for a $23 cheese board, $12 cocktails, and a $34 steak I expect to be sitting somewhere better than on a basement-style couch next to a couple with six kids.

If you were expecting to save a little money during happy hour, you'll be disappointed.  There is NO happy hour menu or flyer.  You're basically relying on your server to tell you \"well I think these three apps are marked down but I don't think you'd be interested in those.\" No drink specials.  Usually reputable places offer happy hour because it captures the afterwork crowd and - guess what? - people who come for happy hour end up staying longer and spending more money.

None of the changes make any business sense for an economically depressed area; even the mall down the street couldn't survive.

Servers are kind but deserve better training and not to be hung out to dry by poor management decisions.  No wonder there is never a wait here."}
{"text":"Best porkchops ever, a great price, and great atmosphere. Friendly, attentive staff."}
{"text":"everyone was so friendly and the drinks were good food was amazing and it's so comfy they actually have couches you can sit in the BBQ duck pizza was amazing"}
{"text":"Sat for 20 minutes in an icy booth.   3 waitresses came near us, but didn't ever acknowledge us.   We asked the hostess, but she shrugged her shoulders.   We left."}
{"text":"1st time here. Came w my Unc bc Louies was closed! Why Louie Why??? 2 burgers 2 salads 2 iced teas 36.70 and still hungry!!! Burger is good, brioge bun is good, literally got 14 shoe string fries w my burger. It was ridiculous this huge plate should not have so much empty space on it. Will not be back"}
{"text":"The food was deliocious especially the burgers and pot pie. If you get offended easily or uncomfortable by the slightest thing, don't read the quotes on the wall"}
{"text":"Service and staff are always great.  I've had just about all their food and its all very good except the pizzas.  The pizza is just like one of the crummy grocery store-brand that you take home and bake yourself.  They should really just take it off the menu.  Can't give 5 stars because of the pizza and everything is $1-$2 too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"I am updating my review to 5-stars because I think for this type of restaurant, Brick House Tavern + Tap is as good as it gets!

I live fairly close to Brick House and typically dine here at least a few times a month. I have been here on dates, with large groups, with clients and with friends. I always enjoy what I order and out of all of my visits I have never, ever had a bad meal or inadequate service. In fact it has always been quite the opposite. The servers have always been attentive and the general manager nearly always stops by to make sure everything is satisfactory. On my most recent visit I had a longer than normal conversation with him and he seems like he is a genuinely nice guy who takes pride in his restaurant and truly cares about the experience his patrons receive.

I have only been going to Brick House for a couple of years and am always surprised when I mention it to people and they think it is another \"breastaurant,\" akin to Hooters or Tilted Kilt. At least for the couple years I have been going, this is no longer the case. The servers all wear shirts that are not overly low-cut and that go all the way down to their pants without a bare midriff. I do think the servers are collectively younger than than a lot of restaurants but they have always been friendly, show enthusiasm for the menu and do a great job!

The décor of Brick House Tavern + Tap is very unique. They have many normal booths and tables but also have a few tables with couches as the seats on either side. They have a few large recliners with table inserts that you can sit at that are positioned in front of large TVs. There are easily 50 TVs around the whole dining area that are positioned in a way where you can see many different ones from wherever you sit. However it also seems that they are not too intrusive and allow one to easily ignore them and focus on who they are dining with. In the winter I often try to get a table near their large open fireplace in the center of the dining room! They also have a large patio with multiple TVs and fireplaces on it.

I think their food is pretty unique as well. They have some really good appetizers that are plenty large enough to share. Their dinner portions provide plenty of food to where I often find myself bringing part of it home with me. Everything seems to be priced very reasonably too.

If you have yet to try Brick House Tavern + Tap I recommend that you add it to your list. If you visited back when it was filled with scantily clad servers maybe visit again now to see the differences. Overall I think it is a fun restaurant with many menu options that should satisfy anyone wanting to eat!"}
{"text":"Previously, I have gotten the grilled cheese w/ tomato soup and the chicken pot pie (Wednesday special) the soup that came with the grilled cheese tasted like someone poured marinara in a bowl. Not good. The grilled cheese was ok. The pot pie was amazing. I would order that again for sure. Tonight we both got the lamb burgers. They say they have goat cheese on them, but neither of us had any cheese. We informed the waiter who said they actually come with a goat cheese sauce. The menu clearly states goat cheese, not sauce. The deviled eggs were good the first couple times we came, but tonight the filling was really watery and the whites were very rubbery. I'm really disappointed that the quality keeps going down."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! We found it by chance and are we glad we did. When you are there ask if Lindsey is working. She was our server and was outstanding. Started with the Potato chips with blue cheese and they were fabulous!  We had the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich, Chicken Fried Benedict, Prosciutto wrapped Meatloaf.  There was NOTHING we could say that would deter anyone from giving this place a try. Too bad this is the only one within a reasonable distance.... Can't wait to go back...."}
{"text":"Myself, sister and her boyfriend came here for a quick early dinner. I have it broken down from atmosphere, service and food quality.

The atmosphere was really chill and relax. Not only do you have a choice of table, booth but also a couch booth(which we opted for). They have fireplaces going and you're welcomed by the amazing smell of grilled foods. Also they have areas with couches and tv (perfect for you game night folks). 

The service was spectacular and our waitress Savannah was extremely attentive! She was friendly, quick and intuitive to our next need (filling up waters, condiments and etc).

Finally the food was above bar food but not gourmet quality, atleast for my plate. I ordered a bison burger medium rare and I was really disappointed by how over cooked it was. It was pretty much well done, which over all kills the natural flavor. (Pictures attached).
The deviled eggs were amazing but too salty, they sprinkle with sea salt and I would recommend going it and maybe drizzling a little syrup or honey to counter act the saltiness of the bacon in the deviled eggs.
One of us got the duck wings and he was floored by the quality of the sauce and the Sriracha ranch was INCREDIBLE! We had to ask for more of it to dip in and for myself to cover the over cooked texture of the bison. My sister loved her BBQ bacon burger and said it was amazing.

I'm giving it a 4 because I believe maybe my bison was just perhaps an off moment in the kitchen. It's obvious the skill in the cooking from the other plates at our table and the atmosphere makes it all worth the visit."}
{"text":"Service is sub par actually service sucked food was ok over priced for portion size and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I realize it is a sports bar but I could not hear people at my table eating. If servers got paid for talking in groups with each other they would be rich. Over all I could give a overall rating of 1/4 star at best would I return never ever would I suggest it to anybody maybe my ex wife. Your response was thoughtless try to do better next time are you kidding me next time why would I ever come back in case you hadn't noticed the choices are abundant all around you and would never return."}
{"text":"So my family and I went to Brickhouse yesterday to celebrate my sisters birthday I've been there before and the food's been good this time on the other hand it was awful and so was the service it seem like we were not the only ones having a problem the manager was replacing people's food and apologizing everywhereour server was less than delightful she was nasty and rude she told me next time I ordered my food that I need to don't order it the right way okay so you tell me what restaurant you go to that puts a cold salad on a hot plate with hot food and doesn't bring your salad out before your meal I find out from the manager that your salad is supposed to be run out before the meal just as I thought and just up and just as I've hadit served before when I've been there I honestly tell you I will not go back there again my sister felt like her food was nasty and gross as well as mine everybody's food at the table either came out wrong or Burnt and we ordered at 2:30 in the afternoon and didn't receive our food until about an hour better later they were not that busy I promise that I am not going back there again and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone you're better served by going across the McDonalds the food and service would be better would."}
{"text":"Tried the \"duck wings!\". 
They were part of their Saturday Special which included a huge pork chop a dish for which they are apparently \"known\", and 1/3 of a rack of ribs.....PLENTY of food, even if you just got done appearing on \"Naked and Afraid.\"
OK, I promise no more quotation marks.
Wings are drum portion only and are fully the size of a chicken leg.
Trying them was a major reason for ordering the dish, so I could try them without committing my entire meal to their palatability.
Expertly prepared and sauced in a spicy/sweet sauce that complimented them nicely. A definite recommendation for anyone to try.
The chop was reasonably tender the marinade was decent enough, haven't gotten chops out much, but these were probably the best I've had.
The ribs were OK, but nothing for any self-respecting rib-house to fear.
The dish was served with their house sauced white beans which were a decent enough accompaniment, but not especially noteworthy.
My wife got their filet Benedict which she praised effusively.
Service was quite good, the manager usually checks in during the meal and is quite personable.
A notch above the standard sports bar, with great ambiance and plush seating."}
{"text":"One of my favorite  places to eat! Brunch is wonderful. BISON pizza is wonderful. Beer selection  is amazing.  Service  great."}
{"text":"Drinks are good! Duck wings and the Greek keftedes a must try - delicious!

The wild mushroom pizza is something else - Tasted homemadeish - yet frozen, not a favorite! Wouldn't order the pizza if I returned. The snacks are the way to go -
But I'm tempted to return to try other dinner menu times."}
{"text":"Liked it. Food good. Greek burger and all appetizers are great. It is a sports bar and there are plenty of TVs with all of the current sports events on. Very cozy with the fires going"}
{"text":"The patio is awesome, love the outside dining area and fire pit. Nice bar, comfy seating inside. However I have just never been wowed by anything on the menu. Their kitchen is open late which is really nice since I work late usually and they give me the option to still enjoy a dinner out. I have tried a decent amount of entrees and appetizers, nothing has ever been great. The soup was cold and smaller than a cup in my opinion. The just menu had just been changed (at least the grilled cheese description) I received a combination of what was on the old menu and new menu on my sandwich. I didn't complain because it was grilled cheese can't really mess that up too bad. BUT the soup was cold. I always ask for my pizza to be well done, it has been made well done ONCE of the 5 times I've asked. I understand that the staffing is based on eye candy I don't mind that, just seems to be a lot of slackers on the job with a few hard workers keeping the machine running. Bar tenders are usually great! Katy and Nancy are always a delight . I'll be back but won't be expecting much!!"}
{"text":"By far one of my girlfriend and my's favorite places! They have couches to relax at.. A fire place inside and outside.. And the food is spectacular"}
{"text":"Our server Misty was super friendly, gave us great service.  We chose to come here for my birthday, it did not disappoint!  Excellent food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Great place! I've eaten here at least a half dozen times and the food has always been on point. Servers are great the majority of the time and I absolutely love the couches...because who doesn't want to lounge while they eat?

So first I will start off with the brunch service....$2 mimosas anyone? Granted they aren't extremely strong but they are only $2 and still hit the spot! The bloody mary is exceptional as well!

As far as happy hour specials, I think it's a fair assumption to say that Brickhouse has the best happy hour specials in the Cuyahoga Falls area. Drinks are cheap and selected apps are half off. Totally worth it!

I had my 24th birthday here in 2016 and Brickhouse was fabulous. They had the table ready for my party of 12 as soon as we arrived on a Saturday night. 

Overall...I can't praise this place enough and I look forward to my next charcuterie board and thai peanut chicken salad!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in around 630 for dinner on a Thursday. The place wasn't super busy, but there were still plenty of people eating. When we walked in we were not greeted by the gaggle of hostesses standing by the door, in fact the didn't say a single word to us, but looked very annoyed that we happened to walk in the door right then. One of them quickly grabbed two menus, rolled her eyes at us and started walking away, before I realized we were supposed to be following her, I asked for a table on the patio. Begrudgingly she took us outside and sat us without another word.

I was going to let this all slide as ill-tempered hostesses. Fine. Our server was friendly and happy to help us with a drink order. We ordered the calamari, fried zucchini and the greek meatballs to share based on recommendations here on yelp. The food came out quickly and we dug in. The calamari was cooked well, not rubbery. The fried zucchini was bland and tasted like old flyer oil, maybe an off night right? The meatballs were just plain terrible. Flavorless, soggy, lumps of meatloaf with mashed cucumbers under them. We finished maybe half of each platter.

I don't normally write reviews here, and I don't like to complain, but the whole experience was just plain bad. The worst part of it, by the time my girlfriend and I got home we both felt ill. Maybe too much deep fried food? Maybe bad meatballs? I don't know. Either way I spent the rest of my night in the bathroom. Fair warning to any future guests."}
{"text":"Timing and direction issues - but always a table on Friday and Saturday nights!

Usually I crave restaurants that are consistent. But Brick House is consistently terrible at timing the arrival of appetizers and entrees. This happens all the time! You get your appetizers, then the food shows up before you can take a bite. I hate that. I wanted to give two stars, but some of the food is actually tasty, so they get three.

We don't even order our food and appetizers at the same time because of this issue. I guess you have to wait until the appetizers arrive to order entrees if you want to enjoy them.

There's some tasty treats here that I recommend - zucchini curls, the breading is really tasty and I like the parmesan cheese on top. However, they ran out of siracha ranch and instead of making more, brought out regular ranch. Huh? Go make more. Which is what they did, when I asked them to please bring the correct dipping sauce.

My husband ordered the meatloaf, which sounded interesting. It was very tasty. I would order that on a future visit. 

I like the French Onion soup - my mom doesn't like that they use smoked provolone, but I thought it was still good and would order again soon.

The calamari is a super treat - with large whole pieces, not the little crappy rings you find elsewhere.

I ordered the roast chicken - which really was grilled, but a whole half! That's a lot of chicken. I really would have preferred a veggie with this instead of just mashed potatoes. And the potatoes were listed as including cheddar but I had none of that. My husband's potatoes too - maybe they ran out!

My parents order the same items every time (pretzel stick appetizer), mahi mahi, and either fish n chips or shrimp (sometimes fries, sometimes tots - I love that they have tots, I am such a fan!).

I do not recommend the mac and cheese. It's terrible. They served it to me cold - not hot at all. Then I requested they add a few little bits of jalapeno - I got a boat load of teensy tiny jalapenos - they covered at least a 1/2 inch at the bottom of the bowl. And the bacon was gross - it was too fatty and in huge chunks. This made the entire thing pretty much inedible. Then, they served it to me cold. Yes, not hot, not warm, cool. How did they make it right? They reheated it! Yuck. Now it was dryer than the desert. How did they make it right? They took it off the bill. It still doesn't erase the memories of that disgusting dish.

Oh - I know I'll be back because my parents are regular diners there - so it's their go-to place. Plus, compared to nearby restaurants like Olive Garden or Applebees (bleh Chains), this has less crowd and more space. I like the fire. I love the patio. I like the bar. I like the stylish seating areas even though my folks require a table."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Brick House. It was decorated in a cute way and has very comfortable seating. 
The menu looked really good, so I chose a grilled chicken sandwich.

The chicken was not a fresh grilled breast. It tasted like a frozen, \"pre-grilled\", rubbery chicken breast. I was quite surprised at this, but the whole sandwich was just chewy and spongey. My salad was a little boring.

The service was good and our waitress was pleasant. 
I would probably go back and try something else, but for my first visit, the sandwich did not impress me."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great environment, featuring multiple fireplaces. Good service. I had the duck wings and filet mignon salad. The food arrived in under 20 minutes, and was very tasty. Duck wings were awesome. I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed my time at brick house food and cocktails never disappoint! Its perfect for after work in the summer time. The staff is always polite and the decore is beautiful, a must place to be!"}
{"text":"1st and foremost I will tell you the food here is AWESOME!!!! It gets 5 stars for flavor and looks.

The atmosphere also gets a 5 star rating.  Where else can you sit on a couch, eat food that is brought to you and watch TV all at the same time?

But here's where it ends for me.  I WILL NOT PATRON A PLACE THAT REQUIRES/LETS THE WAITRESSES WEAR SHORT SHORTS AND TEENY TANKS THAT HIDE NOTHING.  Especially in the dead of winter.  It's gross and disgusting to see things I'm not in the mood to see when I just want to eat.  2nd, being a hetero woman, I'm not really into looking at coochy or boobies.  I'm also NOT into women selling their bodies just for a few more dollars in tips.  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PLACE!!!  If I could give a negative rating, this is the area I would do it in.

Oh, and YES, I did complain and tell this all to management and the main company."}
{"text":"Sub-par food and terrible service. I stopped in with a group of friends for Sunday lunch. When we sat down, we were immediately greeted by the server who promptly returned with our drink order. After that, it was all downhill. 

We placed our order and finally, 25 minutes later (yes, 25), our appetizer came out. We had no plates, silverware, or napkins. We asked the girl who dropped off our appetizer if she could get them for us, she acknowledged, and then never returned. As we just sat there, all of the servers were huddled in the back of the restaurant, chatting away without a care in the world. We were finally able to flag down one of the other servers as she was passing by, and again asked for the basics. She returned with wet wipes, and nothing else. We asked her for plates and silverware, as well-- she brought back 3 plates and no silverware... not even enough plates for half our group. Finally, we were able to get our server and ask her for all of the necessities. 

We waited another 25 minutes, before asking for a status on our food. They brought it out a few minutes later. Everyone got their food except one of us. Again, we had to flag down our server to bring it to her attention (how she didn't realize initially is beyond me). It was getting a bit ridiculous. 

Among other issues with the orders, a friend of mine had items missing from her burger. A manager came out and informed her that she was very mistaken and had read the menu wrong, but would accommodate her. She mentioned that she remembered seeing it on the menu. He again told her she was wrong and stepped away. He came back around a few minutes later, admitted he was wrong, and blamed it on the fact that the menus had changed 2 weeks ago and they were still adjusting to the changes. That's understandable, but definitely the wrong way to handle the situation. The rest of the food was sub-par. We had nothing that knocked our socks off. 

We were disappointed, because we had such high hopes when we walked in and saw the menu. We won't be back again. There are many other choices where I can get a better meal and better service for a similar price."}
{"text":"I'm guessing that the 3 star yelp rating is due to the fact that they used to be a hooters style T&A place with good food to back it up. Apparently, they could tell it was hurting more than it was helping & they've since dropped that angle in favor of a more homey family friendly bar/eatery. The christmas ale I had was great, our server Lauren was cheery, upbeat, knowledgeable about the menu, and super patient with us as we figured out what we wanted. We got a lot of appetizers & there were so much room for at least one of them to be not-so-good or messed up in some way, but everything we ate was really top notch bar food. The chicken bites were tender & moist & the sauces were great with them. My burger was enormous and was perfectly cooked. The Fish & chips were crispy & savory & the fries were fantastic, not to mention you can get regular fries, cajun fries, or garlic parmesan tater tots. The prices were all also totally reasonable for the portion size & quality. I was really impressed with this place. As far as sports bars go, it's as good as they come, IMO."}
{"text":"Finally had chance to redeem my gift certificate as this wonderful establishment sponsored Operation Homefront for a local veteran. We had a previous meeting for our upcoming wedding and had 15 min before happy hour ended.  Our waitress was so helpful and suggested the buttermilk chicken bites with 3 dipping sauces and fries.  Dave ordered $3 Blue Moon and I ordered $6 of house Cab. Really good.  For entree  Dave ordered Prociouto wrapped meatloaf and cheddar mashed potatoes.  I ordered fish and chips and tots.   3 huge beer battered pieces of fish  tartar sauce   breading really crisp.  Way too much food ao dinner tomorrow.   Nice menu or pizzas and burgers"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is getting bad reviews. The food is awesome! We started with the Greek meatballs. They were super tender and full of flavor. Being from the south, I couldn't get my eyes away from the pork loin sandwich. I was so happy with my choice. I especially liked the spicy pickles that accompanied the dish. My companion ordered the chicken fried steak and loved every bite."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place I decided to give it a chance. 

I met a friend here for lunch and we were promptly seated. Our waitress was really nice and very attentive... drinks always refilled without having to ask and our order was taken quickly. She even gave us drinks in to-go cups after we paid our bill. Nice touch.

As for the food... it's so-so. We had some wings for appetizers, kind of small, not that juicy, nor were they spicy. But they came out fast... my guess is that they're warming them up rather than deep frying them.

I ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi. The description said it was cooked in a garlicky butter sauce but I couldn't taste it. It was rather bland. I think I picked a meal that was too healthy... it just lacked flavor.

The manager stopped by once to make sure everything was ok. The keyword is 'once'! That's a good thing in my book!! There are too many restaurants where the manager stops by 4 or 5 times interrupting your meal / conversation... once is all you need. Plus this guy looked a little scary but he was really nice.

I forgot to ask how my friends lunch tasted, but it looked pretty delicious. I wish I ordered what he had (some kind of burger).

Overall it's a nice place, great atmosphere... it's probably a fun place to go watch a Browns or Cavs game, have some drinks (good beer selection). I would recommend it if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch and Brickhouse is always good. I never thought I would say the best customer service I had was for a screw up but my girlfriends burger got messed up and the manager went above and beyond fixing it. Not only did they make her a new burger but they comped it. It was a greatly appreciated gesture."}
{"text":"My first time here was during a Sunday afternoon. I love the seating arrangement and the atmosphere of the bar. The service was attentive but slow. While the food is great, I ordered the Sunday special pot roast. The rice was hot, the meat was cold. I expected a little more for the cost."}
