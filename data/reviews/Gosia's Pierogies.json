{"text":"We loved the pierogi's at the PGH festival!! And the fact that they communicate via ASL was the greatest treat for our lil 7-yr old that just got her cochlear implants! Truly made our visit!"}
{"text":"While waiting to get our lunch, we watched the owner/operator argue with a customer (who sadly was not arguing back, it would have been a great show). She then continued to toss verbal jabs at this couple when they passed later on while we ate.

I'm not sure what the conflict was, but the manner in which the owner acted will prevent us from stopping here. Should we have a comment or negative issue to address with her... would we be next on the shout-fest?
The pierogies were fair. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. With a Ukrainian grandmother and Polish slew of folks in my family, perhaps I'm spoiled... but we've had better fare from the local church.

Maybe it is because all of her pierogies are frozen; who knows who/when/how they were made.

Won't be going back, but will sit in the nearby seating next time to see who the next \"victim\" is."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to taste Gosia's Pierogis at the Pierogi Festival at Stage AE this past weekend.  

What a price difference from some of the other vendors too.  Gosia's booth was by far the best price and they even offered a variety - frozen for purchase.  The potato and cheese pierogi tastes exactly how you would imagine.. delicious.   

They were mouth-watering and I will no doubt be visiting in the future."}
{"text":"First, the pierogies are excellent.  I prefer them to Pierogies Plus for sure.  The feta cheese ones are amazing.

Second, I've only had great experiences with the staff both here and at the Farmer's Market in Market Square booth.  The owner is a friendly guy.  When I saw that he was signing with his worker, I decided to pratice my ASL.  I must have done an okay job because the owner insisted upon giving me an extra dozen pierogies for free.  In case you don't sign, the owner seemed to read lips just fine and his worker was hearing.

P.S. I'm not sure what Ryan D is talking about (not saying it didn't happen), but like I said, the owner is a man and he speaks with his hands."}
{"text":"My Granddaughter and I attended the Pierogi Festival at Kennywood, this past weekend. She and I both loved Gosia's Pierogis.  

Gosia's booth was by far the best price and best tasting.  The potato and cheese pierogi tasted exactly as a homemade Pierogi should taste .. delicious.  I can't make them as well as some of my older family members can, but I love to eat them with fried onions. Great Festival!  I will look for Gosia's again."}
