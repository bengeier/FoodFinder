{"text":"I love Amel's.  The food is always wonderful and the service is great.  I love that this is an old place.  It feels warm and familiar when you walk in.  The Amel's salad with extra feta is superb;  it was a weekly takeout order for me when I lived in Mt. Lebanon.  The bar is very cool, neighborhood-y friendly and classic, and the dining room decor is fun and kinda magical.  I have had kebabs, chicken dishes, salads, appetizers and desserts, and it has always been delicious.  My only regret is that I don't get to the south hills as often as I would like to visit.  Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"We are always happy with the food at Amel's however the waitstaff could have a better attitude.  They seem to be very unhappy with their jobs.  Also the place needs some renovations.  The carpeting is worn and looks dirty and the booths needs new stuffing and need to be reupholstered.  You would think that the money that this place makes that they would shell out some money for basic upkeep."}
{"text":"first time there, will definitely return.  Large menu. Excellent service, friendly servers.  our party of 4 had: filet mignon and fresh veg kabob= cut with filet with fork, was so tender., perfectly seasoned and cooked; as were the veggies.  rice pilaf solid
Virginia Spots \"best I ever had\"
Chicken Tangine, excellent flavor , if a bit on the dry side
Shrimp Scampi= huge shrimp
salads were awesome, highly recommend the taziki sauce as a dressing
were given plate warm pitas to share, yum!
full bar available in restaurant area, also a separate bar in front, seems to be non-smoking
fresh made banana cream pie, real whipped cream, delicious
good price range of items.
not a very large place, so would suggest reservations if have big group"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! We were a party of 10 had a reservation and you think they care about your reservation? Heck no!!! Waited for our table for an hour!!!! No body came check on us, we have been waiting by an empty table, no apologies, and when we ask about the table, they were really mean and rude, the hostess was not doing her job and they ended up kicking us out because they were upset how impatient we were, no.... I think anyone would be upset waiting for reservation for that long. Worst experience ever!!! Will defiantly not go there again!!"}
{"text":"I drove by Amel's many many times during several years before trying for the first time a couple nights ago. I was highly disappointed. I was expecting Mediterranean style food and it was listed on the menu, but the small samples I had were very bland. There were so many other items on the menu that I was wondering if it used to be somewhat more authentic and is trying to expand or what. It didn't compare well to other places I've had around town that serve Mediterranean and near eastern style food. It just seemed like an expensive bar with a huge menu, some of which was not the usual bar fare but was of typical suburban bar quality."}
{"text":"At first I thought the the name of this restaurant was Anal's, so I wasn't really sure about where my brother and his wife were taking me.  I ended up having a terrific meal.  I couldn't even tell you what I ate but I know it was good!  Most of the items on the menu were unknown to me but everything we ordered looked and tasted wonderful.  I recommend trying something different here at Anal's...  I mean Amel's."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. We spent over $100 for the two of us. Don't eat any fish/seafood. Got food poisoning from the meals. If I could give zero stars I would. Regretting going to dinner there tonight. Threw up when I got home. Now both ends. Ugh. We both are sick. Food poisoning. Beware!!!!! Terrible food. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! Disgusting food. This was our third try here. First was great. Second ok. Third terrible. The entrees are horrible. The apps were good but don't eat dinner you'll regret it. So sick right now. Never going back."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  Inconsistency in the food.  Usually a miss with take out so be sure to double check your order before you leave.   Bar service is slow.  Table service is better.    But all the workers are very nice & personable.    Recently ordered the filet sandwich on brioche with aioli that was very tasty.   Hope it's as good the next time I order!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that has been there for ions and there is a reason why.  It's not on a main road nor is it very easy to find or get to if you are not from the immediate area.  But, it was a dedicated following.  Why?  Because the food is amazing and the staff is friendly.  The hummus and the tabouli are perfect--the best I ever had.  But, what brings me back time and time again is their She-Crab Soup!  I know it sounds crazy that a mediteranian restaurant on a back road of a Pittsburgh suburb would have the best She-Crab Soup in the whole darn world but trust me....they do.  I go there for that alone (and their martinis....they leave the shaker with you so you can have the dirty rocks!).  My husband loves all of their lamb dishes--the gyros and the gyro salad included.  Their fried zucchini rocks too.   GO!"}
{"text":"I'll second the other reviewer that said for the price charged, the amount of food you receive doesn't measure up. Furthermore, Pittsburgh still has yet to have any quality schawarma. 

I ordered both the beef and chicken schawarma to sample. 

The beef:

- clearly frozen boxed 'steak-ums' as opposed to freshly shaved off a doner.
- a measly 2 slices at that, I basically had a wrap of lettuce and tomato w/ a hint of beef

The chicken:

- clearly a once frozen and somewhat freezer burnt sliced chicken breast again as opposed to being freshly sliced off a doner and a mix of white and dark meat. this leaves the meat dry and tasteless. 
- maybe a half of a chicken breast if I was lucky

No toum or similar sauce served at all with either dish?!?! That's hitting a whole new low for fake schawarma. 

Hostess was great, service was adequate. I have no motivation to return. 

Hopefully one day Pittsburgh will have good choices when it comes to Greek and Med. food. Today is not that day."}
{"text":"Best tabouli salad ever! Plus you get pita bread with oil instead of traditional white bread before your meals."}
{"text":"They have great Middle Eastern food. The Amels salad with feta was great. The hummus and stuffed grape leaves we're good. I enjoyed the pilaf. My son really liked the gyro. Definitely get the baklava."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service (male server), welcoming atmosphere, nostalgic tone, delicious and quality food. We had the grilled lamb salad and falafel sandwich  (actually a wrap)."}
{"text":"A cute, cozy restaurant you don't expect to find if you're in the area. 
The service was not enthusiastic & short with words, though she got the job done. 
We started off with the she crab soup and French onion soup. Of the two, the she crab was my favorite. It had chunks and was not overly sweet (like some seafood soups tend to be). The French onion was decent, though had too many onions. I did like that the bread that came in it was a bit crispy, which was an unusual, but pleasant surprise. 
The meals came with salads, we ordered the Amel salads. The dressing was interesting. Enjoyable enough. 
The steak tips and mushrooms - I feel like they could've been better if she asked me what temperature I wanted the steak cooked. I like my steak more on the medium rare side and it was more on the medium well, very close to well done side. The sauce was different and yummy. I think the mushrooms helped. The veggies and mashed potatoes were both tasty!
The lamb shank - the lamb fell right off the bone. Very juicy and flavorful. My friend was in food heaven."}
{"text":"Delicious place for lunch! I had the stuffed chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy... Wow so good! And the chicken was Amish antibiotic free natural chicken, a big plus!
Exceptional service,also."}
{"text":"Amels is a great Mediterranean restaurant! First off, the atmosphere is so cute! The lights are dimmed, there's decorations in purple, orange, green, vibrant colors.The food is so good and the staff is very nice! They have a bar in the front that you can wait at and have drinks well waiting to be seated or waiting for others to meet you there."}
{"text":"While I can't yelp but think that the music, decoration, and overall ambiance of Amel's is pure tacky cheese, their food continues to deliver anyways. The one way parking lot both in the front and rear of the building starts the meal with more frustration than delight.  The outside condition of the restaurant and other buildings surrounding it also don't bode well.

The first \"seat yourself\" table we sat at was bussed, and reset for dinner, it was also dirty.  They didn't replace the white paper, and there was some type of food smeared on the corner. We moved.

The service was generally good but the upsell was present in every breathe. It gets old because you are already plunking down a wad of hard earned cash.  The suggestions were good ones.

The hummus sampler was very good with the grilled lamb/pomegranate being very tasty!
 
The Amel's salad of greens with lemon/mint dressing was good.  The upsell of feta was a good idea.  Why they don't just include it and increase the price for the salad, I'm not sure.  It would have lacked something without the feta.  There's a freshness of herbs in the salad -- it was a great start.

I had the mixed grille kabob --- (2) pieces lamb, (1) filet, (1) chicken (1) shrimp, (2) tomatoes, (1) piece of onion.  While admittedly I am a big guy, I could have eaten two of these.  The amount of food was too little given the price tag.  I can get a full 1/2 pound filet kabob at Giant Eagle for about $5. Or mixed Filet/Chicken for $5. Compare this to the $21.00 charged for essentially the same thing.  It was flavorful, but just questionable value.

I think that if they threw on another shrimp to keep the other one company, and perhaps another piece of chicken, and charged $25 I would have been happier.

My wife's pasta athena with chicken was very good as well.

While the service is a bit cheeky for me, and the ambiance definitely shaky, the food overcomes the majority of my concerns.  The value is semi-questionable.  They definitely deliver on flavor, and I'm rounding up to 4 for Amel's."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lovely atmosphere. It's beautifully decorated. Our server was attentive. We started out with a hummus platter. It was just ok, the pita was pretty dry. I ordered the chicken Romano it was absolutely delicious. The pasta that came with it was also good. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in Brookline right on McNeilley Road. We went for brunch last Sunday and the place is very cozy with great décor.  They also have a fantastic outdoor patio in the front, street view, but very charming.  Our waitress was not nice (no substitutions for anything we quickly found out) but she got the job done and checked on us numerous times. I went with the Mediterranean omelet which had feta and tomatoes in it. The omelet was almost as big as my plate, very tasty with a lot of cheese and veggies inside.  The brunch entrees are all served with a choice of sausage or bacon and home fries. It was enough to fed two at a very reasonable price of $10. they also had pancakes, waffles and a few other egg dishes you could pick from (gyro omelet). I can't wait to go back for dinner and try some of the entrees."}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise in the South Hills desert of chain eateries. Romantic interior that's a refreshing throwback, and the best hummus and iced tea I had in Pittsburgh. The kebabs are sizzling, generous, and delicious, and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Worst mediterranean restaurant I have ever tried. 
1- bad service 
2- you gonna wait forever 
3- so pricy 
4- rude employees 
Will never come here again. If u wanna open a business respect ur customers, I am paying 4 my food not you guys :)"}
{"text":"I've been here before, many years ago. The owner is a colleague of my dad. When I suggested that we go here the other night, everyone in the family enthusiastically responded \"yes\". So this is really six reviews with 5 stars.

The atmosphere is nice. The inside looks like a typical neighborhood restaurant. Clean, nicely decorated, but not all fancyish. There are two bars: one in the dining room, and one on the other side (where smoking is allowed).

Both parking and the entrance is around back.

The food is excellent. The fare is typical mediterranean: hummus, babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves, pita, gyros, kabobs, etc. Every bit of our meals was good. We a couple of platters as appetizers that were delicious. My chicken tamboule was great too.

The service was also perfect. I wish I could remember the waitress' name. She did a great job.

Oh, and they have a surprisingly good selection of beers.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Wonderful Mediterranean cuisine! Best I have had! The hummus appetizer and citrusy tabbulee was amazing! My husband had the jasmine lamb and it was so perfectly prepared. The food is authentic and prepared perfectly. The atmosphere is older rustic and dated but makes you feel and know it's well loved."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mediterranean option outside of Pittsburgh. Ample appetizers, wonderful grape leaves, nice wine selection, and flavorful entrees. Best baba ever had. Friendly service, hometown feel, a great date spot on the weekends."}
{"text":"Amel's feels like a place that your grandmother decorated in the 90's, but because the food is so great, you see it as charm with a little romance instead of feeling a little old.

If you are going at a peak time, reservations are a must here because it can become quite crowded and the dining style is relaxed, so tables do not turn over quickly.

The menu contains Mediterranean, Greek and American fare.  The hummus appetizer is a must on regular visits and the sampler is a good choice for introducing the place to a new comer.  The hummus comes served with a warmed pita, bread and onions (yum).  The wine menu is quite limited, but it offers a favorite 'pleases everyone' wine we drink sometimes, so it does not disappoint.

For dinner, we have tried everything from kabob sampler, magic carpet rides and other chicken dishes, beef tips and salmon.  Entrees typically come with a salad that comes with a signature house lemon vinaigrette.  The salad really is dressed to the nines with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, olives and feta.  The food does not try to be fancy, instead just fresh, classic dishes.  The desserts are delicious and very highly recommended, so if you are too full, you certainly will want to get some to go.

Service tends to hover around average, so nothing to complain or write home about there.  After a bottle of wine, two meals and often dessert, our bill typically runs over $100, so it is not an everyday place, but certainly a place that you will want to come back to."}
{"text":"Great food and my favorite She Crab soup!  Great beer selection and desserts too. Atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"Amel's Restaurant is a solid Middle Eastern restaurant with a good selection of food from around the Mediterranean.  My wife and I typically visit Amel's about once each year.  We have enjoyed just about everything we have ever tried.  On caution, however, and this is why I'm only giving it four stars, the kebabs are often dry and over cooked, so steer clear of them.  Otherwise, it is a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"I lived near Amel's as a child and was once traumatized by a very lengthy wait. My mother LOVES to to hear about it to this day. BUT - fast-forward 30 years and I once again live in the neighborhood; and NOW, Amel's is one of my all-time faves! The food is INCREDIBLE. The service is hilariously snarky (especially if you get one of the veteran servers) and the atmosphere is Yinzer-Chic. Their bar specials are out of this world and have a rotating schedule each week featuring gyros, burgers, wine and more. The dessert case is also delightful and none of it will destroy your bank account. Bring a group or go yourself - it's a trip to the Mediterranean via a short drive to Brookline!"}
{"text":"The lamb was delicious. I was only here once but I really liked what I'd ordered. It was a bit expensive though."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good mediterranian food this is your place in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. 
They do not have a gluten free menu but they will work with you. Their house salad is super yummy as is their hummus, all homemade. 

They also have a salad that has a homemade ranch dressing, at the moment I cannot recall the name. Sorry!

Decently priced. They also have a large drink menu and a bar."}
{"text":"The gyro platter was very good although not the best iv had therefore getting a solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but lately I feel like it has gone down hill. The food has absolutely no flavor. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!!   It feels like a local joint but the food and service is world class."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to go all the time when I was a kid, and to this day I still crave it constantly. They have a great array of food. Their kabobs, pastas, chicken, and hummus are my favorites. The service is always very friendly, and although older, I love the decor. I think it's unique and a very calming environment."}
{"text":"Lunch was outstanding! Double down with hummus and tabulee.
Will be back for dinner soon!!"}
{"text":"Generally it is very hard to find good service. Bad service is the norm. Exceptionally bad is an Amels standard. Having to beg for each part of your meal is pathetic. But don't forget to to tip. How about doing some basic training. When a drink is bone dry there's a good chance the customer might want a refill. Bring the soup or salad before the meal. Bring desert before you bring the bill. You want butter with that warm pita? How novel! Perhaps you could offer a free hour glass so we could have some idea of when to expect nourishment. Exceptionally bad !"}
{"text":"Easily the worst service I've ever experienced at a sit-down restaurant. We had a confirmed reservation for a party of six at 7:15 on a Saturday evening. We arrived at 7:10 but were never seated until 8:01 because there were no tables available (isn't that the point of making a reservation?). We then endured a horribly unfriendly waitress who ignored us for the first ten minutes; when she finally came over, she told me that I couldn't have a glass of water because they were \"out of water glasses right now\". (She brought me a water 10 minutes later.) I ordered the mixed grill kebab; as she brought the entrees, the waitress dropped my knife on the floor and walked away. The kebab chicken and shrimp were good, but the filet was overcooked. Overall, I would give the food a 4, the value a 3 (rather pricey for the location), and the service and attitude of the staff a zero. Don't waste your time or money at Amel's."}
{"text":"We went for Brunch on a fabulous sunny day. We sat on the deck. The waitress was kind and friendly. The Mimosa was extra large, no skimping here! The veggie flatbread was delicious although the olive oil tasted old, rancid....perhaps the bottle sat out in the sun too long, perhaps they do not go through enough. It kinda ruined my  veggie flatbread. We will return to try more...because I want more :)"}
{"text":"This is a great find in Pittsburgh and out of the way.  Located on the back of Mt Washington, you will only find locals here.  First, the ambiance I so pleasing.  It is an eclectic place, tastefully done and offers inside and outside seating.  My favorite is sitting at the bar which is a split bar, like a mirror image.  There is something magical about this place in addition to great food.  The lighting in the main dining room is artful--adorned by CX design lighting like walking into a forest of glowing hanging flowers.
For starters we had the humus sampler which was a meal in itself.  I had a hankering for something different and went way outside the Mediterranean venue and right into the meatball hoagie.  I don't know why, but I did and was so rewarded. I am finding the breads in Pittsburgh to be their best kept secret.  My wife had the grape leaves as a diner and it was such a generous portion we needed to take it home. One of our guests had a lamb kabob, that was tasteful but the lamb was a little tough to cut.  I f I get to Pittsburgh again, this is a must."}
{"text":"Awesome, slightly fancy spot for Mediterranean food. Walked in without a reservation on a busy night and got lucky to grab a booth. Pretty good wine and beer selection. Split the Mediterranean platter and some salads. Everything was delicious.

A little pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. Went recently for dinner and was curious to see if anything changed (I had read reviews saying the food and service were declining). I didn't think that at all. The hummus is still amazingly delicious and the portion sizes were plenty. I expected service to be poor since it was busy but we had sufficient attention and all of our food came out hot and in a timely manner. Looking forward to trying brunch!"}
{"text":"What a great find (thanks to yelp!). I have lived in the area for a long time, and McNeilly road is simply one of those roads that I never have a reason to travel.  As a bonus, the weather today made seating outside the optimum choice.

I ordered the Moroccan Couscous, which included chicken and lamb, with the fatoush salad.  My companion got the Chicken Taboo, which included hummus, also with the fatoush salad.  Both meals were full of flavor and fresh.  The seasonings, such as saffron, really set the meals apart.  Although we were there during the lunch hour, our meals were dinners.  We are stuffed!

The parking is very limited but there is a large lot across the street where the Aldi is.  Maybe parking is OK there? We got lucky - we got the lone spot right in front next to their sign.  We walked maybe 10 feet.  

The outdoor seating is nice, with umbrellas to keep the direct sun off. I did notice ash trays on the tables.  If there were smokers present, we would have eaten inside.

Service was quick."}
{"text":"I have lived less than 5 minutes from here my whole life and only recently went for the first time.  I don't know why but for some reason I just never had an interest in going.  Big mistake.

The atmosphere inside the restaurant area is very fitting for the type of food they are serving.  It is classy, but laid back at the same time.  The service was great as well.

My table ordered the mezze platter which had grape leaves, hummus, artichokes, and another type of dip I forget.  All of them were great.  The grape leaves and hummus were my favorites.  They continuously bring you fresh warm pits bread throughout your meal.

Our entrees were a gyro salad, the combo kabob, and a lamb burger.  All were delicious.  The combo kabob was lamb, filet, shrimp and chicken, all cooked to perfection.  The lamb burger was also cooked perfectly and tasted great.  For a place that doesn't specialize in burgers, it was crafted perfectly with a brioche bun.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I got the braised lamb shank and it was pretty good. We also got the goat cheese artichokes which were just ok. The meal and experience all around was just ok for the price. We haven't been back since"}
{"text":"I'm not into the med food but my mate is so I go along.   It's noisy on a busy nite. 
      I will give the bartender high marks for making me one of the best cocktails I ever tasted.   He knows his business."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants.  We heard it had gone down hill.  Last night we tried it and found that indeed it has. Way down. I ordered the Greek Chicken. All I could taste was lemon.  They must of changed pita suppliers.  The new pitas tasted like a doughy pancake. My wife's dinner was bland. We were there on a gift card that still has another 5 dollars on it and I'm not sure we'll even use it. It was that bad. My hope is that they fix their problems. It used to be great."}
{"text":"We fell upon Amel's in a visit to Pittsburgh and pleasantly surprised on our random pick!!! Great food, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Amels. It's intimate, delicious, friendly, local...the list goes on. I've tasted a variety of delicacies including their fabulous hummus, grape leaves, stuffed eggplant, gyro plate, steak, etc...all of which have been cooked to perfection and amazing.
I highly recommend reservations, especially on the weekends. Pro tip: if you like to dine a little bit later, say past 8pm, you shouldn't have an issue getting seated. The staff here is very friendly and won't rush you; plan on a relaxed evening!"}
{"text":"Another great trip to Amel's! I had the vegetarian grape leaves this time, and I DEFINITELY prefer them over the traditional meat ones. I am not saying the meat ones are bad, I just prefer the creamy rice filling in mine with a squirt of lemon juice on top; so light and delicious. 

The only thing that kind of bugged me is that when I got the grape leaves, the waitress very kindly explained that appetizers were half off with purchase of an entree (I guess a happy hour special). I enjoyed them so much that I decided to get another order of them to go for tomorrow's lunch, and she said she had to charge me full price since I was getting them to go. Huh? Kind of odd to me but I still agreed to purchase them.

My SO had the Caesar salad and the gyro platter- he really enjoyed it but wished it came with a dollop of hummus as he would have loved that with his gyro. He also thought perhaps it should come with a bit more pita to build your own gyro. As soon as he asked, the waitress brought more free of charge. He also thought that $8 for a side Caesar salad (he didn't add cheese, I got a ton of feta on my salad so I gave him some) was a bit much- I agree! They need to have better prices for their side salads- although it was delicious and great quality ingredients, it was not the size of an entree salad so it should not have been $8 in my opinion. 

I got the Mediterranean angel pasta again (I just had to see if it was as good as I remember) and if even possible, it was better. This time, it had a bunch of fresh herbs sprinkled on top which just added to the freshness and vibrancy of this heavenly dish. 

You have to give this place a try. Their food is fresh and vibrant, and the decor in the dining room is awesome!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I must have driven past Amel's 5 dozen times before saying Hmmmm...maybe I'll try this place out.

I went out for my birthday dinner and would happily go again, and soon! It's a perfect place to grab some food if you are trying to eat a little healthier...it's also a great place if you don't care as there are a wide variety of menu options. My problem was that there was so, so much on the menu that I wanted to order that I by the time the server came by to ask again, I had to throw up my hands and know that I would have to come back many times to get everything I wanted. I also wasn't all that hungry. Always so annoyed at myself when I go to a new place that's actually GOOD and can't eat that much--the worst!

I started with their summer beer on tap (I think it was the Summer Solstice) which was very good, crisp, and flavorful. My appetizer was grilled artichokes stuffed with goat cheese (awesome.) Since I wasn't very hungry, I got a soup and salad for my meal. The fattoush salad was very good and I would happily order it again. The specialty soup was a cold cantaloupe soup and it's why I had to knock off a star. It tasted mostly of sour cream, but outside of that didn't have very much flavor and I really love chilled soups! No one at my table enjoyed it that much, but as far as missteps go, it wasn't a huge one. 

Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals and drinks without complaint. We sat on the patio on a beautiful summer night, which added to the experience. The shrubbery is situated just so, ad we didn't feel like we were right off of busy McNeily Rd. Parking can be a bit of a hassle since the lot is so small and shared with many businesses, but we just parked across the street. Not a big deal."}
{"text":"I went here during lunch and was shocked that you had to walk around the bar to get to the restaurant portion of the show. I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into at that point. Within minutes, I realized that this was a place where you were only a stranger once. The food was delicious. Everyone in my group ordered something different, and much taste testing took place. Everyone went away full beyond belief and satisfied. If I lived closer, I would gladly frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went to Amel's for New Years Eve.  While it was extremely crowded, we had quick service and fantastic food.  The fried feta in phyllo was fantastic, as was my filet mignon stroganoff.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, and it was a great way to kick off New Years Eve!  Can't wait to get back, and try some more fantastic grub!"}
{"text":"Decent pour at the bar, except I ordered a Manhattan, not bourbon up.  I'm much too young to be drinking here.  Venimus, bibimus, vaminus.  We came, we drank, we left."}
{"text":"Had the chicken kabob and hummus. Didnt enjoy either, hence, the two stars. On the other hand, the bartender was really nice. Might give a second try."}
{"text":"Great meal! Great service! This was our second choice for the evening, but I've now decided it's my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Local local local - working class excellence. People who value a good meal at a good price amongst friendly folk should make this a must-do. The interior is homey old-school but clean. The waitstaff knows - by name - many patrons. The owner is super nice and friendly and very hands-on. An addition into an adjacent space is in the works.One problem that cost a full star off the rating - only two beer selections on tap - think river water product. Other selections available in bottles, but let's face it - a great fish sandwich becomes a good fish sandwich if the brew with which to wash it down is not gratifying. Perhaps a request for EastEnd Brewing is warranted?"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Amel's for about 7 years or so. To be blunt I've never really had a bad meal at Amel's. I'm biased in the fact that it's my favorite restaurant. I won't hide that. 

I've enjoyed many items off of their special menu which changes weekly. They usually have very solid appetizers, and excellent specials. Whether you like seafood, beef and the occasional pork dish it usually appears on the special menu. One dish that stands out usually appears around the Fall season is the Orecchiette with chicken, cranberry and sage in a cream sauce. Incredibly rich, but so good.

One of my favorite items is the Filet with shrimp. Always cooked perfectly and the shrimp are of a nice size. Another standout for me is the Lamb Jasmine. Lamb scaloppine sautéed in a tomato sauce with artichokes, spinach and fresh tomatoes with a dash of feta cheese. Can't beat it.

The downside is sometimes the wait on a Friday or a Saturday can be a bit long. Amel's has a nice bar offering bottled craft beers plus your standards. They often also have a lot of seasonal beers and a large wine selection.

One thing I do not care for at Amel's is their gyro. It doesn't come off of a vertical rotisserie that I'm aware of. It's good, but there are better. Order from the special menu or standard menu unless you absolutely have to have a gyro."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!!  I have to Amel's for drinks but I have never ordered food. Tonight I went in for takeout. Best decision today!  I ordered Chicken Shawarma with Tabouli on the side. I sat at the bar while I waited. The bartender was very nice. The gentleman at the bar showed me his favorites on the menu. It was welcoming that I thought I had walked into someone's home. The chicken in the shawarma was freshly grilled, the hummus was very tasty, and it was the best shawarma I've ever had. And why order fries or onion sings as your side when you can have freshly made tabouli ??  It came with a wedge of lemon to squeeze over it.  
Now I need to back and dine in and get the true experience."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant for family get together for three generations! There is nothing they won't do to make you feel at home and the food is amazing!!! The lamb jasmine, grape leaves, Amelia salad my favorite for 20 years!!!"}
{"text":"Amels has quality food, excellent service, great selection, and great crowd of people. Enjoy myself every time!"}
{"text":"Over priced and the place needs re modeled 
Average food!
Parking is a nightmare!!! 
BARTENDER mike is super cool though !!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant near my house in Brookline. They have a nice dining area in the back for a date or nice dinner and the front area is great to grab a quick lunch or drink at their full service bar. I love their Bloody Mary's. Everything I have tried there is phenomenal especially their lamb kebab, tabollah, and hummas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and beer selection with both being reasonably priced. The staff is courteous, knowledgeable and give prompt service."}
{"text":"Note #1: This originally was intended to be Review Update #100, but the ball doesn't always bounce the way ya want it to, does it?

Note #2: Their website is obviously dead. I think that's the 2nd one they've been through. Hopefully they'll get their net-fu in gear at some point. 

A review for Amel's is what began my crusade on Yelp. Feeling that I had unfinished business with the place, I decided to come full circle and bring Kay here to give Amel's another chance for a rare, impromptu Monday night date.

You see, the few times I have dined here, I was not gastronomically devastated by a magnificent meal. Instead I had a supper that was alternately memorable, lackluster, and flawed. 

Somehow the lively, bright atmosphere that I experienced over 2 years ago fell away this past Monday night, leaving a more intimate, romantic vibe in its place. Amel's truly did seem like it had become a completely different establishment to me since my last visit. In this regard, it is a chameleon. 

Our appetizer was a serving of Pomegranate Couscous Scallops. An immediate classic, this alone made me glad that I chose to revisit and reconsider Amel's. The scallops quivered, inviting us to sink our forks and teeth into their beautifully tender, seawater-imbibed flesh. The tangy yet candied pomegranate sauce caramelized the couscous, turning it into something not unlike toasted, ground almonds, all of it flattering the scallops immensely. Erotic seafood: Amel's has invented it, and we wanted more.

Kay's dish, Shrimp Aphrodite, only furthered this end. Tomato-blessed angel hair pasta served as a bed for plump, goat cheese-loaded shrimp. The pasta alone was exquisite enough without anything else, but the shrimp and goat cheese transformed  it into something obscenely luxurious. Shrimp and goat cheese together are a marriage made in the sweetest, most decadent circle of Hell ever imagined. Erotic seafood: Amel's has perfected it, and we were spent.

Note that I only had a taste of Aphrodite; It was Kay's after all, and it was so seductive, she allowed me to sample it with reservations.

Staying away from Shish Kebobs, I opted for the Lamb Shawarma and found myself enthralled by yet another sinfully ambrosial culinary union; fresh ground lamb and hummus. Housed in a crisped cylinder of pita bread and embellished with chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion, the reddened, savory meat merged with the lush, lemony hummus to create the ideal Mediterranean bite many times over.  

Our server, Nikki, was so positively Olympian, I felt as if I was overtaxing her by slurping down so much lemonade (I had just gotten off work and was dying of thirst!). Never were Kay and I left with empty glasses, and she did it all with a smile and a streetwise verve. 

We passed on dessert since Kay wanted to go to the Rita's nearby, but please don't pass on Amel's as my previous, middling review has been rendered irrelevant. 

P.S. Our bill this time was close to $43, averaging out to about $21.50 a person. Keep in mind we didn't get dessert and that Kay's dish was around $16. My shawarma was half as much. 

P.P.S. I forgot about the french fries that accompanied my shawarma. They were peeled, done steak-style, and were quite good

P.P.P.S. That obsidian genie on the sign at the front door is still so very kvlt. He should appear on the cover of the next Melechesh album...

{"text":"A diverse menu, with, as expected, mediterranean-themed food. Lots of daily specials. A little bit crampled and can be noisy. Not inexpensive and not food allergy friendly--but generally very enjoyable."}
{"text":"After driving by Amel's several times and laughing at the pink genie street sign, the boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot around 7 PM on a Friday night.  Best. Decision. Ever! 

I drove and was happy to see a  parking lot in the back.  Restaurant was dark and decor was unique with painted murals on the wall. 

We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes, so we stopped by the bar.  Moments after receiving my wine, we were seated.  A 20 minute wait wasn't bad, but a 5 minute wait was even better!  

Food was incredible.  Fresh, homemade, local, very filling!

Appetizer: Stuffed peppers.  3 decent-sized peppers & complimentary freshly baked pita bread.  

Entree: Chicken something-or-other (I can't find name on the online menu).  Bone-in chicken thigh from a local farm; rice pilaf; veggies.  

Service: Decent - the only reason I decided on 4 stars, instead of 5. Waitress was friendly, but not terribly attentive (perhaps because they were busy?).  She stopped by to take order, deliver appetizer & food, and to deliver check, and I found myself beverageless a couple times.  

Overall, delicious food and a nice experience."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and it was fantastic!! Couldn't ask for better food and service. We sat onbthe patio, small but well mantained!"}
{"text":"I have never received anything but top-notch at Amel's, and I am not sure what took me so long to leave them a review! 

Amel's is offering gourmet food & 5 star service, all at a Pittsburgh price! Try the phyllo & feta appetizer, and make sure you get a cup of she-crab soup too! If you are disappointed in this place, you probably need to just stay home!"}
{"text":"I heard great things but I'm Not sure how this place has 4 stars. The food is very average, service is okay and we had an hour wait with a reservation. I think it does well because of the older locals and it has a history. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Amel's Restaurant has been around for decades and for good reason. The food here is incredible. Between two people, we split the chicken kabob meal along with the tabbouli. These dishes could easily have been shared between three or even four people. Everything was delicious, the wait staff was respectful, and the restaurant itself had a comfortable atmosphere. There is also a very nice deck outside in which people opt to eat at, but unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate that day. Overall, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It's great for what it is and where it is. It's a simple Mediterranean restaurant on McNeilly road. You want food elsewhere on McNeilly it's going to be wings, hoagies, or mufflers. The Street is basically an industrial park so it's a nice Easter egg.

It's hard to travel the travel the world experiencing all of the great cuisine and then move to a \"sandwich\" town. So it's refreshing to have Mediterranean food that isn't just a gyro with fries. Lovely to have seafood that isn't just breaded pollack with potato chips.

I don't know how fresh or authentic any of the ingredients are or what they are doing in the kitchen, but at least they are trying and pulling it off. At least they aren't the one millionth lousy pizza place in Pittsburgh. Very nice folks of course. Homey understated atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Definitely worth the tab."}
{"text":"I've been to Amels more times than I can count over the past 20 years and have always loved it. Hadn't been there for about 4 years so went for dinner with friends and was hugely disappointed in the food. Definitely not the quality it used to be. I could have bought better prepared food at a grocery store. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere... 

Food is average. Get the hummus without onions or you'll be overpowered."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean in Pittsburgh! Came here with a group of 6 for my birthday and we had a great time. Try the hummus trio!"}
{"text":"As I have mentioned in a few other reviews I use to live in Brookline and this place was a go to from the start. Known as one of the best mediterranean restaurants in town and bragged about but many of the Brookline residents. 

My wife and I went here and they didn't disappoint. Stuffed grapes leaves, braised lamb shank with cracking....Yum Yum Yum. I have not had the chance to try very many things on the menu but everything I have ordered here has been really good. 

If you make it down to the south hills and want some authentic mediterranean cuisine this is the place to be."}
