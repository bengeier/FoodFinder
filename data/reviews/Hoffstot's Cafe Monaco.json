{"text":"I liked this place enough to go back. It won't be a place I recommend a lot. It is good, but not 

The good:
- Fried Calamari. Unbelievably good - and a great surprise since I am a seafood snob and didn't expect it to be much good so far from the coast.
- Lasagne good. Classic American style - huge, heavy, and delicious. I ate it 3 different times, it's that big. (And I'm a big fella.)

The bad:
-Pasta Fagioli. Really guys, it was bad. It tasted like someone dumped beans in spaghetti sauce and added water. I actually think they did just that.
-Service. It was slow, and she was a little cranky. I got a big eye roll when she asked how the uneaten soup was. It was late, and the place was packed, but I am not super demanding and it doesn't take a lot to make me happy."}
{"text":"We've been regularly eating at Hoffstot's for years.  It's pretty much a given that you're going to enjoy your meal.  The salad is fresh and not boring & I really enjoy the homemade house vinigrette.  My husband always orders the fried zucchini.  It's done to perfection.  Never greasy.  And the marinara sauce that accompanies it is delicious.  Every time we're here at least one of the brother owners is present.  We had them cater our Thanksgiving dinner.  Was expecting good (since you pick it up the day prior & reheat it) not great.  Well, it was GREAT!  Everything was delicious!  The stuffing was out of this world.  So I called about a week before Christmas to have a side or two catered, and they had already reached their order limit.  They are making my augratin potatoes for Easter :)"}
{"text":"I love their Blackenzola and filet dinners.  The seafood dishes are tasty.  I tried the roasted beet salad this past weekend and loved it.  Will be ordering that from now on instead of the standard mixed green which is also good.   Service is always good and consistency of the food is great. I have been enjoying this place for 25 years."}
{"text":"Had dinner 2 times there in the past week. Both experiences were great. We had the apple gorgonzola salad, stuffed pepper appetizer, and soup. Everything was delicious. Service was very good. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. We also had the best chicken Marsala!  Again, great calamari appetizer and their coffee was delicious. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here with my mom and her friend. They both had been here before,  but it was my first time (I live in Minnesota).

Our server, Rose, was wonderful. She had a down to earth personality and took the time to chat with us. She was very attentive with refilling our iced teas and clearing empty plates. 

I was going to order the cashew chicken salad, but they were out of it, so I went with the Mini Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. My mom's friend recommended them and they ordered them as well.

The salads we started with were great! They had a little more personality than a typical house salad. They had grape tomatoes, cucumbers, a couple of black and green olives, sprouts, and mixed spring greens. The house made Italian dressing was good.

The crab cakes were nice and light, not heavy with mayo and filler, and were delicately pan fried. They sat on top of saut√©ed spinach and were drizzled with lemon beurre blanc sauce. 

My favorite was the Braised Escarole (greens & beans). I had never tried it before or even heard of it, but I had a few bites of my mom's friend's. Wow! So perfectly garlicky! It's one of my new favorite things!"}
{"text":"we really like going here and have been numerous times? you can always count on very good food, greta selection, I always pick one of the specials. service is top notch. good wine selection. very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great quality of food and awesome service! They also have great daily specials. And a good wine selection."}
{"text":"I can't recommend Hoffstot's highly enough for special events! I recently used their facilities for a bridal shower that I was hosting as Matron of Honor. The chef, Brian, that I worked with was SO extremely friendly, patient, and helpful. I was planning this event from Philadelphia, so I called Brian regularly with questions or concerns. I'm sure he was annoyed with me, but he never once let it show! I can't thank him enough for his professionalism and patience. 

When it came to the day of, everything went as smoothly as possible. The two servers that were assigned to us that day were excellent - I wish I had remembered their names! The food was absolutely delicious, and the portion sizes were huge. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better day. The prices were extremely reasonable, also. 

Thank you again to Brian and the entire team at Hoffstot's! Don't hesitate to choose them for a special event."}
{"text":"Inferior all around.  Server was rude and slammed plates on the table.  Constant noise from clatter of plates and tableware and even running a vacuum cleaner.  Food was poor quality.  I sent my order back as it was not as menu described and the served didn't even ask if I wanted to order another item.  These folks have an UNDESERVED high opinion of themselves.  Pass this place up for another choice that has better food and staff that cares."}
{"text":"Horrible! Had to sit in the bar area and my husband is hearing impaired (too much noise). Salads came quickly and were good, but the eggplant arrived and it was barely warm. Waitress disappeared, never filled the water glasses. Just to get over the new Oakmont bridge it took 30 minutes. My advise, stay out of Oakmont until the bridge is completely open. This place could possible be good if you get a seat in the dining area, otherwise avoid it entirely. Don't think owners care because it looks like a \"gold mine\", so anything else is \"so what\"."}
{"text":"Food was fair at best.  Seemed pre-made.  Bread was served cold.  Pasta was over cooked and all served smothered in sauce. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Over the weekend we had a birthday party in the private room.  The service was outstanding!!
Food was fantastic!  Thank you Chef Brian and team for making our event such a success.

If you are looking to plan a party this is the place to go!!  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get.  Lots of menu options."}
{"text":"Recently attended funeral luncheon, mostly food was good. But the roasted vegetables were total melange of mush. Unacceptable to serve soft overcooked mush for vegetables."}
{"text":"Oh my.  I've only been here twice, and I think that's only because I had forgotten how bad it was the first time!  The food was luke warm and just dreadful.  The service was slow and not especially well-trained."}
{"text":"7pm Friday night - first take was from the door, busy atmosphere, lots of servers running around with plates of hot, delicious smelling food.  we didn't have a reservation and that seems to be quite the SIN, at least to the two hostesses (older one with short hair especially - hope she's not an owner.)  

regardless of uppy attitude, we were seated almost immediately amongst a mostly 60+ crowd in a large room reminiscent of a diner with tablecloths - very bright/not romantic w little fancy ambiance.  

yummy stuffed banana peppers (they'll mix mild and hot if you ask) and generous salad portions.  delicious bourbon pork chops and pistachio pasta dishes!  free delicious almond cookies at dessert - next time I'll skip the tiramisu though (homemade w lots of mascarpone, but we were too full to enjoy, heh.)  good coffee!  

we'll come back, but really drop the attitude, this place is a dressy diner with too expensive, but good, food.  kudos to EXCELLENT waitress, Heather, who turned our frowns upside down!"}
{"text":"The early bird specials from 4-6 pm. Are excellent.  Every time I go I get there pot roast which I love. The staff is very friendly and the owner is always around which I feel is important to run a successful business."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty food, both traditional and contemporary. The portions are huge. We enjoyed several grilled meat salads, consisting of lots of varied toppings, romaine/spring mix lettuces and housemade dressings. We also enjoyed several chicken based dishes. Sauces were abundant and well spiced and salted. Umami was attended to and treated well.

The patrons span the spectrum: old and young, couples and families, middle aged groups of friends.

Citrus Tea is delightful. Beer prices are very reasonable. Service is great, staff is friendly.

Sit in the bar if you're looking to watch TV's or have a more casual ambiance.

Tables are too close together but if you can snag a booth you'll enjoy both the food and drinks as well as the ambiance."}
{"text":"Ordered a fillet mignon, what I received was a fillet.  The difference is a secondary muscle that is attached to a beef fillet.  In order for it to be a fillet mignon this secondary muscle(which is full of grissle and UNCHEWABLE) has to be removed.  I also received what is called the head cut.  This is the first cut off of a fillet that is NEVER to be called a fillet mignon. Enough for the steak, it was less than enjoyable.
  I also ordered a salad with BLUE CHEESE DRESSING.  The problem here was when they made the homemade dressing they forgot to put the BLUE CHEESE in the dressing or so little there was NO taste of blue.  Blue cheese has the color blue in it, hence the name.  There was NOTHING blue or lumpy in MY dressing.  It tasted like I had a spoonful of thin Hellmans on my salad.  I've had better dressing at Eat n Park.
 This was my first and WILL BE my last visit to this establishment.  And my advice to you, DON'T BOTHER find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to this place for first time last night. The location is good and the decoration was OK. As soon as we sit down I noticed a fly in my water! The server was nice but very slow. I think It was his first day. It took a long time before we get our food. My mash potatoes was cold and my steak was very salty and warm. The price is too high for the quality of food. The fried ice cream didn't even test like fried ice cream. This place was just OK. Nothing really special about the atmosphere or the food or service."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  The owner of the restaurant reached out to me after my review and apologized for the experience I had!  Super nice people and they offered a gift card to make up for it.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a little celebratory dinner after I read an interview with the restaurant's executive chef in a local magazine.  Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed.  We kicked off the experience with some sparkling wine, and our waitress had to find another server to open it, as she didn't know how.  The poor server who came over to help cut her hand on the bottle's wire cage and started bleeding all over.  We had to politely point out to her that there was blood all over the napkin she was using to open the bottle, because she didn't notice.  They took the bottle away and got the bartender to open it, and it frankly grossed me out a bit to go ahead and drink the wine out of it, but I wiped the top with a napkin to see if any blood remained on it, and there didn't seem to be, so we let it go and didn't want to make a fuss.  

The bread and oil were good, but I ended up using some of that oil on my salad, since the dressing was flavorless.  We got the cod and chicken pistachio for our main dishes, and I was very surprised to see that the only vegetable preparation they have for their sides is steaming.  The magazine article I read emphasized that the chef sees vegetables as the next big thing, and as a veggie-lover, I expected something really interesting.  Unfortunately, unless you liked the gray, over-steamed brussels sprouts your grandma made thirty years ago, you will be disappointed at all the veggie sides at Hoffstot's.  A more current preparation would be roasting them with olive oil and salt, which is what other restaurants are doing.  I had to send back my chicken because it had literally no flavor whatsoever, and appeared to have been pounded thin and then steamed.  I actually almost grabbed the waitress to tell her she'd brought me fish by mistake, because the chicken had a flaky, fish-like texture.  I took a few bites and tried to like it, but there was just no taste there, only a sea of buttery, flavorless sauce.  I got a side of penne pasta in an equally flavor-free sauce that also went back.

Still hungry, having struck out on the salad, main course, and side dish, I decided to try out dessert.  Their dessert menu says \"Innovative Desserts\" at the top, but every dessert is named \"Old fashioned such and such,\" so that's a bit of a clash.  We tried to order a pumpkin pecan dessert, but the server said they didn't have any.  She said they had some creme brulee for a short time only, as a special dessert, so we ordered that.  It came out looking unlike any creme brulee I've ever seen.  It was covered in strawberries and whipped cream, probably to disguise the fact that it was made far in advance and stored in the fridge, such that there was no \"brulee\" to it.  The characteristic crackly sugar crust had melted and softened, so they should have just called it a baked custard at best, since people usually order creme brulee for the torched sugar crust.  It tasted fine, it just wasn't creme brulee.

We gave in at this point and called it a night.  We won't be back, since the folks running this restaurant seem to be out of date and allergic to flavor."}
{"text":"Some people really love this place-I think it is ok.  It caters to a really old crowd at lunch time so if you are into that sort of thing go for it!  Their menu has not changed much at all in the past 8 years.  Typical luncheon fare, sandwiches, salads, soups and a few entrees."}
{"text":"Well let me tell you about this place. My family gathered here tonight for my aunts birthday. 16 of us total, probably closed to a grand in total purchases. Two waitresses were rude to us all because we had the nerve to ask for a couple tables to be put together. Then, another waitress walked by and rolled her eyes because she had to walk around my Grandmother who was holding her great grandson. None of these ridiculous situations were worse than when the OWNER of the business came by and gave my 90 year old grandmother a completely unnecessary and impolite attitude. No man should speak to a woman the way this man spoke to my grandmother. We were told \"you've been here two hours, I have tables to turn, and you're holding people up.\" ...we had just finished dinner. Literally just finished. The owner is rude and so is his staff. I've worked in customer service for many years and I can tell you that no service person should ever treat anyone the way these people treated us. I, and my family, will NEVER return to this establishment."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Hoffstot's many times, and the food is always excellent. We order the antipasti platter, salads, and I usually get the blackenzola. It's always fantastic. Their service is usually pretty good, too. 

I'm only giving it four stars because we always make a reservation but almost always end up waiting anyway. The last time we waited over an hour past when our reservation was made for, and there was no room at the bar so we had to wait outside  in the middle of winter. I don't think that's acceptable - especially when the staff at the front was unapologetic. Most restaurants would give a free appetizer or drinks, or at least apologize for the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Our party of 7 had an excellent meal.  All guests enjoyed their appetizer , meal and desert.

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I'd give it a 3.5 on food and 4.5 on bar ambience. 

We stopped in around 8 on Sunday night. We had the apple and blue cheese salad, fettuccine Alfredo, and pasta with basil cream sauce. We sat at the bar. It's very nice. It was clean, with large tags, not distracting
Or gawdy... The bar area was clean and well taken of. 

The food came out fast and it was all very good. I would return!"}
{"text":"In response to the owner of this formerly wonderful restaurant, you sir have an interesting way of skirting the truth.  By virtue of the way you responded to my nephew ( Sean F. - 5/7/16), yes it was my birthday, you sound like a guilty man.  If it was the case that larger parties are usually concluded after 2.0 hours, don't you think it would have been helpful to let my husband know that information when we made the reservation?  As far as leaving the table to watch the derby, my husband DID tell the young lady when he made the reservation that watching the derby every year is one of our family traditions.  She told my husband that it wouldn't be a problem. It seems like both of those situations could be solved with a little better training.Oh yeah, I wonder who should be doing that? 

The final straw was your contemptible response to me when I asked if you cared that you were ruining my 60th birthday.  You said, \" I DON'T CARE, IT'S MY 70TH & I'M MAKING MONEY.\"  So anyone in Yelpland looking to celebrate a special occasion with special people in your life, don't go to Hoffstots in Oakmont. This guy will kick your family out as he did ours. It doesn't matter how much money you spend, this owner wants more. That goes for you, all potential golf professionals & staff from the U.S Open---don't plan a leisurely meal at Hoffstots, the owner will kick you out & won't care how important the day was for you."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place one more chance and unfortunately was disappointed once again.  The bartender Bobby, seems to not be happy being a bartender.  I asked if they had any happy hour specials and he said (with a straight face) \"it's always happy\".  He proceeded to say, \"what do yinz want?\"  I had to ask for a list of wine and cocktails so I could decide because he didn't bring any drink or specialty drink menus to us.  We got the Polish Mules, much like a Moscow Mule but with Belvedere vodka.  He then proceeded to tell us that he had to charge us for each bottle of ginger beer separately.  So, when the bill came we were charged $7.25 for the vodka then there was an upcharge of $3 for the ginger beer?????  When we went to close our bill, we were charged for another full ginger beer but only a small amount was used.  At that point we asked for the bottle of ginger beer to go since we paid $3 for it anyway.  I really want to like this place but I have had the same experience about 4 or 5 times.  I don't feel welcomed, I feel like an inconvenience to the staff (Bobby) How can anyone want to go back to a place that makes happy hour make you feel awful?"}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to get dinner there on a Friday night.  We had been seeing this place every time we were visiting Oakmont bakery and we always wanted to try it.  The place was packed but luckily we found a spot without a reservation.  The greeting service was polite and nice and we were seated immediately.  The atmosphere of the place was great as well - it had a feeling of a past decade upscale dinner (which I love).  The menu has a lot of things to choose from and everything delicious (including the house sauce brought to us with the bread).  The fillet mignon and the sides coming with it (choice was mash potatoes and beans) was great and the beef sandwich was good too.  We will definetely go back.  One thing I wish it was slightly better is the service.  While it is very polite and helpful they are a bit slow!"}
{"text":"The food here is very traditional, it's like going back in time 40 years.  They are good at what they do, although it's not very hip or up with the times.  I went for the pork chops, very old school, and it came with 2 sides.  My friend had the Pasta Pistachio, which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a day off and had a delicious meal- chicken sandwich with mushroom and pesto. Fries were very good too! Service was awesome and the restaurant was impeccably clean! Love that! Can't wait to try dinner there!"}
{"text":"Must update my previous, mostly negative review...not sure if it was a full moon or just a bad day during our 1st visit but tonight was the polar opposite...fantastic food & service...from apps & salads to seafood, steak & Italian faves it was all top notch!! Glad I gave Hoffstot's another shot!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars, but it's really more like three and a half.   I had the eggplant Parmesan which I use as my barometer of any Italian place.  First of all, it was gigantic...could easily be split.  The sauce was just a little thick, but it was still tasty.  The side of pasta was a little too overdone for my taste.  But all in all, everything was pretty good.

The service was another story.  Our waiter brought our salads and then what seemed like maybe 5 minutes later, he brought the entrees.  There was no room on the table for all this food which was kind of annoying.

We had coffee and dessert.  Carrot cake and tiramisu.   The carrot cake was great.  The tiramisu was only okay.

All in all, it was a pleasant experience.  I think next time I would stop off at the bar for a nightcap.  There seemed to be a lot happening in there.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Good place to enjoy a neighborhood atmosphere if you are from out of town. Food was better than average, yet, our server was less than attentive to our needs. Great \"hustle\" on her part, however, she gave us the impression that she was constantly in the weeds. The place was barely half full so HITP? Price point was a little high for the value, yet, we wouldn't have mined it if our server was friendly and our order was made accurately. Although, I would give it another shot if I were to return to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about this place. For starters, the menu is extensive, includes lots of seafood, chicken, and other healthier choices.

The presentation is very well done.  The chef must have studied somewhere, because the little presentation details on the plate remind me of fine dining in larger cities.

The food itself is very good.  Lots of interesting choices for ingredients.  My dish tonight included a chicken breast with apples, onions, and yams with a maple reduction.  Very good as you might imagine.

Service was prompt, friendly, and continuous. This is a big reason why the place gets 4 stars from me.

Will return for sure if I ever get back to town."}
{"text":"Attending a funeral down the street. My dear friend recommended. His father used to come here and order the Scrod sandwich with a pint of black beer. 

I'm italian and can be very particular when reviewing italian restaurants. This place is  solid. Everything was perfect!

Stuffed Sweet Peppers appetizer, Seafood Linguini  with white sauce, Veal Romano, espresso almond cookies perfect!

Ericka was an excellent server very attentive."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner. Place was near empty. Very good service. I had the veal Marsala. It was excellent. They bring a little bread basket to munch on. Water glass was always filled. I also went for the dessert which was an apple tart type of thing. A little doubt and I wish there were more apples. I ate it all so it was good. They do bring little flat almond cookies with the bill which just pushed my blood sugar into overdrive"}
{"text":"WIll be a while until I return.  8:30 on a Monday evening and we were seated right away, as expected.  It took over 10 minutes for the server to acknowledge us. No water, no place setting...not good.   He offered anything but a sincere apology and made light of his absence.  We gave him our drink orders (bottle of wine and a Bombay martini).  15 minutes later, still no drinks (no not even water).  The waiter WAS busy fussing over a group of about 8 patrons (larger tip, I guess).   We got up and told the host that we had been sitting for 25 minutes with nothing to show for it.  He seemed extremely uninterested, and we walked out.

As far as the menu...we had plenty of time to study it. Not impressed.  We thought that it was quite boring and lacked creativity (for this community).  The brightness of the dining room was suited for patrons over the age of 70.  It was anything but romantic.  Dimmer switches ought to be in-use.

We did walk down the street to the Chelsea Grill (same owners as Hoffstot's).  We had an excellent meal with an excellent server (Steph).

My experiences with Hoffstot's are always that the waitstaff has a rather lofty opinion of themselves. Pittsbugh is a city in which there are many choices for casual to upscale dining.  As a customer, I NEED to feel as though my patronage is valued if I am to return.  I expect fantastic food and will not accept excuses for poor service.

This will be our last visit to Hoffstot's.....EVER ."}
{"text":"Went here recently for a date night. The food was outstanding, the entire wait staff was very attentive and nice. The place was packed, but there was no wait, staff was attentive and the food came out quickly. The variety was great, my hubby is picky and I like to eat something healthy other than salads, and there was something for both of us!!  Very satisfied customers. Definitely will go again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Hoffstots is a good little restaurant nestled in Oakmont, conveniently located right next to the famed Oakmont Bakery!  Hoffstots is our familys go to when we have family in town and need a last minute reservation.  The staff is friendly and accommodating. The bar is always packed with locals watching whatever sporting event is on that night.

I always start with the zucchini, it's amazing! The food is predictably good and the menu offers something for everyone. I had the seafood Monaco, it was good, almost overpriced for the amount of crab meat and shrimp. The presentation left a bit to be desired, but the food was good. I always start with the house salad with their vinegarette and dried blue. Love love love their salad.

In previous visits, I've had the eggplant parm, which was really good and enough for two people. I also recommend the beans and greens!


If you're in the area, stop by and check it out. They also do a great lunch!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat in all of the greater Pittsburgh area. Amazing service, kind owner, lovely atmosphere, and wonderful chefs! 

It's a very quite place with a mostly older crowd on weekdays until around 7pm when the younger crowd picks up. On weekends, it's a constant mix of all ages.

My suggestions:
- Eggplant Parmesan - so good and a huge portion. Very good for sharing! I substitute the standard spaghetti pasta with fettuccine Alfredo.
- Gorgonzola Apple Walnut salad - amazing, best salad
- Beans and Greens - I don't think it's on the menu anymore, though I could be wrong, but it's amazing
- Citrus Tea - literally the best drink you will ever have"}
{"text":"Great option in Oakmont.  Bar with a restaurant that offers upscale food in a relaxed setting at reasonable prices.  I had the mahi mahi.  definitely tasted fresh and prepared very well.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"After a day at the doctors office..on Tuesday ... decided to take my friend to lunch... she suggested Hoffstot's .. since I've never been there I agreed.  I'm just sorry I didn't take a picture of our lunch .   It was so delicious .. I mean unbelievably delicious. She had the breaded eggplant with a cup of soup and I had the pistachio pasta with a salad .  The portions were quite large for lunch. The flavor was spot on !  It was  very delicious.  (I know .. I keep using that word ..delicious) Will definitely come back .  Thanks Hoffstot's for turning our \"hohum\" day  into a delight!"}
{"text":"Excellent service tonight!  Food amazing!  The specials of the evening sounded soooooo good but I went with the Chicken Parm and a side of Penne Alfredo. WOW!!!!  The Alfredo was so light and delicious!  The Chicken Parm was excellent. I love when you go to a restaurant and they are skimpy ok Sauce, etc. wonderful place to have dinner. They give you a sweet treat with your check...sooooo good!  Definitely a must place to go!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Hoffstot's! This place is like a fine wine, it just keeps getting better. Been coming here since I was a kid and it's always a great memory to go back. Chef Leri and his brigade keep doing the classics justice while offering many great specials. Don't miss the Diablo Pork Chops and or the shrimp Monaco!! Great job Chef!"}
{"text":"Not sure if Melissa still works there but she was our waitress and she was quite a hag. We've been coming to Hoffstots for years, and never have we ever received such rude treatment. The food is delicious but not delicious enough to come back because of her actions. When we complained of her attitude the manager said she was \"going through a hard time\" (the manager told us exactly what she was going through but out of respect I will not post that here). Okay understandable, that's rough but we all have our crosses to bear. No matter what ailment I was going through I would never speak to someone's relative so rudely like she spoke to mine."}
{"text":"Generous portions with even better taste,who wouldn't love!? It's been years since I been here but tonight I realized how much I missed it. I strictly remember always getting the tomato basil pasta and that's what I got tonight what a winner! This dinner comes with a soup or salad  and what feels like a pound of pasta.I also had a class of the moscato which was very good! From the moment we stepped in the door we were greeted right away! The man and woman greeting us were very friendly. Our waitress Tricia was spot on! Friendly, helpful and witty! At the end of the dinner Tricia brought us these homemade almond cookie treats, they were phenomenal! Thanks hoffstots and Tricia for a wonderful evening, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it. It was my late grandfather's favorite! The restaurant itself was packed and the decor was nice. I had a caesar salad to start, and it was very good! I got a pasta dish, and honestly it was disgusting. I took a bite or two and then went back to my salad. I would give it another try.. Maybe it was a fluke. We shall see."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to this place in a long time and we decided to stop here for dinner before heading to downtown Pittsburgh for a show. I made reservations a head of time so we were seated right away. Our waitress was excellent great service and my drink was always refilled quickly. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and the Shrimp Monaco for dinner. The calamari was delicious some of the best I ever had! The pieces were big lightly bothered and melted in your mouth. The house made marinara and mustard sauce that accompanied it were superb. 
As for dinner we split the Shrimp Monaco it came with 5 jumbo shrimp with lump crab meat on top. It was just enough for both of us and ended out meal perfectly I will be ordering it again!

Came here again and hit up the early dinner menu tried the Salmon Wellington. It was different but delicious and the price couldn't be beat!"}
{"text":"Now this place is happening, it's got a great atmosphere, great vibe and really good food... I had the pork chops and they were wonderful... Everything here looks great ..."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with great ambience. For appetizer I had the mushroom and shrimp saut√©e not only did it look good it had a nice flavor. For my main course I had the NY strip it was cooked perfectly. I will visit this restaurant again. For dessert I went next door to Oakmont Bakery."}
{"text":"I once had the biggest, most delish, well prepared plate of scallops here! It's what keeps me coming back. The sausage stuffed pepper is a good one too.
At my last visit we had the clam chowder and apple blue cheese salad. It was good but I wanted more! The waitstaff was friendly too. As always, Oakmont is a beautiful place to walk after to work off the calories."}
{"text":"Nice place for dinner and drinks. Good service, good food. Kind of fancy... white cloth over the tables n that whole deal. Pasta pistachio is delish."}
{"text":"Went there for a party last week, favorite meal changed for the worse!  Really bad feeling and sure enough got sick as s dog for the past week.   Probably will not go back, ever!  Shame...staff was excellent, but cooks should be fired!"}
{"text":"I have Celiac Disease which makes it challenging to find something I can eat in a restaurant that I actually enjoy. So I ordered the Coconut Chicken Salad. Instead of panko coconut breaded chicken they made it gluten free with a grilled chicken breast then sprinkled coconut over the salad and it was absolutely delicious. I couldn't be happier with my meal."}
{"text":"Meh. Stopped in on a Wedesday night. Went to bar first. Barry Manilow on juke box, loud mouth Hummer owner at bar, tilapia dinner special. Perfect. One and done.

4/26/16  Don't know if I'll back to HCM as I don't go to Oakmont very often.  Neverthess, props to Dan for watching his social media."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I have had some amazing dishes here- scallops, zucchini, beef. But I have also had some poorly prepared ones- overlooked, undercooked. Etc. pricing for food and drinks is reasonable. Gets very busy on prime nights."}
{"text":"First time at Hoffstots today as we were in Oakmont to order a cake at the bakery. We shared the fried zucchini as an appetizer and both ordered the open faced Reuben sandwich. The zucchini was really good...it's cut in long wedges and battered to a golden crisp served with marinara. The Reuben's were terrible! Hardly any corned beef atop mounds of cold sauerkraut and barely any cheese or thousand island dressing. The rye bread was thin and soggy. The fries that came with the Reuben were very thin, crisp and tasty. Based on the food I would consider giving them another try...but will not return because the service was HORRIBLE! The waitress was named Darla and we only saw her when she took our order and brought the food. She never refilled drinks or asked us if our meals were okay. She was very rude and short with us despite it not being very busy. I never understand when wait staff can are rude, I mean, come on! That's how you make a living and you do a crappy job?"}
{"text":"Came here for an event and YUM YUM! The event served a 3 course meal and all the food was so good! I had a green salad with a delicious dressing (i  just wish i had asked for the dressing on the side because the greens were swamped,) the pasta pistachio - great portion size btw - didn't think I would finish it - but apparently i was super hungry! and the amazing dessert definietly the winner of the meal, a delicious chocolate mousse cup with a peanut butter brittle. One thing I would say is that this place is in dire need of an update. A lot of Pittsburgh places that are classics look like they haven't been touched since the 80's or 90's and this is one of them. The price points of the menu's are pretty reasonable though and the bar is absolultey beautiful with huge windows (in a seperate room than the dining area.) I would def recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Very crowded local's place in Oakmont with an intimate setting if you want to come out for date night -- I recommend making reservations, even during the week night because of this restaurant's popularity with the locals, it fills up quickly during the week AND weekends.  
The Gorgonzola Apple salad was excellent!  The pasta dish with white sauce was excellent!  
Service was excellent!  
Nice restaurant! 
Crowded!  
What would make it a 10:  Tables seem a little too close together with the wait staff and customers coming a little too close at times.  Need a little bit more elbow room. It was winter time and alot of people were carrying their big coats.  
Overall Score: 9 out of 10"}
{"text":"The bread and dipping oil is a great start to a great meal!  My favorites are the ravioli and chicken parm!"}
{"text":"Decided to dine here while waiting for the festivities at the Oakmont Hometown Christmas event to begin tonight.  

It has very nice ambiance, especially as it is decorated for the holidays with a wreath in the window and tasteful red bows distributed thoughout the place and the tables each have white linens on them.

What is slightly disturbing is the age group all around me -- the over-50 crowd (note that includes myself).  I did notice 2 tables of younger people with children, but in each case they had grandparents in tow.  The problem with this scene is I don't want to be in a place that only attracts the older set; I want a place that is appealing to all age groups.  

Regardless, the food was quite good.  I ordered the special recommended by my server, Marie, which was the pork wellington served with a pear and cranberry sauce.  Sounded wonderful and Marie was excited to recommend it.  It was good but the pear and cranberry concoction was barely noticeable.  I also ordered a salad with raspberry vinegarette which was good.  I ordered a glass of Reisling and it came in an ever-so-small glass.  Come on, people -- a grown up glass would have been much better.  And the Reisling wasn't the best I've had for house Reislings.  The price was pretty low so I'd recommend they up the ante and serve a better quality.

Four stars because I really liked the ambiance and it's the first time I've ever had any wellington dish.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed.  I loved the menu options and so we decided to check it out.  But when the food was presented to us, the bread was cold and the eggplant parmesan was sad.  I was served luke warm, dried out , hard eggplant \"disks\" that were covered with sauce.  The cheese it was topped with didn't even pull apart like fresh cheese should.  I can only believe that it was either previously frozen or yesterdays leftovers."}
{"text":"Only giving a 2 star because of the staff or it would be a zero. The food was amateur. Will never return. Had better steak at Outback. Could name3 restaurants in Oakmont superior to this, and way less money"}
{"text":"I am surprised it is only rated 3.5 stars... they had lots of good and original looking dishes with interesting flavor combinations. Service was good and fast. I was torn between giving it a 4 or 5. 

I had the pistachio pasta. Very good, great flavor in a light olive oil sauce.  Much wife got the coconut chicken salad. Lightly battered chicken in panko/coconut mix. Well cooked, very nice looking salad. 

I'll definitely try again..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before but it's been a very long time. I was not impressed. The waitstaff was wonderful, absolutely no complaints there. The food was decent but nowhere near worth what it cost. We had a large party of 12 and they don't split checks.  This is certainly their right but highly inconvenient. It will be another long time before we eat here again."}
{"text":"I love Hoffstot's Caf√© Monaco.  Been going there for more than 20 yrs.  My favorite is the Blackenzola steak.  And I don't mean the petite either.  Seafood dinners are just as delicious."}
{"text":"Went to Hoffstot's cafe to celebrate my birthday. This is the second time I've dined here and it was quite satisfying each time. The prices and portions are very reasonable. I ordered the little piggy pork chop that came with a salad and a side of pistachio pasta. The garlic, tomato, pistachio sauce on the pasta was perfect. The banana peppery grilled flavor on the pork chop tasted great. I think I ordered this both times I went. 
The bread and the oil that comes along with it is fantastic. They should bottle up that sauce and sell it. The seafood pasta had a decent flavor and was loaded with bits of crab, calamari, and clams.. I hunk everyone was satisfied with their meals. The beans and greens made an excellent appetizer as well. This place is a great local spot for a decent meal that will leave you satisfied at reasonable prices. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight & started with a few beers at their rather large bar which has huge windows that look out onto the street. Bartenders were friendly & timely in re-filling drinks. I was surprised to see Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap and they seemed to have a decent selection of other craft taps and bottles too. We partook of their early bird special menu (4-6pm), which has quite a large selection of entrees for $12.99. I had the risotto with scallops & a side salad and my husband had pork medallions & asparagus. Everything was cooked to our liking. We got a free fried zucchini appetizer (regular $8.99) thanks to a short term promotion they were having to \"like\" their Facebook page & free zucchini post. We were too full for dessert. Being a Wednesday the place was not very crowded, but it's large inside & accommodates a lot of people. I doubt we'll be back frequently since we live 40 min away, but if we happen to be in Oakmont we'd definitely stop again."}
{"text":"Today my family chose to dine at Hoffstots Cafe Monaco as we have for many decades. We arrived early for our 7PM reservation for a party of 7 and were seated promptly at 7PM. With this many 7s what could go wrong!?

Service was spot on until the entrees arrived. A well-done Mini Blackenzola filet entree was ordered among other entrees and shortly after the entree was brought to the table we discovered the steak was raw on the inside. By the time the waitress returned to bring it to her attention everyone else finished their meals. We showed the steaks to the waitress who apologized and offered to have the steaks cooked as ordered and boxed to-go - we accepted the offer.

Upon unpacking the to-go containers at home we discovered the steaks were still raw on the inside - clearly just transferred from plate to to-go container and not cooked as promised. We have enjoyed the food, service, and culture from the restaurant for so long to have such an off-putting experience."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here with a party of 25 and it was awful. My meal came out incorrectly twice, substitutions were made on many of our meals without our consent.  This included switching out various nuts when we shared up front that we had a child with us who has a nut allergy at the time of reservation and also multiple times that day."}
{"text":"We generally prefer the bar.  I saw reviews on service but can only share that Bobby and Renae are always on the ball at the bar.  I cant say i ever had a bad meal.  Good place to unwind!  Ate many other places and there is no way it deserves less than 3 stars."}
{"text":"There is something magical that happens on Friday nights around 9:30 PM if you're sitting at the bar at Hoffstot's. Picture this: you're hanging out with your friends, sipping your second glass of sangria (p.s. stay away from anything with mango vodka in it-- it's disgusting) and out comes the bartender with plates and plates full of pizza and hummus and hotdogs. The bartender sets them down on the bar and you're free to dig into whatever carb you desire...without charge! The friends I was with said that they had breakfast apps last time they visited at the magic hour. This is the only way I'll be visiting Hoffstot's from now on."}
{"text":"I  go here a couple of times a month and it's a good italian suburban restaurant with a better than average bar.  The crowds are mostly locals who are friendly.  The service is pretty good with most of the staff professionals and not \"journeyman\".  I wish the menu was a little more creative, but again it's an italian joint in the burbs' aimed towards the baby boomer crowd.  I like the burgers.  They are usually cooked perfectly and the meat seems to be fresh and not frozen (but, I'm not sure).  The fries are pretty good and I like the fresh vegetables.  I've tried a few entrees', but again the menu doesn't really appeal to my tastes with the majority of entrees' being heavy red sauce dishes.  I've had the blackened filet, which is pretty good quality with a nice balsamic reduction.  I've also tried the Shrimp Monoca wich is about 8 nice sized shrimp cooked simply with butter and garlic.  They give you complimentary cookies after dinner which is a nice touch.  The prices are okay, but maybe a touch higher than they should be for a suburban average restaurant."}
{"text":"I must say I am surprised to see any review less than a 5 star. This place it absolutely wonderful I have been eating there my entire life and I mean that my family and I ate there every Sunday since I was 1 year old up until I was 15 and we still go there a good bit. The staff is great and attentive the owners are some of the nicest people around. The food is incredible I have never had a bad meal. My favorite is the chicken sultanboca although it is no longer on the menu it can usually be made. On Sunday's they have wedding soup which it out of this WORLD!!!! For desert they sometimes have these incredible almond cookies. This place is the best after returning from my honeymoon my parents asked where we wanted to eat after we left the airport and it was out 1st choice"}
