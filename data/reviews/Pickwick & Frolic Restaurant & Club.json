{"text":"Love the bar, atmosphere, and the food.  They always have good food and a good selection of beers.  Great place before or after a tribe game"}
{"text":"Wanted to treat my parents for an anniversary dinner. The service was disappointing to say the least. Dirty dishes were left on the table the entire night after appetizers. Even after we stacked the plates to one end. I let the server know we were all sharing entrees. We were never given new utensils or clean sharing plates after using them for the appetizers. I made it known to the staff that we were celebrating an Anniversary and it wasn't acknowledged at all. A manager never checked back on the table."}
{"text":"Geat food! The waitstaff was excellent, ours made a fantastic suggestion for my meal and gave us honest opinion on some of the entree. A good time was had!"}
{"text":"I had a difficult time finding a place with availability so just wandered in to this restaurant with a colleague. The service was wonderful and the menu was perfect! Everything we ordered at our table was delicious! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We sat down at 530 (with reservations) to have a meal before our show at Hilarities at 7pm. The waitress knew that there were 11 ppl in our party and that we had tickets for the 7 pm show. We waited and waited and waited for drinks and food -- ate quickly once it all arrived and we were still signing our checks at 730! The servers and staff should be trained to handle large groups that would like to get to their show on time. We made reservations with plenty of time to dine without rushing --- still didnt happen because the staff was not prepared."}
{"text":"Pickwick & Frolic started the East 4th resurgence. The corridor was abandoned when P&F opened, and since then, the the area has transformed into an arts and entertainment destination in downtown Cleveland. Back to Pickwick, this place is truly visionary. It has imagination, bringing together cabaret, music and comedy without trying to hard or being overly kitschy. The food, drinks and service are unparalleled, and guests have a myriad of entertainment options - from comedy shows to simply enjoying an intimate dinner. Don't leave Cleveland without taking a visit to Pickwick & Frolic!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and service. Options are a great deal and servers are happy to discuss with you. Food is average or a bit better. On a nice night, sitting out in fourth for happy hour is lovely. The atmosphere in bar and champagne room are fun too."}
{"text":"I was with a group last night for Party of 16, reservations at 7. The food took an hour. At around 8:45, a few of my friends got up to go to restroom. We had all paid. I was sitting their with my drink when the male host pushed over 6 glasses onto my table,  mind you people weren't finished and took tables away. I've never in my life had that happen and was absolutely appalled. This was a special occasion. I told the host to stop but he didn't. Completely unacceptable behavior."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Nick the owner!!!  Restaurant was very busy and ran out of several items but made it up by making special dishes for our table. Great food...fresh and clean...not greasy. Will come back again. Had Cesar salad added grilled chicken and a few pizzas. Great time!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Only okay.  First off, not a great idea to have the Comedy Clubbers parading past the diners.  Noisy and distracting....Secondly, our dinners were not as described.  My scallop dinner had exactly FOUR scallops.  One large, 3 medium. Tasty as they were, they in no way could add up to a HALFPOUND, as described in the menu.  And $26 for 4 scallops and rice??????
Hubby's tuscan chicken dish turned out to be a colorful seasoned veggie mound, with, as he put it \"the scrawniest chicken I ever saw\".  
Drinks were overpriced, and c'mon, for a Sunday early dinner?  But what really confounded us were the prices on everything.  I think some places in C-l-e-v-e-l-a-n-d are deluding themselves into thinking they are in New York.  No, break it to ya hard, but this is the Midwest, this is Cleveland, not a top tier city, not even a top tier city in the Midwest.  They need to get real."}
{"text":"The hostess was exceptionally helpful.  Due to traffic, I was 45 minutes late for my reservation, but they worked to accommodate us.  Customer service there is exceptional.

The waiter was attentive and friendly, but did seem very busy.

The restaurant is crowded and you sit quite close to your neighbors, but its tolerable.

The appetizer came out very quickly.  We got the Spinach Artichoke Dip with Pita Chips.  It was tasty.  The entrees took a little longer to come out.  I had the Cedar Planked Salmon with Fingerling Potatoes.  It was also tasty.  My date got the Pasta Marina with Mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms.  After tasting her dish, I commented that I could probably make that same thing at home but better tasting.  

We each had two cocktails.  She had sangria and I had vodka \"iced tea\".  I didn't care for her drink.  It was overly sweet and syrupy.  However, I did like my Raspberry Vodka \"Iced Teas\" that were garnished with a blackberry and a lime.  I didn't even feel like drinking, but I am glad I ordered those.

The menu all fits on one page, but has a lot of variety and caters well to individuals with dietary restrictions.  We were impressed with the selection.

However, the total bill was $90.  In my opinion, the food and the drinks were over-priced.  For a restaurant of its class located on East 4th Street, perhaps it is appropriately priced, but don't expect amazing food.  Expect food that tastes good, nothing more."}
{"text":"I had a Roast & Toast for my mom's 60th birthday. We rented the Cabaret room - it has a stage, lighting, the works. I loved the red chairs - overall a great ambiance. 
We had around 80 guests and many of them said the food was REALLY good. 
Courtney is very knowledgable with party logistics, and Sam, who helped me with audio and video, was SO nice and helpful - he was very patient with me and the production of the evening. 

The room is only blocked off by heavy curtains so you can hear some noise from upstairs and the surrounding rooms,  but I don't think it affected the speeches. 


We had a blast!"}
{"text":"I think P&F is one of the most fun venues in Cleveland.  I love the comfort of the restaurant, and I love the old Hollywood  nostalgic look of  the restaurant. My only issues were that there was no lobster in my lobster bisque, although it was delicious. My soup got cold waiting for warm bread, and my \"medium well\" stake was a bit on the charred side. Plate presentation left something to be desired for a $43 Stake meal with only meat and potatoes on the plate, no salad or any other green vegetable accompanied my meal. My key lime pie dessert was good. I like the portion size, my husband thought it was small. Service was nice and timely.  Had a great time at the comedy show, but the air vents were blowing directly down on me so I left before the show was actually over. Bill Bellamy and his crew were hilarious! Thanks for the laughs!"}
{"text":"Food was ok show was awesome. 2nd time here and I can't wait to come back. Great time"}
{"text":"Owner Nick Kostas has built a wonderful restaurant and comedy club that would be a crown jewel in almost any city. In fact the large comedy club would be the largest pure comedy club that I know of in Chicago or New York City if it were to be located there. The old fashioned way Nick runs his business and his caring for other people are truly special. To be blunt, this institution should be a Cleveland icon and treasure, yet I'm constantly amazed how many Clevelanders I met who had never been there or had never heard of it. Tell Nick that I say hello.

{"text":"First I went here as part of my company's dime.  Comedy Club is nice big acts in the heart of downtown.  East 4th is one of the cooler streets in the midwest.  The bar downstairs serves martinis has a nicely decorated bar but cost a lot.  Upstairs at the restaurant we had a big group so we only had three items to choose from...but the chicken was pretty much a full bbq chicken that was good with garlic mashed potatoes.  If you saw the pork chops you might never eat again.  Not sure of the prices bc I didn't pay but it was good.  This is the only place on 4th without a patio, but I like the mix of the bar and comedy club downstairs and the restaurant upstairs."}
{"text":"Always have a great time. The food and drinks are a good price for a budget.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Last nights show was great! funny guys even the first intro act. I wish I would have remembered their names.  I didn't eat anything but I will definately go again. The seats on the side are ok , but next time I will get seats more center stage (but still far enough from the comedian so he won't pick on me)  I sat on the couch seats which were very comfortable.
Can't wait to go again, and get some food this time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, terrible food. Seriously step it up. For how amazing of a location you have and how many celebrities and important figures visit your restaurant, the food is pathetic. Spend a little more on getting quality ingredients. You're honestly making Cleveland look bad."}
{"text":"We just arrived in downtown Cleveland on Thanksgiving eve. We had no place to eat dinner. The owner of Pickwick and Frolic said they had just served over 300 dinners but we're closing. They took the time to find my son, grandsons and us a place to eat. This is gratitude and what Thanksgiving is all about."}
{"text":"????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????10?????????
?????????????????
???????????"}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times and had fun each time.  The food is great and the theme is fun.  After dinner you can watch the free caberate show.  I like the location downtown although after you leave the little strip that it is on there is not much else to do."}
{"text":"i have been here each time i have ever been in cleveland except once, but had my schedule allowed i would have gone. i have only attended this place for the brunch on sunday though. it was really something. i was very impressed and ive never went home unsatisfied. my only complaint (which isnt much of one) is that they didnt have anything non dairy for my coffee. but nevertheless i will most definitely go back the next time i am visiting."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and had pretty good experiences, but this was not one of those times.  The wait staff was helpful and so polite, but the positives ended there.  My date had the filet mignon and I had the burger, and both came out just covered in salt, ruining both meals, and most of the rest of the night from the effect it had.  Then, mid way through the meal, a bachelorette party had a \"private room\" for karaoke, which is private in the sense that a cloth curtain was the only sound barrier between us and the microphoned attempts at singing just 5 feet from us.  Was impossible to hear at the table, and seems odd they wouldn't give you a heads up before seating you that people will be screaming nearby soon.  For a $100 meal the food and environment really left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We had the burgers tonight.  We requested medium rare and they were very pink in the middle (might be a little to rare for some people).  The burger and fries that came with them tasted great.  However the ginger ale that I ordered tasted very flat.  The service was fairly quick, even though the restaurant was extremely busy."}
{"text":"The Pickwick staff did a great job accommodating a large group at the last minute and splitting the check umpteen different ways, all with a smile. The atmosphere was faded (in a nice way) vintage Hollywood with a lot of carpeting, drapes and low light levels. The noise level was right for conversation.

I don't think this is a place to come for pizza, although there are pizzas on the menu. Go for the more traditional offerings. Portions were generous. My entree included two large bone-in pork chops, very tender, juicy and nicely seasoned. They were served over some of the best flavored and lumpy textured mashed potatoes I've ever had, no exaggeration. The dessert menu was limited; most of us opted for simple scoops of Mitchell's Campfire S'mores ice cream."}
{"text":"i know i'm gonna piss off some people i know and love by saying this, but i'm gonna say it anyways.  why?  because this girl knows how to insert her foot in her mouth.
eww.

gross.  feet. eww.

i do not enjoy the pickwick.

i mean, they have plenty to offer.  there's a austin powers looking martini bar downstairs.  people who want to feel too cool for school spend time here.  
there's a little cabaret room off the martini bar that has, and here's the part where i suck as a human...some of the cheesiest acts i've ever seen.  are they people too old to audition for american idol?  are they has beens who didn't make it to atlantic city or vegas so they ended up at pickwick?  i don't know.  but it's not my style.

i've not had good experiences at the comedy club, either.  each time i've gone, something has gone terribly wrong.  tickets messed up, bad seating, horrible service, you name it.  

upstairs there's a full blown restaurant, but the food wasn't that great for the price.  

don't mean to be debbie downer, but....

people seem to like this place.

i, however, do not."}
{"text":"Decor, service, and ambiance are excellent. They have a ton of vegetarian dishes! Just don't go here if you are on a diet, the dishes are rich. The fried zucchini is awesome. Everything I tried was great. Its a nice idea to have the comedy club downstairs."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Cleveland and the Corner Alley was everything. There were plenty of options but we decided to dine here just because. Our server was very honest and helpful. After several dirty thirties, I can't remember his name :-/  The Buffalo chicken fries were kind of spicy (tasted like Frank's hot sauce) but I loved em. The Margherita pizza was average but the quinoa crusted salmon the bomb.com. I'd love to come back when there's  a comedy show to get the full effect."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once and I've gone for drinks a few times. They have a delicious drink menu, and a wide menu for food. They're a little pricy, but the food is worth it. I've always had great service as well. Great staple for East 4th."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit!

Went here for dinner before seeing a comedy show. 

Service was fairly quick but servers were in no rush which was nice. 

When we ordered drinks, the server had to take one back because she noticed one of the glasses was dirty (had lipstick on it) which is part of the reason for knocking off a star. The other part was watching the servers aimlessly walk table to table trying to find where our food went before finding our table. 

The food: excellent. I had the walleye and it was cooked to absolute perfection. Flavors were amazing and even the potatoes were seasoned well. Drinks with the meal were good and not too weak or too strong. 

Pricing was a bit higher, but the food justifies it. 

Overall ambiance is pleasing but the chairs were a little uncomfortable (felt like I was sinking into them). 

Service: 3.5/5
Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"The menu is pretty limited and I ended up just going with a strip steak that was completely unremarkable. The fries were decent and seasoned well. Margaritas were on special and were good but not great. GF had a sausage sampler that was pretty good but overall not worth $100."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Classy, sophisticated, great steaks, fresh seafood, wood fired pizzas, in-house smoked rotisserie chicken. Whats not to love?"}
{"text":"We went to Pickwick and Frolic on a Tuesday night for the \"Mike Polk Jr. Live\" show. This is a great midweek opportunity to get out for a pretty inexpensive evening, with no games/events in town, parking was cheap and close and the show itself was only $5 per person. In the small cabaret stage theater there is table seating for maybe 75 people, everyone is close to the stage. The show is sort of a comedy sampler/variety show, a good place for local comics to work new material and Mike Polk's game was on. They weren't all gems; one guy was just kind of gross and I don't think anyone knew what to make of \"Cool Ghost\", a comic reminiscent of \"The Unknown Comic\"' you might remember from the early 80s if you are old like me. He wore a sheet over his head and sunglasses, classic \"ghost\" costume...I thought his schtick had potential but the material needs work. Still, nearly all the comics were at least good, two stood out as really good. Mike Polk ended the show with a comedy song that was absolutely hilarious. This show happens occasionally, watch the calendar at Pickwick and Frolic/Hilarities website to see when it comes up again. It's a lot of fun for not much money.

The service was very good and we split a prosciutto, goat cheese and fig pizza that was delicious. Other tables ordered meatballs, bowls of steamed mussels, salads. Sort of a bistro menu, light fare at pretty decent prices. Drinks, food and tip for under
$40."}
{"text":"Good spot. Nice beer & wine selection. Our server Ivy was organized & attentive. We had the pita& spreads and the Cleveland sausage party apps which both were good. Food was promptly served and we had a range of steaks, prime rib as well as the walleye & salmon dishes which definitely were hits."}
{"text":"Food here is below average.  I had the cheese soup and it was watery, thin, and tasteless.  I then tried the Caesar salad which tasted nothing like a Caesar salad.  The margarita pizza only tasted like pure garlic.  The BBQ chicken pizza was pretty good, actually.  It's convenient to dine here because of its location to Hilarities, but next time we will dine somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been here once before....before yelp existed. Things seem to have changed. We had looked forward to a nice dinner all day, but things didn't work out well that day. Thought we would still go - but maybe eat a touch lighter. There are almost no sandwiches. They offer a burger and what they call a steak sandwich. The steak sandwich was $25 - nothing in here is much under $30. I don't mind paying for great food and decent quantities. Sadly, what they sent to my table were a cup of fries (they were outstanding!), and '2' steak sliders. About 3-4ozs of steak maybe, on a chibatta bun of sorts. The steak tasted like it had been doused in lighter fluid and charcoaled, exc the lighter fluid taste remained. My wife got the first bite and spit it out as it gagged her. She refused and sent it back. The manager arrived shortly and apologized. Everyone was very, very nice. But between prices, portions and quality from visits years apart - The best I could offer would be 2 1/2 stars. $25 for a steak sandwich 
is insane.......especially one that could not be eaten. I truly wish this review could be better!"}
{"text":"Pickwick & Frolic (Hilarities, really) you failed me during my last visit to your establishment.

You also somehow scammed what seemed to be a TON of people out of decent seating to the Jim Breuer show because you somehow let tickets be double sold on your website. Then when we got there even though we purchased the tickets WEEKS in advance we were told the people who purchased them after us would be getting those seats instead of us and that it's \"not our fault and not your fault\" - what?? You guys left the link up on your site to the old ticket selling company and then somehow didn't have access to the tickets they sold AND didn't tell them to refund anyone's money even though you resold the tickets? Absolute ridiculousness.

Also unfortunate was the fact that we talked to the owner about it and still were not offered a refund or even a free drink! After we expressed our disappointment with the replacement seats, the floor manager said he would come check on us. We never saw the man after that. 

However, what we did see was an older couple with the same issue throwing a massive fit, drawing a lot of attention, who were then upgraded to a loge. Seriously? All I had to do was cause a scene and I could get a sweet upgrade? Psh. Too bad we were a bit too classy for that.

While I'm grateful that we were able to see the show at all - I'm disappointed at the lack of customer service finesse your employees exhibited. Just an all around fail.

But. We will be back again, we can't help it. Gluttons for punishment maybe? Ha."}
{"text":"Ayyy comedy clubs are my kryptonite, no surprise that I would be reviewing this place since I've been here quite a few times! Their comedy shows are actually pretty good. The openers are what I would say \"ok\" but usually the main comedian makes me more than just giggle which is usually what comedians get from me. Also a little tip- if you sign up for their emails/phone notifications, sometimes they call with free tickets! And we all know how we feel about this F word. 

I can't vouch or say much about full on dinners because I've never actually eaten here. But their appetizers and pizza we got during the show was pretty standard. Drinks were good too. Clean inside, the set up is nice and I feel like even when you get \"bad seats\" you can still have a pretty good view. It's just a great place to go out with friends and get out of the house-especially during Cleveland's brutal winters."}
{"text":"I was in awe while walking down 4th Street on a Saturday night; between the lights, brick street, and the beautiful atmosphere, my friend and I hoped to eat somewhere outside. Since the only restaurant that had any open tables on the patio was Pickwick, we decided to snag a table there. The menu was not what I had expected, but I decided on the cauliflower pasta. I was quite shocked when my plate arrived. The noodles were drenched in a soup like sauce to the point where you couldn't see the pasta. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that watered down or if it was supposed to be like that, but it was rather upsetting and hard to eat."}
{"text":"We stopped in last Friday night for a quick drink, ended up getting an appetizer..and a pizza.  The artichoke dip was slightly above average and the pizza was excellent.  The wood burning oven really does wonders for the crust and the flavor of the pie.  We had the American Bistro with pepperoni, sausage, banana peppers, and red sauce..the banana peppers really made the pizza with a nice sweet finish.  Such a coincidence that the bartender is from a city now too far away from us...and he definitely mixes a great martini."}
{"text":"Verdict: The Comedy Club - Great, The Restaurant - Sucky.

The comedy club is large and well-styled, service is attentive.  Not a big fan of the food offerings but more on that shortly.  My butt gets sore though during some longer acts due to the comfort of the seats (or lack thereof).

The restaurant-I can do without.  The service was bad, took forever, server didn't listen to orders.  The food and drink were bad.  Ordered a Cabernet that had a delicate bouquet of stank.  The salmon was tough and tasted fishy and was complimented with hash browns.  Literally hash browns.  How lazy are these guys?  My mushroom pasta was good though.  

Kevin's Martini Bar is... convenient?  I'm still a little confused by the white and red decor but if you don't want to walk upstairs you can get an above-average priced, average beverage there.

Go for the show, go somewhere else for the food."}
{"text":"Went with a large party for a pre wedding event. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large party which was awesome. There were some pros and cons here.

The good:
Accommodated a large party
Cool ambiance


The not so good:
I asked for my steak medium and it was rare
Service was slow

I had the filet which was good (after it was redone to be medium). The appetizers were pretty good including the shrimp and the stuffed hot peppers (which yes, are very hot).  With my steak I got asparagus which was good. My niece had some sort of potato cake side and neither of us loved them."}
{"text":"After being to Pickwick & Frolic a few times for drinks & for a few events, I assumed the food would have been amazing, especially considering the prices. After ordering the buffalo chicken flatbread and the calamari. My boyfriend & I were not impressed. The pizza looked as if it came out of a Chuckee Cheese, the toppings were only covering a 2 inch diameter of the middle of the pizza, while the rest of the pizza remained uncovered with toppings. It looked as if someone just dropped the toppings right in the middle and did not spread them out at all. After removing one piece, we found the kitchen ticket under the rest of the pizza, very unappetizing. Calamari was average, the sauce was very good. My white sangria was the best part of the dinner."}
{"text":"Came to this establishment for the RNC. My mom wanted and lemonade and she asked the bartender if they had any. So the bartender left and came back with a lemonade. About 20mins later she wanted another lemonade because I was getting another beer. So I asked the bartender and she said go ask the other bar around other side. So I went to ask and she said they didn't have it at that bar so go to the other one on the other side of the wall. Came around the corner and found the soda fountain machine and I was tired of the run around. So I went to get it myself and was then reprimanded for doing that. I was being told you don't serve that but you have it. You should always accommodate your guests. Never ever going back."}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner at Pickwick and Frolic. Good service. Very nicely put together wedge salad with a delicious dressing. I had the 10pz strip steak which was very good. Tender, flavorful, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The accompanying fries were a nice salty side dish. Recommended"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. I wouldn't normally think of coming here for the food because it's a comedy club. That is a mistake for anyone because the food is phenomenal. The service and drinks are fantastic also. This place is so underrated and better then most of the more well known places on 4th street. Well done!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here after a late night Indians game because they had patio availability. Started off with the BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp, $16 for 5 small shrimp, wrapped in a thin sliver of bacon, and was served so piping hot the roof of my mouth is still recovering a day later, clearly this was served out of a microwave. We split our main dish, vegan spaghetti and meatballs. I'm not a picky eater, but I had to set my half aside, it smelled of death. The best part of the meal was my $7 side of fries. Hopefully someday I'll try them out again so I can raise my review, perhaps happy hour will be better. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"So, you're looking for a complete night out, a place that is not only swanky, but is also entertaining? 

Look no further than 4th Street near the heart of downtown, and Pickwick and Frolic! 
Pickwick is not only a restaurant with fine food and drink, but it is also home to several entertainment venues, including Hilarities 4th Street Cleveland Theater, said, by many comics, to be one of THE best comedy venues in the country, but there are also several smaller theaters down below the main restaurant that are home to burlesque theater, murder mystery shows and other special events. 

The food is good, not only up top in the restaurant in my opinion, but also down in lower section held by Hilarities (they have two different menus, but both can cross over from up to downstairs.) I can say I've never had a bad meal there, and they have items for a variety of tastes. 

My wife and I have gone to multiple shows there and seen comedians both local and national and the service from the staff is EXCELLENT. Mr. Kostis does a great job of creating a warm atmosphere where you can laugh, eat and relax and just enjoy the evening. Also, just a hint, but if you park a the garage at the corner behind Potbelly, they do validate parking at the Pickwick bar and they are MUCH less expensive:) 

Another thing; when you go downstairs to Hilarities, make sure you fill out the comment cards because not only will it put you on a mailing list, but you have chances for FREE TICKETS to multiple shows when they contact you. Free stuff is always a good thing these days, eh?

So, if you need a place for an evening out and need to frolic, try Pickwick and Frolic and get a meal and laugh:)"}
{"text":"We have come several times for comedy shows. First time checkout the other offerings. We tried out the burlesque show this evening. The show was great, drinks a bit overpriced but yummy, the seating has a small problem as its not tiered. I had to sit on my knees to see the show. Also there are always 4 people to a table so if you are a couple you will be with another couple. Kinda uncomfortable. 
Over all I recommend the show just ask for up front seating!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A JOKE.  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY....
I recently had a very disappointing evening at this establishment.  It seems for a Comedy Club the management was a little overzealous.  Several times staff told people to be quiet or flat out kicked people out of the club.  Our group decided to leave the show early as we were all a little disappointed in what seemed to be a management power trip.  
I understand that there needs to be some order in that setting, but it seemed that they were more concerned about the quality of their taping then they were the customers supporting the establishment.  
I also realize that about 70% of the people there got in as \"winners\" of free tickets and maybe that is not the best recipe for securing the crowds Pickwick desires.  Let's face it.......under the current business model they pack the place with people that would not be there otherwise other than having a free ticket.  Then Pickwick makes money based on the sales of F&B.  When the crowd gets to be what staff believes \"loud\" they walk around hushing everyone or kicking them out.  
I am very disappointed about what transpired.  When we left there were groups of people really upset and making it known they would never come back.  I was embarrassed to have suggested the evening to my friends and colleagues, and do not think I will ever return on my own, nor recommend Pickwick."}
{"text":"Solid steak, salad and Pinot at the bar along East 4th Street that stands as the culinary highlight to my brief (thank God) visit."}
{"text":"Bad waiter. Mediocre food. Over priced. 

We had the lobster bisque to start and Scampi entree. Both were eh :( 

We had to ask for bread and our sever was not helpful or knowledgable about the menu. 

The cocktails were good. Honey Bee and a ruby red mule."}
{"text":"I love this place almost as much as Hilarities. They have upped the ante with their new beer offerings. About time. I was very happy with the selection, and there were quite a few local breweries represented. Yay!

Menu is constantly updated, which is nice. Food quality is good. Very attractive presentation. Very good, attentive service."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my all time favorites! Among 20 - 30 visits I've yet to be disappointed with a meal or an experience. It's a big place and I'll never know how Nick the owner makes his rounds to what seems like every single customer. You will not regret going there. AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"We've been to Pickwick & Frolic a few times.  Once to see one of their \"murder mystery\" dinner shows and a couple of times for dinner.  The dining area is large and the decor is fun.  They have a large menu with something for everyone.  Our last visit, on a busy Friday night, was just okay.  We sat for quite some time before the waiter came to the table.  Then it took about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive and another 30 minutes or so for our food to arrive.  Yes it was busy but the waiter should have checked in with us and let us know what was going on.  Our food was good and there was a live band playing during happy hour so we had a good time even with the problem with the service."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced for its quality. Environment and service was acceptable. First and most likely last time there."}
{"text":"Still an awesome stop in awesome E. 4th. Pickwick is a spacious and swanky bar and restaurant with Prohibition era decor. As if the main section isn't fun enough, Pickwick also boasts a comedy club -- Hilarities -- a cabaret, an ultramodern martini bar, and a new champagne bar (complete with flowing fountains).

 Overall, this complex has a bit of a Las Vegas vibe to it. All of the food is slow-cooked in a large stone oven.

Grade: A"}
{"text":"Went for thanksgiving buffet. Our server was very polite, friendly, and attentive. The food was maybe as good as Hometown Buffet. I don't mean to say the food was bad. But l can't say it was good. It just was not what I expected. After reading the other reviews I don't believe I would return or recommend.6"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, once for dinner and drinks, and once for drinks only.  Never watched one of the shows.  Pickwick seems pretty average/standard for a bar.  Decent wine list and beers and the patio seating on East 4th is nice on a non-crowded night."}
{"text":"Food was great and nicely priced. Waiter/bar tender was a little slow. I'm very picky. Over really good. Steak was done to my perfection"}
{"text":"Stopped in during our first night in town , it was rather busy being that the Indians were playing , but we were seated quickly . We ordered the sausage platter and a pizza , to say the pizza was the best of the two.  The outdoor seating was nice and our server was efficient. It was a good quick bite but I'm sure there is much better ."}
{"text":"The restaurant food is delicious and the alcoholic beverages are high. We've eaten the best steaks in Cleveland here. We've been members since 2009. The restaurant manager and the owner decided to add our suggestion to the menu \"Lobster bisque\" and is devine.
Hilarities is 1 of the nicest comedy showrooms. The ticket agents are good. We would prefer if they raised the house lights so we can read our guest check."}
{"text":"Normally I usually have a great experience here.  But last night I had a horrible experience last night.  My server was the worst I had there .  But here is the thing, a few months ago I had this server and she was ok.  I figure she was new, because I did not seen her before.  So when I saw that she was my server, I figured she improved but I was wrong.  She went to every other table except ours to take food orders.  I had to find a manager so I can place an order.  Then it took 25 minutes for a order of chicken fingers??? The only reason she checked on us is because I waved her down.  Then she was annoyed when it came time to pay and we told her which items were to be charged on which cards.  As a ex server I also try to give the benefit of the doubt and usually leave a tip.  But after my service I received last night , I did not leave a tip.  I will go back to enjoy a night out, but if I see that this person is my server, I will ask to be move to another section!"}
{"text":"I went just for dinner and found it to be OK.  Had the Texas sirloin dish and it was cooked medium rare just as ordered--a challenge with the shape of the piece that I got.  The fries were less of a hit.  The portion was generous but they seemed a bit heavy and had an almost orange to them.  Not sure why \"hand cut\" makes any difference but they must feel it has some marketing impact.  I suspect they're not fried twice but that's just speculation on my part.

I started with the lobster bisque that quite good and a pretty hefty quantity to boot.

I would certainly go back again in the future."}
{"text":"Went for a few laughs. Been there many times before. But never got kicked out. Sam made his insecurities as a bouncer very clear by bullying our party out of the venue. We laughed. Not even loud enough for the comedian to hear but too loud for lil Sammy. If he's gone when I go again I'll up my star rating."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, great selection.  But the service IS SO SLOW.  Forget about quick lunches here...."}
{"text":"This review is two stars because it includes impression of bar. The Comedy club took away from what would have been 4 stars. This review duplicated under the comedy club only as one star.

We attended the comedy club.;  

The club was clean and the seating process was organized and pleasant.
The comedy show was really good. For 30.00 we got 3 comedians and they were all funny.

Now for the bad. Not even keeping in mind that the club is INSIDE a restaurant (because that makes this even worse). the food was absolutely inedible.

We already had dinner at Brasa; it was GOING to be Pickwick and boy did I dodge a bomb on that one.

So just to have something to munch on I order the fruit and cheese plate.  Served in a hamburger plastic boat I get some 'fruit' and 'cheese'. ALL of it is at or above room temperature rather than nicely chilled, beading with ice cold water droplets.

I had about 10 warm grapes. They were all a combination of varied degrees of green and brown, all of which was mushy or well on the way to mushy.

Two warm strawberries that actually looked good but very warm???

A few blueberries, again soft, discolored and warm.

The cheese was warm as well, which is scary. The top slices were shinny as if they had been sitting out; obvious by the WARM aspect.


I brought this to the waitresses attention. She said it all looked like this and all was warm. I am thinking why did you sell it to me? Was this a case of.... . Let's see if HE will eat it??? For that price??? For ANY price?

So I exchange for veg plate. A few pieces of celery, carrot, broccoli. Again a 9000% markup which I guess we are supposed to just expect in a venue like this. And warm. Slightly cool to touch but not cold, not properly refrigerated; not even close.  The plus side is that the vegetables were reasonably fresh. Proper color and crunchy so we kept it.

In closing I go to a lot of comedy events, and live shows and the season is upon us now. Will I be back?? Maybe.. If someone is there that I MUST see I will go back otherwise I will avoid.

This would have been embarrassing even with a club having an appetizer kitchen. This is a full blown two level restaurant.

Not to mention this was a first date LOL.  

Come on guys you can do so much better. These two dishes require -1 on the skill level. Nature did ALL the work for you and it was still a mess. All you have to do is keep these items well chilled; place on a plate when ordered, THAT IS IT!."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for one night, and we got a great table outside to people watch. It was especially exciting because Young Jeezy was playing nearby and the fans were out in true form! To start, our service was very good! I had a few local beers, and we ordered the 4 bread and spreads that included homemade spreads as well as hummus and bread, which was delicious. My gf had a pizza and she loved it, and I had a few different appetizers and a salad and they were all tasty! Don't miss the duck sliders; I had never had anything like them before, and they were tasty. Try and get an outdoor table!"}
{"text":"This is a really great restaurant situated on a nice pedestrian only street right in the heart of Cleveland. The food was delicious and the portions were huge. I had the prime rib and my husband had the shrimp and chorizo pasta. Both were tasty. The service is friendly and the inside of the restaurant also has a cabaret, comedy club and champagne bar all located below street level. The atmosphere is really nice. Very happy we stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"Both service and food are a total fail...who puts a goopy Demi Glacé on a $45 Ribeye steak or on Prime Rib for that matter?? I'll tell you who...this place! The reason is due to the low quality, poorly cooked beef they are up-charging you on that tastes like it was cooked on a sterno-stove...but trust me P&F...nothing you put on this food will ever make it edible. Just walk past the kitchen on your way to the bathrooms...you can see the sterno-bums who are cooking your dinner. Total bill for two steaks and drinks (no dessert) $170.00! See the shows, but definitely skip dinner!"}
{"text":"Most of us tried their prime rib special and enjoyed it quite a bit. Service was friendly and the other food we tried was good as well. Decent beer selection makes this a good choice to eat at any time."}
{"text":"Food was way beyond my expectations! Service was great. The staff was super super friendly. I really enjoyed the cajun pasta. Sooooo good. I went back the next night and had the rotisserie chicken. It was juicy and delicious. I cant rave enough about this place. I then went and saw a comedy show and it was phenomenal. So funny! Eat before the show because you cant laugh and eat at the same time. Run don't walk to this establishment."}
{"text":"So I ordered up a Grand Marnier after a recent Cavs playoff game.  I had finished the drink only to discover that there was lipstick on my glass and I guarantee I don't use lipstick and my wife didn't have lipstick on either I told the barmaid and she just laughed it off.  She should have compensated and either given me another drink or taken it off my bill."}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing! Great portion sizes. Great atmosphere. Great service. My fav is the salmon. The pizza is great too."}
{"text":"First visit to this place after years of literally sitting across from it and wondering what was up with it.  Assumed it was a late night/weekend joint..it's not.  Good comedy, during the week, and happy some impromptu dining mates invited me to join them as they had an extra ticket.  Won't be my last time here. 

Food offerings looked pretty good too."}
{"text":"I thought this place was incredibly overpriced and overrated.  I like the decor and the service was good-that is the only good things I can say about this place.  Five of us went to dinner and everybody was not pleased with their meal.  I got the filet- it was a perfect medium which I had ordered but the flavor was terrible.  It has a smoky flavor but not in a good way.  The serving size was very small.  The potatoes were dry and flavorless. For a $30 entree I do not like to leave starving."}
{"text":"We visited this place a couple times during our annual St. Patrick's day weekend. The place was absolutely amazing and the service outstanding. We met the owner Nick and manager Rick who spent time talking with all of us as we were from out of the area. Servers were very attentive, especially Chris who kept up with the busy crowd on St. Patrick's Day. I highly recommend this place!! If you get a chance check out the comedy club as well. There were 8 of us and all agreed that we had never seen a better line up of comedians and we actually hurt when we left from laughing so hard!! Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom, her co-worker and one of their clients before a Cavs game recently.  I really liked the ambiance of the place; it had a good after-work vibe going on.  I had the cedar planked salmon which I thought was very good. It paired very well with the sauteed red onion and fennel beneath. The fingerling potatoes were cooked perfectly and were great with the salmon. I had a glass of the Malbec wine and was very satisfied with my choice. This place is fairly pricey, but I thought it was worth it for the quality of what I got. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"The comedy club is great, like David said in his review, it would be considered a top comedy club in any of the large cities like Chicago or New York.  The food and atmosphere are also top notch."}
{"text":"The best rotisserie chicken I've had in a while! You must try their Sangrias too! Service was great. Front desk had a 40 minute wait, somehow we got a table within 8 minutes! No complaints here :)"}
{"text":"We just enjoyed 4 awesome meals!!  Great pizza, salmon, scallops, and steak.    Service was impeccable!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Visited on 1/31/2015 late in the evening as part of a birthday weekend trip to visit the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame & Museum. Food and service were excellent. We were blown away!

For starters, we ordered a pizza. Being from central NJ, I don't expect great pizza in other areas of the country, but it was very good! Right on par with some of the better pizza restaurants in my area.

Our server was Jarret. He was extremely courteous and professional. It turned out he and I had some things in common and we had a nice conversation (being it was late Sunday evening and not extremely busy). We were curious about the establishment and he brought the manager over to our table (unfortunately I cannot remember his name) and while we waited for our main course, he actually took the time to give us the grand tour! From the stone pizza ovens to the comedy club, burlesque club, and downstairs lounge. He was also very knowledgeable of the history of the restaurant.

When we got back to our table, the food came out shortly after. I had a NY strip steak which was excellent - cooked to perfection with the nice grill marks, flavorful, tender, but not overstated. The side items were very good as well. We had eaten at a fine dining steakhouse the night before, but I actually liked this steak better and it was not as pricey. Not the cheapest place in town either, but well worth it.

Bottom line - food and drinks were excellent, pizza was a pleasant surprise, and the service and interaction we received from Jarret and the manager on duty really made our night. They made us feel extremely welcome, like we were old friends. It's rare to receive that kind of service and attention. We really appreciated it and will certainly eat here again when visiting Cleveland. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'll start out with this: I'm only reviewing the restaurant here -- the comedy club is a separate entity in my mind, even if it isn't *really* one in reality. I adore Hilarities. Pickwick & Frolic: Eh, s'ok. I've eaten here twice, and I don't really plan to ever eat here again, unless someone else is paying and everything else on 4th St is too packed. 

The food is decent. Not great, but decent. The main issue I have with it is the price for what you get. $25 for the steak sandwich - with fries with a salad. The salad is just sadness - iceberg lettuce from a bag, some grape tomatoes and cucumber slices, and a smattering of julienne carrots that I'm pretty sure came in a bag too. The same kind of house salad you get at a mom & pop 24h diner, where your entire check for a party of 2 will come to less than the price of one entree here. The fries are entirely unremarkable and kind of blah. The steak is tasty, but it's a small portion for $25, especially when the side and salad are so cheaply done. 

To be fair, I've only ever had that and the burger (I've had burgers as good, or better, for half the $14 price tag) -- it's entirely possible that the other entrees are killer, but I'm not tempted to spend the money to find out. 

 The service has always been acceptable, but not so great that it makes me feel better about having to tip more than I think the food is worth, just based on the percentages. 

The atmosphere kind of stinks. Both times I've eaten here have been because I've been there for a show - but even though I was one of the folks there for the show, I find it really irritating that all the people coming in for the show have to go through the restaurant to get there - or stand and wait in line next to a table if it's a big show. Nothing screams uncomfortable like trying to enjoy your overpriced food while people are just standing next to your table. 

If you're just out for dinner - there are far better restaurants on 4th to hit. If you're there for a show, either hit one of the better spots for dinner first, or just wait and pick up some of the much more reasonably priced bar snacks at the show."}
{"text":"No bread? Never offered bread? Never received any bread at all even after asking....at first we were told 'you had to ask for it- it's not given out because people have gluten allergies\" REALLY??? That's a good one! Then we were told there was no bread ready, it was in the oven. Saturday night at 6:00 right before the 7 pm show. Prime dinner hour! Snarky waitress never offered apology just kept faulting the kitchen. All I ordered was the soup for dinner- didn't come with even a cracker either!!"}
{"text":"Folks if you get the opportunity to come here ima thinking you won't be disappointed,Our stand up was Matt Braunger and good stuff is all I can speakage!! And the service was TOPS!!!! them folks deserve a raise...Food,drinks,laughter and great service deserves a \"BAM\"GETCHA SUM!!!"}
{"text":"The maddening thing about Pickwick & Frolic restaurant is you just don't know what you're going to get each visit. Sometimes it's just great, sitting in that cool dining room and being served delicious hearty food by an attentive staff. Then you go back and get disappointed -sometimes by the little things. That's what happened just recently. OK, it was a weekday and we were eating outside. I ordered the fish and paid extra for a side salad. It was not good-the lettuce was slightly wilted, brown on some edges and completely plain-jane. You don't charge people 3 bucks extra for a salad that you pull out of bag and slap on a small plate. The plank salmon? actually very good, but hey people, its the little things that make greatness."}
{"text":"I've been here for corporate events, never for personal events.  Food and service has been OK.  Food is well prepared.  Not a big fan of prime rib, but seems good here.  Bar service is nice.  Theatre is well laid out and comfortable.  Shares valet parking with the other E 4th street venues.  Might consider a return trip."}
{"text":"When my party and I arrived on a Monday evening we basically had the place to ourselves with maybe the exception of one other table. Yet we could not understand why it took more than 30 minutes to get our food. By this time a couple of other parties had  arrived and had their food before us. I ordered the prime rib medium rare which came out perfect. The mashed potatoes and asparagus was fine but this place is still quite overpriced. Even though the staff was nice, I can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"The WORST comedy club experience EVER!  We go there for a friends birthday, based on my experience there with corporate clients.  We get stuffed in a corner when we walk in, and we had \"Premium Tickets\".  There was a huge pole between my seats & the stage. Poor service, poor food, & flat beer."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place.  I went on a double with my boyfriend and my friends for a Comedy night with comedian Tom Papa.  I was shocked at how funny I found the 1st comedian and Tom Papa.  It says a lot about the atmosphere and place when big time comedians come and can wow the crowd.  We got a pitcher of Margaritas, which is well worth it if you are ready to drink and have a good time with friends.   The service was quick and efficient and I was really happy with how many times the waitress came back to check on us.   The only thing I didn't like is that there is absolutely no cell phone service :( 

The room was spacious and had tables closer to the stage.  Sit near the front if you want to be picked on!  I would definitely recommend this place for the atmosphere and laughs.  This place is a hidden gem hidden under a great bar-which validates parking, a huge plus in downtown Cleveland.  

If you are looking for a place that has great atmosphere, drinks, and comedy that will put you in a great mood.  This is a great place for you to try!"}
{"text":"The worst experience I've had in a long time. Based on the fact that this place was directly across the street from my favorite place in town, I was surprised it was so freaking terrible. Food came out sporadically. One dish in our group of 6 before the drinks even. Then we waited around for the salad that one person ordered for 45 minutes. A full chicken Cesar was ordered and he got lettuce in a bowl with 2 slices of cucumber. That's not what he ordered. There was also a hair found in the water. We ordered steaks and got no steak knives. Then on top of all that the waiter gave us an attitude. After ordering a $40 steak all they did with this god awful experience was give us our cocktails for free. It was horrendous. I would avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Great for date night or girls' night! So much fun. Awesome food, yummy drinks, fun shows and excellent service. Cleveland is lucky to have a place like this!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The prime rib is fantastic-they use a rub rather than the traditional au jus. The music is also wonderful giving the restaurant a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't say much for the comedy club as I was only there for dinner, but the double pork chop I had was quite, quite good - perfectly cooked, tricky to do with a 2\" thick bone-in chop especially since so many people are squeamish about pork being even a tad pink.  Decor was upscale but not trying too hard, though the assortment behind the bar looked sparse - maybe they had everything back there, but the way bottles were arranged made it look like the world was slowly running out of liquor.  

I would have given the place 4 stars, but...

I ordered my usual, gin martini with 3 olives, up.  Martini arrives, no olives.  What the h?  My coworked and I order the baked brie appetizer... no bread comes with it.  I ask our waiter for bread... he brings dinner rolls.  Maybe I misread the menu, but... seriously?  Brie without crusty baguette?  That's half the point of ordering it!"}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant only, where I've gone to a number of times and have never been disappointed. Is it the best food in downtown Cleveland? Probably not. Is it a delicious, less snooty yet still nice spot for dinner and drinks? Absolutely.

Perfect for a date or group outing as the tables are far enough apart to actually hear your dining companions talk. A sophisticated atmosphere to make it feel like an adult outing only place, but not so stuffy that you feel the need to order 4 courses. In fact, I've never actually ordered an entree and the waitstaff has never made me feel bad for doing so. Service is always on point - the wait staff know the drink and dinner menu well and have always tried that nights specials at the very least. They are attentive without being overbearing and always refill drinks at the right time (something I deem an important marker of a good waitress!)

Now on to the food! I almost always order the same grub (the mussels and a wood stone pizza) to split with my man because it's the perfect amount for sharing and keeps the bill low enough to order an extra round of drinks!! The mussels are always perfectly cooked and the charred tomato and white wine sauce is addicting, just the right amount of tang and spice - almost reminds me of a romesco sauce though I know the ingredients aren't the same. Save the mussel sauce for dipping your pizza crust in - your taste buds will sing for joy! As for the pizzas - cooked on a wood stone in their brick oven and the thin crust is perfection, just the right amount of crunch to chewy ratio. I usually go for the roasted mushroom pizza because the tallegio cheese and garlic oil combination is perfect with the mushrooms. They brush the crust with a little of the garlic oil as well, which makes it extra perfect for dunking in the mussel sauce...it all comes full circle!

Other menu items I've tried: American bistro pizza (pepperoni, sausage, banana pepper), hand-cut fries (I prefer a thinner fry but these are cooked and seasoned well and I'd recommend getting two herb aioli dippers rather than ketchup), lobster bisque (tasty but was served lukewarm), and one of my hubby's favorites, the classic wedge - essentially just delicious toppings (bacon, blue cheese, egg, candied pecans) over a hunk of iceberg yum!

Good, seasonal draft menu. Good martinis and usually a different cocktails special each month. I don't know much about wine pairing, but I've always found something that tastes nice with my meal. The other perk of this place is that busy hours are just before shows so it's very possible to show up at 730/8 on a Saturday night, without reservations, and get seated right away because the crowd just went in to the show."}
{"text":"A lot of the reason why I am giving this restaurant 4 stars instead of 3 is because the ambiance here is amazing!! The cabaret venue, the comedy club, the many bars, and general restaurant area are gorgeous. Pickwick & Frolic is worth visiting just for all of that.

About the food & drinks:

First, I ordered the Foxtrot Cabernet Sauvignon and it was great! Very smooth, but pricey. 
As an appetizer, I ordered the mozzarella sticks. They were not too greasy, like most mozzarella sticks are, so that was really refreshing. For my entree, I ordered the margherita pizza. The pizza was cooked just right, so the crust was just crispy, but not hard; however, the pizza was a little too dry for my taste and there were not enough tomatoes on the pizza. Overall, not bad, though.

I ordered all this food at the comedy club, Hilarities, and the laughs made all of the \"pretty good\" food even better!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Our server was very friendly and the menu had a lot of options. Our food came within 10-15 minutes of offering it. I'd come back during my next visit to Cleveland"}
{"text":"The BEST steak sandwich I ever ever had!  Awesome wine and great service.  James is the best"}
{"text":"Great service, but both my dishes were terrible. Don't get the salmon or the vegan spaghetti and \"meat\" balls. Both terrible!!"}
{"text":"Would have loved to be able to hit this place up on a non-event night. We had a sponsored event here featuring Kevin Smith. The place was super cool looking on the inside - very stylish and felt like a club. The food was ok. I've had better but you don't go to the comedy club for the food right? This place would be pretty trippy looking if i was wasted though..."}
{"text":"I recently attended a conference in Cleveland where we had our welcoming dinner at Pickwick & Frolic. Huge place, our group was in the lower level seated at a variety of tables where we enjoyed a mixed greens salad. We went to a nearby room for our main dish, chicken, fish and pasta. All were presented well and flavorful. In the same room was a plate of chocolate desserts, the only dessert is chocolate in my opinion. Our wait staff was very friendly, accommodating to special needs. Good option for a smaller conference group dinner in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was kicked out of a show for laughing. I was then stepped in the face by a security guard."}
{"text":"On my first night ever being in Cleveland I was excited to go try some good food. There was a group of about 10 of us walking from the Westin hotel to the 4th street area. The \"street\" which has been made into walking only was packed with people on a tuesday night. I figured any restaurant we walk into would be good.

We decided on Pickwick & Frolic. Out on the sidewalk was a hostess podium where we waited to get our seating. It took about 15 minutes before a staff member seated us. Keep in mind its extremely busy in the street. We walk in to find the place nearly empty. Maybe 6 other people eating at the time. So we sit, it takes a long time to get our drink orders. After about 20 minutes we finally get to order. I was sitting at a table of 4. 3  of my group ordered pizzas. When inquiring about the size of a pizza our waiter said and gestured to about a 9 inch pie. The pizzas came out and were in fact about the size of a regular large pizza. I ordered The salmon. When it came out it had an ok appearance and smelled pretty good. I took a bite of the fish and it was alright but nothing special. It was laid on a bed of spinach and a few root vegetables. The spinach was seasoned with garlic and a few other spices and I did enjoy it. The other vegetables however were cut into cubes and barely cooked. There was a sauce over all this which I assume to be a wine reduction of some sort. It was over used leaving a sort of salmon/root veggie soup which did not work at all. For $27 I was very displeased with the food overall. The others in my group said while their pizzas were ok, would of much rather had something else. 

Once we got our food our waiter was GONE. no refills, no check ins nothing. We finally had to track someone down to get our check to leave. After waiting almost an hour just for the check we tracked down another staff member who got our original waiter. He came back to our table very rude as he laid down our check. If I had less morals I would have just left without paying. This place obviously only survives on it's historical value and being in such a high traffic tourist area. I will never return and I hope I keep a few people from wasting time and money here as well."}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland for the Billy Joel concert and chose Pickwick and Frolic for dinner. Hostess told us 1.5 hours for a table so we decided to sit at the bar. Ashley was our bartender and she was great! The entire place was so busy, yet she was very attentive and efficient. She kept a smile on her face the whole time as well. We had the margarita pizza, calamari and bacon wrapped shrimp. All were delicious.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. My wife and I had dinner and we were surprised how good the food was. I ordered a steak sandwich which was perfectly? cooked. My wife had the shrimp wrapped with bacon and a house salad.

Our server was Leah, and she was attentive and very supportive to our needs.

I would recommend this restaurant for good food and service.ex"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Just don't. Quote from my companion \"this is up there with the worst food we've ever had.\""}
{"text":"This place is located in a great spot downtown. We sat outside, which was lovely. Our food and appetizer were fantastic. My beet salad was amazing, especially with the assorted bread and dip app. spread. My husband's prime rib and potatoes were fabulous as well. The only reason this isn't five stars if because we ordered a pitcher of the white sangria, but it wasn't good! It was super watered down and didn't have much flavor. Otherwise, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I really love the food at Pick Wick. The appetizers are small, but the entrees are large and very good. The staff is also very accomodating. When we had trouble getting a reservation it was worked out and when we are arrived we were taken very good care of!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten at Pickwicks and not yet seen a show. I hope to update my review once I come back. First, the specialty drinks were quite pricey with nothing less than $9.50. It could be worse, but I was hoping for something a little less than that. For my meal, I ordered the tomato bisque, which was amazing! I could have eaten an entire other bowl! On the other hand, I had the caprese salad for my entree and it was nothing to write home about. I was expecting the mozarella balls to be super fresh, but they were fried. When I have a salad, I like to go for a more healthy option. 

I loved the decor of this restaurant! It was a fun place to go downtown for a girl's night out! The martini bar was closed due to a private party, so I would also like to try that in the neae future. All in all, I liked Pickwick's for dinner!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the worst meals and service that I have every experienced. 3 of us ordered the Walleye and it came out burnt and undercooked, with a spinach that had been cooked till it turned yellow. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"First time dining here, and probably the last. Our server was nice, but not very attentive.  We saw him to order our food and drinks and when he brought the bill. The prices were exorbitant for the small portion sizes, and the quality wasn't really there. We ordered a small plate of meatballs for $12 and it included 2 small meatballs, that didn't have a lot of flavor. I ordered a side salad for $9, and it was very small- nowhere near $9 worth!  Our food came out sporadically, with one person being finished with their meal before another's had even arrived. I had higher hopes for this restaurant, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Cool place for a date night. We had dinner before a comedy show that was downstairs. Loved the food we ordered, and the drinks were great too. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well for starters who could imagine that 30 yrs have passed since Nick started this whole place. 

I like the atmosphere; service; variety and quality of entertainment; drinks

The food never has been very good.  Our apps were pretty good, but the pizza dough was not browned, at all. I've been here other times for dinner over the years and I guess I've always known this about the food. 

Otherwise this is a great establishment."}
{"text":"I will not being going back unless they ever change the way they mix food/drinks with the show. People should order before it starts and after or go get their own refills. Instead you have waiters talking loud, card scanners in your face blinding you, standing in front of you blocking the comedian.....the ENTIRE time! Great drinks and food, but it was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and arrived quickly. Drinks were also generous. Will be back for sure! Waiter was great and polite. The atmosphere is nice on a nice summer night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Steaks were very good, service was excellent, but roast chicken was below average. I am going to give 4 stars because of the great service and excellent steaks."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good comedy show?? This past weekend was not a let down.  John Caponera headlined and I almost fell out of my seat laughing.  
The place was packed and the energy of the audience kept everyone on the edges of their seats.  
The only problem I have with this venue, is the price of the cocktails.  Two drinks at the bar were almost $20.  Yuck!!!  My cucumber martini was amazing as usual but geesh, at almost $13 a pop, its only a one and done.  
I will say though, that the bar and the entertainment that is put on in this nestled away gem, is always spot on!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was a great deal here, a must stop on your East 4th venture. With a simplistic happy hour drink and food menu, makes it easy to stop in quick and get going to your next destination.

The American Bistro fries were absolutely delicious with the melted cheese and excellent pairing of the mozzarella, bananas peppers, sausage and pepperoni. 

They offer comedy shows often, which I have heard are hilarious. Choose to sit outside and be apart of the buzz of East 4."}
{"text":"Oh, man!  Tonight's show was terrific.  Dave Coulier is a great guy and he has a hillarious stand-up act.  The guy is sooo talented.  The opener and the feature act were also very very funny tonight.  Great show for a Sunday night in chilly downtown Cleveland!

While I'm at it, the fries served here are delicious.  They are large cut steak fries and cooked perfectly.  I had the buffalo chicken wrap, which was also yummy.  I tried my cousin's onion ring and it was delish.  Oh, and the pitcher of Dortmunder Gold that we shared was gone in 20 minutes and it was fresh and delicious.  Dortmunder is so much better on tap than it is in a bottle."}
{"text":"Calamari was like rubber bands. Walleye was barely average. Should have been excellent given it is local. Asparagus was cold. Service indifferent. Much better  choices along 4th street"}
{"text":"As a whole Pickwick gets three stars from me.  However, each individual part of Pickwick gets rated seperately.

Hilarities: 5 stars
They do a great job of bringing comedic headliners to the area (mostly so said comedic headliners can make fun of Cleveland, but hey, who doesn't?).  Every time my husband and I go here for a show, we have a great time.  Typical bar food, drinks are decent.  Some people have complained about the price of drinks, but I think it's pretty standard for the setting you're in.

Martini/Champagne bar: 4 stars
My friends took me here as part of my bachelorette party, and it was fun.  Probably if I were the one paying for it, I wouldn't have thought it was that great.  Drinks are overpriced here (same price as Hilarities, but they cut the alcohol).

Restaurant: 1 star
The food here is barely decent.  I would honestly rather eat at TGI Friday's.  Pickwick is in a great location, so they get a lot of the pre-show dinner crowd that heads to Playhouse.  Unfortunately, when some friends and I went there for a pre-show dinner (not my choice), the service was terrible.  They specifically asked my friend when she made the reservation if we were seeing a show.  I thought that was a nice touch, except they didn't deliver.  We only had to wait about 10 minutes for the 12 of us to be seated, so that was good.  However, we waited an additional 15 minutes at our table with no silverware, water or menus.  My husband had to hunt someone down to bring us these things.  Same situation with taking our orders and bringing us the check.

I will go back for Hilarities, but that's probably all."}
{"text":"Amazing evening at Pickwick & Frolic. While they have limited options for vegetarians, the vegan spaghetti was mind-blowing and Dirty Martini was fun too :)

Loved the decor and ambience - the vintage Hollywood look and the energy of 4th street make a wonderful combination.."}
{"text":"We got free tickets to a show for tonight and I have to say, the guys were pretty funny!  Especially for a Wednesday night free-show crowd. Maybe it was the alcohol (?) but I was laughing my ass off the whole show! 

We headed down to E 4th for a delicious dinner before the show, but little did we know the Backstreet Boys are in town! Which means hordes of ladies out on E 4th clogging up our usual restaurant choices!   We decided to go ahead and go in Pickwick and Frolic for an appetizer or two, and it was actually quite good.  We had a delicious pizza and some fries quickly before our show - service was fast, which was important since we hadn't planned for all the people that would be out to see boy bands!

I don't know if it's every Wednesday, but inside the comedy club we were told we could order off the Happy Hour menu for the full show.  Sweet!  Free tickets and cheap drinks!  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"You probably won't believe me when I say this...but the food is pretty good.  I wouldn't have believed someone until I went for the first time last week.

Our 8pm reservations were probably unnecessary, based on the 15 or so occupied tables in a land of 40 or so.  Yikes, right? Not exactly, because Pickwick and Frolic has a decent drink menu, good and basic American dinner fare menu, and will get your tickets for you from will call if you are seeing a show.

Now it's not the least expensive menu in town, but there are some good bargains.  The steak sandwich? Not one of those bargains, but you'd have to check with someone else because I didn't order that.  I did go with the rotisserie chicken and my lord it was a delicious feast.  They must really have a rotisserie and they really do serve you half a chicken.  2 others got pasta, and another got scallops which were decent size and were said to be delicious.

Should you choose this over other places downtown if you aren't going to a show at Hilarities?  I'm not sure.  Maybe it just means you need to go to Hilarities more often, because that was a damn good show as well."}
{"text":"Cute place - must try the steak sandwich = amazing.  I have tried many steak sandwich's in my time but I actually have to admit that this was the best I have had to date!"}
{"text":"It was just okay. I hadn't been here in forever, but went back because I had a gift card. This isn't a place I will get a craving for, but it wasn't bad either. I just ordered two appetisers (muscles and calamari) since I wasn't too hungry and they were both good. However since everyone else I was with got meals and I just got appetisers I did ask for them both to be brought out at the same time as everyones' meals only to get the calamari out before everything else. The waitress was helpful in describing menu items and making suggestions on what to order. All in all however of all the places on E4th this one is struggling to keep up with the competition in my humble foodie opinion. 

And a quick note on parking: I recommend 515 Euclid which is at Euclid at E6th St. (not really 2 full blocks away). It's $10 on nights/weekends which is about the same as the E4th valet at $8 (after getting $7 back after showing a restaurant receipt) plus a $2 tip. The difference is the valet is super slow and getting your car back to you since they are so busy and on weekends often have a line of incoming cars stretching all the way onto Prospect Ave."}
{"text":"I ate here prior to seeing Carlos Mencia at Hilarities.   Pizza was pretty good.  Drinks were better.  It was a happening spot pre and post show.   Great prices, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great option for a date night dinner & comedy show combo. The food is good and the service is solid, but when compared to some of the options in the 4th Street Alley it tends to take a back seat.

If you go on a night with a popular comedian performing make sure to get a dinner reservation. On nice days ask to sit on the patio... it's incredible when there's a live band playing next door and the ambiance of that district enhances the mood at any meal."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Pickwick in a few years. From what I remembered, the food was awesome!  Last week they participated in the Downtown Cleveland Alliance restaurant week. Their prix fixe offerings looked phenomenal so my family opted to dine there.  I'll get right to the food part!  I opted for the duck & gruyere pizza as an appetizer. The duck was cooked like a well done steak. Duck jerky. The crust, however, was delightful and the portion was huge for an appetizer. For my main course I chose the chicken stuffed cabbages with lobster and sweet potato pierogi. Holy disaster!  The 2 stuffed cabbage were each only slightly larger than my thumb. They were incredibly dense and it was as if the cabbage was shrink-wrapped onto the filling!  Crazy!  The pierogi had to be cut....correction...sawed with a knife and tasted like a chicken wing that had been left in fry oil for way too long. The filling had plenty of sweet potato but sadly not a hint of lobster was to be found. Our meals came with a pairing of wine or beer. I wouldn't call it a pairing though.  Our server forgot to bring them with our meals. By the time we DID get them we were almost done with the main course. My husband ordered the Mediterranean Beef Wellington which looked good enough. The only catch was that it was sitting in a puddle of bizarre red sauce which I can best describe as looking & tasting like Frank's Red Hot. (Don't get me wrong, I love Frank's!  It was just very out-of-place on this dish!)
My dessert was awesome!  Surprise!  I had the berries & mousse and it was delish!
I'm sure everything I've described isn't on their regular menu, but one would think they would use restaurant week as an opportunity to wow their guests and showcase their culinary abilities. They missed the mark horribly on this one. There many other places nearby that are in much higher league than Pickwick & Frolic. 
I must say that the service was quick and friendly, with the exception of the drink snafu. 
I'm not easily disappointed and I hate to complain, but this meal was an absolute joke."}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly service, wood-fired pizzas and burgers are delicious, good beer list, free wifi."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here which was 3 years ago, my chicken was undercooked ...... but that isn't the point of this review . 

I am actually sitting in the outside patio space at The House of Blues which is located across from Pickwick . It is 10:50 pm, and standing outside are a couple of staffers and a small ice cream stand . I love ice cream . It's my fave . But that isn't the point of this either . There is a man . With a bell. A big bell. And he has been ding a linging that s**t for the last 45 minutes . The amount of annoyance the customers feel , seeing as how we can't even hear one another at the table is ridiculous . No one is buying the ice cream anyway . I know that this is probably a part of their job, and they have no choice , but for the love of GOD why must we hear it consistently as if he is a coin collector for the Salvation Army during Christmas ? This is a walkway that stays busy , and at best all you need is someone enthusiastic enough to verbally solicit this product . Please take the bell away.......please ."}
{"text":"Steak Cobb salad, too much dressing on it which I asked for on the side. Waitress friendly but not very knowledgeable about the menu or the steaks they offer. It took Way too long to our get entree (about 40 minutes after app came out). PW +F you'll need to step up your game to hang with the big boys on east 4th. You can make people laugh in the comedy club. Just don't do it in the restaurant. ROTF crying."}
