{"text":"Great customer service , always fresh , well worth the price and super professional. My go to spot for sushi takeout"}
{"text":"Looking for best sushi, sashimi and rolls for party tray take out... Eventually, this place is always our first choice when we have a large group of people for festive celebration or gathering at home. Their food are expectedly so fresh, so variety and so yummy..."}
{"text":"Perfect place to get sushi platters for your house party!   Ordered a large party platter. Fresh thick pieces of salmon sashimi. Other fish and sushi were good. The rolls were okay but not the best. But overall the quality was decent. Much better than anything you can get at supermarkets. Order a day ahead and get five percent off. 80 pieces for less than 55 dollars? What a deal.   Will definitely come back if hosting any house parties. Save your time on cooking."}
{"text":"I was having some major sushi cravings post pregnancy and sent my husband to pick up a medium sized platter for the two of us to share.  $33 for 50 pieces.   Overall, I would say it's decent.   Value wise was decent, quality and taste was decent.     I don't think I'd be a frequent customer, however, I think it would be worthwhile to order a platter for a large house party.   *I was too hungry to take photos, so you'll have to live vicariously through other Yelpers photos.   However, the medium sized platter looks dinky because they use the same sized tray as the large but with significantly less sushi."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this tiny little ugly mall for haircuts for over 15 years and only recently did I discover a take-out Sushi joint that has decent quality and is very reasonably priced.  In the picture you see here, it's a 30pc sushi/sashimi combo for $22!  The fish tasted fresh and was cold.  Nothing worse than room temperature sashimi!  The rice on the nigiri and the rolls were a bit hard and dry.  Seoul Banchan also sells sashimi by the pound, which is great!  Tip - if you plan on ordering from here, try to order one day in advance.  You'll get a 5% discount if you pay cash!  Not much to talk about with service as this is purely a takeout joint with no tables and chairs.  tl;dr: good food, reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Dropped by to order a sushi Platter, for a party. I've lived across the road from this place for over 16 years and never purchased anything from here before. I saw good Yelp reviews and thought I'd give it a try. The platter was ready by the time promised, but I doubt this place is very busy. The sushi isn't very large, hence the cheap price. The rolls were quite small and the rice a bit dry. I ordered 2 spicy salmon rolls, on the side too. They were the size of a quarter, they were the smallest rolls I've seen anywhere. The salmon sashimi was the best thing that I tasted, everything else was mediocre. In fact, some supermarkets have better sushi  than here. Which isnt good because this is a made to order  sushi place. Doubt I'd ever return, only if I was in desperate need of a platter at really short notice. I think people come just for the cheap price."}
{"text":"Seoul Banchan is located inside New Kennedy Square, and has been around pretty much since I moved to Markham in 2002 (though it was known as a different name I believe).   They offer takeout sushi/sashimi/rolls, and offer a wide assortment of party trays or simply small orders. If you order one day beforehand you get 5% off your order, and it's all tax included regardless!  I ordered a small sashimi party tray, 30 pieces for $20.90. You can mix and match sushi and sashimi, but I decided on 30 pieces of sashimi due to maximum fish. I found the sashimi to be reasonably fresh given the price, however the variety was definitely lacking (salmon, tuna, butterfish, red snapper, yellow tail, surf clam, and octopus; salmon was 15 of the 30 pieces).   It's probably the best bang for your buck sushi place around even though it's take-out only, though of course it's nowhere near the best sushi place in Markham (even if it was take-out)."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years!  It's been around for along time, Korean owned family business and has a Chinese help watching the cash.  I come here mainly just for Salmon Sashimi. It's $17.50 per pound and I always buy it uncut.  I like coming here because they sell me the pound of sashimi with the belly - unlike most restaurants will always have their fish pre-cut ready for making sushi so it never comes with the belly.  So his place feels more like a wholesaler..  The downs to this place is its take-out only and there isn't much selection.  They usually have octopus, salmon, tuna, butterfish, and yellowtail, that's pretty much it..   I've tried asking the owners to pre-order other types of seafood for me such a live sea urchin and they won't do it.. Although you can order Uni Sushi, but not sashimi.."}
{"text":"This place is predictable and never disappoints. Food is always fresh and prepared on time for pick up. It's your basic, \"no frills\", take-out place. Don't compare it to high-end sushi or fish market places because that's not what they're trying to do. Friendly and professional business owned by a Korean couple with Chinese help."}
