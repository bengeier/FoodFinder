{"text":"Great service. Ordered rare strip steak. It was served as ordered. Hadn't had one perfectly prepared in years. Each of us ordered something different. Each was pleased. Fried onions outstanding."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. If you enjoy food and consider yourself a foodie this is not the restaurant for you. The fried cod was wet in the center which leads us to believe that it had not been thawed properly and dropped into the frier. It was goo. The cornbread was out of a box, the baked beans out of a can and the fries fried in old oil. Their prices far exceed the quality of their product.  The young server was very nice and removed the item from the check when she saw that it was going back uneaten.  However, the manager never came to the table to discuss the matter nor did he show any signs of caring.  Atmosphere and decor OK."}
{"text":"What a bummer-  traveling from
Michigan to stay with friends in charlotte.  We walked in around 9pm
On a Wednesday evening and we're seated quickly.  To our surprise after 12 minutes of waiting for anyone to acknowledge us and servers walking by not making eye contact, bartenders laughing behind he bar not busy or texting -  we got sick of waiting and left.  On our way out the hostess who sat us said thank you and have a good night, we said u sat us 12 minutes ago and no one acknowledged us......she just
Looked at us like a deer in headlights and said nothing.  The server that came up behind her also stood there and listened and she did not care or apologize.  I will never waste my time or others to go back to this complete train wreck of a bar to visit."}
{"text":"Unimpressive and way too expensive for price point. Food was cheap and tasted way too processed. Mashed potatoes were not terrible, chili was ok, and was not a fan of succotash. Not a terrible restaurant but there are better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Casual dining experience. The wings had a bourbon/molasses glaze yummy.   We had the small platter.  4 meats and a side. We chose brisket,  ribs, pulled pork and chicken.  A side of baked beans and mac and cheese.  Meats perfectly cooked. Mac and cheese tender and creamy. More than enough food for two people with leftovers. Key lime pie had the right amount of sweet-tart. Server was attentive and helpful.  A really great place to enjoy barbque."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really nice, open and airy with a nice outdoor patio. The servers were attentive and attractive. The burnt end sliders were good and the bbq sauce had a nice flavor that wasn't too sweet. Unfortunately I won't be returning. $8 for a well vodka(Absolute) is ridicules for the Charlotte market."}
{"text":"A friend and I sipped in in a Sunday evening for dinner. Service was great. I had the ribs: tasty and fell of the bone she had the shrimp appetizer and salmon salad. She said both we're really good. We were happy with our last minute choice. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was a little skeptical of this place, the reviews are bad and I called for call ahead seating and the hostess wasn't the friendliest or the brightest. However, with much hesitation, I gave it a try. I was excited to try a new place. First the hostess didn't even acknowledge I was there, I had to say excuse me (I know she saw me there). It is a tiny place, or maybe cozy is a better word. Our server was attentive right away and through out the meal. The food however...mediocre. The alcohol selection definitely trumps the food selection. I had the beer can chicken sandwich with mac-n-cheese as my side. The side was so small, think I finished it in 2 bites, and it was just warm, needed to be hotter, the chicken was OK...it wasn't dry, but not overly flavorful either. It needs something on the sandwich like BBQ sauce or mayo, something was missing. My friend  had the French onion soup and a wedge salad. The salad was huge, and she said the French onion soup was bland, a lot of salt needed to be added...it's hard to mess up soup. I think some of the food is over priced too for the portions and the taste. This isn't a great place but not a terrible place either. My favorite part was they have NoDa's Jam Session, it's on of my favorite local beers. I think this place has potential, but unfortunately it will take longer to get there than it should....you have to remember it is in the South Park area, people expect more."}
{"text":"Having a name with Whiskey in it, we anticipated getting some delicious whiskey drinks. Sorely disappointed. Cocktails were watery and flavorless. Food not much better. Upscale bar food would be an overstatement. This place needs to decide what it wants to be....a whiskey bar or a sports bar. Too many other great spots in Charlotte, so no need to return."}
{"text":"Great food - try their salmon in a salad or as an entree. Good beer selection as well - been here twice and on both occasions food was superb"}
{"text":"Treehouse is brand new to the South Park area and every time I have dined there, the experience was amazing. The interior decor is beyond amazing, relaxing and luxurious yet it has a comfortable ambiance for families, business associates, and friends. The patio is the best in this area equipped with heaters to keep you comfortable during the cooler evenings. They have a wonderful variety of options for every type of diet and each plate is delicious. This place definitely should be deemed the best BBQ and Brisket restaurant in the entire Charlotte area. I've had the opportunity to try many entrees and appetizers, and so far my favorites are the Beer Can Cheese Dip (appetizer), Korean, Argentine, and Fish & Chip tacos, Lobster Cobb Salad and Fire Grilled Salmon Salad, Crab Legs and Dirty Shrimp, Out & In Burger and Classic Burger, Carolina Pull Pork BBQ and Beer Can Chicken Sandwich, and lastly any of there BBQ combination plates! 
This place has every sauce you could think of to top off any and all menu selections and they are all made in house! Not to mention their incredibly friendly wait staff and over accommodating management team. 
Don't forget to try out there bar and large selections of draft beers and whisky!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Drinks were ok but they couldn't even find ingredients for a signature cocktail.  We didn't eat there but prob won't unless they improve on a lot of things. The patio is really awesome and they did a good job decorating inside so that's where they got the two stars. 

Once they bring it up to par with other places of similar type of food/price point then it will be a place Id be a regular at."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...but definitely bar food... Service is friendly but slow...and the food is basically a rental if you catch my drift"}
{"text":"BBQ chicken was so dry it was almost inedible.  Clearly it had been sitting around warming for some time.  The drinks were so watered down it was impossible to taste the liquor.  I really wanted to like this place but there was nothing to like.  Just plain bad."}
{"text":"Overall terrible experience. When we first arrived, all three girls that were working were sitting in a booth together taking selfies. Finally after making eye contact, one came over to the hostess stand and sat us at a table. There was only one other table occupied at 12:30 on a Sunday (red flag). Our server came over (from the booth) and was friendly. The girl who sat us was outside the rest of time with a boy, I'm assuming her boyfriend, sitting in his lap. The other occupied table finished their meal and left. The table was not cleared for 20 mins. Our server went back and forth between waiting on us and returning to the booth she was in with the only other server while they colored and took more selfies. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and said it was just ok. I ordered the out and in burger. It was honestly the worst burger I've had in Charlotte. Two patties that were clearly pre-pattied, frozen. Mushy texture. Worse than a bubba burger you would get from the grocery store. I could maybe see coming here just for drinks, but never will I come here to eat the food again!"}
{"text":"awesome place.... cozy environment.... good for relaxing.... comfortable pricing.... we tried it after a long trip from Jersey and loved the IPA's"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst places to eat in Charlotte, not enough seating, food is horrendous, service is mediocre, the music is so loud you can't hold a conversation, and did I say the food was horrendous..."}
{"text":"never got past the front door. we had a party of 6. they said they don't take reservations but would do call ahead. we informed was my birthday. called before we left our house which was a grand total of 4 minutes away. hostess said come on in, there is no wait. walked in the door...yep. there is now a 45 minute wait. hostess could've handled that a little better but i won't go back to find out. what a buzzkill."}
{"text":"We will keep coming back for the drinks and the atmosphere. But...

The food just isn't great. Beer-can chicken and turkey burger are dry and the beer cheese is like cheap nacho cheese. The wings are good and the Argentinean taco was very good. If they can step up the food quality, this has the potential to be my all time favorite. 

Service is better at the tables than the bar. The bartender was not very friendly or helpful, and a little condescending.

You can't beat that patio on a nice day, though! Would love to see more Charlotte beers on the draught menu!!!"}
{"text":"Service was some of the worse we've had in a long time. Food was just ok. Don't waste your BBQ experience on Treehouse. There are too many other better places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've probably given Treehouse about 5-10 chances since it has opened. It's a super convenient location to where I live and the patio is great. I really want to love it. Unfortunately at least 4 out of 5 times I've had some of the worst service I've ever experienced - for the most part the girls are all very nice (and it seems their looks/age are a factor in the hiring as well), but they're not knowledgeable, helpful, professional, or attentive. It doesn't seem they've had any experience or training in the industry. I'd rather have an experienced waiter/waitress any day - if the hiring was based on more important factors than sex, looks, and age, I'd be a regular here and a huge advocate. As a side note, the food hasn't been great either."}
{"text":"Great Food and Service!  We will be returning again soon. Love the feel of the restaurant as well. Nice addition to South Park."}
{"text":"Love this spot!!! Best patio in town, great beer selection, and I'm always greeted with a smiling face. Their tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is for outside eating if that works for you. The food is good and the drink selection is expansive. The decor is rustic for Southpark, but to me that is the charm. More in line with a beach resort outdoor grill. Come here when the weather is cool and during the off hours and you will enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"The food was great but one of the waitresses used the restroom and didn't wash her hands. Walked right past me and walked out of the restroom grabbing two plates to take to a table. I emailed the place to tell them about the situation and they never contacted me back saying they handled it. We even provided the date and the time including what she was wearing but no response. We should have contacted the health department on that because it is a health risk."}
{"text":"Stopped by early Tuesday evening.  Restaurant not very busy.  Chloe was our server, very friendly and bubbly.  I like the variety on the menu.  A good variety where most people can find something to eat.  I ordered the briscuit sandwich.  For $15 i expected a huge sandwich heaping with everything they described on the menu.  What I received was a small bun with maybe 4 oz of meat and two little ramekins of toppings.
My wife ordered 2 tacos.  The tacos tasted good but had very little filling in each one.  Again at $5/taco with no sides these are pricey.  We were both hungry after eating our food and ordered pecan pie.  The pie was good whole pieces of pecans on top but no pecans in the filling.  
A 1/2 hour later after I left I was still hungry.  Not sure where the whiskey comes into play with the name.  They had an extensive beer list but I didn't see a similar whiskey list.  

Treehouse might work as a place to go to after work for a drink but as a dinner destination there are better alternatives."}
{"text":"Cool place! Very elegant, classy, and all of the expectations for an after dinner ambiance were met. However, the drinks are way over priced. My girlfriend and I work a block from there, and it's a nice place to go and chill after work. We simply won't be going back though, at least not for a good while because we had, 2 specialty beers, 3 fireball shots, and 3 makers mark old-fashions. With the obligation of having to give a generous tip due to us being in the service industry as well, was immensly difficult to bite off and chew for our tab being $84 for 8 drinks plus the $20 I gave. We would go 3 times a week if it were no more than $5 for our brown ales that we indulge in. Not anymore though."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a restaurant with great service, good food, and a relaxed (but visually appealing) atmosphere you should try the Treehouse. Kids can be as loud as they want and the menu includes items with their tastes in mind. Its also a fun place for adults, too :-)"}
{"text":"When it comes to food it's hit and miss. When it's good it's great when it's bad it's bad. Every time I have visited it's been different than the time before. I will say the brisket has been consistently good. Avoid the greasy burgers.
The bar and patio always work, it's a good drink spot hidden in SouthPark area. It's a unique place and overall a good time. Particularly when it's a nice day to be outdoors with a good beer. I like it."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service, horrible management. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Oh boy.  Not really sure what I was expecting, but for South Park I really was expecting more.  I was seated outside during mid-week happy hour and would've been happy to just sit at either side of the indoor-outdoor bar, but it was already full.  I'd like to stop my story here, where as I'm walking in I overhear the bartender finishing making a round of shots for what seems like regulars (who seemed surprised they were getting shots), then yell at one of the girls because \"they had not toasted yet\".  Moving right along, the patio area is cute in its decoration with the lights, but fair warning for chicks in heels - the walkways are not stable with tree roots, gravel and uneven stone slabs.  I'm happy to report is a dog friendly area though :) Being that it's not on the main road, but tucked behind other businesses, it did have a remote feel to it. 
I ordered the bacon wrapped jalepenos with a whiskey molasses dipping and a beer sample.  The sample was in an oversized shot glass that had some kind of brown syrup stuck to it and a fruit fly floating in it.  So that's super gross, but I was waiting for someone and decided to stick it out.  Ordered a different beer, the flash fried jalepenos came out quickly and were good.  I was looking forward to the whiskey molasses part and got kind of raspberry jam instead - still good, but not what was on the menu.  
We left after the one beer.  There's just something about the ambiance that screams this is the place for you if you're looking for \"let's get S-faced and make bad choices\" kind of bar.  Waitresses in uniforms of  t-shirts, sneakers, flannel and shorts that have a \"don't you want more alcohol with your alcohol\" mentality."}
{"text":"I'm giving a three star review only because the food was the saving grace. Service was below par, I'd give a one- maybe. We sat down around 5:30 on the patio. It's a Tuesday night so as you can imagine it wasn't too busy. We ordered our drinks, and threw in an appetizer (jalapeno poppers). After we received our drinks our waitress literally disappeared. We finished our drinks, and still nothing from our waitress- I'd say we were sitting for about a half hour before she came back, she said she'd grab us more drinks but never asked if we were ready to order so my husband told her we wanted to get some dinner, she looked confused but took our order. She then returned with our drinks, but still no jalapeño poppers. About another 15 minutes went by and then another waitress came out with our dinner, and our jalapeño poppers. My husband also ordered a side salad which didn't come out, and the waitress asked if he still wanted it since it didn't make it to the table. He decided to skip the salad since he probably wouldn't see it for another half hour. Overall the food was good but we would have loved to enjoy the poppers and then gotten our dinner. We couldn't really enjoy them since it all came out at the same time. We were excited to try this place and gave it a chance but next time we will listen to the reviews."}
{"text":"Not very good food and an untrained waitstaff. I personally witnessed a manger being a tyrant to his waitstaff due to an error the expediter made. Food was slow coming out too. 

It's a shame because the place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"A very decent selection of beers on tap, especially quite a fee from North Carolina. This gave us a shimmer of excitement. Ordered the Jalepeno Cheddar biscuits and glazed pork belly to start. Both appetizers were easily 4-5 stars. The biscuits were large, fluffy and had a perfect amount of jalepeno flavor. The pork belly was phenominal. The pork had a decent char that gave an amazing flavor to the pork belly bites.  If asked, I would suggest everything mentioned to this point and stay with apps and drafts.  
The entrees were fair. The small combo was more than enough food and we had brisket, salmon, shrimp, and smoked sausage with the bacon cheddar grit cakes as a side.  We also ordered the rib platter with corn succotash. The entrees were just bland. They were in serious need of salt. Sadly, the ribs were room temp.  It didn't appear that they were warmed. As I stated, the apps and beers were amazing. I will skip the entrees next go around."}
{"text":"As first time guests we were excited to find a great new spot to hang. Unfortunately, we were a little disappointed.  I guess we are still searching for the next regular spot. Don't get me wrong, there are some cool and redeeming qualities for the new casual bourbon/BBQ bar.  It's just that the concept and location has amazing potential in Southpark but right now the place isn't what it could be.

It's a very cool idea of treehouse with a tree in the middle of the warm small space located in a very convenient Southpark location right behind Baku across from crate & Barrel at the mall. The concept is warm and inviting and with the large quality bourbon selection makes it a winner without ever playing. 

The bourbon selection is excellent going from Woodford double Oaked to Pappy. Get the double Blanton's if you haven't tried it yet.  Drinks are good, nice selection of craft beer and other cocktails and the bar staff was nice. Big plus. Bar is small but intimate and while the end of the bar is locked in to a corner it was welcoming.

The menu is pretty limited and basic bar type item fare without a real signature dish.  After trying jalapeño poppers (Woopsy, they were out) I tasted the highly recommended brisket sliders with cole slaw.  Bummer, it was pretty dry. The fries were ok, wings were good but still not memorable. A friend said the onion rings were average but I did hear the chicken chopped sandwich with bacon, cheese and other stuff was really good so I'll test it the next visit. 

I'm hoping the kitchen better because this place has big potential! Maybe they can start with a website."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late lunch... service was good - our server, Sophia, was friendly/attentive. The food was fine - I had the jerk chicken taco which was not bad, but not anything I'd recommend either. My biggest criticism is the ladies room. Honestly, just a mess. Stalls are built of raw wood - in keeping with the restaurant theme, I guess. Exposed nails...door did not lock. No tissue.  Toilet seat loose so that it was sideways across the bowl.  Counter of the sink was wet from splashed water. Paper towel dispenser was broken (I assume) - the roll was sitting between the sinks - half soaked from wicking up the water on the counter...  How managers or staff miss such a fundamental part of their restaurant is beyond me... I'd expect this at a gas station...or college bar... but not here.  Glad we tried it, but doubt we'll be back"}
{"text":"Went the other day with my girlfriend. All we had were the oysters and drinks (oh and a salad they had delivered to our table by mistake while we were outside, we informed the waitress but she just said keep it they had already made another one) The oysters were great the drinks were good. (little pricey) Even the salad was good the waitress was even nice enough to bring my girlfriend a different salad dressing (way to get picky about a free salad.) But the food they were bringing to the other tables looked great. but the best thing of all was our server, polite, on top of everything and very professional for being so young. Also I believe one of the managers was trying to help us figure out a problem we were having with the car. Very friendly place."}
{"text":"Just bad all around. The waitress we had was as sweet as could be but that doesn't make up for the less-than-stellar food. All four of us got sick after eating there. I don't think I'll be going back for a second try."}
{"text":"Food is great--can't say the same about the service. 

Cheddar jalapeño biscuits are awesome and worth a try!! Shared the turkey burger and it was pretty tasty as well"}
{"text":"\"Watered Down Cocktails, Food Not Great, UNIMPRESSED!!\"
 
The pros: beer cheese dip with chips, jalapeno cheddar biscuits, Buffalo shrimp appetizer
The cons: watered down cocktails, poor service, extremely fatty brisket lacking flavor

My friend and I were looking for a new place to try when we came across Treehouse Whiskey and Fork. We requested outside patio seating and were seated promptly(they have a decent sized patio area). We ordered cocktails. My friend ordered The Mule which tasted nothing like the drink and was practically watered down and I ordered their raspberry mojito type cocktail( I forget what the name of it was) and I couldn't taste anything remotely mojito about it. I only tasted champagne?? We neither finished our drinks. 
We did order 3 appetizers to share and each an entrée. The beer cheese dip with extra crispy chips was nice and thick with jalapeno peppers. The buffalo style shrimp was large and tasty and the buttermilk cheddar jalapeno biscuits were rather tasty. 
Next up, the entrees. My friend ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with tater tots which he said \"was just ok.\" I ordered the brisket platter with mac & cheese, French Fries. I specifically requested the leaner cut of brisket since typically you can order lean, fatty or mixed at other places. I can tell you this...it was the worse brisket I've ever had. It was so fatty I couldn't eat it. It lacked flavor of any kind. 
We skipped dessert and both agreed we won't be back to Treehouse Whiskey. Perhaps if you stick with just the beers, whiskey and appetizers you might want to try it out. But don't say I didn't tell you so."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, with friendly staff, and very comfortable dining area.  Quite active weekend crowd at the bar."}
{"text":"** Overpriced food. ** Bad service ** 

Been there probably  6 or 8 times hoping it would improve since it opened. It hasn't. The food is hit or miss, but definitely over priced for what it is. 

The service there is almost always poor.  The one exception when I got a nice waitress, but the bartenders are rude, arrogant and feel entitled.  If they hired a robot to serve drinks it would be a better experience. 

The main clientele to the bar are men and the female bartenders are clearly unhappy with their life choices, it is very apparent which makes for a extremely poor experience as a customer. 

They hire all an all female wait/bar staff and you get the immediate feeling these people hate their jobs. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went to Treehouse this past Friday. We are new to the area and wanted to go out for a casual dinner. We arrived around 7:00. The outside patio was full, and while there were many families and friends dining inside, we didn't have to wait for a table. 

We ordered the Iron Skillet Cornbread to start. It was moist and the maple brown butter was yummy and sweet. I ordered the Hickory Smoked Salmon Belly BLT Sliders as my meal. It was plenty of food (there were 3 sliders), and they were flavorful, but nothing amazing. My fiance ordered the great taco (which was huge) and a side of the hickory grilled corn. We both finished our meals and felt satisfied, but aren't particularly anxious to eat here again soon.

The low point of the meal was the service. We've been to quite a few restaurants since moving to Charlotte, and the service has been attentive and friendly. In comparison, our server at Treehouse seemed inattentive and rushed. She wasn't rude, but it just felt like we were inconveniencing her by ordering."}
{"text":"Barbecue tasted good at the time, but woke me up at 2am feeling bad! Ambience is great. Server was not too friendly... Not what I was expecting for this new place."}
{"text":"Just what charlotte southpark needed, another chauvinist restaurant with young girls not pretty enough to strip in short shorts and mediocre food lol. The waitress hung over the top of the table while I ate with my husband and tried to flirt for her tips. Definitely not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Expected a lot more from this place but really it was just a sports bar with bar-level fare. Music too loud and tv's everywhere. French onion soup a little undercooked (cheese barely melted not browned), brisket tacos were pretty decent but meat was too tough. The Argentinian taco was pretty good though. Turkey burger average. The slaw was tasty for sure. Not bad overall; mediocre."}
{"text":"We had the platter for four. Everything was absolutely delicious. Mashed potatoes was the best side we ordered. Mac and cheese was decent. We barley had leftovers. Never seen us eat so much."}
{"text":"Went there today for brunch 10/23/17. I ordered a BBQ omelet and my wife order a bacon and cheese omelet, both of our omelets came out without cheese in them. When we told our server that they didn't have cheese she took them back to add the cheese. While she was telling the cook what was wrong I saw her rolling her eyes. When she returned to our table with the omelets the cheese wasn't even melted and was just stuffed in the top portion of the omelet. We were the first guest there when the doors opened. By the time we ordered our food there were two other couples in the restaurant (it was dead) and it took about 45 minutes for us to get our food. This place is disgusting, slow service, rude staff and food is not good at all."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, although a little pricey.  Atmosphere is really good, great feel and nice decor.  Service was good as well, the waitresses were pleasant and attentive.  Drinks, this is the big drawback, WAY too expensive for any liquor drink, I was shocked at the markup.  $12 for a standard house cocktail, even Cheesecake Factory or Morton's isn't that pricey.  They did have a draft special that was what you would expect price wise anywhere else.

Summary: if you want good atmosphere and food but are only drinking tap what're go for it.  If you want a drink with food it simply isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Date: 8/8/17
Food: 16 hour hickory smoked brisket  

The brisket was excellent, large portions  coleslaw was \"beefy\" with little slop. My side choice was the veggie of the day consisting of squash zucchini carrots and red onions well 
was legit overall I was a fan and would go back"}
{"text":"Interesting decor, waitress was obviously new to the job, but well meaning. We ate lunch, both had the French onion soup. Large pieces of bread, no broth aside from the soggy bread, onions and cheese were OK, but overall not a pleasant soup. Deb had a pulled pork taco she liked, I had a grilled cheese sandwich with roasted peppers. The sandwich was good, but perhaps less goat cheese and more of the other two cheeses would have been better. After reading other reviews about the minuscule wine portions, we had iced tea and lemonade. In spite my request for light ice, my glass was 70% ice, which really irks me. Bottom line, we are in no hurry to return, nothing stands out and with the number of excellent restaurants in the area, I think it will be tough going for this place."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were good. The fried dill pickles, although quartered pickles, are deep fried and beer batter with ranch dressing. Pretty good. 

There was a special on \"poutine\" tonight, it was a real disappointment because it came with potato chips instead of french fries. First poutine I've ever had with potato chips. No good!! That is not a poutine. Poutine is on french fries, not potato chips!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Cute atmosphere and fun concept to the menu. Food was overpriced for the portion size and nothing memorable taste-wise. I had the pulled chicken plate, which I thought would be like BBQ but with chicken but instead it was just cut up pieces of chicken. The coleslaw was very small and just ok, and the cucumber salad was cucumbers and tomatoes tossed in what tasted like a store-bought Italian dressing. One of my friends had the same dish as I did with beans, and she had also expected something more like BBQ as well and that she wouldn't order it again. Our other friend had the brisket and enjoyed it. She had sweet potato fries as her side, which were, we all agreed, the best food item we had. 

Ok spot - but in the area, there's much better restaurants not far away."}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed with the food or service...so I will probably not ever return.

I was with a group of friends when I came and we went to the bar to get a drink while we waited. I got a glass of wine. The pour was so small, I was in shocked. I didn't say anything to the bartender, but later when we were seated I asked our server for another glass and told her how disappointed I was with the first glass to please make sure the pour is standard. Again, same small pour. I couldn't believe it. 


We had the beer cheese dip as an app. It was good, but nothing special. It came with house made chips, which were descent. I had the lobster mac and cheese. There was not much lobster in it and it wasn't fresh, in my opinion. Good portion size. Flavor was lacking. 

I might try this place again when the weather gets nice, but I won't be ordering wine. The outside porch seems to have a decent amount of seating and is nicely shaded."}
{"text":"Food was okay until it was overcome by the smell of Clorox all over my food. They are cleaning the tables with some weird industrial cleaner. By the middle of the meal my eyes were burning and appetite lost. Let management know but they seem completely unconcerned."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night with a 30 minute wait but food was worthwhile.   OK, I had a coupon, so that always helps.   We loved the sweet potato fries, Cuban, argentine taco.   Kids loved the milkshake for dessert.   Will be back but at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Just went for a few drinks and it was horrible service! Bar tenders are usually nice people...friendly and want to provide good customer service. Nope not here. The female bartender that waited on us was so rude and horrible. I have never felt so unwelcome at a place before I even placed an order. It was obviously an issue for her to be working tonight or maybe she just hates people in general. In that case get out of the service industry!"}
{"text":"Bartender was horrible. She said she's been working there since it opened. Very rude not polite. When you Sit down at the bar you expect a little bit conversation. Deep down your looking for some interaction there was none. Just an order taker. The art of service is dead it's sad. She hurts the rest of us who make it an experience not just an order. Sad I have worked as a bartender for years."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a shot seeing all the bad reviews I wanted to give it a chance. The only reason I got 3 stars is because it is a really cool concept with the tree in the middle of the restaurants. We went late on an off night and the wings were barely edible, however the pork taco was really good.  Price of seems decent, and the service was pretty good for only one bartender.  Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"1 star is generous for service this horrible. After being sat by the hostess outside, had to get out of my seat THREE times to ask for someone to wait on us. And believe me when I say the wait was not worth it. With so many fun and delicious places to try in Charlotte, do yourself a favor and leave this place off your list."}
{"text":"Terrible service . Every time I come here. Our waitress sat at the table beside on her friends lap while we were patiently waiting to order dinner. After waiting for her to get their order of drinks (we had asked the host to send her to our table to order dinner originally) for over 15 minutes, we left. No dinner. I have been to this place several times and EVERY single time, the level of service is a zero. Last chance I give this place."}
{"text":"For most part, the food is mediocre, the cheese and sausage dip was the starter, and I don't think it was actually sausage, more like Canadian bacon sprinkled on top. Of course not enough chips and had to ask for more, which the server said were free refills, but by the time she brought them, the cheese was cold. Fish taco I think might have been spoiled-I could smell it across the table (hope no one gets sick). The burger and brisket were good.  $4 tater tots are of the frozen kind and were served somewhat cold.  The service was terrible! I had to get up to get water b/c the server forgot to bring it twice. She seemed aloof.  It wasn't the worse meal I have ever had, just no reason to go back."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS gigantic portions with a reasonible price point.  Whiskey drinks are expensive, but most places are and they have a large selection.  Food is super tasty, quickly served by friendly staff.  Appetizer of cheese fondue with pretzel salted balls and chips.  Pork nachos are huge and fresh with lots of pork.  The pork is tender and they have four types of sauces on the table.  Tried a piece of cornbread with maple butter that when it melted made it seem like dessert.   Yummy spot with cute decor and can't believe we did not try sooner.   Also, mimosa drinks on Saturday are 4.00.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Really great concept and love the atmosphere.
The in and out burger is a new favorite and the only place you can get it in the south.
A must try"}
{"text":"The grilled cheese and sweet potato fries are to die for! Servers were too sweet and adorable in overalls! Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to be a little nice about this review only because I spoke with the bar manager. The rude bartender \"CJ\" was more interested in the two older gentleman at my right than actually giving me and others proper customer service.

My family owns a transportation company and I also work for a National Real Estate Construction Company. I'm making this a point because I'm 49 years old and apparently CJ thinks she can get more money out of two older men. And giving them free drinks so that she can get a bigger tip. I did make notes at the bar which I have all documentation of this stupidity on her part. I live  across the street and this is my neighborhood and has been for many years with my family. So, CJ you better take your gold digging ass to another restaurant because I'm going to call the owner of this establishment. 

It's really sad that I wasn't able to experience what I thought was an amazing place. I will now tell all of my clients NOT to visit. CJ you need to learn respect and the \"Core Ideology\" of life and do the right thing!!!

Please keep in mind I have all video and text of this interaction. So if you are the owner please contact me.

Me or my clients and friends will not be back if the current bar staff is there. It's very unfortunate to have such a great hideaway in South Park.  I will continue to repeat this post until these \"ladies\" are no longer with this restaurant establishment."}
{"text":"OMG went to treehouse for the first time today and DAMN IT I won't be back....I ordered the Sriracha Burger that has a sausage and egg...and I thought the sausage smelled funny so after I ate half I couldn't stomach the smell anymore so stopped eating.  Well here WE are 4 hours later on the freakin toilet...yup I said WE - my husband got sick too!!!  BTW noticed the health sanitation rating ON OUR WAY OUT - 92.5  not good at all!!! Explains the stomach pains"}
{"text":"Yes, when it first opened, there were some kinks to work out, but the owners and servers have been busting their butts to make the place better. 

And, the food is exceptional. The ribs are INSANE (best I've had at a restaurant arguably ever), the grilled oysters are yummy and the cornbread muffin thingies with maple butter are delicious as well. 

This is a MUCHNEEDED addition to the SouthPark area and I'm happy to be a regular. Give it a second chance if you've only gone once; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute place, tucked away behind Baku kind of. Have had a few yummy things- tacos & nice drink selection. A little tricky that drinks listed on the kids menu aren't actually included with the $7 cheeseburger ($3 extra) but now we know!"}
{"text":"5/5 on decor, 1/5 on food. The interior was absolutely adorable. Everything went along with the tree house theme. It's a great vibe for kids and adults, as long as you don't care how the food tastes. 

Brunch was disappointing. The french toast came out first, then we waited almost an hour for our omelettes. Unfortunately, the omelettes were not worth the wait. They were dry and the ham & cheese omelet was missing cheese. The meatlovers omelet was basically dry egg pancakes. Tater tots were really good, so that was awesome. The french toast was good but not better than what I can make at home. Our bill came out to about $50 for a plate of nice tater tots, so we left a little bitter. 

I think their dinner is supposed to be better. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt because they went above and beyond for the interior decorations, so why not the food, right? I hope we just caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. Nice selection of beers. A bit overpriced for the food I feel. The beer cheese and sausage app seemed as though it was just velveeta cheese. I had the pork plate and had to send it back because there was more fat than meat. Switched to the BBQ chicken instead. It was ok. I loved the decor but I probably won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Went there last night for drinks and dinner.  Ended up sitting at a high top table that had the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE metal chairs.  I knew I wasn't the only one b/c a guy at the bar chose to stand, which I did by the end of the meal.

We ordered a burger and wings.  Wings were good, burger was just ok at best. Burger was $12.50 which I thought was expensive for what you got. 

Don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Beware.... servers will give themselves a nice tip. My lunch tab was only $13.... I tabbed out at $17.... then the bank draft came through at $27."}
{"text":"Super average food though the decor is SWEET! The beer cheese fondue was not so great. We got it with pretzels and chips. It just tasted like soupy heavy cream. The Argentinian Beef taco was meh but the Jerk Chicken taco was great! BBQ pork sliders were good too, though just standard BBQ nothing to write home about. All in all average food, but a really awesome interior design and decoration!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a 2nd try, and it was our last try. The food is all frozen and overpriced. If you're charging $10-$12 for a burger it shouldn't be frozen and have a mushy texture. The whiskey menu is not up to date, 2 whiskeys we ordered they no longer had. The service is mediocre."}
{"text":"First Visit.  No reservations, so we had to wait a bit for a table, but what better place to wait than the bar?  I was a little put off at spending $25 for a very small pour of Chardonnay and one mixed drink.  I should note my drink was especially good tho.

Our waitress made great recommendations, and I went with a brisket plate.  It was solid, and I had leftovers that I was excited to get into the next day.  Mc and Cheese was good but a bit al dente for me.

Server Brooke was on top of it and took really good care of us, which is mostly why there are three stars as opposed to less."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, cute patio. Service was spot on. Food was terrible. We got the beer cheese fondue - bland, buffalo shrimp - okay. Beef brisket - boring and dry. Side of Mac and cheese - not good. So wanted to love this place - location and patio so fun. But food just really wasn't good - at all. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Fun environment! Server said turns more into a bar scene at night but families come.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  Not often do I feel I need to leave a review but I want to warn anyone thinking of visiting this place to stay away.  A friend had me meet them there this past Tuesday night, I had never been and thought \"why not!!\".  So, get there, seated right away but then after about 15 minutes of waiting for someone to come by for at least a drink order, I went to put my own drink order at the bar.  A server that I passed and asked about possibly ordering drinks told me their system was down,  What does that have to do with letting customers sit at a table without even coming to say something???

I did not know it was Taco Tuesday, the sign as we entered said \"$3 tacos\" so I decided to order a couple, as did my friend.  Get the bill at the end and they were charged at regular price.  When I asked the server about it she says \"oh, only select tacos are $3\".....like we were supposed to know that, she didn't even seem like she cared.  Tacos were ok, but nothing to write home about.

There is nothing good to say about this establishment.  Please stay away!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, if I could give 0 stars I would.  We went to Treehouse for their grand opening on Friday and not much to report since the service was pretty terrible.  Granted it was their opening night, but they just seemed terribly unprepared.  It took almost half an hour before we got the beer that we ordered and another half an hour to get our salad.  The salad actually wasn't half bad, but that's all we ended up eating since after 1 hour and 20 minutes later, we were still waiting for our food.  We ended up following the lead of another table that decided to leave after only getting waters, waiting too long for their food.  We couldn't even get a grab of the waitress to pay for our salad and beer and ended up just giving cash to the hostess just so we could get out.

It's too bad, seemed like a fun concept, but don't plan on going back unless we hear that they fix those issues."}
{"text":"So the food here is great... Probably the main, if not only, reason I come. 

Service has generally been sub-par at best. Seems to be pointed to poor management as you see servers on phones, chatting all the time, and generally have a \"I don't want to be here\" attitude.  

Still... Good food. Could be so much more."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Loved the sliders & wings appetizers & the brisket was some of the most tender & juicy I've ever had!! Great succotash, perfectly cooked salmon. Might skip the potato grit cakes as they didn't have a great flavor. Seriously great atmosphere, music was a little loud & for some reason the managers kept propping the door to the patio open (hello it's January) but definitely will go back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Ok I steered away from this place based on other reviews of the food. Well, I wished I had come sooner. The selection of bourbon whiskey rye and scotch on tap is unmatchable. Atmosphere is fun and less pretentious than most southpark places. Open windows, cool people, great beer selection as well... OMB captain jack my fav. Oh and by the way, reviews on food weren't good and I must say. Best tacos I've ever eaten. We started with salmon BLT sliders, wow, honey glaze, I want them tomorrow! The Jamaican jerk chicken great, Korean BMW taco with wasabi was fantastic the treehouse brisket taco AMAZING, got two to go. I highly recommend this place and I'll be back... SOON."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my friend for her birthday. Food was good, the Korean pork taco was amazing! I also enjoyed my chocolate milkshake for dessert. My biggest complaint is how slow the service was. It was slow to get greeted, slow to get drinks (water), few refills, SUPER slow to get food and desserts and slow to get checks. Very disappointing that the food is so good but the service sucks."}
{"text":"Great bourbon selection. ....WORST service.   Rude,  young bartenders who only are nice to male clients.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We won't be back anytime soon.  First, the hostess \"warned\" us that a band would be playing soon and it would be loud.  Anyway, we opted to sit and the music being played (not the band) was so loud that we couldn't really talk.  We waited 15 minutes for a waitress to come by to take our drink order without any apology for the wait.  No big deal but we were close to walking out which now I wish we did.  

We ordered a glass of wine and a beer and I tried to order an appetizer but she walked away while I was ordering it.  Anyway. when she came back and we ordered the buffalo shrimp,  a Korean taco and the beer can chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The buffalo shrimp came out about 5 minutes later and they were very good.   The rest of the meal came out about 10 minutes later and it went down hill for there.  The Korean taco tasted like sweet, puréed beef.  Not appetizing.  My husband wouldn't eat it after one bite and I am not sure I have ever seen him not eat more than one bite of a dish.  The beer can chicken sandwich was fine if unremarkable.  Even though I ordered sweet potato waffle fries we received regular fries (again it was loud in there and hard to hear.). The fries were very good.

My husband ordered another beer and she took away the first one when he ordered it when it had about 3 sips left in his original beer. 

She offered us dessert but we just wanted to get out of there at that point so I handed her my credit card.  I checked the bill after we left and they didn't discount my wine for Wednesday \"1/2 price wine night\" but that was my fault for not checking it before I paid it.

We LOVE Baku and we we were more than disappointed that this restaurant was so bad.  It's a great location and a cute space but the service and food were subpar at best."}
{"text":"A group of us were curious about a tree in the middle of a restaurant so we decided to give this place a try!

For being brand new, the wait for a table was moderate and typical for a Saturday night. They do allow reservations and call ahead seating. The ambiance was different and interesting with a storybook type theme throughout the restaurant. I'm a big foodie and it takes a lot for me to rate anything really highly. The baked beer cheese and brisket sandwich were really good however my side was the bacon cheddar grit cakes was bland. All I tasted was grits. I tried my friend's lobster Mac and cheese and it was also very bland and we both had bites with shell in it. Also, there wine pours were ridiculously small. They should either charge less or pour more! 

I maybe would try this place again in the summer when you could enjoy the patio. Otherwise, the food wasn't good enough for me to come back and it was pricey for the portion size."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Really cool concept, but menu is all over the place. It's bbq meets seafood meets sandwiches. I opted for the burger and fries.. My burger was burnt, if we weren't in a hurry to get back home, I would have sent it back. Fries were good. My hubs had the pulled pork sandwich sans slaw and he said it was good, but didn't finish it. Food is a little on the pricey side. It set us back 40$ for 2 sandwiches and two side salads."}
{"text":"Decent place, I had the pulled chicken. The place is not bad for an after work kind of unwind
The whole treehouse idea is kind of gimmickey. Just my opinion
I'll probably come back from time to time but it won't be a priority for me"}
{"text":"Good place to eat a quick snack and drink an adult beverage. Everyone including the people were fun and talkative. Great place to hang out after 5 pm waiting for the traffic to die down... Def worth going to."}
{"text":"Last night I was in the area and got a little bit indecisive where to go since there are so many places around South Park Mall. I've never heard about this place but when I saw the outside I did a little research and my husband and I decided to check the place out.
We got there there were no wait so we were sat right away. The waitress came to introduce herself be brought two glasses of water without us asking which I like. The decoration is very rustic and nice. They have a tree in the middle of the bar and they have a tree house painted in one of the walls. The place is cozy and there are wood everywhere. Even the restrooms have great decoration.

About the food...
I ordered a beef brisket nachos that were pretty good. The serving was more than I was expecting and I enjoyed my meal. My husband ordered a low country boil that didn't look like one. The portion size wasn't worth what was paid. Not to mention it had a very fishy taste. The shrimp which are normally my favorite seafood item were not that good. To the point I didn't eat them all. The sausage was the best part and some of the best I've had. 
Overall it seems like a good place depending on what you order, but for the value, I don't think we would go back."}
{"text":"The early reviewers should cut the staff some slack. I'd expect some glitches on opening day. 

I tried the half roasted chicken with corn succotash and apple slaw. Everything was delicious. I can see the patio becoming a very popular destination. My only complaint would be the weak mixed drinks at strong prices."}
{"text":"Came here about a month ago. Was not impressed with their signature drinks or service but their food is amazing! 

Best BBQ around! Best Sweet Potato Waffle Fries ever! 

Will definitely go back but only b/c their food is awesome. 

One small thing I would like to see changed: the BBQ sauce containers- they're cute but totally impractical for a restaurant. Super messy and gross looking with the old/congealed sauce all over the lid and opening."}
{"text":"Ah the late night grub out experience,, we were trying to find a different spot to eat since we arrived at the hotel late at night. I didn't really wanna go to smeesh smake factory since it was way too easy. Plus this spot was open later.

Anyways, we were a bit confused when we arrived since there was an outdoor bar with a pretty good crowd gathering. We sorta stood around for a little bit trying to figure out how things worked. There was no host station, so I don't know who to approach. So after around 5 minutes of standing around I go up to what seemed like a server. Asked her how things worked and said, \"please, take a seat wherever you like and I'll take care of you.\" So we chose a spot, sat down and experienced what this restaurant/bar is all about.

We ordered the pulled pork sliders and each did an \"Out and In\" burger. The food was pretty good,, it wasn't bad, but it was actually pretty good. I had the succotash as my side and it wasn't my favorite thing in the world. 

My beer was cold and served in a big glass,, the live music was very good and the service was impeccable. 

The food certainly isn't the focal point here in this spot. It's more the bar and the craft beers. That being said, order shareables,, it's better for the environment. 

It's deserving of a 4 star because of our awesome server. She took real good care of us. Even boxed up our food for us. That right there is GREAT customer service.

Weeeeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"Where to start...?? Got greeted when we walked in but then sat for 5 minutes as a hostess stared at us while seating on a crate or something at the front door, 2 servers cleaned the table off 3 feet away and never acknowledged us, and our eventual server who passed us three times before taking our order. Got our drinks in an acceptable amount of time, but then waited 20 minutes for our server to come back and ask if we wanted to order food. By that time, we decided the drinks were the only thing we were gonna get. When she came by to get the check, she didn't say a word to us. Just picked it up and left. Not that I was surprised, but she didn't even ask if we needed change. Just took the book and never returned. We did in fact need change but by that time, we just didn't care anymore. I'm sure we don't look like it, but my fiancé and myself have over 35 years in the restaurant and bar industry so it's not hard to spot a server with little care and even less skill. Some of the worse service I've seen in a long time. I'd love for someone from treehouse to comment on this or contact me. Not sure if the servers name, but she didn't seem to hesitate to jump the four top of guys that sat down next to us. Terrible job treehouse!!!!"}
{"text":"Forgot to write a review but every Monday I am reminded of the all u can eat crab legs. They were delicious in the ole bay seasoning. It came with corn, butter and biscuits that had jalapeño peppers in it. I love biscuits but I didn't like these.. The staff checked on us and brought us out more crab legs before we could finish each batch. We sat outside and it was a very nice ambiance. They have tvs and music playing and they are working on building a treehouse. If you love crab legs you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Decor is really interesting. Truly feels like your in a treehouse. Its mostly a BBQ place which surprised me. I am Gluten Free, they Dont offer a separate menu, I was able to get a salad. My friend and I ordered the same salad, they took forever to come out and were really expensive for what you get.

I also had trouble finding the place. Its hidden behind a building and GPS tells you to turn past the entrance!"}
{"text":"Good food - good service - good drinks

We ordered delicious appetizers and an abundance of craft beers. The other patrons and servers were chill and could vibe with the customers. 

Cool environment- I hope to return"}
{"text":"A lot of the reviews are mixed.  But the Argentinian Tacos are fabulous!  The service was good.  I would recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Over priced warm drinks and bad service. Cool atmosphere, but I hate to see this place at \"peak\" time. Tried here at 1:30 in the afternoon and waited quite a while for the worst drink I've ever had...\"mountain berry\"
No Miller Lite for either."}
{"text":"My fault! As stated by a fellow reviewer. I should have read the reviews. service was lacking ,prices shocking, food pathetic! If I had to say something positive Beer selection appeared ample. (PF Chang's was great by the way)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night with some friends for dinner. The place is cute and totally looks like a treehouse inside and out. We had no wait but the place was buzzing with ppl. Ordered the chips and queso to start. Not impressed at all. Cheese was not very hot, chips were not good. Concept was better than the dish. I ordered two tacos, Korean beef and the roasted shrimp. Not impressed with either. The Korean had lackluster flavor in the beef and was so wet it made the flour shell super soggy to the point I could not pick it up. The shrimp taco was more lettuce than shrimp. 

Not sure I would come back for food but maybe for a cocktail on the cute patio"}
{"text":"Expanded menu is great, atomosphere cozy. Can dress up since it's in South Park or go casual. Tacos are great as well as whiskey drinks. Husband said brisket was best he had in Charlotte and it was a huge portion of food!"}
{"text":"Let's start out positive....we were greeted in a timely fashion and sat quickly.  The whiskey menu was solid with blends we had never had other places.  The appetizer menu was decent but there was an item on it they no longer carried.  Our server Allyson was at a job she clearly felt to good for.  Her service was as if we were intruders on her evening But hey I get it anyone can have an off night...so maybe it was hers...The other servers were very pleasant, cheerful and friendly.
We ordered a cheese fondue which was okay...and hush puppies that were really good (I would have preferred a sweet butter instead of the dipping sauce)
I just ordered the turkey burger which was bland and the texture was strange.  My husband ordered a Cubian and it was ok he said.  
There are plenty of really good restaurants in the area and I will opt for any number over the Treehouse."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place today ,it looked like a fun spot to have lunch(11:45 am) however wait staff was rude from the door.  So my friend and I didnt feel comfortable spending our hard-earned coins there. But after reading the reviews looks like all I missed was a fun decor and nice outdoor setting . definitely not the food. Maybe it will be a next time when staff gets better. I must admit that outside looks amazing"}
{"text":"Not really sure why the low rating. We almost didn't come because.  But sure glad we did. Turkey burger was on point and the Beer Can chicken sandwich was good too.  Certainly not a 2.5 star place."}
{"text":"Blah. That is how I would describe our appetizer. We had the beer cheese fondue with bacon and jalapeños and it just didn't have any flavor. I've had this kinda app many different times and this was the worst one I have tried. We anticipated ordering an app and entree, but after the bland app we decided to just leave after the app. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Based on my first impression of the place I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was good, but everything had a sweet taste to it. Needed a little more salty than sweet. The chef was from the islands. So maybe that had something to do with it. Our waitress Gabby was good! We will be back."}
{"text":"Despite mixed reviews we tried this place on a Friday night because we had an entertainment book coupon. The only reason we're giving a second star is for the ambiance, the treehouse vibe is fun and different. The food and service left much to be desired. We started with the cheddar jalapeño biscuits which had a weird flavor and were clearly reheated, though not week since the bottom was cold and the top slightly warm. I then had the house salad with grilled steak as I want feeling too excited by my other options. The steak was pretty good but overall was nothing special and overpriced with an $8 up charge for the steak. My fiancé had the pork plate with Mac and cheese for the side. Though the pork was a large portion, it had no sauce and the Mac and cheese was bland. The coleslaw that came with the pork was laughably small, served in a metal condiment cup...for $16 you'd think a little bit more coleslaw could be added to plate. With so many great options in Charlotte, especially for bbq meats and tacos (many of the menu items) I would choose elsewhere. Also, our server certainly didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"We ate here the first time today. The BBQ was great. The Brioche bread was soft and perfectly toasted. The sauce was excellent -Whiskey Smoke. My side item was mav/cheese.  Let me say this as a Southern girl who is very critical of Mac/cheese.....IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!! Our waitress, Marina, was knowledgeable and attentive. The only reason we give it 4 stars is because the Apple Crisp was not very warm. We will return."}
{"text":"My team decided to meet here for lunch. Surprisingly we were able to be seated immediately.
The waitress was kind but obviously didn't know much about the menu items. She delivered our drinks quickly but it took roughly 45 minutes for our food to come out. Although there were 10 of us, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. When the food finally came out, 3 of the orders were wrong! Since I was so hungry at this point, I chose to overlook this issue but then it took another 30 minutes for her to bring the check. Overall the food was satisfying but nothing I'd recommend. This restaurant is in need of a restaurant consultant to review their processes and procedures."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday.  We sat inside and waited for 15 minutes and no one came to our table.  We saw other tables around us getting service and the waitress just seemed to ignore us.  We walked out.  Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was not! We went on lunch, the server forgot about us and it took forever to get our food. She said she would take care of our meals.  The Korean taco and pulled pork pork sandwich was great. Mac n cheese was ok.  Our server disappeared again with our check so we could tip her.  When we got it she was o sorry manager only wanted to take off 75%. We just paid and left... Might be back only for the food..."}
{"text":"Uh oh .... Did I just find my new favorite burger joint??? The out-in burger is amazing??  Nuff said"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - decor is thematic without being too kitschy. Looking forward to weather being nice again to sit on what looks like a good patio. Unfortunately, that was the best part of the evening. Tables are set close together, and noise level was high (bouncy acoustics). Food was only so-so - we had 7 different entrees around the table, all of which needed more seasoning. Strange that none of the pulled barbecue had sauce in a town and state that pride themselves on different styles and house secret/special condiments. Mixed drinks were very weak (sad for a whiskey joint), beer selection was okay. Starter salads were good size and looked very fresh. Service was casual but fairly attentive. We may be back to try the patio in spring - hope they will have found their style and settled into a groove by then!"}
{"text":"The food is good but I guess anything taste good when you're so hungry because you've waited 2 hours for the food. We had a large party tonight of 10 people and our waitress Abigail was trying her best, but the rude manager/bartender was no helpful whatsoever. She repeatedly made horrible tasting drinks and was hatful with even being asked make a different drink. Then when the table finally got their checks 4 people in our party including me sat there 45 minutes after the rest of our party left, and we were still waiting for our checks! The manager \"tried\" to help the waitress get the checks correct but gave up and walked passed us without saying anything. She didn't apologize for it taking so long or anything. So when we finally received our checks nearly an hour after the rest of our party left we paid out and gave the \"managers our feedback and she said she didn't realize there was an issue. She's horrible. She sucks. She should never work in customer service. But she is pretty good at flirting with the four guys that sat at the bar the three hours we are there and trust me she kept their drinks full."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for dinner and he suggested this place. I can't lie, after reading the reviews in Yelp I was not that excited to eat here. But I'm glad I did. 

The service was attentive, although I would've liked her giving us a bit more time to look over the menu in the beginning. I ordered the out and in burger without lettuce, tomato, or onion (I'm picky) so it was just the burger, cheese, and special sauce. It was fantastic. 

Seriously. I dream about going back just to have this burger. It had double patties, the meat to bun ratio was just right, and the sauce was fantastic. Highly recommend this burger if you visit."}
{"text":"Place has gone downhill. Service is mediocre, food isn't great. Worst ribs ever.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for the first time. Glad we didn't read the Yelp profile prior to coming here. Service was very prompt and friendly. Great selection of craft beer. My wife is a Bloody Mary aficionado and gave high mark to their pour. 

Ordered the Turkey burger and Korean tacos. We enjoyed both and tested out a number of the sauces.

Frankly, I don't understand the negative reviews. Seems to me to be a victim of Yelp-driven group think."}
{"text":"Showed up at restaurant. 3 servers around the hostess stand eyeing us down to make sure picking up a table at 8 o'clock would be worth their while. Apparently she was ready to go as soon as she picked up the table. Found a hair in my sausage, NO MANAGER CAME TO THE TABLE................She looked at me as if I did it myself.. Place is played out. Chick didn't even know her beer menu!!!!!!!! If your not in the mood to serve than get another job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere :4
Service: 2
Food: 0

Ordered pulled bbq chicken sliders. No bbq and chicken was cubed.  In all pretty much cut up chicken breast with coleslaw.  How can you claim it's pulled bbq chicken?

House fries cooked ok... however barely any cheese, a few squirts of bbq sauce and no chives. Boring. Needed ranch dressing to make it exciting.

Will only come back for a drink otherwise no need to waste money on less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember my servers name, but overall my experience was phenomenal. We had tacos and wings and both came out way better than expected. The atmosphere was super cool and the food even better. I am not sure if I can even say I've ever had better wings than theirs! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beware is all I can say. The tree house is one of those niche places with \"witty\" menu items like \"sticks\" instead of sides. The salad and soups are \"leaves and sap\" you get the point. Prices are way to high...bone in rib eye for $39!!!! It's a small interior with 10 bar stools. This place will be gone by summer 2015"}
{"text":"I really give Treehouse five stars for atmosphere and the great patio! However the food was just mediocre. 

We started with the salmon BLT sliders and the beer cheese dip. The sliders were good but had too much bread. The cheese dip was okay but I did love the chips they served with it. I liked the fact too that they put the sausage on the side since I don't eat meat but my friends could enjoy!

I ordered the fish and chips tacos which were pretty good. My side was the corn succotash which was not that good. It was obvious it was canned corn and there was meat in it. Although I mentioned to our waitress that I don't eat meat, she did not bother to tell me it had meat in it.

My friend ordered a hamburger and fries. Although a simple meal, she said the beef patty was overdone. The waitress never asked her how she wanted it cooked.

My other friend ordered the small barbecue plate. Let me tell you that thing was huge! When the manager came by to check on us, my friend mentioned she was surprised that no barbecue sauce was served with the plate. He said that three sauces should come with it, so he came out with those. But again our waitress never offered those. She also got the succotash and thought it was just okay. She got the grit cakes as well and said those were pretty good.

As a whole we decided we would go back for drinks as the patio was so cool! But probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Decent food but nothing spectacular. Pulled pork had a lot of fat.  Service was spectacular and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Met here with a group of friends who get together every month for dinner. This was our first time at Treehouse, and we liked the decor and outdoor patio. I appreciated that the menu had plenty of sides options for vegans and vegetarians. (The grilled corn was delicious!)

While we are a kind of loud group, we always treat our servers well and tip generously. But not so much tonight. 

Our server did her best to ignore us. One friend wanted an after-dinner drink, but gave up trying to flag our server. Our beverages were not refilled. A request for a plate to share dessert was unheeded the first time, then took extremely to be delivered after the second request.

There are way too many other restaurants in town for us to add Treehouse into our rotation of favorite restaurants. I'm glad we tried it, but I won't hurry back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is one of the best. I went on a nice sunny day, and they had the windows and doors open which was awesome. The tree in the middle of the restaurant adds character. The wings here are so yummy as well as the drinks. Everyone also had entrees and dessert. The entrees did not disappoint and the dessert was amazing!!

Our server (I am not aware of her names) was very attentive and upbeat. Overall, we had a great experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for overpriced low quality and  poor service this is the place.  $5.00 Tacos were a huge disappointment ordered Korean Beef and Grilled Shrimp received a pork something and a beef something that had no connection with a typical Korean taco. We were struggling to find something for our 4 year old and after placing our appetizer which were awful cheese quesadillas we asked our waitress if they had a Childrens menu. We ordered had already ordered our 4 year old something and was later told they did have a kids menu. Very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"I'm back here and guess what? Only reason Im here or would ever come back is \"Simplified\"! Unfriendly bartenders (females), no smiles, no hellos! So so disappointing! Still no Corona. I asked the manager tonight why they don't have Corona! He laughed at me, cut me off and said \"we will never carry Corona because we have 32 craft beers\"! Okkkkkkk, anyways..... Bud Light is $4 a bottle? Whatever!
Then I listened to that same manager (a black guy with glasses) bad mouth an incident he had with a rude customer, to people sitting at the bar! So, so unprofessional! This all went on while the owner was sitting drinking at the bar! The customer service is poor here! If the owner sits there and allows a manager to share a story with the bar customers about another customer, then now I know why customer service is so poor here! I recommend you spend your money elsewhere !"}
{"text":"There is no reason for us to come here and have our girls night anymore. No more all you can eat crab legs, even though it is still advertised on the menu and on the website. This was the only really awesome thing about the restaurant. We won't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and won't be back.  This is a bar that is loud, and also seems to have an early evening family crowd with young (loud) children.  The food and beverages are overpriced.  I had salmon sliders which were prepared with bacon and a sweet bbq sauce.  not very good.  My friend had onion soup which she had to send back.  

Hard to tell what crowd they are aiming for, but it seems to be all over the place.  The servers were however, friendly and accomodating.  Really need to work on the food."}
{"text":"A co-worker suggested we try something new for lunch and so here we are. The decor fits the name; very laid back but kind of cramped quarters. The staff was friendly but service was a bit slow. Once my burger arrived I had no complaints. It was huge and juicy with just the right amount of smokey flavor. The side of bacon cheddar grit cakes lacked both bacon and cheddar (that I could decipher), but were well made and had good flavor on their own. I won't write this place off just yet, I believe there is potential for redemption."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch at Treehouse probably 5-6 times over the last year.  I come to Southpark about once a month for business, and it's right next door to our regional office.  I've gotten the same thing every time I've been there- the brisket plate.  It's probably the best brisket I've had outside of Texas!  You have three options for the brisket- lean, fatty, and mixed.  The fatty is the most flavorful and usually what I get.  The deviled egg appetizer is really good.  The mac and cheese side is about as good as you'll get!  My co-workers swear by the brisket salad.

Service has been good- I've seen some negative reviews on Yelp about their service, but I've never experienced it.  On my most recent visit this week, our server Hayley was excellent.  Prompt, personable and attentive.  The outside seating is nice if the weather isn't too hot.  I'll probably keep coming here for lunch as much as my co-workers want to when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I ate a bad tater tot and got sick. My wife called and left her name and number. They said the manager would be in touch. We never heard back."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today, first thing I notice, seems pricey but it is south park so OK. I ordered the brisket sandwich and onion rings. The onion rings were a disappointment. They used the outer papery ring of the onion, the part that should be tossed, instead of the meatier part. The breading had no seasoning, very bland though texture was good. If you are only going to give 4 rings, make them good. Now the brisket sandwich, all (stale)bread, seriously where is the meat! Normally, I get a BBQ sandwich, take a few bites then eat the meat so I do not eat so much bread. Had I done that here, there would have been about two bites of food. This place is just not good. Service was friendly and attentive but since the place was empty, they did not have much else to do."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Had to walk to the bar to get out beers and the server never noticed or commented. Still waiting for the food... been more than 30 minutes. Brought an out of town friend. Embarrassing experience. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Staff is great, the artwork inside is off the chain and is a great atmosphere. Love this place when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Chris S.   Your review is absurd.  I was sitting next to you while you were here and you review soooooooo creeepy.  I see your not an elite yelper and thank goodness you are not cause your reputation around town is very well known.  CJ was not nice to you cause you were asking creepy questions and sooooo weird. I felt dirty listening to your questions. Please continue reviewing restaurants like Golden Coral and Red Lobster as this is your league."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, thanks Taylor B. We started with buffalo shrimp (maybe the best I've ever had) and Beer cheese dip, I think a house special. Both were incredible.
I had the fish n chips taco, very good! Great first visit and with 40+ draft beers, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Third time here and everytime it has been wonderful!  Food has been excellent and delivered with a smile. 
I really like the shaded patio. And it is dog friendly on the patio!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service left a lot to be desired.  I MIGHT give them a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"First time here.. I was a bit put off by all the food reviews but decided to try for myself. We were a big group ..I think 15 people so it was a bit stretched out for service time . The drinks were good! Ordered and Old Fashion made with Makers Mark... Everyone was pleased with their drinks. Appetizers were slow to come out, I ordered Avocado Eggroll but got to taste the Homemade chips which were great and the Jalopeno Poppers both of which were very good. I had the Turkey Burger, which had goat cheese in it .. It was small for the price and it was good.. not great but good. It seems like a cute place to go for a nice cocktail.. food is just average .."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on labor day for the Monday night all you can eat crab legs .... The crab legs were amazing ... The service was a little slow in the beginning and our apps of the jalapeño bacon bites (that were awesome) came out before our drinks but I think our server had the majority of the tables. She was very nice and once the crab legs tarted flowing our plates were never empty. You definitely have to try the crab legs they are some of best I have had here in Charlotte for all you can eat and the price of around $28.00 is well worth it. Not too much out of the ordinary on the rest of the menu. A large selection for whiskey drinkers though and we will be back for the crab legs.... Great experience."}
{"text":"This place was great once. The good point seated right away ,but got screwed because we got the bartender as our server. I should of known better than to go on a Sunday after 12 . She spent half the time talking to friends at the bar and outside. The manager on duty was more interested in spandex outside ..Sorry but this place needs a rehab...Also if you order the beer fondue your just the same crap you get from the grocery store in a jar heated up . So sad .."}
{"text":"An intensely mediocre experience.  We asked for a beer list, and I wound up having to go to the bar to get them myself just as the food arrived.  The first two beers I asked for were not available, and I cannot stand playing beer-list guessing games, especially as my food is sitting on the table getting cold(er).  One of the worst barbeque sandwichesI've ever had- it was dry, flavorless, cold, and served on a bun made of cardboard.  The second star belongs to the manger.  She was sweet, apologetic, and comped the entire meal.  She also offered a gift card, but I declined.  This is North Carolina, we know barbeque, and if you can't bring it, you shouldn't try.  This place won't be open this time next year."}
{"text":"This place has the worse wings I have ever had. I ordered buffalo & smoked, they were dry and cold.  I had such high hopes for this cute little location. I have heard and read many bad reviews but wanted to give it a try. I probably will not return.  I only gave it one star because you cant post without a rating."}
{"text":"A terrific find in SouthPark, Treehouse offers a tremendous selection of craft beers, cocktails and whiskies, along with good food and friendly service. Oh, and did I mention the great deck for outdoor dining?

The diverse means there's something for almost every palate, from succulent BBQ Pork to burgers, tacos and salads. On a recent visit, I enjoyed a tasty Cubanito sandwich, while my wife enjoyed a delicious plate of Brisket. Add in the kid-friendly setting and great tap menu, and Treehouse is likely to become a worthy addition to our family-night-out rotation."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday with a group of friends who mentioned a new place opening up with lots if whiskey selections.

They didn't have what I was looking for so I went with a Johnny Black on the rocks. Hard to mess up you with think? It was ALL ice - I literally got 1 sip out of it. I know what a $10 pour of Johnny black looks like, and I sure didn't get it. I was pretty disappointed. Other people in my group got some wine. $9 Pinot Grigio and the pour they got was extremely lacking (3 ounces, if that). They ordered a second round once we sat down and even after letting the waitress know that the pour was small the first time (assuming it was human error) she came back and said that it was a standard pour for them. If that's the case they should be charging $4.50/glass. 

The food - it wasn't bad, it wasn't great. The beer cheese dip was pretty good and the salmon sliders were tasty, but lacked salmon. I also had the Brisket Sandwich and that was VERY good. It came with bacon cheddar deep fried grit cakes - unfortunately the only thing you can taste in that is GRITS.

I will give this place another shot as they are just getting up and running, however I will be in no rush to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Complete disappointment.

Went there because we were looking for a place to watch the Derby. When you walk in its very impressive. The decor is beautiful, patio looked great and lots of whiskey but beyond the appearance they fell flat.

We got a table inside so we could watch the Derby on one of their many TVs unfortunately they didn't turn the sound on so we almost missed the start.

I ordered the Shrimp and grits and a Mint Julep. The mint julep wasn't on their menu but the waitress didn't question it. I'm not sure what we got but it wasn't a mint julep - it was CLEAR! 

The shrimp and grits came with 6 tiny shrimp and the only flavor in the entire dish came from the BBQ sauce drizzled on top. At least the BBQ sauce was good but if I wanted good BBQ sauce I would have ordered BBQ.

My boyfriend got the brisket with the Mac and cheese. Which I tried...as in I ate almost half. The brisket was decent and Mac and cheese was actually great but for $18 I was expecting a little more than decent brisket and great Mac and cheese. There are way to many amazing BBQ places in Charlotte that charge way less. 

To me this place just seems like a lot of smoke and mirrors."}
{"text":"Yes indeed it is a little hidden, however that is part of its charm. Went for brunch and ate outside under the trees. I had two tacos, one jerk chicken and one Texan ground beef. Food was good, service was great and the surroundings were above par.  I will be back for dinner on the patio. Considering the surrounding restaurants (some of them my favorites) this is a positive change of pace."}
{"text":"Great food, a little overpriced.

Only giving this place 3 stars because even if they don't take reservations on the weekend. My party of 11 was even 30 minutes early AND we even still had to wait 45 minutes after the time we were all supposed to meet. The hostesses did not do much to help."}
{"text":"So bad. So bad. So bad. Don't go. Ever. Don't even want to give this place a 1. Second crappy food visit."}
{"text":"Awesome decor.  Weak, weak BBQ game.

I grabbed a meal here at the end of my Charlotte work summer as the final stop on my BBQ tour.  The atmosphere inside is truly unique and definitely worth stopping by for a beer to check out.  The food however is weak.  Brisket was not good, reminded me of crock-pot roast beef.  Sides were fine.

Get a drink and then go to Midwood, or if you aren't a BBQ snob swing by American Burger Company down the street."}
{"text":"The most amazing BBQ EVER! I've had brisket in Nashville & this place tops it. We ordered a sampler platter & a full rack of ribs for a family of 4. We all shared & it was plenty of food. The ribs fall right off the bone, so tender & the flavor was sweet with just a touch of heat! #perfection 

On the sampler platter we had salmon, shrimp, pulled pork & brisket. Everything was fenominal. The service was fast & attentive. The tree house atmosphere was so laid back & chill. We will definitely be frequenting here!"}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment for a restaurant in a prime location!  Look forward to the new tenants soon because this place is not going to make it! 

Cons 
1. Wine prices for the amount of wine you receive - very tiny glasses
2. Under cooked food (vegetables served not even par cooked basically raw)
3. Food being served not how it's described on menu (turkey burger should be topped with cheese) 
4. Servers are not customer pleasing (in so many words was told I was either stupid or blind) not very knowledgable on menu 
5. A manager that needs to attend ' restaurant management' formal education. Didn't seem to know how to handle a difficult situation. 

Pros
1. Location

Overall a very disappointment experience for our family. 
Red flag any restaurant that's not busy on a Saturday night should make you think twice...   
Lastly, huge failure on our part that we didn't check reviews before we stepped foot inside! Had we read the reviews we would not have wasted our time or $$."}
{"text":"Disappointing service and food.  My wife and I sat at the bar for dinner and a drink.  A manager got our drink order.  We then had to wait at least 10 minutes before the bartender spoke to us, and even then did not ask if we would like to order.  The bar was not busy at this time, very poor service.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and my wife had the pulled chicken sandwich.  The sandwiches were okay, but the big disappointment were the \"hand cut fries\".  They tasted like frozen fries.  We were never offered a second round of drinks and our water glasses were never refilled.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a low key bar in Southpark....unfortunately I probably won't return. The bar tender was so rude and thought she was the coolest thing ever. Terrible martini, she was drinking her own drink on the bar out of a straw and was on her phone ..the worst part, the girls behind the bar kept flinging their hair everywhere and running their fingers through it and then making drinks without washing their hands. Bartender said she works uptown at Suite on the weekends - her behavior and long hair may work there but not for us.  We weren't given an itemized receipt so have no idea how much each of our drinks were however we were asked to start a tab with credit card ( I guess two folks in professional clothing are a flight risk at a Southpark bar at 5pm??)
They allowed someone to smoke a cigar on the patio that drifted smoke into the place.
The manager seemed to like flirting with the bartenders more than caring about getting patrons service. 
Music was really loud for 5 pm on a Thursday.  
Didn't even try the food because we were so turned off by the bartenders we left.
Pretty sure the 5 star review prior to mine was done by  a server who works there...."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Wednesday night while in town for work.

The decor inside the restaurant is really nice.  We sat outside on the patio which is great.  They had live music.  The patio vibe reminds me of being in Key West.  Unfortunately this was the best part of this place.

The food was just ok, nothing that made me think I definitely have to come back here.

Shared the cornbread with maple butter with a coworker.  The bread was served with maple butter and was ok, not the best I have ever had but not the worst.

Ordered the Hickory Smoked Salmon BLT sliders.  You get three sliders so it was the prefect size for dinner.  I ordered the corn succotash as the side.  Again both were ok, but nothing making me feel like I have to come back here to try other items on the menu.

Considering there are some really good restaurants in the area that I enjoy, I don't think I will be adding this one into my rotation."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner with three other friends.  We went on Monday night for the all you can eat Crab Legs.  The Restaurant was crowded but the service was extremely slow.  We sat for about 15 minutes before ever being greeted.  We asked the manager about it and finally a waitress came and took our drink and food orders. It took a very long time to get our food. 
We did notice that others that were seated after us were getting their food and we still were not so we inquired again and we received our food.  We had to ask each time we needed service, ie drink refills, food order, etc.  The food was very good.  We had crab legs, buffalo shrimp and jalapeno poppers. We had no complaints about the food.  The biggest issue was the service and how slow it was. It was slow to get greeted, slow to get drinks, refills only when requested and slow to get food. Disappointing that the food is good but the service not so much."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty cool but we were really underwhelmed by this place. The beer cheese dip was not a dip by any means it was watery liquid cheese. The chips were great that went with it though. I had the Salmon salad and the salmon was actually very good. The service was OK. I wasn't really loving the menu. We ended up here bc Baku was closed for lunch and we didn't realize this was a BBQ place. From the other reviews I guess I didn't miss anything by not ordering the BBQ."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is low priced and the service is amazing and the food is too. the all you can eat crab legs on Monday are to die for and very kid friendly! there are tv's for your favorite sports channels and they have a great outside patio and bar. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"This seems like a fun place.  We went in for a couple of drinks just to check it out.

The food we saw coming out was looking decent and it was busy.

I think we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The server was very nice but the food was completely trashed. I expected the food to be a little better the Mac & cheese taste like it came out of a box and the hot wings didn't please me at all. Wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto and into the Treehouse after visiting Southpark around noon. After swallowing hard at the prices we settled on water to drink and three cheese cassideah and brisket sliders, $19.48 without tip. The food was passingly ok but nothing to brag about. Maybe a few drinks and it would be more filling and a lot more expensive."}
{"text":"I live near SouthPark and I am so sad if a new restaurant takes a potential location and then doesn't try hard. If I owned a restaurant I would tell a wait person that it is essential to refill drinks. Ours were never refilled so the meal is somewhat ruined when you are watching for your waitress in hopes that you can flag her down so you don't choke. You eventually give up and that makes the meal unpleasant. Refilling a customer's glass is the most basic part of waiting tables. When the waitress brought our check and my daughter asked for water, she took her glass only and I said, \"I'm sorry. We are just parched.\"  She responded very sweetly, \"It's okay!\"...  What?!? But, I will say, she was pleasant and sweet on the 2 occasions we saw her. My plate of smoked pork was not the NC pulled pork I was expecting. It is cut pork. Pulled pork is slow cooked so the grease cooks off and the pulling allows the remainder to go by the wayside. I am not exaggerating when I say that there was a good 1/4 cup of yellow grease running from the meat. Yuk. Do they not own a slotted spoon? I have eaten out with my family almost every night for 10 years and this is the first review i have written. There is no excuse not to train your wait staff (she is sweet; she would listen, I am sure) and not to train your cook staff that meat swimming in grease is not appetizing (there was a lot of fat on the meat still- yuk). 
     The atmosphere is nice and the tater tots (is that food?) were good and there were lots of them. 
     This last comment will sound picky but it is my family's pet peeve so this is a good opportunity to complain about it (this is not particular to Treehouse; it happens everywhere). So we were hungry and this mom doesn't cook. Therefore, we ate the food. The waitress had no idea that I got napkins to soak up the grease and then used a different plate to transfer the meat because she was not around to check on us. So she arrives with the bill and says \"Well, I don't need to ask if you liked it!\"  When wait persons say that, I want to say \"No, it was crappy but we paid a lot for it and we are hungry.\" If you are a pig and eat your food, a waiter never asks if you enjoyed your meal. There is almost always a snide comment that they think is so funny. Maybe you skinny people don't know that; or maybe it does not bother you. But this hungry working girl eats her food and a classy, mannerly waiter should never comment on how much a person eats. (I still tip 20-25% but wanted  to get that last complaint off my chest!). 
     Treehouse, you seemed to stop your good efforts at the decorating stage. You can do better."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS SO GOOD. 
It was my boyfriends birthday and we had the bacon wrapped jalapeños. Honestly we get these a lot at other places but we agree that these were the best. You could tell the serves were genuine, our server (Cara, or Claire can't remember sorry) was awesome. She made great recommendations! We both got pork BBQ. I had sliders which were so good and perfectly portioned for someone who wasn't terribly hungry. He got a pork BBQ burger with  sweet potato fries. Those fries were the #1 fries we'd both ever had. Seriously recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to get drunk, not the greatest food to absorb it. My boyfriend and I really wanted to love this place as he is a big bourbon drinker. The cornbread was delicious but the Mac n cheese was gross. We shared some apps and a combo bbq plate which was much smaller than expected. They have lots of flavored sauces but very run of the mill. They milkshakes sounded good but we were too full of beer to try.
Our waitress really sucked too, she was careless and inattentive."}
{"text":"5-stars all the way. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Everything is absolutely delicious and the service is superb!
Loved the pork belly & sliders appetizers."}
{"text":"Super cute concept.  Very visually appealing.  Parking = not enough of it.  Service = servers were visually cute, but not too fast.  I get that they're trying to be sexy in their little overalls, but wow- some of their shorts are so skin tight that it's leaning towards gross to look at.  

I ordered the beer can chicken with 2 sides.  I got the grit cakes and corn succotash, neither were amazing and neither would I order again.  My friend built her own burger and got sweet potato waffle fries that were very tasty.  The sweet tea wasn't very sweet and they didn't have any to go cups  :-(  We were sad that they were on a limited menu and didn't offer creme brulee, so we got the pumpkin cheesecake to go instead.  We were shocked at how small the slices were for $10 each!  WOW!  (mental note:  no dessert at the Treehouse!)

It's pretty clear that the Treehouse is all about making money on their whiskey and beer.  The food seems like a complete sideline revenue stream, at least at this point.  And it's pretty pricey for what you get:  We ordered chicken with 2 sides, 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 cheesecakes and 2 sweet teas for $61 before tip."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! I love the treehouse theme, the food and drinks were awesome and the TV is huge. Perfect for game day! We will definitely be going back. The outside patio is so fun, there is a good variety of music playing and the waitresses are all so friendly. We got the beer battered okra, hush puppies and baked beer cheese dip for starters. All were good, hush puppies were the best. The wedge salad was top notch, and the BBQ was ok. If you're a true North Carolina BBQ lover/snob, you might not be impressed but all the other food is delicious.   Lastly, the chocolate milkshake was AMAZING. Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Service and front of house need a bit of work. Terrible service, even for sitting at the bar. The restaurant had 15 patrons, max. Two servers proceeded to have a profanity laced conversation in front of me about fellow co-workers. Hey, the profanity is cool by me, but I have enough drama in my life, I don't want to hear about yours while I'm paying for an experience. Food and ticket time was good. This place just lacks heavily in the service department."}
{"text":"We went here for after dinner drinks at Cheesecake factory just across the street. When we entered, I immediately fell in love with the tree house aesthetic. It was fun. It was different. It was cool. Drinks are pricey however. But, I was impressed with the draft selection! It was very crowded by the bar, people were standing there and not at the tables. So we grabbed a table and the waitress came right over to us. I would definitely come back with a larger group. Just a warning-it does get rather loud in there!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but that's about it. The service was absolutely terrible, like the worst I've experienced in Charlotte. The hostess was slow and spacey and the waitress was awful. We had to ask for things multiple times like drinks, napkins and condiments. Drink refills came in one big glass, that everyone at the table had to share and pour in their own glass. I never saw a drink pitcher. The crab legs did not come with butter or lemon. Also, they ran out of crab crackers, so all of the claws went to waste because we couldn't open them. They brought my husband a salmon dish when he had ordered a sandwich and no one apologized for it. Even when things slowed down later in the night, the waitress still seemed too busy to care. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Another not-so-good review of this recently opened restaurant.  Unfortunately, the service was so slow that we only received one person's order (a salad, but hey, the mustard dressing was pretty good!).  We waited easily over an hour for the barbecue order which never came and no apologies from the wait staff.

Also, we asked our server-in-training some questions on the food, and she was unable to answer as she's never tried them because she is vegetarian. Honestly, I know it shouldn't matter, but it's hard to trust someone who would never try the food there. Unfortunately, that was the most memorable part.

I may try to come back but it looks like the food that people did get to eat wasn't worth it anyways.  

Verdict: wait and see"}
{"text":"I really like the environment this little restaurant has to offer! 3 stars because of the customer service. Every time we walk in the girls who are seating tables don't even crack a smile nor ask if you want to sit inside or outside they just walk you over to the table and flop down the menus and walk away. We went a few weeks ago when it was very chilly outside but they have a lot of heaters so we decided to grab a drink at the outside bar and sit at a table next to one of the heaters. We were told we weren't allowed to sit there unless we were having dinner. Keep in mind it was probably 40 degrees outside so NO ONE was sitting outside eating dinner...i don't even think there were people working outside other than the bar. We weren't taking up any space or tables, we just wanted to have a drink to get out of the way because it was crowded inside. We went back on black friday for lunch and our waitress was nice, she was a little slow and got forgetful at times but she did tell us it was her first week working here so she wasn't familiar with all the food or drinks yet which was fine we appreciated her honesty. She forgot to bring my brisket chili so i told her she could cancel it because I was stuffed anyway but she was kind enough to put it in a container for me and took it off the bill. The food is OK, i prefer Jim and Nicks or Midwood Smoke house for good BBQ but i truly go here for the atmosphere and environment. It is great to go here in the spring or summer and sit outside and just chill."}
{"text":"Bartenders suck. Non attentive, oblivious, food mediocre at best.. need friendly and more attentive behind bar, including checking on their patio guest!!!! They will leave ppl out there for hours"}
{"text":"Food was okay but honestly Liz was the best thing about our meal. she was sweet and right on point. Work on food, service was great."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Treehouse Whiskey and Fork and it was not a good experience. Overall the restaurant is not busy at lunch time. We were easily seated and got waited on. The issues came from the food and the attentiveness of our server. 

We ordered the baked beer cheese dip. The menu description says there is smoked sausage inside. There wasn't. They did add crumbled bacon on top. The real issue came from us requesting there be no tomatoes in the dish. It came out with tomatoes on top. The server was quick to fix the issue and said they would remove the item from our bill. However when the bill was presented it was still on there. We were in a time crunch so I didn't have time to dispute it with the server and just paid for the item. Also when our main entrees came out I asked for sweet potato waffle fries as my side item. I was given regular fries. Since they had already messed up one item we ordered and we're going to comp it off the bill I decided not to make a big issue about it and just eat what was presented to me. But when I got the bill and saw that they hadn't comped the appetizer I wish I had of spoken up. 

Overall  the food and the service here has always been below average. I will not be back and won't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I doubt if I will return. My wife and I got the BBQ combo plate with pulled pork, brisket, beer can chicken, and ribs. The brisket tasted like pot roast and the pulled pork kinda tasted like the brisket. The ribs were okay, but there are so many other places that have far better ribs. The chicken was above average, but nothing worth returning for 

For an app we got the smoked wings.  Decent flavor, but fatty. How can wings be fatty?

The service was mediocre. The server was nice, but her knowledge of the menu was limited. I asked her a question and she had to take the menu from me and look at the description. 

The concept is too cute. Little Branches=Appetizers. Too cute. 

The only good thing was the nice selection of bourbon."}
{"text":"This place has a lot potential. The food was very good! The bartender & waitress were very nice & helpful. The hostesses were not. They were indifferent to the fact that I stood in front of them at the hostess stand for several minutes while they talked. After telling them I had a party of 5, they wrote nothing down.  Finally, I asked if they needed my name & they took it. It was bizarre. Our food took a while to get, but it was very tasty. The corn succotash was amazing. This was a good place to watch a game. I think if they work on the speed and accuracy of service it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came to Treehouse this past Sunday; we live in the area and thought we would try it out for a late lunch. The restaurant is hidden off of the road and parking is limited, but it was not an issue when we were there. The inside decor was very cool; there's a tree in the center with branches expanding over all of the tables, rustic-industrial light fixtures, and faux moss and logs on the walls. Our waitress was friendly. Beers on tap were almost all craft brews, which was awesome!

I ordered the turkey burger stuffed with goat cheese with a side of Mac and cheese. I wish the burger had more goat cheese in it; otherwise the flavor was good. Juicy burger, toasted bun. The mac and cheese was cheesy and had a little breadcrumb Parmesan crust on top. Others at the table ordered the grilled cheese with sweet potato waffle fries (noted the sandwich had a very strong Gruyere cheese flavor and other cheeses couldn't be tasted; crispy yet soft fries) and the hickory smoked brisket sandwich with pickled cabbage on top (noted that it needed more BBQ sauce).

We would definitely come back again to try some of the other items. It was raining when we went, so next time I would also like to sit outside."}
{"text":"The brisket , sweet potato fries and macaroni and cheese are amazing! The restaurant was a pleasant surprise late hours and  great service!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Seated outside, no one came by for 10 minutes. Manager acted confused when we pointed this out as a problem. Went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really good double bacon cheeseburgers w  shrooms .. great outdoor seating and weather is fantastic :)"}
{"text":"If i could give this place negative stars i would! I sure hope this establishment has changed their staff and management since they've first opened their doors. I work close by and was hoping this could be a nice place to catch lunch but boy have I been let down every time I've gone. Granted the food was always good but some things are overpriced on their menu. I think the biggest killer for me is the lack of customer service time after time after dining here that i haven't bothered to return.
The icing on the cake for me was the very last time i came here. I was with my colleague and hands down i think i had the worst service ever in my life and experience some underlying form of racism. We came for lunch and there had to been no more than 6 tables being served and that was including ours. They had the bartender serve us and she was doing the best that she could i guess?!?!?
There were at least 4 to 5 other servers and a manager on the floor. Its funny how they all managed to make rounds at the other tables, hell sometimes even piggybacking on tables but yet never stop onced at ours to see if we needed anything. I found it hilarious that we were the only minorities at the establishment dining there at the time and go figure the bartender who served us was a minority herself. On that note, both my colleague and i have never returned since. #endrant"}
{"text":"The stars are mostly for outdoor dining. I love a nice deck with good lighting. 

The food is okay. I'm a NC BBQ snob, so I don't order BBQ in Charlotte due to the fact I am always disappointed. I did enjoy the shrimp tacos. They are pretty small to be priced at $5 a pop. 

I will say this place is full of handsome, middle aged men. ALL THE SINGLE LADIES! 
With that being said the beautiful female waitstaff will not pay any attention to you if you're female. I get it, you go where the money is, and I'm sure an older male is more likely to pay you a 200% tip than I, but still! 

I will be back. Probably just for drinks, but the deck and men are worth it ;)"}
{"text":"Man, should've checked Yelp before trying this one. Somehow we spent over a hundred bucks on 3 cocktails, 3 tacos (with no accompaniments), a very fishy tasting ceviche (clearly made with previously frozen fish), and a \"fondue\" dip that tasted identical to our gross soggy brisket nachos (because the nachos were slathered in that same dip). And that's it. It wasn't very much food and the food wasn't good. There were so-so stale tasting corn chips served with 3 out of 4 of the things we ordered. The food was boring, redundant (as noted; fondue = nachos), not fresh, and overpriced. Our waitress couldn't answer any questions about the cocktails - her excuse was \"I'm 19 yrs. old\". Yeah, I get that, but you're working at a restaurant that literally keeps over 20 different types of whisky on tap....you need to have some background knowledge about the products you're selling. Pick up a book or something. Decor's a bit hokey (giant fake tree inside), outdoor seating is fair (basically you're siting in a parking lot). Wouldn't go back to this place and I recommend you don't bother. Even the drinks, which they specialize in, were totally disappointing (too sweet, too much ice - booze too watered down). I'd give a 1.5 star rating if Yelp would allow."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and outdoor seating, our waitress was Melanie she was a very knowledgeable and really sweet. Will be back."}
{"text":"A hip original layout with plenty of outdoor seating.  Casual menu with attentive staff."}
{"text":"So, second time here, and its sealed the deal for me, a solid two stars. Here's my take- this place is probably a great place if your goal is to drink. On the weekends. If the goal is Friday lunch, just don't go.

Let's start with the front of the house issues: hostess is kind of quick, curt, but, whatever- summer lunch help. 

We sit down, and the server strolls up, asks if we want anything, oh, she's in the restroom? I'll be back. Back, as in, I'm the bartender. I'm covering this table, when I have time. She takes her time, because, well, she's got paying bar customers. We sit and look over the menu for a while, decide it's not a the day for $5 tacos, and we decide on our drinks, at least. And we wait. And then we get some service, and I order beer, and she orders a sweet tea. And we wait, and when the bartender comes back, she tells me the keg that I ordered from had been 86'd. Would I like something else? I try again. When she comes back to get our food order, and oh by the way, drop off the tea, well, that keg had been 86'd, but here's a flight of unrelated sort of beers, would you like one of these? I know that she was sure that these were still on tap, since she just pulled them, but, can I see the menu? I order something else. I get it.

The food was really kinda lame. Bar food. Nothing special, even for a place that exists in a town where bar food can be good. The Cuban sandwich (the \"Cubanito,\" which came out normal-sized), was passable. The \"pulled barbecue chicken sandwich\" was none of that. It was braised and chopped, no smoke, and dry. it had a pile of bacon on top of it to make up for the lack of sauce and smoke. Oh, and the cucumber salad needed a lot less of whatever that dressing was that it was swimming in (creamy italian- do they even make that anymore?), as \"oily, chunky gazpacho\" wasn't part of the description.

In the end, this looks like a great place to come after work and drink. The decor is fun, and I'm sure that the fratty, yell-at-your-friends-over-the-music scene is the vibe that they are trying for. They definitely achieve that here.

TLDR; Drink, don't eat, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The decor is the best thing going for this place . The service sucks and the staff is just weird. They are either all new or not trained . The waitress took along time to take my order and the very simple order seemed to confuse her. The food was not good at all. I ordered a buffalo chicken salad . It taste like a taco salad instead of a buffalo salad. No plans to return and wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here"}
{"text":"90 degrees outside and they have the bar window open, so eating inside felt like outside. I was sweating during dinner and couldn't wait to get out. Complained to waitress and was told the owner won't let them close the window. She was sweating too. 

Guess the 2 customers at the outside bar counter bring in more money than the customers inside. Will never go again when it is hot outside! 

Food and service was good, but it was so hot it made the entire meal miserable."}
{"text":"Warning! This is the worse dining experience I've ever had. 

Let me break it down..
After a 40 minute wait we were seated. 
10 minutes later a waitress came to take our order. We ordered drinks and food (it was all you can eat crab leg night so it made the decision easy).
25 minutes later our crab legs came - cold. 
10 minutes after that our drinks came. Drinks came after the food!!
They were out of crackers so we could not eat the crab legs. An additional 15 minutes later they found one. There were two of us. 
Our waitress came by probably another 20 minutes later. We ordered more crab legs. They didn't come for another 20-30 minutes. 

Summary: worst service I've ever had. So disappointing because it's a really cool vibe. Great patio too."}
{"text":"Cool patio and outdoor bar! Went last night for the first time. Just had some drinks and apps. It was a cute spot. Good crowd, but not crazy and we had no trouble getting a table on the patio. The service was on point. I ordered bacon wrapped meatballs which were the special appetizer. The waitress had me sold at bacon wrapped. Good flavor and portion size. I also got barbecue homemade potato chips. Nothing special but they were tasty. Very light, not too heavy or greasy. I'd probably give this place more like 3.5 stars. It wasn't \"phenomenal\" but a solid \"good\". It's just a very laid-back, chill kind of spot to go to. I could see myself going there as an after work spot or for some spring/summer daytime drinking."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nothing that I had was mind blowing. They do have a nice selection of draft beers. Several people in my party stated that the sweet potato fries were really good. I thought the brisket was a little dry as another reviewer stated. Not bad but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"My hubs and I received  food poisoning here for the first time in our lives. Called to report it and of course they denied. Weird decor and bad food. Stay away unless you want to get sick."}
{"text":"Treehouse is an interesting place. The beer and whiskey lists are good. Food is terrible. Atmosphere is ok. Servers are young women with tight, low-cut clothing which is annoying. Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews for Treehouse. My husband and I decided to try it out shortly after it opened, as it's right near our chiropractor's office, and we had a great experience. The food was delicious and they had an awesome beer selection. Generous pours too!

We tried the jalopeno poppers as an appetizer, and they were to die for. I don't normally order jalopeno poppers (not a big fan of \"bar food\") but these were so good. For an entree, I had the smoked beer can chicken and loved it. 

Since that first visit, I know my husband has been back a few times for appetizers and drinks and the service has always been good. The two of us revisited again a few weeks ago for a couple of beers and we ordered the pulled chicken sliders appetizer to snack on before having dinner at our chiropractor's office. They were fantastic. We really enjoyed the branding / concept as well. The servers wear overalls and there is a tree in the middle of the restaurant and a large wooden swing out front which gives it a genuine, casual, at-home feeling. Very cool place. We highly recommend at least trying it out - especially if you like southern comfort food, whiskey and/or craft beer!"}
{"text":"After enjoying a nice dinner in Charlotte, I decided to stop in for a drink at Treehouse. What a mistake that turned out to be. Upon entering the place was about 50% occupied, with much of the staff appearing quite relaxed. We were greeted and seated promptly, but after waiting for upwards of 15 minutes without being greeted, I realized coming here was a mistake. I observed the servers making their rounds to each of their tables, even greeting those sat after me. At this point my frustration rose, and I walked out, stopping at the hostess stand to inform her of my experience. She just looked at me with a blank face. I will not be giving them another chance, and would encourage anyone else not to go either."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food but the service was excellent. It seems like an after work watering hole for the business folks in the south park area. Don't know if I'll be back but wouldn't say no.  Some solid top-heavy bartenders too."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place out. The decor was adorable and the service was pretty good, but found their food to be just okay. I tried two different tacos, one was okay, but the jerk chicken was awful. I even asked the waitress if it was in fact jerk chicken and she said it was and I told her I didn't like it at all. I didn't even it and mind you one taco with nothing else is $5. She didn't take it off the bill, which shows me they aren't interested in customer service."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Atlanta and drove around Charlotte looking for a place to have dinner and and saw the green neon sign that said Treehouse Fork and Whiskey and had to check this place out. Boy are we glad we did! Dave, the general manager, is one of the nicest people I've ever met running a restaurant and Melanie our waitress has been super nice. The food here is outstanding and I would highly recommend the brisket nachos as an appetizer. Not to mention the numerous craft beers they have on draft. Excellent choice and we will definitely come back to the next time we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came in last night to grab a weeknight dinner with my boyfriend. The decor is quite unique and I appreciate that as it provides a very comfortable vibe. However, be prepared for it to be loud inside due to small spacing and close quarters to other tables. Not going to be the place to go if you want to have intimate conversation. There was live music being played from the patio and though we were seated inside, they have speaker hookups in the inside dining room to enjoy it as well. The patio does appear to be extremely cozy but we were seated inside because they simply said they only had availability inside. (Unsure why we were not at least offered to wait). 

We were seated and greeted by a sweet waitress whom provided excellent and personable service. We never had to ask for anything due to her being extremely attentive. The food, however, was not my favorite. I will say I appreciate that they have some vegetarian options at a restaurant that focuses on BBQ, but to tag onto that, I do want to suggest that they also consider offering gluten free bread/buns.  I had the portobello sandwich with cucumber salad on the side (the waitress did double check with the kitchen if there was GF bread because she was unsure, she then apologized profusely that they did not). The sandwich was only okay for me, but had a combination of flavors that had potential to be great, so I am unsure of what happened. It was also a little saltier than I prefer. It did hold its form and was easy to eat which sometimes is difficult to get in a meat-free patty. The cucumber salad was also only mediocre, odd mixture of flavors. My boyfriend had the smoked chicken sandwich (he enjoyed their addition of sprinkled bacon on top) and though he completed it, he unfortunately does not rank it high on his list of \"bests\". Fries as his side were fairly plain, he had to season with pepper. He also feels the BBQ sauces were \"standard\". (*As a side note I think a few typos and spelling errors should be fixed on the menu for a professional establishment*)

Overall, this will not be a place that we will return to on our own, it is just not for us. However, I can see that maybe if you want whiskey and/or low-key late night bites without high expectations you could give this place a try, heck it might be a better experience for you. But for us, we will be enjoying other options."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating as the food was delicious! The staff was also very kind and helpful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Normally, I really like this place. However, my most recent experience a month or so ago, I left my credit card after paying in the bill folder which was my fault. I flew out of town the next day and figured it out then. So, my girlfriend called them to verify they found it. They had. She drove there to get it and nobody could find it and told her it wasn't in the lost card folder basically telling her she must not have called them. She left. I had a pending transaction on my card so I called and they said it was probably just a pre-tip amount and would go away. Then, an hour later, another transaction was pending on my card! I had no idea what was going on so I called the manager and told him that someone in the restaurant was using the card. He stopped a guy who was just leaving. He had the same type of credit card as mine. So, when they pulled my lost card, they accidentally gave it to a customer who used it at the bar and for his food in two transactions (not knowing it wasn't his card). Anyway, I had to drive back there a day or so later and the manager gave me my card finally but offered no true apology. I would expect at least a discounted if not complimentary meal since we had to call them several times and drive there a couple of times. We visited this place often and haven't been back. 

Update 8/14/2017
They no longer have 1/2 price cocktails on Mondays."}
{"text":"I work in  South Park and found it while delivering a check to an office next to the restaurant. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere, food selection and  service.

Give it a try...you won't be disappointed  despite the negative reviews, especially if you have kids!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend for their \"good barbeque\" and cool atmosphere. Tried it for lunch. Could be a generation gap but the waitress had purple hair and nose piercings. Immediately realized I was in the wrong place. Had the Korean taco as an appetizer. Tasty enough but mostly tortilla and not much filling. At $5.00 for a tortilla with less than an ounce of meat, some cilantro and a secret sauce it simply wasn't worth the price. BBQ sandwich was ok. Bun was nice and soft but the meat filled half the bun. Sweet potato fries came out cold and less than crisp. 

Didn't try the bar offerings since it was at lunch but heard the table next to us that did say the drinks were watered down and overpriced. The place just isn't special enough to earn a return visit. Too bad, a clever enough idea but at those prices they have to earn the business and quite simply, they didn't. Don't think this one will be around very long. The only way the make it is from the expense account crowd and there didn't appear to be enough of those business types in there to sustain it over time. Too many great options within a mile of the place."}
{"text":"Been a while since coming to the Treehouse.  We usually get the tacos, which are always good.  Love the outside patio-Wednesday's they have live music.

We ordered some skillet corn bread to start.  They give you three decent size pieces, but extremely dry.  It was crumbling when trying to add the maple butter.  Don't think I'd order again.

Tonight, I had the brisket, which comes with slaw and one side--I ordered Collard greens.  I'm addicted to collard greens, and usually can't get enough.  The greens , way too much vinegar, but good heat.  The brisket, a very big portion but extremely dry.  You definitely need BBQ sauce.   I would think that after 16 hours of smoke, I would expect more of a smoke ring, any smoke ring.  It was between the brisket and pulled pork--now I wish i went with the Pork.

My babe went with the pan seared fish.  We asked our server what the fish was, and all she new was she thought it started with a \"P\". 

The fish was very good, for whatever kind it was.  It came with grilled veggies and slaw, and also ordered the Mac-n-cheese.  The fish and veggies were the winner tonight.  The Mac-n-cheese wasn't very cheesy, seemed milked down.  

Overall, not a very good dining experience, food so-so, the server never did come by to ask how everything was -- seems very trendy for the regulars.  If I come back, I'll stick with the tacos."}
{"text":"I have read/heard many mixed reviews but decided to check this place out on a Thursday night. I love the décor of the restaurant, its very cozy and the patio is very nice. We started with the jalapeno appetizer... the crunchy jalapenos, the cool cream cheese and *crispy* bacon with the whiskey reduction were a great start. I opted for the out-n-in burger (their version of the in-n-out burger) and was not disappointed... it was huuuuuuge, I would definitely recommend sharing unless you have a big appetite! I ordered the fries as the side and they were cut in house and nice and fresh. Friend ordered two tacos, she didn't say much except she wished she ordered the burger because she was having major food envy!"}
{"text":"So, Treehouse Whiskey & Fork..not sure where to begin.  The location is a little hidden and I can definitely see an issue with parking during prime lunch and dinner hours.  We arrived around 11:30 and from my initial glance I thought it was a beautful restaurant. Amazing ceiling, details and quite quaint, although not that many tables.  Now, I did see outside seating as well but my visit was in early February.  Having never been before my friend ordered a Whiskey drink, strong for my taste and I chose a Bloody Mary.  Overall the drinks were good. However, we decided to start off with the brisket sliders while we caught up.  They arrived at the table and all I can say is a lot of bun! The meat was good but it didn't seem like we got a lot for each sandwich and the sauce was a little thick for my taste.  

After that we decided to order a variety of tacos. We chose the Korean, Ground Beef, Smothered Chicken and the Fish.  The fish was by far the best. Lightly friend and served with just the right amount of sauce...however, only two small pieces of fish. As for the others, the smothered chicken was SO smothered I cannot say anything more..just that I wouldn't order it again.  The ground beef was covered in a cheese sauce that tasted right out of a jar.  As my friend said, it tasted like a McDonald's cheeseburger in a taco, ugh! As for the Korean, it was okay, but the wasabi may was killer...good, but they put way too much. The tortillas were a little cold and could use quick heat up before delivery.  

I do believe Treehouse has potential with their drinks and outside seating during the summer/fall months, however, the food has a lot of work to pull in people on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss and even when it hits, it's still just ok.  I've been for lunch and dinner during the week and on weekends and given all the other viable options in the area, I see no reason to go back.  

The patio area and bar are nice for a drink when it's warm out but the service stands out as one of the biggest issues for me.  The staff seems to be poorly trained and lacks a sense of urgency when it comes to accommodating their guests.  It's more frustrating than anything because half the time the restaurant isn't close to being busy.

The menu has a few items that, when cooked properly, aren't bad...salmon and smoked wings come to mind.  Other than that, they deep fry a lot of their food with a really thick batter and only cook the burgers well done because the patties are so thin.

Probably wouldn't recommend if asked about a spot in the area."}
{"text":"I can really only speak of the drinks here because I typically only came for after work drinks. But I enjoyed the drinks a lot and they were typically very good. I do think it's a tad bit expensive. 

What I really disliked about this place was the service. I ordered a drink and wasn't a fan of it so I wanted to order another. I tried to wave down our waitress for about 15 minutes before finally going to the bar and ordering something from the bartender. I watched our waitress sit down at another table and talk with her friend while she had multiple tables to wait on. Our waters were empty and we all wanted another drink. Then when we went to the bartender, he asked why I didn't get my waitress to take the order even after I told him she wasn't paying attention to us. He didn't make it easy for me to order a simple drink. 

I try to always leave a good tip between 18%-25% even if the service isn't the best because you never know a situation, but I barely left a tip because our waitress just flat out ignored us and other tables. I also had poor service from other waitresses while at this place. One waitress disregarded my deadly allergies despite me asking her to make a note of it on the ticket. She \"simply forgot\". My allergies are not something to ignore, especially ones as severe as mine. I can overlook a lot of negative things but not taking my allergies serious is a huge problem. 

This might be a good drink spot but the service this past summer was absolutely horrendous."}
{"text":"Lots of things to like about this place.  Whiskey deals, drinks specials, good tacos, and a patio which is something you don't see a lot of in the South Park neighborhood.  I wish the patio wasn't in the middle of a parking lot, but it'll do.  There a good vibe here and open concept minded with huge openings leading from the inside to the outside.  For something outside of the chain options in South Park, this spot is a great option.  It's hard to miss because it's a little tucked away off the main road.  Service was great and everyone was very friendly.  Another perk are the TV's!!  So, if you need a place to watch a game Treehouse is a good option."}
{"text":"I've been to Treehouse three times now and love the place! The food has been consistently good, and service is usually good.   My last visit started out rocky but ended on a good note.  We were seated but it was 10 minutes before we were greeted by a server.  We placed our food and drink order. I got the impression she did not want to be at work. Our drinks were eventually delivered by a different server.  Our food was slow in getting to us but when it finally arrived we had to flag down a server to get napkins and utincils, and were told it would be a minute that they were out. We did receive them in a few minutes.  From that point on service improved and we finished with an OK dining experience.  I don't know what the problem was when we were first seated or at the start of our meal.  I'm going to chalk it up to an accident.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cute and homey! Lots of wood and tree decor making you feel very much like you are hanging out in a treehouse - even the smell of woods kind of a style.

The menu has many options, tons that are not the typical cookie-cutter restaurant style. They have jalp & cheddar biscuits which are wonderful, but not that spicy since the jalapeños are finely cut and added in. They also have a GREAT turkey burger with goat cheese stuffed in and guacamole on top. YUM!

The service is amazing too! Our server Sydny was incredible polite and very knowledgable about the menu - Always anticipating and making sure our needs were met. 

The only drawback is parking can get a bit tricky as there are not many spots right near the building."}
{"text":"This place is new to the scene. I did enjoy it. There is a faux tree inside the restaurant which is sort of cool. The layout is kind of tight which is slightly uncomfortable. I went in on a Monday with some girlfriends for their all you can eat crab legs. Served at 6 pm until they run out. The crab legs were really good, some of the best tasting I've had outside of the beach. The service could have been a little better, but I blame it on the place still being new. I wasn't a big fan of the drink menu, I got a muddled drink with blueberries which lacked taste. I had it sent back and requested more syrup but it came back the same way. I would definitely return, but probably just for the all you can eat crab. It's not really my scene."}
{"text":"2.5 overall - but the fried pickles won us over so bump up to three stars because we would definitely come back for those.

Out with my mom and her husband and they wanted to go to Cowfish for dinner but the wait was almost 2 hours so we changed up to Treehouse instead. 

We walked over and once inside we were seated quickly. Our waitress was alright. She definitely seemed busy. None us had been there before and she kept rushing us to take our order. Once we did order our food, she told us our appetizers would be right up but they took forever to come out. Longer than normal, I feel. But they were pretty busy so we didn't complain. 

Once our appetizers came out, our food quickly followed. And overall, no one was really impressed with their food. I ordered a burger and it was just okay. My salad was the best part of my meal. The salad was super fresh. Nothing to rave over. The man had tacos and brisket chilis. The tacos were okay. And the brisket chili looked delicious and tasted like chili but had no taste of brisket. It was quite disappointing. My mom and her husband didn't complain about their food but they weren't extremely happy about it either.

What was good was the fried pickles and the hush puppies. Really good. And it was so loud in here, I mean very loud. I would not suggest coming here for a family dinner. You can't even hear yourself. It was difficult to carry a conversation just across the table. 

I wasn't expecting much because of the reviews - and I will cosign and say everyone is pretty spot on. 

Your takeaways from this review should be:

It is loud here. Very Loud. 
Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"So, I was REALLY excited to go to this restaurant when I stumbled upon it online.  Decided to do dinner there with a few girlfriends.  First impressions were great.  I loved the tree house touches they have made throughout the dining room and the patio looks like a great spot to hangout.

First impressions : However, after being seated, our waitress came to our table and did not introduce herself.  (come to find out on the receipt her name is Brooke) One of my friends asked her if one of the wines was really sweet - her response was, \"umm, I'm 20 yrs old\" - totally fine because the drinking age is 21, however, if you're working around alcohol (whether you are able age-wise to drink or not) you should be educated on the items you're selling.

My next criticism is a heart-breaking one.  I am a HUGE jalapeno poppers fan so when I saw them on the menu I had to order one.  They are described in their menu as battered, jalapeno, bacon and cheese.  I was extremely disappointed.  First the peppers were inconsistent - one was still almost raw.  Next, the cheese: cream cheese (YUCK) it kept the popper on the colder side and added zero flavor - just a bland, creamy mess.  And lastly, there was NO bacon. Zilch, nada. And 4 poppers for 7$? A little steep.

Overall their food was average.  I got the burger (average, nothing to write home about).  The fries are amazing! Tater tots, sweet potato waffle fries.. they nailed that one.

My next issue was how our food was delivered.  Two of my friends got their food from our waitress and when she returned from the kitchen, she was bringing another table food.  There really should be a better system set up by management to help servers serve their tables all at one time.  It looks disorganized and isn't a good impression for your guests.

For dinner, two of my friends ordered tacos.  My one friend specified that she wanted 2 tacos (running at $5 a piece) which I found pricey for a tortilla, a little slaw & two small pieces of fried fish.  My other friend specifically asked our waitress if the tacos were just one or came in a pair.  The waitress told her it was just for one taco.  She said that's what she wanted with a side of fries.  When we received our dinners, they brought her out 2 tacos.  She was confused but ate it anyways.  Once our bill came they waitress had indeed charged her for 2 tacos.  She told the waitress that she had asked that before ordering because she only wanted one.  The waitress gave her a bit of an attitude but ended up eliminating it from the bill.

My big beef I had with the waitress was, I paid my bill in cash and was suppose to receive back $10.23.  When she dropped my change off there was only a $10 bill.  Now, I'm not frugal, but my change is my change.  She did that to another one of my friends bill's as well.  It just felt like she was too lazy to figure out the change.  AND if she thought about it before bringing me my change, she would have gave me a $5 bill and 5 singles so I could giver her change for a tip.  

I'm super bummed because I was really excited for such an eclectic place but with the mediocre service and food, I don't think I'll be back."}
