{"text":"Here's a tip, just don't go here. The food is mediocre and it is in uptown? Why??? Meats were so dry and burnt. Seriously, hire better chefs or cooks!"}
{"text":"I will never eat at this restaurant again.  The food was mediocre at best, and the service was terrible.  The server was rude and took 20 minutes to bring a glass of water.  The barbecue was DRY and was served on what tasted like cold King's Hawaiian rolls.  In addition their children's menu does not have many child-friendly options.  There are a number of good bbq restaurants in Charlotte, and I'm not sure how this one stays in business."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place the spicy fried oysters are the BEST I have EVER had!!! They maintain their juicy-ness despite them being fried I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I seriously don't know how this restaurant is still in business.. I've never written a review in my life, but I felt the need to with this place. Let's start with the appetizer. The bartender that served us (who was quite rude and obviously hates her life, her job and would have rather been watching the game than waiting on us) assured us that the chili chips were a large portion and plenty for two people. Ha! There were 12 chips covered with what tasted like Hormel chili. Horrible. We couldn't finish them, but that had absolutely nothing to do with the tiny, overpriced portion size. As far as the BBQ goes.. We had the pulled pork. Being born and raised in NC, I've had a lot of BBQ in my lifetime. This was by far the worst I've ever had. Flavorless, greasy, fatty, just plain bad. The sauces sucked and the sides were nothing to write home about either. My advice? Just drive the 3 miles to Mac's!"}
{"text":"Great service and nice 'flights' --selections that come with multiple liquors to sample.  Not impressed with the bbq - had the brisket and it was not overly flavorful.  Grits with cheese were pretty good side."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a co worker in early April. Finally got the chance to try city smoke on my 3rd trip to Charlotte.  Walked in well after the main lunch rush. (1:30pm on a Monday)   Very nice and clean inside with plenty of seating. Read a review about a larger group. While it does have plenty of tables and booths and counter top space I can see why and how a group could be a problem.  As for the food, very very good. Didn't know what to order so I ordered the combo: brisket, pulled pork, 3 different kind of ribs with two side.  The brisket was delicious, and all three of the ribs were very very good. The pulled pork lacked a lot of flavor but this could be because I enjoyed the brisket so much.   Each of the ribs had their own different taste w the sauce and dry rub. Which is always good. The brisket had a good smokey flavor to it.  I had Mac and cheese and dust fries. The waitresses recommended the chili and the fried okra topped with something.   Service was extremely good and fast. Never had to wait. And there was 6-7 other tables at this time of day.  I will be a repeat costumer, probably at some point this week.  They also offer brisket burgers which may be what I try next!   Plenty of options: salads, BBQ, burgers, starters, fish. They have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Overall enjoyable evening. We shared the chicken wing appetizer and I had the dry rub ribs and he had the bbq ribs. We managed to get a table in the farthest corner of the restaurant which is the most private, so if you are a couple ask for this table. Otherwise the place gets real loud real fast. The food was good and fairly priced for bbq but I felt it was a bit more spicy than average and most Southern palettes will find it has too much heat for them."}
{"text":"Was in town for a concert and needed a downtown bite to eat quick, fast and in a hurry. Ordered the quarter smoked chicken and one side, collards. The smoked chicken was savory and flavorful, an unexpected pleasant surprise. The collards were tender and southern seasoned, like home cooked. The meal was served quickly as we explained our event started in 45 mins. The \"au jus\" served with the chicken was a new experience, extra bang for the buck. The meat was also tender. This choice was reasonably priced and exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"City Smoke kinda goes up in flames.  We showed up around 7pm on a Friday night, and our first clue should have been that the restaurant was almost empty.  However, we were hungry, so we threw caution to the wind, grabbed two bowls of peanuts, and were shown a table.  After deciding not to throw our shells on the floor, we perused the menu.  As a place that quickly establishes itself as a BBQ joint, the menu seems disjointed; oysters on the half shell and peel & eat shrimp co-mingle with sliders on the appetizer menu, and shrimp & oyster po-boys are listed above the omnivores' pork, chicken, and brisket sandwich options.  But the true blasphemy surfaced once the meal arrived.    Y'all, the mac & cheese was NOT GOOD.  Grainy, tasteless, and altogether sub-par macaroni and cheese is unacceptable in a BBQ restaurant.  And the fried okra was overly salty without packing much flavor.  At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how great the meat is at a BBQ joint (and keep in mind, City Smoke's meat is nothing to write home about); if your sides aren't stellar, you might as well shut down shop.  Between the four of us, we ordered the brisket, rotisserie chicken, and pulled pork, but no one was overly complimentary of the meatsplosion on the table.  We had three sauce options: one was vineagar based, and the other two tomato-based ones tasted almost exactly the same.  Our service was okay, but I think that's mostly attributed to the fact that our server only had one or two other tables to attend to.  Maybe City Smoke burned brightly at one point, but the flame has died."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch to go today after not ordering from City Smoke in a while.  After picking up my meal I was shocked.  For $10.83 I got iced tea, two vegetable sides, a piece of bread and a piece of chicken that wasn't enough to feed my dog (no bones for Fido of course).  I called back to talk to them and was told that \"1/4 chicken dark meat is a small leg and HALF of a small thigh\" - which is what I got.  They did offer to fix me something else, but I didn't want anything else.  I wanted a chicken meal equal to what I paid for it.  My friend got the same thing, but with white meat and was disappointed as well (a tiny wing and half a little breast).  Will not be going back.  The chicken and collards were pretty good, so I'm giving them two stars, but the value was not.  I know $10 is not a lot of money, but this wasn't a $10 lunch."}
{"text":"Was asked to call twice to confirm reservation for larger party.  When we showed up, the manager told me that he attempted to call me 20 min after my last call to see if we could push the reservation back, but my phone number was disconnected.  They took my phone number down wrong and the manager made it seem like it was my fault.  Was unapologetic and offered the 9 of us to sit at the bar for dinner!  When I showed my disappointment in the garbage option he offered, he said that we could sit there for 30-40 minutes and would then be able to provide our table.  Did not offer anything for our inconvenience, not even an apology.  When one of us asked if they were going to provide us with an appetizer or two (due to # of party) for our troubles, the manager was extremely rude.  Will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"If you let your 4 year old cook whatever he/she wanted, that's what the pulled pork sandwich tasted like.  Bland, bland, bland.  I've had barbecue all over the country and NC barbecue is my favorite.  This place, does not reflect that.  The sauces were mediocre at best.  Mac and cheese the shining star of the meal.  Ugh...I'm just disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there before a concert with reservations for a party of 6.  The waitress was frazzled but kept getting everyone else worked up as well.  It took over an hour for the first 2 out of the 6 beers to arrive.  When the food came almost 90 minutes after ordering the orders were all wrong and it was cold.  We asked for a manger several times from our waitress as well as other staff.  Our request was in a respectful demeanor and we didn't talk down to anyone.  The manager never came.  I also wrote a note through the website several weeks ago (this was the night Pearl Jam was in town) and they never responded.  It's one thing to have a bad night with a sub par waitress but its clearly not an off night when the manager hides from a circumstance like this and won't respond."}
{"text":"BBQ and so much more!  Great selection of apps, oysters are fresh, meat is tender and falls off the bone whether it's BBQ or one of the other selections, the lamb was cooked to perfection.  Good bar selection, price is ok for the 5 star standard of quality."}
{"text":"In town for a conference and was looking for some great Carolina BBQ.  Came here as it was close to our hotel and looked pretty good.  Atmosphere was cool. Bar and restaurant with an open kitchen. Staff was very friendly and helpful with menu selections. One odd thing I found was they didnt have Carolina BBQ.  They had Kansas, Texas, etc but no Carolina.   I started with the fried pickles and LOVED them! I did not like the accompanying sauce as it was very mayonnaise based/flavored (so was their ranch). I then had the pulled pork with mac n cheese and some tomato bean side. The mac was yummy. The pork was average. The sauces available just didnt taste good to me or my coworker. The beans were not good.   We had a flight of beer at a great price. And the beers available here are great! Lots of craft beers, IPAs, pale ales, etc. My favorite was the Jalepeño beer (not spicy - just tasty).   Definitely come for beer and fried pickles! The rest...cant say its super great."}
{"text":"I must say I was surprised to see so many negative comments.  I went for a weekday lunch and here's my take: --Pulled pork - was good.  Tried all 3 sauces and they were ok, no great.  There was no 'hot' sauce, though, for those who like the red hot version. --Mac&cheese - I agree with previous comments.  It was OK, but too velveeta-y. --Cheese grits - fabulous.  Like dessert, almost, due to (I'm sure) the amount of butter. --Fried okra - good.  Sprinkled with a spice with a bit of a kick to it, so it had a nice flavor. --Meal served with texas toast.  In my opinion, that's just a waste of time and food; can't imagine how much of that stuff they throw out.  A BBQ plate should be served with cornbread.  In fact, cornbread should be a freebie for the table. --I appreciate that soft drinks are served in a small bottle with a cup of ice - it's better flavor than a fountain drink; however, I missed the free refills.  Our waiter did explain that an additional drink would cost us and offered to bring water instead.  Service was good. It's not like there's a plethora of good BBQ joints in this town (ironically), so until I try Queen City for comparison, I'd call this a nice place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Had a salad with pulled pork and a baked potato. Fast service and awesome dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch for the first time and can say I won't be coming back anytime soon. The food was just OK and the portions were noticeably smaller than other BBQ joints in the Charlotte. The service, however, may have been the worst I've experienced since moving to the city. The guy seemed like he was just having a bad day - he was short when asked questions, our drink refills came with our check, etc. I'm pretty sure he didn't crack a smile the whole afternoon.   I would have liked to come back to check out the happy hour scene since their bar looked really impressive but I will pass on that. As for my next BBQ fix, there's plenty of other (and better) BBQ joints in the city."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  I was so craving Carolina BBQ, and I guess I should have known better than to go into a fancy, bright place.  Should have looked for the dark, local hole in the wall type to get good downhome BBQ.  I decided to try the combo, since I could not decide what to get.  The best things on the platter were the cornbread and collard greens, even the mac n cheese was eh!  Brisket - dry, ribs - dry, pulled port - eh.   The best thing was when I ordered an Arnold Palmer - order it all the time and have gotten a lemonade/iced tea combo 100% of the time - except this one.  First impression was \"wow, they are really cheap with their drinks\" - came in a small, similar to lowball sized glass.  Didn't taste the alcohol but after a bit was feeling a little weird, but went ahead and finished the drink (also thought it was weird that I was given a refill) figuring I was just tired.  Then asked the waiter if there was alcohol in the drink and he looked at me like I was asking a crazy question, and finally said yes, and asked isn't that what I wanted.  No - the Arnold Palmer I was wanting was just plain old lemonade/iced tea.  So he starts laughing. No big deal - confusion but get this - he doesn't actually bring me what I wanted and charged me for a drink that I didn't actually order!  Really?  Good thing I wasn't a recovering alcoholic or allergic to alcohol."}
{"text":"Great location, good beers, worst barbecue in the state of North Carolina. They \"smoke\" their BBQ in an electric smoker. Service is decent but locals avoid."}
{"text":"Good place...good fun, especially if you like a variety of different BBQ preparations and Whiskey!  Service is so-so...seemed a little understaffed. Decent live music - went on a Wednesday night.  Try the ribs...variety with Texas, Memphis and KC were really good."}
{"text":"Overall a decent place to eat.  Very dark interior and food was ok. Service started out good but went down hill. Went right past our table to another and asked them how they liked their food. When he came to our table first things out of his mouth was would we need a box.  Not saying it is a racist place but it sure seemed like it.  Can't blame the restaurant but some people just don't need to be in customer service.  Prices weren't bad for what you get. I probably won't return due to the customer service but if you want bbq to knock off your bucket list this place would do."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday before the Checkers game.  Bar tender (Seth) was friendly and provided good, quick service. Ate at the bar so Seth was our server. Deviled egg appetizer was yummy. We enjoyed the oyster po'boy and spend a lot of time in New Orleans so we know good po'boys.  Defiinitely will stop back."}
{"text":"We were in City Smoke on a Friday evening at 5 PM. Server was amazing very helpful, explain all of the items on the menu. We decided on pulled chicken with two sides, worst meal ever.  The chicken had been boiled,  tomato baked beans were WAY TOO smokey, the macaroni and cheese was mush, and the collard greens were too salty.  The manager was really great, offered us dessert and or free drinks. The manager and server get a 10+, the food gets a -5"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! My aunt was in town for work, so I wanted to show her a little bit of the uptown atmosphere. We sat right down on a Wednesday night, and were quickly helped by our attentive server. After browsing over the menu, we both decided to go with the classic-sounding Hickory Smoked Pork, with mac n' cheese & roasted baby carrots as my side. This meal was only $12. Everything was better than expected. The portions were perfect, and the pork was so fresh and tender, I think it's the best I've had in the Charlotte area. Our server also brought us bottles of eastern & western NC barbecue sauce for our pulled pork (I always favor the western NC red sauce). It was a little difficult to have a conversation across the table, but we still enjoyed the company. I would definitely recommend City Smoke to anyone looking for quality food in the uptown Charlotte area."}
{"text":"It's a bit more than pathetic when a bartender at a bourbon bar doesn't know what a Perfect Manhattan is.   When I asked for it, the bartender replied \"So is that up?\" And I said \"I'll just take a regular manhattan with a twist instead of a cherry.\"   She responded \"So, you don't want the bourbon cherries or the cherries on top?\" (Um, not a hot fudge sundae).   Finally, the drink I got had some kind of nasty muddled into it, as if it were an old fashion. I had to check twice to ensure the chunks weren't dead fruit flies.   Buyer beware."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous! We were lucky to sit at  the bar. The cauliflower was fantastic! We had the half and half sampler! You couldn't get any better than this restaurant. Coming from California, we appreciate good Food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Varnished floors plus no rubber stoppers on the chair legs made for a very dangerous dining experience.  We were shown to a bar high table with high wooden stool-chairs.  Everyone in our party had a hard time getting up onto the chairs as they were slip sliding around as we tried to sit down.  During dinner I made the mistake of shifting forward on my chair and it completely slipped out from under me.  I fell 4 feet and landed on my back on the floor in front of the busy restaurant.  Luckily I was not hurt too badly but one of the waitresses told us it had happened the day before to someone else. Food was not that great.  No plans to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. Nice ambiance and pretty good food. Ribs (sweet), mac and cheese, and fried okra were my faves."}
{"text":"You could chop salad with the added addition of the roasted chicken. Good wine for BBQ. Have to try the regular roasted chicken. Did try my husbands Mac and cheese very very good. Au have to also recommend the warm pecan pie, to die for."}
{"text":"Out of Macs, Midwood Smokehouse and Queen City Q, this is my favorite BBQ joint. The ribs and pulled pork are great, but the hidden gems are the chopped salad (seriously), collard greens and the wings. Also love the huge bourbon selection and nice choice of local beers."}
{"text":"Awesome ribs and the world's best Lexington slaw. A great way to satisfy the hunger after a long flight from the west coast."}
{"text":"Worst BBQ I have ever had in Charlotte. Everything I had from the sauce, meat and sides were all disgusting. They serve the food to you on what look to be those metal dissection treys you had in biology class. Some brilliant restaurant executive who never ate BBQ in his life thought it would be a good idea to put thin paper down on the trays to keep your food off the cheap metal tray...well when you but BBQ sauce on thin paper it falls apart. The result is you end up picking up pieces of the wet paper when your eat your food. Do yourself a favor and skip this pretentious joke of a BBQ joint.  The best part of the experience is that if you order a soda with your meal they bring you a bottled soda when they give you the check at the end and don't tell you that you have to pay for it. They just set it on the table and say nothing as if they are just giving it to you. Intentional or not it was misleading and sketchy."}
{"text":"After having a pretty upsetting experience at another uptown bbq joint I decided to try city smoke.  Thankfully this was much better than the reviews I have seen.  I must have just come in a good day because we loved everything.  Mac and cheese yummy and soft.  Not creamy like out of the box, seemed a little like custard which surprised me coming from a bbq place, so good!  The side of Brunswick Stew was also very good, meaty and comforting.  I had the brisket which was much better than the last place we went and my girlfriend had the pulled pork, which she couldn't stop taking about.  Upon our servers advice we got the pecan pie for dessert. Wow. Completely made from scratch and you can tell.  It makes it seem like I've never actually had pecan pie before now.  Again, maybe we just got really lucky, I'm not sure what some people didn't like, but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Place. Greeted with a smile the second we walked in & our server Morgan rocked. She explained the menu, told us her favorites and steered us through a great meal.  We kicked off with fresh oysters and a bourbon/whiskey flight that was great. It helped that Morgan knew what and where everything was from it also helped she had an opinion....and always a smile.  The oysters were fresh and the roasted ones were perfection. What a great surprise.  I order the half duck, which was so big it must of come from Chernobyl Ukraine. I can't remember having duck that big. It was crispy, a little smokey and aus jus was the right balance. The petite roasted potatoes were the right size side, enough to compliment the meal but not too much food.  Dessert was he banana pudding. Made with meringue instead of whipped cream it was delicious. Although, my friend got powdered sugar on his, which is the only gripe of the nite lol.  Very casual & delicious.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Had dinner here, nice location, live music was a little loud for trying to talk to your friends.  Craving bbq NC style but I'm not sure this place got it right.  I live in N Florida where we are inundated with various bbq places of every style.  I was expecting more but it was a decent meal.  I actually liked that they didn't give you a ton of food.  Had the pulled pork, carolina slaw and mac n cheese.  All fairly boring. Also ate the pecan pie.  It tasted thawed and the filling was running out of the crust.  That shouldn't happen.  So unimpressed on that.  I will look for something more authentic next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Cool barbecue joint in downtown Charlotte. Not too expensive and nice atmosphere. Walking distance to Epicentre. Small food menu huge bourbon and liquor menu. Beer specials. Rotisserie chicken seems to be big favorite as well as different styles of ribs with sauce or not. Sides and really good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Also not impressed. I sat at the bar, waitress was not friendly at all even though there were only 4 people at bar. I ordered the oyster po boy, coleslaw and Brunswick stew. They brought out shrimp po boy - the barkeep did 4 things before putting in the order wrong.   The Po boy was tiny, maybe 4 bites. It was good but 5\" long?  Really?  The coleslaw was good, Brunswick stew also small and salty.     Barkeep cleared my plate and brought check without asking if I wanted another beer or dessert, etc. like she was in a hurry to get rid of me at 8:00 pm on a Wednesday night.   Maybe a meat meal would have been better, I'll never know."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife on Wednesday night before a Bobcats game. Service was excellent, the waitress was attentive and had our order out quickly.   Burger and fries delivered! My wife enjoyed her brisket sandwich and macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs! Our experience here was awful. Our waiter was clearly new and constantly flustered the whole time he was serving us which a point annoying but fine the 1st day is scary for everyone. But the food was incredibly sub par and the pricing is a scam. I ordered a side of fries my parents split a 25 dollar dish and my sister an 11 dollar dish yet we ended up with a 75 dollar bill. My sister had a pulled pork sandwich with so much fat she could barely eat 3 bites of it. The mac and cheese must have been from the very bottom of their supply to be so lukewarm and strange tasting as my mother described it. When we complained to the manager about the food he left halfway through our complaints to get more food which at that point was the last thing we wanted. Never coming back. there's a Hooters right across the street you'll eat much better there."}
{"text":"If you are looking for traditional Carolina BBQ this might not be what you envisioned, but the food and the service were fabulous! I had the burger with a side of fries and it was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Rib sampler was not. Had plenty of Carolinas bbq so I have good point of reference.   Ribs were dried out like jerky, fries were dripping with grease, and not really sure what the mac and cheese was.  Would have told the manager but he never stopped by even after the waitress took most of my food away."}
{"text":"We came in as a group of six for a late lunch on a weekday. We got a table straight away and ordered a round of drinks. A few of us went to use to the restroom and found they have ONE for everyone. We weren't all back at the table for a while, and I would say that was the one negative impression with which we left.   For the table we ordered chicken sandwiches, pork sandwiches, a chop salad, mac and cheese, and the roasted squash. Everyone really enjoyed the food. The chop salad with the lemon dressing was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. The waitress was really attentive and friendly. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went in for the raw oysters but all our food was excellent. We got oysters, meatball sliders, Mac and cheese, and Scooby snacks. Everything was tasty, the place smelled like BBQ the whole time, and the staff was quick and friendly. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Upsides:  Close to the Spectrum center  Wide variety of sides on menu  Lots on drink menu  Downsides:  Our booth seats were worn  Even though someone came over to our table to check on us, (at the door he stood) he wasn't pleasant or really wanted to engage in conversation when I asked about the restaurant. I was in the middle of giving the menu a compliment about the diverse sides and he walked away.  Bar bites menu is hidden from view when you come in but visible when you leave...  Corona is listed as 3.75 on the menu but is was 4 on out bill. I was going to say something but my bf to me not to."}
{"text":"Lunch. Great selection of local beers, not a overwhelming list. I had the roasted chicken (1/2 portion was half a breast) it was plain but very tender. The bbq sauces on the table were a perfect match with the chicken, as I tried all three flavors . The mayo coleslaw was great, finely chopped with carrots but the potato salad was okay. The red potatoes, celery , ham and onion sounded great but there was too much mayo. The fried okra was great, as well as the mac n cheese. I did not realize they cater, my friend asked about a upcoming event and the manager came out and explained everything. Their prices for catering is reasonable and they were willing to travel 35 minutes away.  I gave 5 stars because the food was what I expected and a good value, service was friendly, bathrooms clean."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the drinks were great. One my recent stay in Charlotte I saw this place in the corner from the Epic Center. It's a hard to get into since it is connected to the adjacent building. The tables are kind of close together so doesn't give too much privacy. I had the Duck Nachos as an appetizer they were very good. As the main course the Pulled pork with Mac and chews and collard greens. The Mac and cheese was good but those collard greens were amazing!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with clients and colleagues on a Monday night.  The service was good and the staff had great personalities with a sense of humor.  Enjoyed the peach smash and a colleague had the lemon ginger smash and enjoyed it. I had the rib sampler... Three different types. Prices seemed reasonable. Restaurant is on the corner of Trade & College, in the Bank of America building... GPS had trouble finding it."}
{"text":"Great selection of local beers. Nice setup and decor. You must try the deviled eggs with \"smoke dust\" trust me they're good. Service was great our waiter was extremely attentive. My big negative, 1 bathroom for both men and women tucked down the service hallway."}
{"text":"Ok place. We stopped in for a beverage and appetizer before having dinner elsewhere.   Chip and brisket chili appetizer was disappointing. Chili was more tomato sauce with a few veggies and jalapeños with sour cream. We had ONE piece of meat about 3/4\" square in the whole dish.   The chicken wings someone else ordered looked and smelled great so maybe we just made the wrong choice."}
{"text":"Let's keep short and sweet: empty at prime time on Friday, horrible service, mediocre bar-b-q, and the Old Fashioned tasted like watered down whiskey and water.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This is across the street from the Omni where we are staying. The food is really good and priced nicely. I had half chicken with 2 side $12.00. It was excellent the chicken was cooked perfectly. The sides were great I had Brussels sprouts and cauliflower. My dad had Brisket that he said was tender and tasty, it was $18.00. It was so good that we will probably go back tomorrow, because there were other things on the menu to try."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a very cold and snowy day. The Coffee and Baileys hit the spot. No flair to it, which is fine by me. Had the rotisserie chicken and added collard greens to the side. If you are on a low sodium diet then avoid all of these foods. Everything was juicy, tasty and hot. The waitress was very helpful. I will definitely be back next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not one to write reviews, but I feel like this had to be done. I went on Sat night for Queens Feast and wanted to check this place out because I had a gift card. I've had 2 wonderful experiences during Queens Feast -- both great quality & portion sizes (Paco's Tacos & The Liberty) if we are naming places. Therefore; I had pretty high expectations of this place.  For starters one of the appetizers wasn't being offered anymore that we wanted. No biggie, so we get a cheese plate & chicken wings. The cheese plate came with 2 things of cheese that looked and tasted like butter (pretty positive it was), un-pitted olives & 4 crackers. The wings were super chewy. That's all I have to say about that.  Main entree we ordered was a filet with squash and the rotisserie chicken with mac & cheese. The filet was probably the size of my palm & the squash was maybe 2 of my palms put together. The chicken was ehhh & a good portion size..nothing special, but not terrible. I did however like the mac & cheese!  On to Dessert, that's hard to mess up with me because I love sweets. Well..the cheesecake tasted like a frozen one that came from Walmart. Tres Leches Cake was meh. It's not that they were gross, but it wasn't anything exceptional.   By the end of the night my date looked at me and said \"So wanna go get some real food after this?\" - thankfully this wasn't our first date because that would have been terrible. Maybe we had a bad experience because it was the end of Queen's Feast, but I'm not real sure I will be going back again to try."}
{"text":"Can't speak to a dine-in experience but I did walk by and see that they catered so I ordered lunch for our office. We have ordered BBQ numerous times but I thought I would try something new. The mac n cheese was cold, and not super tasty. Chicken was good. The \"texas toast\" was a loaf of bread in a bag. I would say overall it was surely not the best BBQ we've ordered and it was by far the most expensive."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed...we got a bunch of different stuff and shared...everything was really good...nice people in a great location...and pretty good price...."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for dinner and drinks, finding the place is a little tricky especially if you don't make frequent trips Uptown.   They offer valet but I'd suggest just parking I the BoA parking garage and taking the elevator down to the restaurant. The atmosphere is fine, nothing fancy but you should expect it from a BBQ joint. The place wasn't busy so we were seated right away.   The menu is not very extensive, but includes all the classics : ribs, pulled pork and brisket just to name a few items. For starters we ended up ordering some wings. It's not a bad deal for just $5 you get half a dozen wings with blue cheese and some other dipping sauce. The wings were very tasty! The came out hot and packed with flavor.   For my meal I went with the pulled pork sandwich and cheese grits. Meh, it was okay. I've had better pulled pork at other BBQ places and they didn't really give a lot of meat on the sandwich....more bun than meat is no bueno!!! The cheese grits were decent...but again nothing to write home about. If I came back I'd stick with the wings.   So why the low score??? Aside from the average food the waitress/bartender had a horrible attitude. I've said this before and I'll say it again....if customer service is NOT your thing....please do us all a favor and pick another job!!! Shitty service ruins the experience and meal every time! Even if the food had been better I'd have to strongly consider give my money to someone who rolls their eyes at me and my guests AND ignores my requests while I'm eating (excuse me for needing a refill on my drinks and extra napkins....ugh!).   So try this place at your own risk...or just grab some wings to go!"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and dinner, sat at the bar.  Good beer selection and the bartender was knowledgeable and friendly.  Chicken wings appetizer was outstanding, the best wings I've ever had.   Ordered brisket platter for dinner.  The sides were great, all homemade and very good.  The brisket had a good flavor but was fatty and tough.  They sliced it with the grain, a big no-no.  If not for the beef I'd have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch only, and both times I've gotten the wings. They are some of the best chicken wings I've had from a restaurant. I usually am not a fan of dry rubbed style, and love to pile on the sauces ... but these dry rubbed wings (the only kind they have) are char-grilled to perfection ... and they're a great size to-boot. The mac and cheese is also pretty decent!"}
{"text":"Queens Feast Extravaganza!    Whiskey or beer, whiskey or beer.  What a dilemma.  I finally settled on a \"Kentucky Mule\", which was prepared perfectly.  I had planned to get a beer after, but it was so good I had another mule instead.  Served in the appropriate copper mug, which makes it all the better.  (Side note: One time in Charleston the restaurant I was at tried to upcharge for the mug.  It seemed silly and I didn't do it, so I got to drink a Mule out of a regular glass.  It was still OK, but since the mug makes it that much more special, I was a little frustrated by the experience). Pleasantly and more appropriately, there was no mention of that kind of nonsense here.  Kudos for not being ridiculous like that.  This Queens Feast week deal was hard to pass up, they made practically their entire menu available.  It was very difficult to choose, but since the opportunity seems to come along less and less, I went for Chef Adam's Rotisserie Feature (Prime Rib).  It was everything I hoped it could be, and done just right.  I opted for the \"pee wee\" potatoes as well, although they did offer any side from the menu, not just this suggested pairing.  I went for dry rubbed chicken wings for a starter, and with five at our table everyone else got something different, so we tried most of the the starters available.  We all agreed the wings were the clear winner (although it was all delicious).   We all picked the Deep Dish Bourbon Pecan Pie for dessert.  It was large enough and sweet enough I brought half home for later!  Service was extremely attentive, we will definitely be going back here again soon."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and really enjoyed the pineapple BBQ sauce with the frys.  Bartender was great and he was from Chicago so made it a little more fun for us.  Had the sandwich special.  Like a chopped smoked meat on a bun"}
{"text":"We stumbled on the restaurant while strolling around. The Epicenter was packed and we were hungry. We saw this spot and checked the yelp reviews... they weren't great but we wanted to check it out for ourselves.   We sat at the bar and had awesome service. Nice, attentive, knowledgeable and visibly working hard. I ordered the fruity margarita and it was pretty good, nothing wrong with it but I generally don't do sweet... my own fault. My husband ordered the flight of bourbon... good choice. He LOVED them, was really happy with the quality.   Food- we ordered two apps to share and that's it. We ordered the Sticky Ribs and Potatoes. Um I am still thinking about those sticky ribs. They were absolutely my favorite.. I almost liked the bowl. The flavors were spot on to my taste buds. Potatoes were also on point. They also served some complimentary bread with a special spread.... I never wanted the basket to end :)   Decor was cute and current. Bathroom was a single and there was only one. It was clean though so I'm not that mad.   We would do date night here anytime! We can't wait to try the dinner!"}
{"text":"Overrated. pretentious. small portions. everything that bbq should not be. drinks were kinda weak. they had run out of pretty much everything by the time we arrived (which was still early for a sat night). the sides are served in these tiny little ramekins. the vinegar based sauce was good- and the pulled pork by itself was tasty. it's just that this place seemed like it was trying to be a trendy hipster bbq joint. which seems like it just doesn't go with bbq. i dunno. there are a lot of places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good stuff! The semi casual atmosphere and the impressive flavors offered here are a reason to return again and again.   We tried City Smoke for restaurant week and boy... we couldn't have been happier. The interior is a really nice mix of farmhouse modern with an awesome open kitchen (open kitchens are a clear sign of the cleanliness in my books).    We started with the bread and butter. The kalamata whipped butter was full of flavor and really a step up from the average bread and butter. The bread was fresh and soft, a nice vessel for the butter.   Next we're appetizers, we had rotisserie chicken wings and the Mediterranean flatbread. The flatbread was a fresh flavor with a high quality olive oil. The wings.... the wings were off the charts. The dry rub was so good the dipping sauces were not needed and the grill marks add a nice color and an extra layer of flavor.   Main course we had the bbq combo and the filet kabob. The combo was huge!! It's enough for two people so be ready to take some home or just split it there. Pulled pork had a nice vinegar sauce, brisket was lean and moist, and the ribs were fun with the two style on the same rack. Sides were also really good. The kabob was a perfect medium well and a might lighter entree which was nice considering how heavy the BBQ is. We managed to finish the kabob entree and almost half the combo and too the rest Home.  Dessert finished the restaurant week meal but we ordered it to go after everything else. Cheesecake and tres leches were also a good size and had good flavor. The cheesecake topping was a really nice addition and the tres leches had a vibrant lemon flavor from the zest added on top."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place as I was waiting for some friends uptown before we made our way to our final destination for the night for dinner.  I sat down at the bar and ordered a beer from their wide range of options.  They must have 10 or 12 taps of local/regional craft beers.  Since we had plans for food later, I didn't order anything else, but man the restaurant sure smelled good with smokey BBQ aromas.  Overall the drink and food menus look promising and I will likely return to at least try some of the food.  My friends showed up, and we had another drink and made our way to our dinner destination."}
{"text":"I took some friends visiting from out of town to Uptown Charlotte.  Food at City Smoke was okay but they were way understaffed.  Waiter was a bit pretentious. Not exactly the experience I wanted to show my friends."}
{"text":"Great food here for a great deal during Queen's Feast/Restaurant Week. For drinks we had a Kentucky Buck and Larceny Mule and both were good, though the Kentucky Buck was both more unusual and better. Our appetizers, the lamb flatbread and cheese plate, were both excellent (especially the lamb flatbread). I had the combo, of which the ribs were the best (flavorful, lots of meat) and my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the rotisserie standing pork rib roast. Shoutout to our server, Demetre, who was very friendly, provided excellent service and recommendations, and made our visit on the whole outstanding."}
{"text":"City Smoke is a new urban BBQ experience unique to Charlotte.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The food is reasonably priced and of a good quality.  I wouldn't say that it blew us away and was the best barbecue we ever had.... but I also had no complaints.  Our favorites of the meal were the fried pickles for an appetizer and the beef brisket."}
{"text":"The place is decorated well and was busy on a Friday night. Our server was nice and great local beers on tap. As far as food goes, it was by far the worst bbq I ever had. My wife ordered chicken which was dry and I ordered pulled pork which was flavorless and dry. My beer, which was delicious had a 3 inch crack from the top of the glass and the second round didn't get served until we were done with dinner. Everything here seemed rushed with little attention to detail. Highly recommend eating somewhere else, plenty of restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Good, not great.  I love the interior. The big square bar is nice with the 3 HD screens to hold your attention. They also have like a 'BBQ Bar' where you can sit at stools and watch the cooks prepare your entree of choice in front of you.   Ordered the City Smoke Chicken wings for $5. They were served hot and tender. They were accompanied by blue cheese and 'Devil's Butter'. Def worth the $5, but not exactly the greatest wings Ive ever had.   For my entree I ordered Kansas City Slathered ribs. The half rack was $13, the full was $19. The ribs were def tender and moist. I got Mac-n-cheese and baked beans as an appetizer. I dunno, for some reason I wasn't a fan of the Mac-n-cheese. They did something funny with the cheese, didn't taste like something grandma would make. The baked beans were up to standard.   Service was great.  Music was great.  Even though there's still some kinks to be worked out, I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Starters for us was sautéed almonds with olive oil.  This is a must have.   Half and Half.  Texas and Oklahoma style ribs. I had both vinegar based and ketchup based sauce. Fries and black bean soup for sides.    Finish up with a caramelized banana split.   Big surprise from an Metro BBQ Restaurants."}
{"text":"Me and Jim Hutton ate here and loved it.  Priced reasonably and good portions."}
{"text":"I went to City Smoke with a co-worker a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised with the service we received, the atmosphere and the bbq!  I ordered one of their house salads with brisket, and although the brisket was not the best I've ever had, it was quite tasty and made for a delicious lunch.   We had no problem getting a table and had a charming server who was funny, attentive, and got all of our menu modifications correct!   I tried a taste of the mac-n-cheese from my co-worker's place and it was pretty phenomenal... I'll definitely order it the next time I'm there!  I'd love to go back for happy hour sometime, the bar seemed really neat and they have an extensive bourbon selection, so I'll definitely be back!   City Smoke has my vote as a solid, not too pricey, bbq restaurant in uptown! A great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Reviews were not great at the time I went, but decided to give it a chance as I was in the mood for BBQ. It tasted allright, but nothing memorable about it. The sauces on the table are not that great. The banana cream pie was delicious. My wife had ordered a bottle of sprite, it was filled up to 70% and the bottle had been tampered with. Someone was thirsty and decided to take a zip from our drink before serving it? Not cool. We had two main courses, one beer, one soda and one dessert, the total with tip came to lower 40s something. Not too bad, but will probably look for some more authentic bbq next time I am in town."}
{"text":"See Dan. General manager and all-around good guy for making the best Manhattan in Charlotte...or anywhere for that fact. Top notch.  Nicole was my server and just a doll--very attentive and went overboard to make sure I was happy with the service."}
{"text":"I must say I underestimated this place, I went in with very low expectations based on the reviews.  I did everything I could to get out of the group luncheon but ended up enjoying my pulled chicken sandwich with one of the sauces on the table and I really wanted a plate of the pickled okra that they serve with the sandwiches.....it was so very good.  Not sure about the rest of the food but everyone in my group really enjoyed what they had."}
{"text":"Dan, the manager is a great asset to this restaurant.  We arrived on Christmas Eve for our 6:30 reservation, keep in mind the restaurant was about 3/4 full, so busy, but not slammed.  The host sat us and then moved us, why I'm not really sure; 10 minutes went by and four servers had walked by us, two serving tables on either side of us and no one stopped, even after we tried to get their attention.  So, we quietly just gathered our stuff and walked out of the door.  At this time, Dan, the manager saw us and asked what happened, we told him and he apologized and asked us to stay; he comped our appetizer, first round of drinks and was personally our server.  He took great care of us, was very apologetic, extremely knowledgeable of the menu, had wonderful suggestions and was friendly to our children as well!    My husband is a bourbon fan and the bourbon selection here is wonderful.  I had the pineapple smash, with muddled grilled pineapple and it was amazing! Chicken wings, prime rib and the burger were all wonderful as well and cooked to perfection.  Because of Dan and the experience he provided, after a rough start, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"On a business trip to Charlotte, NC and my producer wanted to go to Roosters' but we didn't have reservations. Janie checked her list and decided Haymaker would be a great second choice. On the way back to the rental truck we saw City Smoke. So, instead of driving to Haymaker 10 minutes we check the list again and City Smoke was next on the list. Compromise not really, right place right time more like it. This place has great BBQ and insanely delicious sides especially the vegetable variety.  I ordered the quarter rotisserie chicken, small portion and the two sides. Brussels Sprouts crazy good, Acorn squash step back and check yourself. Chill vibe, modern decor professional service and a cold brew to boot. Downtown is a better place with City Smoke around. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Brought a group of 12 all was great   Superb service!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mac's, Bill Spoon's, the other Mac's, Queen City Q and then decided to check out City Smoke about a year after it opened.    I'm strictly making my judgement on the mac & cheese and fries because, well, thats whats important to me.  Unfortunately, they didn't win me over.  The mac & cheese wasn't cheesy & creamy enough for my liking and the fries had a bit too much seasoning.    I think I'll stick to Queen City Q when I'm looking for BBQ uptown."}
{"text":"I had a quarter ROTISSERIE CHICKEN and it was not that great.  I have now been three times each time is the same result.  The flavor of the chicken is off and not for me.  The texas toast, mac n cheese and fries all great, just the main dish was a let down.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I had the brisket with grits & collard greens. The fried pickles were unusual & tasty. The drinks were original. The service was extremely slow. We were here for 45 min. before they took our dinner order. If the service was faster, I would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"Perhaps I should have ordered ribs or a burger with some bacon and real cheese.   You see... I like Mexican food. I'm all about that life; but every once in a while, I crave a burger. So why not try a burger but with a little Mediterranean flavor? Right? Fail. I can't remember what the name of that joint was, but it had feta cheese, lemon and sage aioli, lettuce, and some other stuff. The meat was juicy but had no flavor... AT ALL. I mean, can I get a little salt and pepper on that joint???   The fries weren't really my style. I like the thick cut steak or crinkled cut fries. So they were \"Mer\".   My b/f's burger was pretty good. He had what I should have ordered in the first place cuz it had what?... bacon and cheddar cheese. You normally can't go wrong with that. Either I'm getting that or some ribs.   Service was straight and I like people watching, so it was a nice spot to do that."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Chris R. was right on time with his review! We had the same experience with 6 people all with 6 different meal choices.  The obvious clue should have been how empty they were on a Sat night.  Keep walking when you see this place, no wait, RUN!  Cold buns, cold wings, cold BBQ, but I will admit the baked beans were hot and decent, but watery... How do you stay open when you don't cook food to the right temp, I'm pretty sure they are microwaving left-overs! Service was aweful, didn't refill our drinks at all while we were there for an hour, no knowledge of the menu!  Take it from someone who eats Lexington BBQ a few times a month.... This place sucks all around and I hope they go out of business, then maybe someone who knows how to cook can move into this corner I go by numerous times a weekend. It's insulting they would even try to sell what prepare or actually don't."}
{"text":"It was OK, but not amazing. The brisket had an awesome smoke flavor, but was tough to chew and swallow. Perhaps the extra fatty section through out my pieces is an aquired taste. Their BBQ sauce was tasty. If the meat had been a better cut then I would have upped the stars for sure.   The atmosphere was nice. I've never slide so much on a wood floor while seated in a chair. Kinda entertaining.   Oh.. On a side note, my first time eating pickled okra, and that was yummy."}
{"text":"I had the half rib sampler along with cheese grits and Mac and cheese.  Everything was delicious. However with the sampler I was supposed to get three varieties by it seemed like I only got two and both were the same except one had a little BBQ sauce squirted on it.  Them having only 1 bathroom was a problem and caused some uncomfortable lineups in a storage hallway."}
{"text":"Very accommodating to our large party on a busy Friday night! The food was excellent. The cornbread muffins were mini size which was a little disappointing but the rest of the food definitely made up for it. Drinks were kept full, food was served at the right temps, and what a fun spot to visit in downtown Charlotte. Hope I get to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch during a visit to Charlotte. Great atmosphere, great food!! The rotisserie cauliflower was amazing along with the rotisserie wings! Their sauces with the half rotisserie chicken I personally thought left a little to be desired which is the only reason for the 4star rating but other than that..awesome spot!"}
{"text":"Honestly was one of the worst meals I've ever had. The bbq was swimming in water. The best way I can put it is it was like the bbq was boiled in water. The chicken was very dry and the sides looked like they had been sitting out for hours.  It was restaurant week so maybe it is usually better but that was our first and last time. We had to go over to Aria to eat after leaving City Smoke."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Had a great time last weekend.  Ate at the bar and the bartender was great.  She made a fantastic dirty martini and they had blue cheese stuffed olives!!! We had oysters and wings and everything was good.  Will definitely be back! This could be a regular place.  The rest of the menu was intriguing and I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Bar maid was very knowledgeable and courteous. Gave some great suggestions for things to do in town. Food was on-point. I will definitely return for more of Smoke."}
{"text":"Great service with excellent food, and prices weren't too bad either. I got the BBQ platter which everything on it was quite yummy. My mother got the octopus as her meal and it was awesome! Rotieserie octopus? Who would have thought? Def a place to try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to check out this new place and see how their barbecue was. It was pretty good. He ordered a whiskey, which they have a nice selection of, and I got a tap beer. It was served so ice cold and stayed cold for quite some time. They have daily specials on beer and food up on their chalkboard. Our service was great and the food was served so hot we had to wait a minute to eat it. We started with fried pickles, which had a nice flavor but maybe could be thicker? I ordered the fried chicken (it came with three pieces) and mac and cheese with baked beans. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fried okra. I really liked the smoke flavor of the pork."}
{"text":"I ate here hoping to eat some great bbq. I ate the fried catfish and bbq beans. To me it was way to greasy.   The restaurant was in the corner and had TV's which was really nice, but I wish they served more so I could appreciate the goodness of the food.   I ordered some wings and i ate the large bbq wings which was really good.   My friend had a bacon burger and that was pretty greasy. But overall it was a big burger that tasted great!   If your trying to catch a game and get food, definitely go to this place. You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"So HOW does this place stay in business??? Imagine filling up your bath tub full of SALT....the very fine kind. Now, deep fry your fries and immediately submerge them in the middle of the salt bath....and leave them in for 15 minutes. Then pull 'em out and eat. Well, that is the recipe for City Smoke fries! Trust me, I am definitely a Salt-o-holic. When I think something is TOO salty, my GAWD it must truly be SALTY! All I can still taste is SALT.   Last time I came in, I had their brisket, and it wasn't very good. So I stuck to something safe....a Patty Melt. Now the burger meat itself wasn't that bad, but they also salted the outside of their bun. Who does that?  I'm guessing here that the owners of City Smoke own lots of Stock in Morton's. I have NEVER been so innundated by salt flavors in my life. It's been an hour since I left here and I still taste SALT.  I may NEVER have to use salt again....I think my tastebuds have been permanently salted. In Baseball, you get 3 strikes. In Paul-Ball, you get 2. City Smoke you are OUT!"}
{"text":"City Smoke was the first BBQ place I've been to since I moved to the Carolina's. I'm seeing there are only 3 stars and I'm not sure why.   The atmosphere is cool, really laid back and has a brewery feel to it, which I like. They have chalkboards with all of their drink specials posted and they serve local beers, which I also like. My friend and I posted up in City Smoke for a couple hours to sip some drinks and have a couple snacks and other than the general location, we weren't disappointed.  What I mean by the location is that, it's hard to have that real BBQ feel in the middle of a city, for me anyways. I tend to think a BBQ joint would be the most legit as a hole in the wall, and city smoke is more contemporary. That doesn't mean it wasn't good! We got a couple local beer flights, the cucumber-jalapeno cocktail and the bacon bourbon bloody mary. The cucumber-jalapeno cocktail kicked my ass. That thing was so strong and it wasn't that spicy, it was more refreshing. The bacon bourbon bloody mary stole the show though. It was hearty but sweet at the same time, in a good way. Just try it, you won't be disappointed.  Finally, after like 2 hours of sipping making small talk with our server (he was pretty cool and recommended some other bars for us to check out), we ordered food. We shared a combo platter so that we could try everything. It came with two types of ribs, pulled pork, brisket and a couple sides.  The green beans were decent, mac n cheese, killer. The meat was on point though. The ribs were tender, the pulled pork flavorful and the brisket was smoky. I was very pleased with everything we ate.  If you're in the downtown area and looking for some BBQ, you should try this place out. It's slightly hidden though. It's like built into a big glass building, you have to really look for it but it's worth it."}
{"text":"As a Texas barbecue fan this is a great place Service- fabulous,the ribs incredible especially the dry rub Texas ribs, pulled pork excellent and to the point, brisket really good, great selection of sauces and a real home feel to the place. The manger came by multiple times at the right times. Fantastic strawberry shortcake. Truly excellent experience and food- felt like home !"}
{"text":"Decent food, but not stellar. We came in for lunch and they seated us quickly and service was great.  Nice industrial decor and clean space. Would definately come back for a good (but not great) meal."}
{"text":"To summarize in 1 word - Awful.  I'll start out with the good points:  The chicken was moist and they had ketchup.  Bad points:  Food came out luke warm / cold (including the chicken which was moist). Sides were not good (tried the Mac and cheese, Cornbread, beans, okra).  None of us finished our meals, it was pretty close to inedible.  The 3 sauces on the table were bad individually, but when combined were not that bad (not good, just not that bad).  If someone tries to bring you here talk them into going to Queen City Q instead. You'll get a great meal there.  I am not sure why so many people wrote bad reviews and gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"I work downtown; been here two or three times for lunch.  Pork BBQ - Their's is good.  Good flavor, several sauces available, and the portions (at least on the Plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine).   I've had the Brunswick Stew.  Okay, so simply based upon my experience and input from friends, Brunswick stew is usually thick and not soupy.  The stew is soupy here - i.e. it has a lot of broth.  But, get this now... I've ordered it twice because it's good.  So it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try.  Collard greens were good.  There seems to be a lot of stems, but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out.  Good flavor!  All in all, this is a convenient spot for good BBQ in the center of downtown Charlotte.  Fortunately for us here in the queen city, we now have two options available!!  If you do go, get the deviled eggs appetizer.  They are good!  One thing to note... if you order a soft drink, you're buying a bottle.  That's it.  So your refills are limited to your bottle.  Want more? Buy another.  I don't care for this approach.  The wait staff was very nice, friendly and informative.  Not terribly attentive, but then they don't have to do refills either. ;-)  So, I like this place and will most likely be back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me. I would say they get an ok. I had the ribs, which were cooked properly, fall off the bone, but the options for sauce (KC - tomato base) and dry rub were blah. I got 4 of each. The dry rub was caked on the ribs and I had to scrap it off, it was overpowering and too heavy on the sugar. The KC sauce grew on me a little bit, but again was nothing special. I would like to see a couple more options, but for what it is, I'd consider it again as a back up.  I sat at the bar and my bartender was very attentive, which helps the rating. The drink list was decent and the bar snacks were decent.  The oysters were good and I would consider them the highlight of the dinner."}
{"text":"Recently went on a bbq pilgrimage in Charlotte.  Mac's and Midwood Smoke were the clear leaders of the six places my crew visited.  Unfortunately, this was the loser of the group.  Average to poor bbq. Average to poor service.  The ambiance was nice and the food presentation was cool.  But bbq is all about the food and forget the frills."}
{"text":"I came during my lunch break, so this will be a very quick review -- I will go back and elaborate on this later.  In short, while this may be a decent restaurant, I wouldn't really call it a BBQ joint.  Highlights: Sauce and seasoning pairings on the ribs are spot on!   Good slaw (vinegar-based) and potato salad (mayo/cream based). Friendly service.  Needs improvement: Price point is a bit high for what you get. Would prefer spare ribs over loin backs (or at least offer the option). Location of the restaurant does not allow for true smoking of the meat.  Other info to know: The address states 100 N. Tryon, but the entrance is located at the corner of Trade and College."}
{"text":"I found City Smoke to be disappointing. I walk by it regularly & was really looking forward to trying it out. Food was so so & service nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. We are visiting Charlotte and came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The staff all seems brand new. We waited for a good five minutes for a hostess to even come help us. Our server Michelle was very nice and super friendly. None of the other staff had a smile at any point - they all seemed like they hated being there. They were out of chicken which is their specialty dish so we ordered the sampler with two sides. The pulled pork was really good. The brisket was burnt and very dry. The toast was also burnt. Ribs were good nothing special though. The vinegar based bbq sauce (if you can classify it as a sauce) was weird. The sides we got were the rotisserie potatoes and mac'n'cheese which were both mediocre. Some of the potatoes were not fully cooked. Mac was pretty bland. Overall, we would not go back."}
{"text":"Corner locations tend to accelerate the clientele of a good Resturant, in the case of City smoke, the captivating aroma of smoke delights billowing down the street truly doesn't hurt. My most recent pit stop here resulted in a smoked pulled pork sandwich, and the house cut and garnished with a garlicky seasoning that seemingly melts in your mouth (little chewing required).  Next up, I must try their prime rib."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. Started with the homemade chips with bleu cheese, descent taste, but chips should have been hot or at least warm. Had the Brunswick Stew, it was unlike any that I have ever had, and I don't mean that in a good way. If you are going to advertise a classic dish, serve it. This was merely a bowl of old meat and bean soup.  The shrimp and grits were actually quite good, nice flavor and consistency. The Jalapeno Cheddar cornbread arrived after all the other dishes and having to ask if it were coming. Don't bother, poor flavor, texture, and portion size, three strikes.  Service was prompt and friendly, atmosphere was nice but I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing. We went there on a locals recommendation. They do have an excellent selection of delicious beer, however the food was only mediocre. The chicken wings were good, but the fried chicken had an extremely salty breading, so salty that we returned it.  Our server was very pleasant and immediately took the dish back. We tried the mixed BBQ as well and found it of only mixed quality. The collard green side was, like the chicken, too salty. The ribs were nice but the pulled pork and brisket were nothing special. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"You have to try the roasted chicken with mac n cheese, collards, and corn bread.  Man, this food is so so good! A MUST if you are ANYWHERE near Uptown Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to southern bbq food here in Charlotte, North Carolina. My boyfriend and I didn't know where to eat after our ballet show, so a bouncer outside guarding the escalators across the street suggested we tried this place.   At city smoke I ordered the beef brisket and it came with two sides: the slaw and the jalapeño cheddar corn bread! The brisket was delicious and must of been roasting for hours, for it just melted in my mouth good. However the corn bread was just okay, I wish it was warmed up for me. The cole slaw wasn't as what I am used to being from up north.   My boyfriend for the half slab sampler, so he got a taste of the ribs in the different sauces that they offered. Out of the three ribs he liked the Memphis ribs the best.   They have a good selection of beer and being in a town like Charlotte I had to have a beer to go with my bbq!"}
{"text":"Will definitely becoming back to this place! Very nice staff, very accommodating with dietary restrictions, great atmosphere and delicious food!! Perfect lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place isn't rated as 5 stars. We had a friendly and attentive waitress, the beer selection was great and the ambiance is pretty cool. The food was delicious. I think anyone that said the BBQ was plain didn't realize that they make it that way so you can choose your own sauce (which is on the table). The Mac and cheese is delicious. The beer prices were also great too...I believe it was $3.50 for craft beers from Noda (for you out-of-towners that means beer from an area of Charlotte). Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went to Charlotte for a day and decided to try City Smoke since it was close to our attraction. It was early evening and was not crowded so we just sat at the bar. The bartender was so inattentive and not friendly at all... we almost had to flag her down anytime we needed anything. Considering there were 3 other people in the entire restaurant, it was quite annoying. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with mac and cheese. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. However, the sauce for the sandwich was pretty good. Everything on the menu was also fairly expensive. Our bill was around $50 for 2 entrees, 2 beers, and 1 mixed drink. City Smoke was definitely a poor choice considering the amount of restaurants in the area...Unless you like overpriced, mediocre BBQ."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the Rib sampler with fries, salad and jalapeño corn bread. The ribs were acceptable to good. Keep in mind that I walked in on a Tuesday night at 915pm to eat... So it's to be expected that the food might not be absolutely fresh - not to mention that it's smoked BBQ. Avoid the salad. The fries were really good - slightly sweet and otherwise perfectly seasoned. The Jalapeño corn bread was superb. The reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 3 was the price/value ratio, and the fact that they had about 12 craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, after hearing very little positive reviews I decided to give this place a shot. I wanted to at least give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I should have listened to my gut instinct and gone somewhere else. My friend and I started with the house made chips and buffalo wings. While they were very tasty, we ended up waiting 30 mins because our waitress forgot to ring them in. We were a little upset about this as we couldn't get the manager over to our table to tell her about it because she was very rarely in sight. The one positive thing I will say about this place is their pulled pork BBQ. I prob could have had another full serving of that! Other than that, there's not much to write home about. Honestly, I think I will be sticking with Queen City Q or Macs in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty effin bangin food for great prices! And their meat is from a farm that is animal friendly/all natural, which makes it even better! Would've got 5 stars but they don't have a happy hour... whomp whomp"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place.   I arrived at about 845 pm into Charlotte after driving 8 hours. The City Center Marriott is nice, as is the restaurant inside, but nothing caught my eye there.   Perhaps my Yelp settings were wrong, but City Smoke didn't show up on the first page. After reviewing a few places, I decided just to walk out and see what I find.   City Smoke is just down from the hotel on S. College.   At 10pm, I had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese. They serve Carolina and KC BBQ sauce on the side. At this hour, I was expecting it to be dried out but it was perfect. Both sauces were very good.   The bartender was out of Buffalo Trace and made a good recommendation.   Prices for both food and drink were good for this location. Their prices, quality, service make it a great place to go!"}
{"text":"I'll start this off with the admission that I am not the biggest NC BBQ fan. That is, what the natives of NC (specifically Charlotte) consider to be the best BBQ is far from what I consider it to be. Their favorite places are miles outside of town and serve from meat with their BBQ sauce.  I am not a native, so my preferences are a bit more unique.  The place has a great atmosphere, with their tapped beers scrawled over one of the walls in chalk which looks nice. They have a good selection. Their BBQ is not bad at all. Is it the best I've ever had? No. The best I've had did not come out of an a la cart restaurant - and I don't think it ever will. Compared to the competition in Charlotte I consider this to be a good choice though, certainly as good as Queen City a few blocks over.  My favorite item on the menu  however, is not BBQ at all. Their monstrous chicken wings are phenomenal. If I had to go watch the game somewhere Uptown, this would probably be my choice."}
{"text":"I was not dazzled by the food.  The place is quaint for an uptown spot.  The food is definitely overpriced. I will not return on my dime, it would have to be someone else's."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot, even though I have heard only mediocre reviews. City smoke delivered on its reputation; food was just OK but service was good. When I go to a BBQ place I expect bold flavors and city smoke failed to give me that. The interior is pretty neat and I like the feel, but without some good food it fails to attract me for a second trip."}
{"text":"What a joke. Saturday night they took a big party reservation through greed and spent the rest of the time suffering through stress, explaining that delays and canceled reservations was because they had a large party, even had to print more menus. Made a reservation on open table that was confirmed that they subsequently canceled not that I saw the email. We offered to sit at the bar even though we were celebrating our anniversary written on the reservation they canceled. Manger thought that would be great! Offered to give us a whopping 10% off just before we were about to leave as an after thought. I had the server reverse it. Food was average and luke warm at best. Bar staff were great but frazelled. Hope you have a better experience if you choose to go."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Excellent selection of whiskey and bourbons.  The prawns where amazing as well as the filet kabob. And the salami charcuterie was amazing as well.  I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"You honestly can't go wrong with anything here! Just tried the pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich and its an absolute game changer. I've had the BBQ plate my first time at City Smoke of course. Because if you claim to be a BBQ restaurant it has to be on point. I loved it and the Mac n Cheese is a must!"}
{"text":"Each and every time I have been here I've had wonderful service and worthwhile food and drinks! If you are looking for classic BBQ with a modern twist this place is for you. Order the mac & cheese!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love City Smoke. I live and work in Uptown and this is my favorite place to eat. Good food, friendly service, creative drink selections... What more can a man ask for?"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink!!  They have free peanuts at the door - yum!  The special taps keep the beer ICE COLD.  They have Son of a Peach on tap which is my new favorite beer, as well as many hard to find bottles.  I would say stick to the apps if anything here.  The brisket was lean and looked like they trucked it in.  The cheese muffin that came with the combo tasted days old and dry - so gross.  The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it was out of a box.  Please.  This is the South, don't try to trick us by saying you are a Q joint when your brisket is dry and your mac is out of a box.    I will keep coming in due to the excellent beer choices and the super location.  Overall it is A-OK."}
{"text":"Friends and I ate dinner before a show Nice menu, friendly  attentive service. Moderate prices. Food nicely plated and served hot. We ordered:. Butternut squash bisque, , 2 orders of roast chicken ,one beef brisket  dinner and  one pork shoulder dinner. 2 sides  per dinner  some of our sides were roasted pee wee potatoes, beets with blue cheese, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower and creamy coleslaw The brisket very tender as well as the pork.  Our chicken was a bit dry. The soup delicious as well as  most of the sides . The coleslaw was fresh and brussel sprouts just a tad chewy  On the way to the single  restroom we saw spilled water on the floor with staff working  around it. . I mentioned something and it was cleaned up promptly with  a caution sign out up.  I would  definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Terrible food, cold bread and buns. Grill marks on cold dry bread. My friend asked for a sample of brisket before ordering a platter and was told no. You can tell they do not know BBQ or sauces. Nice bar."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got takeout. The waitress was nice and offered me something to drink while I waited for my burger and soup to be brought out.   The city burger was large enough, but overall nothing special. Everything was about $11 and it took about 10 minutes. There's a ranch dressing on it which \elevated the  burger but in terms of the meat it was a bit over cooked. It came in a potatoe type bun.   Decor seems to be a nice happy our place, they seemed to be focused on the barbeque, but their burgers were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This was a real disappointment.  While it is in a great location - right downtown Charlotte, the food was pretty mediocre. I ordered the grilled Ceaser salad with pulled pork. There was a good amount of meat, but it was dry and pretty bland. The salad was watery and I saw no evidence of the \"slightly charred\" lettuce leafs. I tasted my friend's brisket , and it was even drier than my pulled pork.   The service was ok, but if you want some good BBQ, I'd steer clear of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has upscale BBQ with a cool urban atmosphere. They do give you a lot of food, but the meat was a little dry."}
{"text":"Rotisserie pulled chicken sandwich, awesome. Mac-n-cheese side, awesome. Noise level above engine of a 747, not awesome."}
{"text":"We had dinner there on a Saturday night and we won't go back!! We waited for over and the food is overpriced for the portion size- we got the house chips for an appetizer and we got a total of 10 small chips. The food was below average and the service was horrible!!! She came back twice the whole duration of the meal (to bring the check which we had to ask for was one of them) my water glass was empty for the entire meal (even after I asked for a refill) we will not be going back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite BBQ joint! Every side dish I've had there is amazing. Standouts would be Mac and cheese and the banana pudding although everything I've had there I've loved."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!!!! This place is delicious I went with a large group and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was stacked high with meat. As my side I had the mac and cheese and boy was it cheesy and delicious! I ordered a drink from the bar and it was not watered down and gave me the perfect effect of relaxation you would expect from a well mixed drink.   Our waiter was very attentive even though we came on a busy Friday night. He was able to accommodate all of our request for what we asked for in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a concert and had a great experience! The staff was super nice and the food was great! We actually ended up ordering everything bit BBQ, and we're so surprised with how good it was. The  lamb flatbreads and Mediterranean flatbread we're amazing! We also ended up ordering the sticky ribs app. Great food and great service for a quick bite in Uptown."}
{"text":"I honestly would have probably been in the 2 star range had it not been for the fantastic bar and drink selection.  To begin with the setting is pretty typical of a BBQ joint.  No frills or glitzy or glamorous stuff, just comfy seating and wood/barn'ish decor.    The food just didn't do it for me.  My girlfriend and I decided to split the combo meal which had an assortment of pulled pork, ribs and brisket.  Most memorable was the brisket.  It was flat, very poorly sliced and just not tasty.  The ribs gave the meal a little bit of redemption but overall just not great.  The drinks....woah....love it.  Glycol taps?  Nothing better to make your beer ICE cold!  The selections as far as beer are probably as good as any I've seen in Charlotte.  No, they don't have 78 taps, etc. etc. but truthfully I don't want that.  I just want a few great ones.  They have exactly what I like...Bell's Two Hearted, Hopslam, etc.  All in all I think this is a great place for happy hour, just not somewhere I'll be going to grub on some BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is in the heart of uptown. I came on a Saturday night after while out. Had a reservation and we were soon seated. The staff were friendly, but not attentive. Waiter forgot the bread, didn't check on us for water or to see how the four was, etc. To top it off the food was mediocre. Surprisingly they were packed. Still scratch my head on how?! Do people believe this is great food. I had a few drinks so typically your hungry or food taste better but nah, They interesting part is they have one restroom! Really?! I asked about this and they noted because they are apart if a bigger building that has public bathrooms the same law doesn't apply. So the night I went to dine here  I waited 15 minutes in line to use their restroom or I had the option of going up the escalator and walking through someone's wedding to pee.  On a cool night each time the door opens everyone can feel it. This one dinner was so annal about the door being closed I thought you pay to dine here and get a work out while you eat- lol. I can say the staff were nice despite it all but probably won't return but it could of been the day or time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure just how qualified I am to judge a BBQ place in Charlotte, being from Seattle myself, but I was reasonably impressed by what City Smoke had to offer.  For starters, their drink menu was pretty impressive, tons of bourbons and some specialty mixed drinks.  I had the Magic Bulleit, which was composed of Bulleit Bourbon (surprise!), ginger, simple syrup, and a splash of soda.  The drink was really good, though a bit under-mixed for my taste (aka, 1-oz shot, not 1-1/2 oz).  Looking over the menu, I really couldn't make up my mind, so I was extremely happy to see the $26 combo plate that they have - pulled pork, brisket, all three types of ribs (Memphis, Kansas City, and Texas - more of that in a moment), and two sides.  I'll be damned if I wasn't going to give that one a try.  So I did...and the behemoth arrived after a short wait.  Here are my findings: 1. Pulled Pork - A-MAZ-ING...perfectly tender, perfect light smoke flavor, and when tossed in a combination of their vinegar BBQ sauce plus their Kansas City sauce, utterly delectable.  2. Brisket - A bit of a miss here for me.  I loves my brisket, and they served up a decent version.  Very nice smoke ring, excellent balance of beef and smoke flavor, but it was really, REALLY dry - almost like they'd sliced it an hour or so before and left it warming.  It was good, but nothing to rave about -- it's also the only part of the meal I didn't finish (well, fries don't count).  3) Ribs - Each set had their own unique flavor, but it seemed mostly from the sauce (or lack thereof) rather than a unique preparation of each.  My biggest recommendation is to go fully-sauced or naked - either Kansas City smothered or Texas dry rub.  The Memphis was something a little bit in-between, and suffered for it.  My favorite by far were the Texas dry ribs, but even they were a little over-cooked and more blackened than I typically like my ribs.  The Kansas City were decently sauced, though I still added a little more to it.  The Memphis really needed something to stand out from the other two, and kind of missed the mark there.  Overall, good ribs, but not outstanding.  4) Sides - I went with the Lexington Slaw, which was diced cabbage mixed in a vinegar sauce, and their City Smoke Dusted Fries.  The slaw was second only to the pork in sheer BBQ bliss - the balance of the vinegar sauce with the cabbage was absolutely amazing.  The fries were pretty good, but...well, they were fries.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, but I wasn't as wowed as I really hoped I would be."}
{"text":"I'm glad I went in.  Loved the food.  Healthy barbecue. I loved the rib plate and the brisket.  I got it to go fast service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the heart of Uptown Charlotte. Great location! They validate parking! I went with friends. We didnt have to wait long for drinks or food orders! Last night I enjoyed the beef brisket along with mac n cheese and collards! Every bite was good. Our waite staff was helpful and friendly. The only downside to the restaurant was the tables and how close they were placed together. I was afraid to get up to go pee because I was scared to knock something off a table or bump someone. The restaurant theme is cool with a rustic look! I will definitely go back but maybe on a less busy day."}
{"text":"I'm giving three stars because I had the lackluster lunch special.  I always believe the regular menu items are better than any specials offered.  I had the lunch special with deviled eggs, hand cut fries, and the pulled rotisserie chicken.  As soon as I told the server what I wanted she came back with my food in less than five minutes.  My fries are \"sitting under a warmer\" warm, not fresh out the cooker warm,  the deviled eggs.... everybody shouldn't do deviled eggs, and the pulled chicken didn't have that juiciness that rotisserie chicken usually has.  It was a decent lunch for the price, but quite underwhelming given my expectations based on what the place looked like and the pictures I saw here on Yelp.  Maybe one day I'll give them another chance for their dinner service."}
{"text":"My take on City Smoke: - Get the \"EXPRESS\" lunch. Two sides and Texas toast for $8.99. It doesn't get any better than that. - Try the rotisserie Pee Wee potatoes. Very tasty. - Personally, I'd skip skip Beef Brisket.  - Mac N Cheese was Ok. - Service was fast and very friendly.   Three Yelps."}
{"text":"Ordered: the dish with different meat (ribs, brisket, and pork), Mac and cheese, jalapeño bread, fried pickle.   Meat was dry, fried pickle was okay, Mac and cheese was awesome.   Service was great! Can the servers here teach a thing or two for the servers at Queen City q?"}
{"text":"Great food, perfect portions, really good service, and a nice menu with variety. We had pork, rotisserie chicken, grits, Brussels sprouts and one of the new cocktails. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte i decided to try this place since it was near my hotel..Good beer selection; didn't recognize the names but they all looked cool (interesting names) and pretty inexpensively priced. The waitress was really helpful with selecting beer and food options. She said the fried oysters were popular. I love me some oysters but I usually eat them raw and these were breaded and fried which took some getting use to. I really wasn't too impressed; I had to put hot sauce on it to be able to eat it! It was just a weird combo of mush and the fried breading so I couldn't eat it. I can't tell if it was how it was made or if it's just me. I wanted to try the pulled pork and ribs but there was no combo for it but she let me order the ribs and a side of pulled pork. They had a good selection of sides but she suggested the mac and cheese and fried okra so I went with it...the okra was surprisingly good and the Mac and cheese was disappointing. The crunchy topping on the mac and cheese makes it good but the cheese was really weird. I was really sad about the pulled pork; I imagine meat that is soft and shreds easily and that was not the case. I got large clumps of pork that wasn't soft at all, was hard to pull apart and had ok taste. The ribs made up for it though! I tried all 3 kinds and the menu really describes them well! The ribs had good flavor and the BBQ sauces they serve is really good! Meal comes with Texas toast which is good too. All in all it was a good meal but I would only come back for the beer and ribs (if I'm ever back in Charlotte that is)."}
{"text":"I'm a barbecue nut and always seek out the local joints wherever I go.  I figured I'm coming to NC and since I love NC style cue I'd have a great time.   Unfortunately in an area that is full of good cue - this was only okay.   I wished I had gone elsewhere as soon as my Brunswick Stew came out.  It was thin and waterly with very little flavor.   I have eaten BStew all over the south and this was in the bottom 5 that I've had.   I also had the pulled pork and it was only passable.     The atmosphere was fine and obviously caters to the young after work crowd which is fine.  They had live music in the form of a guitar player.  That was enjoyable and the beer selection was good.   I just wish the cue was better.  If it was then this place would be a hit.   Would I return - no."}
{"text":"1 star for that sweet Texas toast/bread. Like, yoooooo! Give me a warning.   5 stars for the operating hours.  4.9 stars on the decor  3 stars for the service and valet  5 stars for security in the building  5 stars for having a BBQ joint uptown  4 stars for the Restaurant Week offering. Pretty decent choices. I personally didn't care for any of the desserts but hey.  3.5 stars on their drink menu and prices.   2 stars on the prices for those SMOKING GOOD SMOKED wings.  1 star for that red chimichurri sauce that's served with the jumbo shrimp appetizer.   5 stars for an actual cloth instead of paper napkins.    Things appeared quite clean. Astethic to the eye.  Decent location.  Nice cut and I forgot to ask for center cut.  Only had 2 kinds of ribs. I recalled seeing a 3rd but I guess it wasn't part of restaurant week.   I will return.  They can keep that mac & cheese. A lot of places around here seem to offer macaroni and cheese but fail to make a nice, juicy, cheesy option. Always dry and light on the cheese. Idk what's that about.   I wanted to try the collard greens and Brussel sprouts but it was one of those days so fries won. I also wanted to try the salmon but brisket won. I look forward to the next trip. Many more options to try.   Oh the pulled pork is a vinegar based cooked item."}
{"text":"This place should have a better rating. The ambiance was fun and the decor was neat. The food was delicious. Their special was a \"pork apocalypse brisket burger\".  It was amazing, and I'm not even a huge pork eater. Our waiter Dan was hilarious and very attentive. I'd highly recommend giving this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the BBQ. I had  the cue combo which had pulled pork, brisket and Memphis, Texas and Kansas City Style ribs. The waiter made a big deal of telling us that the ribs were all St. Louis cut ribs regardless of style. SL cut ribs are larger and meatier. What we got were  short puny ribs with little meat on them, the size of baby backs. They tasted ok but nothing special. When we pointed out they were not the size he had stated, he had no explanation for it. The pulled pork was decent, the brisket was very tough. We had 3 sides-fries, collard greens and creamy grits which were good.    The waiter was apologetic, offered us some kind of card to come back to get a free sandwich, but I honestly don't see myself returning there anytime soon. Midwood Smokehouse does BBQ much better, IMHO"}
{"text":"I take back most of the ugly things I said in my previous review of City Smoke. I'm not sure if they're under new ownership or what, but they've seriously stepped up their game! On my most recent visit, I met my husband and a friend for lunch kinda begrudgingly. But, I was so pleasantly surprised, I had to come back and update the review. Service was attentive and the food was delish! I had a veggie plate with cauliflower, acorn squash, brussel sprouts, and grits -- each was perfect.   Next time we're looking for an uptown dinner spot before a show at Booth or Belk, we'll definitely consider City Smoke! Hopefully, their beer has improved as much as the food and service."}
{"text":"Worst BBQ in Charlotte. Just go to midwood smokehouse and don't waste your time here. I am a huge BBQ fan and even cook a lot myself and know good BBQ and this isn't it. Wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemies."}
{"text":"City Smoke is garbage. My friends and I ended up here after a Bobcats game since it's a short distance from the arena and it's a decision I wholeheartedly regret. First it's extremely dark which isn't necessarily a problem except we ended up using our cellphones to read the menu. That's a bit much. Second the service was horrible despite the place being nearly empty. I could forgive all of that if the food had been good. It's not.  We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer, and to the restaurants credit at least those were fresh from the fryer. They don't taste good, but at least they were cooked to order. That's more than I can say for the rest of it.  I got fried chicken where the meat was cooked but the batter was still wet around the meat. They obviously cook the meat in the oven beforehand and then batter and flash fry it. Better than getting raw chicken but still pretty nasty. I ordered the Mac&Cheese which was bland, and the okra which was flavorless and hard. I assume that comes from hours under a heat lamp.  The meal also came with Texas Toast that tasted like charcoal. I can understand one or two things being sub par but  the entire plate?   My friends got a BBQ sandwich which she took two bites from and stopped eating saying it tasted \"funky\" and the other got the BBQ platter that had a little bit of everything : brisket, ribs, pulled pork.  He said everything was terrible and having tried all the signature sauces on the table I could only imagine.   For such a nice location, the food is worthless. I don't see how they stay in business except tricking people into coming in once, because they certainly won't come back. I'd give it less than 1 star but that's not an option. Please, give this place a pass or you'll end up like me, wasting money (I didn't pay for the chicken dish, but paid for the tea and pickles) and ending up at Denny's where I could get something edible."}
{"text":"Great after work bar - not so great BBQ.   For my meal I ordered the brisket with sides of collards and potato salad.    The brisket has the chewy/dry consistency of reheated meat. Also, there is no identifiable smoke ring, which is the hallmark of smoked meat. Whatever smokey taste I get is on the surface and appears to be smoke flavoring applied as part of a very light rub. Overall low on flavor. I am very disappointed - especially since the name of the place is \"Smoke.\" On the upside the \"brisket sauce\" is tasty and complements the brisket well, but mostly as hydration.   The collards have the familiar vinegary, sweet, hot taste that I like and has ham bits well incorporated for flavor. Overall a good side for those who enjoy collard greens.   The potato salad is forgettable. It appears to be some version of baked potato salad.  It contains celery, green onions, small chunks of red potatoes, a scant few bits of bacon, and is made creamy by what tastes like a mixture of sour cream and mayo. Some may enjoy it, but it was too creamy for me - I can barely taste any potato in the mix.   Overall an unimpressive experience, but since it is conveniently located - in the same building as where I work - and the beer selection is decent I will probably give another main dish and sides a try on a less motivated day."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in to test this little spot out for lunch during the work week...the service was quick as well as the food, but we didn't really see our server that much and sat for most of our meal without anything to drink. The pulled pork was AMAZING and we both loved the different BBQ flavors. I would suggest not ordering the mac n' cheese, it was very bland and came out cold...didn't do a true BBQ restaurant justice.  The hardest part for me to deal with during lunch was watching them slide the sides under the heat lamp and my bowl of collards dump out onto the countertop and then get scooped back into the bowl and sent to my table. I'm sure it's clean up there and the guy washed his hands, but it kind of grossed me out.   All in all everything was OK, but not over the top great. I might go back, but will probably order different sides."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at City Smoke with a few (very minor) glitches. My friends and I had uptown plans that got rained out so we decided to grab dinner instead. On a Friday night we didn't have to wait to get a table which was appreciated but a little odd considering how busy most restaurants can get on the weekends. Regardless, our waitress (should have asked her name) was super friendly and conversational.   To start, I had a margarita (didn't really warrant the $8.50 price tag - it was good but it had a \"watered down\" taste). I ordered a \"pulled chicken\" sandwich with fries and added a side of mac n' cheese based on a recommendation from the waitress. The fries were good but nothing out of the ordinary. The sandwich was fantastic. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had a nice smokey taste. The sauce that was served with it was a great compliment to the sandwich and the fries, too! It was easy to eat and the sandwich stayed intact for the most part.  The mac n' cheese side was a small portion but tasted amazing. It was creamy and had a rich flavor of a few different cheeses. I really enjoyed it.   Overall, the ambiance was warm, the service was fast and friendly and the price tag wasn't unbearable. I had a bill of $20 before the tip which seemed reasonable for the amount of food and the alcohol that I had ordered.  I'll definitely give it a thumbs up and solid 4 star review. I will be back to try the actual BBQ next time. Didn't give it a full 5 because it wasn't really out of the ordinary and there wasn't an \"experience\", it was just a great meal."}
{"text":"Not-that-impressive BBQ place in the heart of Uptown.   We stopped in here one night after passing it every time we walked to the Epicentre from our First Ward apartment.  We were a little worried about the price, but sat down anyway and ordered a burger and brisket.  My wife's burger was good, a decent portion and filling, but nothing to write home about.    My brisket was bad.  As mentioned in other reviews, it tasted like reheated or microwaved frozen meat.  Without the sauce, it would've been inedible. Really disappointing.  After a beer apiece, an appetizer, a burger, brisket, and tip, our bill was $50!  It made sense after checking the itemized bill, but after the quality of food we had eaten, it just felt wrong.  The only thing saving this review from 1-2 star land was the Mac and Cheese.  I've had Mac and Cheese as a side at all other BBQ places we've been to in town, but this was the best.  We might find ourselves back at City Smoke simply because of the convenient location, but if we do, I won't get BBQ... I'll just get the Mac.  Plenty of good BBQ places in Charlotte, too bad this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"My vegetable plate rocked!  There are very few places where I live offering southern food so this was quite a treat.  I didn't try the barbeque but did enjoy my beer and sides.  The wait staff was friendly and there were TVs for watching sports.  I will return next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Our experience was great! The pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich and garlic aioli fries were super delicious and all the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place kinda deserves two stars but  it was clean and had a coolish atmosphere despite subpar food and awful service.  These were the worst fried oysters and fried pickles I've ever had in my life, and those are my go to bar bites so I've had plenty! Everything came in an awful soggy cornmeal coating which fell off when you tried to pick it up. Burger came out over temp, and the only thing on the menu we really wanted (fried chicken) they claimed to be out of. Our waitress RAVED about the banana pudding so we ordered that and a cobbler. We took a few bites and left it. We left a lot of food untouched and our waitress never bothered to ask if something was wrong or if we were dissatisfied. My boyfriend wasted a ton of money on this check, absolutely nothing was worth what we paid aside from my absolutely delicious drink which I believe was a peach Collins. Seriously the owners should hire a new chef and give their bartender a raise, they're the one keeping this place afloat!"}
{"text":"Average BBQ spot at best. Better places Uptown and much better places outside of Uptown. Not a place I plan to visit again."}
{"text":"We took some clients out to City Smoke the other night. I can't say that the food was bad, but it wasn't great. This place has a good beer selection and a nice list of bourbon specialty cocktails. As a bar alone, I would give it a higher rating. Nice atmosphere and huge bar area.  We started our meal out with the fried pickles, which were pretty good, but the shards of glass that I bit into in one of the pickle slices kind of ruined that. The staff reacted, comped my meal, etc. so I wasn't too upset, but it really did freak me out a bit to spit out a few pieces of glass after I just bit into a fried pickle.  But regardless of that event, my opinion of this spot wouldn't change. I would much prefer an NC barbecue restaurant to focus solely on NC barbecue and not try to be a mediocre version of Austin, Kansas City, and Memphis as well. The NC pulled pork was quite good, but the eastern vinegar sauce was horrible. I love Eastern NC style vinegar based sauce, but I don't know who came up with the vinegar crap I tasted there. No flavor at all. The Kansas City sauce resembled nothing like I have ever tasted in my 6 or 7 experiences in KC with their local style barbecue. It tasted like Ketchup when compared to Arthur Bryant's or Gates'. Their own \"city smoke\" sauce was decent and tangy, but nothing to write home about.  On a really positive note, the Brunswick Stew was killer. Probably some of the best I have ever had. It had a nice spicy bite to it and had a bunch of chunks of pulled pork. I could just order a giant bowl of this and I'd be happy!  As uptown barbecue restaurants go, I think Queen City Q has this place beat by a long shot. Unless I just want to grab a beer or a bourbon drink, I don't think I will revisit this place."}
{"text":"We wanted bbq and this place was close to the hotel.  Beware that the though address says Tyron it should say College as that is where the valet parkers are.  Being in a high rise building there are no smoker nearby as everything in the kitchen looked electric.  The BBQ was great as the ribs fell of the bone and the texas dry rub ribs with the kc sauce is a great combo.  The service was a bit spotty as our new waiter made a mistake as wanted the kc ribs and got the texas ones. Also noone went through the sauces as there was a vinegar based sauce that would have been great on the pulled pork sandwich that we did not know about.  It worked out well as mentioned above and I will happily return as want to try the kc ribs."}
{"text":"Be prepared to switch your choices during queens fest cause they ran out of a lot of the good choices early in the night!!!  City Smoke sent me an email prior to restaurant week that peaked my interest so I saved it. The email was  advertising a chicken dinner for 2 during restaurant week. It sounded like a great idea after my other restaurant week plans for that night fell thru. So I quickly made a reservation through open table. However once we sat down for our dinner that night I was presented with a Queens Fest menu that boasted most of their menu items for a $30 price. You could pick an appetizer, entree and dessert but  the dinner from the email was no where to be found. The Queens fest deal allowed us to try a lot of their menu items so we opted for that and never even asked about the email deal.  Sad thing was that once we started ordering a few of the better choices on the menu they had ran out of. We were able to wait for them to get more of the smoked wings but we weren't able to try the sticky ribs or the other ribs on the combo platter.  I was really bummed.   I did really enjoy the lamb flatbread and the brisket. The grits, Mac and cheese and the roasted cauliflower were also great side item choices.   One other sour note for the night is they charge for extra sauce!!! Y'all know that's my pet peeve. We must of ordered one too many ranches cause we got a nice 1.30 charge for 2 RANCHES. But we ordered 2 orders of kids chicken tenders with fries and 3 orders of the smoked wings so idk when we got out of hand with sauce but we did according to them.   Overall I'm not so sure I would return to City Smoke. It took a really long time for our food to come out (we had school age kids with us and they started to fall asleep) and I was really disappointed by missing out on the ribs. Granted I know restaurant week is a very busy time but we have an early reservation on a Monday.   City Smoke  100 N Tryon St Charlotte, NC 28202 Monday January 21, 2018 7:30pm"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Try the combo platter or the Texas dry age rub.  The pinot noir they have in kegs is quite amazing as well their selection of beers that they brew.  The smores brownie is also pretty good.  Not the best place for kids but we did bring my 4 year old in and there was music playing so a bit loud.  Other than that not the best bbq place considering where you are and the options you have but the pinot noir sold it for me regardless and it is easy walking distance from all the hotels."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte alone for work on the Sunday of the Charlotte/ Seattle playoff game. All the bars downtown were hella packed and this place was quiet so I stopped in. The bartender was amazing!! She was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the beer selection. The food was great and the service was awesome!  I'll for sure be back next time I'm in town. Great job!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd grab some BBQ while in the great state of North Carolina. Found this place and came only because it was late and it was open. Ended up ordering the 8 Texas ribs and jalapeño coleslaw and jalapeño cornbread and Mac and cheese $17.  First the sides: Mac was overdone and pretty bland, nothing to remember.   Jalapeño cornbread was also on the overdone side but still moist and flavorful. Not too spicy at all.   The coleslaw was by far my favorite of the three.   Now the ribs: I'm a traditionalist when it comes to ribs. Dry rub, no sauce and heavy smoke. Low and slow is the way to go. When I do my own ribs they normally take 5-6 hours. These are spareribs so don't expect baby backs (strike one) while plenty of flavor the ribs where very fatty and a little dry. Also I've never seen a BBQ joint put more rub on after the ribs were cooked this was weird and completely unnecessary. They likely would've been better without the extra seasoning.   Overall, this place is so so. The atmosphere is pretty cool, food is OK (edible) but nothing special about this place.   Take this one piece of advice: If it doesn't smell like a smokehouse when you walk in, turn around and walk out. Find your BBQ elsewhere."}
{"text":"The restaurant was crowded but we luckily made last minute reservations on OpenTable. It was the best option closest to our hotel. The downside of this restaurant is that there is only 1 shared bathroom for men and women. It's located perfectly downtown and close to the Performing Arts Center. The service was decent for a busy Saturday night. They have a fun whisky flight menu if that's your style. The BBQ was decent, probably not the best in the state, but enjoyable for the night. The Mac & cheese is homemade and an essential side for your plate. The plates were a better deal as we wanted to try a multitude of sides. We came with a group of people and we all ate Smorgasbord-style."}
{"text":"Three of my girlfriends and I went to City Smoke on Feb 24th for her birthday dinner. We arrived and wanted to have a table for 4, we were told that it would be about a 40 minute wait. We waited, and waited and waited some more. Eventually we made it in for dinner.  initially I was frustrated as Dan (the manager) was frustrated with his hostess and with how crowded the restaurant was. He went off on her at the door, about customers sneaking in alcohol. There was some type of pub crawl going on in Charlotte near the Epicenter and it was a madhouse.  We finally got invited in and we got to sit at the bar until our table was ready. I ordered the Raspberry-Peach Margarita. Before I could drink it our table was ready. Needless to say, when it arrived  it was amazing with fresh raspberries and peaches. It was just what I needed to calm my frazzled nerves.   We ordered the following appetizers: House Made Hummus- the olives, pita bread, olive oil and pickled onions were amazing. We literally had to stop ourselves from licking the bowl. It was amazing. Deviled Eggs- We ordered four and only ate two. They were kinda blah... Nothing to write home about. Rotisserie Chicken Wings- These were amazing. that spice rub is to die for.  Oysters on the half shell- We got them roasted. They were great.  Entrees ordered: Half Rotisserie Chicken-  Ohhhh my heavenly lord above. This chicken was slap your momma good. moist and flavorful, salty, crispety, crunchety, skin with that garlic aioli. It was the best smoked rotisserie chicken I have ever had. I have been telling anyone who will listen about  it, how good it was. I'm thinking about coming back to try that again. My Lord. I had the Hand Cut Fries and Mac and Cheese and the Collard Greens. I guess I'm a Collard Greens snob, they didn't taste like momma's. They were just okay. The hand cut fries were perfectly crispy and potato-y. Very enjoyable. The Mac and Cheese was decent.   Lonestar Beef Brisket- it wasn't as good as the chicken. It was okay. Nothing spectacular about it. The Brussel Sprouts were fantastic.  Also our server Frank couldn't have been nicer. He was a nice, efficient and attentive server. Give that man a raise."}
{"text":"I so loved this place. The baby greens salad and olives were great as well as the Serrano ham (although it was cut thicker than I've usually had it.) My pulled pork sandwich was fabulous and the fries were everything! The only fail was the tres leches cake which was more like a regular cake. Our waitress was pleasant and sweet.  We came here before a show at Booth Playhouse and we'll definitely be back. This place has a diverse menu which I appreciated."}
{"text":"The food was good and very tasty. Place looks clean and very organize. Service was great! I Love the coleslaw."}
{"text":"When we arrived late into Charlotte on a long road trip from Toronto down to Florida we headed for one of my favorite downtown corners, Tryon and Trade. I'd been to City Smoke a few months ago and thought that the ambiance was amazing so we decided to have a return trip there. We sat at the bar so we could get a good view of the Charlotte Hornets game and we were looking forward to just kicking back with some appetizers and a couple of drinks. My hubby ordered a great blonde stout from Legal Remedy  and as the responsible designated driver I went with icy water LOL. I ordered my usual favorite, the brussel sprouts, but they missed the mark by a long shot last night. There was nothing special about them, the brussel sprouts were undercooked, and they were sitting in a puddle of uninspired balsamic vinegar that was neither reduced nor adding anything to the dish. My husband ordered a platter of ribs, even though he had said he would only get an appetizer LOL, and he ended up getting brisket served to him. Oops... But they did deliver the ribs a few minutes later and all in all the meat was just as it was a few months ago, beautiful looking on the plate, but not the best that we've ever had. I'd say if you want ribs or chicken to head over to Queen City Q just around the corner. Not as much of an upscale vibe but definitely better barbecue. All In All, City smoke is an amazing place to sit and watch life go by in Charlotte, if we would have had time I'd like to have tried all of the great whiskeys and drinks on their menu but it wasn't in the cards for this trip. Give it a try, and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan but place wasn't bad.  Came here for lunch with co-workers.  Lunch salad offerings were very limited to a few.  With it being 95+ degrees outside I really didn't feel like eating heavy.  Mac n cheese and hot temps sounds uncomfortable.  Pork or roasted chicken sounded like a nap waiting to happen.    I ended up going with a basic burger without the bun and fries.  Burger was really  good and so were the fries.    Service was really good.  Location...good.    No real complaints other than the food options for lunch."}
{"text":"Damn good food and fantastic drinks. Great whiskey selection! Including high end whiskeys and bourbons."}
{"text":"City Smoke Manager needs development in customer service. My friend and I decided to have a glass of wine around 4:45pm before dinner and the NKOTB concert. We walked into the restaurant and there were no other customers, empty, just staff. We proceed to sit at a high top table for 4 since another friend was on her way to join us. Menus were handed to us by the staff and then the manager came over and requested us to move since he had a reservation on the table at 615pm. Since we thought about having dinner we agreed to move to another table. I asked for a window table in the corner (just to people watch while we chatted) and he said sorry that one is taken as well. Remember the restaurant was EMPTY even the staff were embarrassed about this situation. Needless to say we left and had a great time at the Ritz and dinner was fabulous at BTL Steak. My advice if you have customers walking into an empty restaurant treat them with respect and kindness it goes along way and we are in the south for goodness sake."}
{"text":"The lunch was perfect. The smoked pulled pork was delicious long with two sides. The Mac-n-cheese was great. Fast friendly service.  I was in town for a conference and stumbled on this gem."}
{"text":"We were here for the first time about a week ago.  We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and appetizers.  Our bartender was awesome, can't remember his name (sorry).  We had wings, tater tots,,,which come with some amazing sauce.  Can I have the recipe??  We also had the deviled eggs and a cheese dip.  We loved the wings, so tasty.  They were charred and just perfectly cooked, we also loved the sauce it came with!  The only issue I had was the seasonal beer on the menu was listed at $4.5 but once we got the bill it was $8 per....my boyfriend had 4!  Other than the wrong price being advertised we had a great experience.  If we come back to Charlotte we will definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a busy Friday.  Service was quick and efficient.  The jalapeño deviled eggs are definitely different but still very good.   The BBQ was very flavorful (even before adding sauce) and it was pulled into large sections.  The fries were a little limp - could have been better.    Our server was efficient but not overly friendly.  Lunch was busy, but a restaurant should never be too busy to provide service with a smile. With that said, the food was mostly good so I would return."}
{"text":"Other than our fantastic server, Morgan, I was more than disappointed.  I ordered the dry ribs, and was very discouraged to see my ribs come out with approximately 1/8th inch dry rub on top of them that was clearly put on immediately prior to them leaving the kitchen. I picked them up and held them sideways and the rub just poured off in one large dry pile.  I asked to speak to the manager and instead the chef came out and explained that was how they made them at City Smoke - - \"additional\" dry rub is put on immediately prior to serving.  I say additional because he also explained that prior to cooking any of the ribs, dry rub was put on them (what I am used to), but for any \"dry\" order even more was put on just before it left the kitchen.  He was very polite about it.  I am not sure if there was a manager present, but despite the fact that was who I asked to speak to, he or she never came to my table.  There were only three or four other tables being served at this time so I know it is not because they were too busy.  I ended up scraping off as much of the additional rub as I could onto my plate with a spoon because when biting into the ribs all I could taste was a mouthful of the spices."}
{"text":"Second time here and I love it.  I'm not a huge BBQ fan so maybe my expectations were different.  What I was looking for was favorable meats at a reasonable price, and that is what I got.  Staff was friendly, especially the manager.    My sides were the cole slaw, which was great, and the brussel sprouts, which were good but I have had better.  The meat itself was smokey and meaty.  The meat was not overly fussed with and the que sauce was on the side.  Didn't have dessert but they all looked good.    The wings were also spot on (I love a good smoked / BBQed wing) with nice char and flavor, and were priced comparable to chain wingeries.  I'm in town for three weeks and will probably hit this place up a few times a week.  The food is good and priced well.  Check it out, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not good. I was giving it a shot since BBQ is popular but here it was bland and somewhat dry the sides aren't anything to rave about."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the staff.  The bartenders and servers are very knowledgeable about their food, sauces and alcohol.  I love the fact they have all NC draft beer on special on Mondays for $3.50 and served ICE COLD out of the glycerin taps!   One of their specialty drinks, the bacon infused bourbon bloody mary is AMAZING.  Definitely not your typical bloody mary made with vodka.  Just enough heat in this bloody mary and that trace of bacon flavor will make you want a second or even a third!  Lunch turnover is fast!  If you want an fabulous meal without having to get fast food, this is the place.  In and out in less than half hour!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast service during the lunch rush in Uptown then this is the place to go.  The collard greens was a sure hit. The combination of smokey and zesty was perfect for the collard greens. The rotisserie lamb sandwich was just okay, a little too heavy on the onions.    The service at the bar was great. The ambience was causal with an old butcher shop's feel. The staff seem pretty attentive during a lunch rush. The manager even. walked around to greet and meet..kudos to the leadership....  The only disappointing factor was the Arnold Palmer!"}
{"text":"I recently visited City Smoke during restaurant week 2017. It wasn't crowded. I had a reservation and was promptly seated. One waiter cane by and took our drink orders and stayed someone else would be our server. We waited between 10-15 minutes before our waitress came to the table. She quickly asked us were we ready to order. I said yes, but had to ask her to tell us her name. She smiled and said Rachel. We have her our order for the evening through desert. She came back withing 15 minutes with our appetizers. The wings were awesome. My husband enjoyed his garlic shrimp too. We then waited another 25 minutes for our entrees. The manager had to come over and reassure us that our orders would be out soon. Once everything came out, we both enjoyed our meals. My husband had the lamb which was extremely tender. I had the meat combo meal with potatoes and collards. I didn't care too much for the pork or the bbq sauce. The ribs and brisket were good though. I would go back specifically for the wings. The service wasn't anything to Rabe about."}
{"text":"I went to City Smoke for my lunch one afternoon just to check out places.  The brisket philly cheese steak was good but I will have to go back to try out their pull pork and other sandwiches to give them a final rating. I tried the country ham potato salad, which was good to and different!  The servers are very attentive and they are looking for you input on how the food tastes.   When the lady next to me ordered her pulled pork sandwich, she got a large sandwich versus what I seen in the other places.  I will be back to try out other items on the menu.  I went back there with the crew. The flavors in the BBQ are ok. Normally the local spices chosen for BBQ come through in the process. Unless I missed something I didn't taste anything.  I had the BBQ Pork sandwich.  The help was friendly as usual.  Oh yea... They are NOT dog friendly. ;-)"}
{"text":"Found this place while visiting from out of town while looking for a BBQ dinner for me and coworkers using the open table app. One of my coworkers couldn't remember the name so googled best BBQ and found an article titled the top ten - guess who wasn't on it....    Pros:  upscale, trendy, nice decor, good spot downtown (or uptown as they say here) across from Omni hotel, serves flights of various types of alcohol with cute names and the Brussels sprouts were edible, roasted chicken was not dry. Cotton cake was super light like angel food cake with a surprisingly flavor of lavender and honey; local brew with jalapeños flavor is a hit for those who like spice; staff was very friendly and attentive; open view of kitchen, three sauce choices - KC which was more traditional with a kick, vinegar with spices you have to shake up and something that may remind you of Heinz 57. Brisket was good but comes out cut like prime rib not shaved.   Cons:  pulled pork is in a vinegar broth - no not a sauce basically vinegar; lamb sandwich was a flatbread with small pieces of lamb hidden amongst a mix of red onions, French fries, tomatoes and lettuce; creamy coleslaw - not so creamy - or flavored;  eggplant side dish was more tomatoes and onions with wisps of eggplant and because of the acoustics, even when not packed, the convos carry easily and swiftly across the restaurant. And at 6:30 on a weeknight they were out of the most coveted side dish - squash!  Bottom line:  Go for the drinks not the food."}
{"text":"I was not expecting flavor bbq in Uptown Charlotte but man this place delivered. I had the smoked wings, mac and cheese and the collards all of it was amazing. My girlfriends were all smiles with their food too.   Oh they validate parking which is a nice extra."}
{"text":"Great experience but food was lacking seasoning.  We sat at the bar that overlooks the cooks and I highly recommend that experience.  We started with the shishito Keller which were great except we had to add plenty of salt, this becomes a trend.  The bread was good the garlic spread was a little strong so go light with it.  We shared the prime rib with side of tomatoes and beets. First it was disappointing they didn't ask us how we wanted the prime rib, it came medium so we were happy.  The cut was very tough, I had to spit out 2 pieces after trimming a large portion away.  The ahju was good but again we had to add salt tot he steak.   The tomatoes were no very good, it wasn't season but it my opinion they should have taken them off the menu than serve them as was.  My husband loved the beets.   Our friends ordered the pulled pork, which was super watery, prime rib sandwich which was good but again needed salt.  They did rave about the mac n cheese and the grits.   We did have the creme brûlée and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I just finished the most wonderful beef brisket. It was very flavorful, tender, and moist. I don't eat a tonne of red meat when I'm out because I'm so fussy but I shared the sampler with my husband and wish I got a whole one for myself!  We came on a busy Saturday night with no reservation and the staff sis their best to accommodate us."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Downtown Charlotte and first time here. Unfortunately my first trip to Charlotte they were closed however almost a year later I finally made it. Living in South Florida its a bit of a drive.    The staff was super friendly once we walked in we were seated immediately. Dan our server was great. I normally drink Corona and this place has no imports. So most waiters would of been like \"Yeah we don't have it\". Dan recommended a local beer which then offered me a free sample. It was good enough to enjoy dinner with it. Once our drinks came out ( super quick by the way ) our orders were taken. We had our kids with us on this visit, so I was a little surprised they have a kids menu but no kids menu printed. It was a little odd but Dan have us all our options. Food came out, and was awesome. I've had some really good BBQ, this wasn't the best but pretty good. The meat on our ribs were falling off the bone, well seasoned, and cooked well. The meat wasn't dry like some places serve.   Overall it was clean. One small bathroom to share with everyone which could be an issue if the place was super busy, a needs better lighting inside the bathroom.   Location was great. Just about 3-5 minute walk from our hotel."}
{"text":"Food was good to great.  Fresh fruit dessert was outstanding. Service was great. Super convenient, enjoyable dinner before a Blumenthal show.  Dining room is very accessible for wheelchair users. Staff was attentive to pathways and seating locations for larger power chair. Restroom is roomy for wheelchair users, but there are no stability bars installed for transfer."}
{"text":"BBQ is not good.  Go to Midwood Smokehouse or Mac's Speed Shop if you want good BBQ in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Second visit to city smoke.  Very good bbq, the best? No but very very good. Excellent sides.  Fabulous craft beer choices.  Staff is cute and extremely friendly.  Manager stopped by to ask what we thought about new nacho offering.  That speaks volumes about this business.  Great place which I shall keep in mind anytime I visit. I'm a little surprised by some of the poor reviews here.  I can buy a three, but a one or two rating?? Get real..  And the person that complained about the perfect martini.... Did you eat there?  It is a bbq restaurant!"}
{"text":"The beer and bourbon selection is very good.  The beer isn't terribly priced but the bourbons are.    I ordered the half rib sampler.  It was 1 half slab of ribs with the different sauces on it.  The ribs are loin runs, smaller bones but fattier. They were good. The grid were good and the okra was tray.    Wife ordered fried chicken with Mac and cheese. The chicken was pretty good, not prices chicken coop good, but freshly pan fried. The Mac n cheese was terrible.  Not enough cheese was and gritty.  Service was good and helpful.  It's just OK food though. That needs to improve to get more stars."}
{"text":"I would definately refer people to another BBQ joint in Charlotte.  The food was okay.  I liked the beer selection, but that's about it.  I was there when it wasn't busy, and didn't appreciate listening to the servers piss and moan about how they got a lousy tip from previous customers.  I just think that's rude.  I had the pulled pork, which the portions were weak.  The only thing I really like was the Bruswick stew for a side.  My mom had the Beef Brisket sandwich and she told me that the brisket was chewy, usually good brisket should fall apart in your mouth.  All in all, not very impressed."}
{"text":"A place that could be great but is not. The place is packed and has a great atmosphere. The smell outside and inside of the smoke is incredible. The collard greens were very good  Only place left to sit was at the bar. Works for me.  The bartender must be new and only one for the whole place. She had several misses on the orders. At one point a waitress had to come back and make the drinks that were made wrong.  I had the chefs special the pork. Was extremely dry and lacking flavor. When I finished eating I put the napkin on the plate and waits. It had emptied out by then. Had to finally call over the bar tender to give my credit card."}
{"text":"Fast service, good selections of brews and pretty solid barbecue. Brunswick stew is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place and I HATE writing negative reviews but we just were not impressed.   We had a large group and upon arriving were offered drinks. After 3 attempts at ordering a craft beer I thought I would like and being told they didn't have anything like what I was looking for (no stout? No Belgian type ale?) I switched to Jack and Coke. Then the server said they were out of Jack and Gentleman's Jack and my only option was single barrel at $15 a drink. So finally went with a specialty drink that tasted watered down. As I started looking at the menu I learned they are a whiskey bay with like 30 types of bourbon starting at like $4. And my only option was single barrel at $15?  Came time we to order food and our waiter was nowhere to be found. After a good 10 minutes he came by and I ordered the brisket with Mac n cheese and loaded potato. Brisket was ok, not great not terrible, mac n cheese was ok but I didn't feel it lived up to the other reviews. Potato was just bland.  I wanted to like it but just didn't have a great experience all around.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"There's no reason to write a letter home about this place, but it was perfectly lovely for a bbq lunch. I had pulled pork and collards both of which were tasty, but not exceptional. The sauce options were nice, and the service was efficient. I don't need to ever go back, but I wouldn't be mad if I had to."}
{"text":"We had an early Monday evening dinner with two adults and two young kids.  We were staying at the Hilton City Center across the street and had been walking and sightseeing all day.  Dinner right at 5, close to the hotel sounded just right.  We were trying to avoid chain restaurants, and with the exception of breakfast, Uptown Charlotte makes it an easy thing to do, outside of Epicentre across the street.  Being so early for dinner, we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  Hubby and I each had a beer, light for him, dark for me.  We went with the waiter's suggestion on both and he did good.  We both had beers new to us and were both happy with them.  (Mine was the Duck Rabbit Milk Stout- good stuff!)   The waiter was very friendly and good with the kids.  He made some suggestions and answered questions about options for the kids, since there were no kids' menus.  (They must usually be on the placemats, because he said they had \"run out\" of kids' menus.)  Once they heard mac and cheese the kids were taken care of, on top of all the peanuts.  I had a cheeseburger with fried pickles and comeback sauce and fries.  The fries were good, the burger was ok.  I'd like to say I liked it better, but the meat wasn't very flavorful, (despite being ground chuck and house ground brisket as the menu says.)  The sauce was a little overpowering.  Couldn't even taste the fried pickles, which were the reason I picked it.  Not bad, but not great.  Hubby had a pulled pork sandwich which he said was really good.  He liked the choice of the sauces on the table.  Vinegar style, KC style spicy and City Smoke sweet.  The mac and cheese the kids had was really good.  (Thankfully not Kraft style, which we had been given all vacation!)  The kids weren't crazy about the crispy cheese crust on the top, but were happy to share that part with me! Overall, I'd definitely stop in here again.  They seemed to be trying hard, I'd just order something else.  I liked that we were made welcome, even towing a couple littles along with us."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the poor yelp ratings for this place. I went here afterwork with 30 co-workers, we just showed up without warning and they were very accommodating. I think without us being there, there would not have been a very big crowd. We were just going to have drinks, but they let us hang at the bar, with 2 adjoining tables, so several of us also ordered food.  First, I was very impressed with the Bourbon/whiskey selection. This isn't something I know much about, but been trying to grow my palate in this area. They have an extensive list of Kentucky Bourbons, plus different scotch whiskey's, etc. They aren't cheap, but if you want to try some Bourbon, this is definitely a great place.  They also have probably 10 craft beers on tap.  Since this is a BBQ place, I got the Pork Sandwich. I thought it was very tasty, comparable to Mac's and other better BBQ places I've been to in Charlotte.   If you want a quiet place to hang out, sip some bourbon, grab a BBQ sandwich, this place has a nice vibe, and nice location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I think this place is appropriately rated at 3 stars because that's exactly what it is, mediocre. Some of the food, including the shrimp and grits, and ribs are pretty good. The sides aren't bad either (especially the fried okra). However, other entrees like the pulled pork are just mediocre. I have found the food inconsistent as well which really brings the rating down for me. It's worth a try if you're in the area and absolutely craving bbq."}
{"text":"Bad service, slow and unnecessarily rude. Couldn't handle a table of 10 people with very simple orders. Food was decent but it was just disappointing."}
{"text":"I like it here; don't know why they aren't closer to four stars. I usually call-in for takeout so maybe it's an issue with their service (although their employees have been courteous and friendly toward me every time). Their ribs are my go-to. Half sampler and full sampler are great. Nothing like trying different ribs and sharing with someone. The sides are really good too. I've also tried the brisket but that has been mediocre. Still a solid place"}
{"text":"The wings here are great! Dry rubbed, oven roasted and finished on the grill. Served with a great blue cheese dressing and Devil Butter (hot sauce and butter mixed together). I placed a call in order and asked if they were whole wings or party style wings. The young lady informed me they were whole wings, they were not (ahhhh, our young people today). Anyway, I was still really pleased and can't wait to try their other offerings!"}
