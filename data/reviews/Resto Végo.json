{"text":"My favourite restaurant. It seems like not a lot of people know about this place though (or at least the buffet part).   They have so many choices (hot dishes, cold dishes, salads, soups, desserts, sandwiches and wraps to take on the go, etc.) that it makes me forget they are vegetarian. The buffet style makes it ideal to try a bit of everything. I think the quality of the food is great, and they have a mix of healthy and more \"indulgent\" dishes to satisfy everyone.   Definitely recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and were blown away by this restaurant! Amazing vegan/veg options, many of which are premium and all you can fit on a plate for $15 makes it incredible value, the price by weight option for lighter meals is not expensive either. There is a great mix of healthy and more savoury items in the buffet as well as take away options, desert, alcoholic beverages and fresh or bottled drinks. This would be a good place for non-vegetarian people to see what veg cuisine has to offer. The cute girl at the front was super nice and explained things with a big smile on her face. We ate on the patio outside in the sun and enjoyed the great location. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good, that we were only in Montreal for two nights, and went back to this one, even tho it's located on a street filled with other restaurants!"}
{"text":"This place is vegetarian heaven!   I've been eating here for years, but recently ate there daily for three weeks while taking a course at UQAM.   The food at the buffet is consistently high quality and clearly labeled. A lot of the dishes fall into the comfort food category, but there are many lighter options as well.   There's also a great take-out counter downstairs now. I've found this a handy place to grab a quick salad or veggie wrap (with actual protein inside!) when I've not had time for dining in.  I only wish the Toronto location was still open!"}
{"text":"Awesome Green Heaven healing Gaia! It's by weight not all you can eat. And make your own dessert with green juice;)))p"}
{"text":"Because I've only been here twice and tried two different kinds of sandwiches (I will let pictures speak for themselves), I don't know if the other dishes and desserts are as good. The one thing I know for sure is it is affordable and the quantity and delicious mix of ingredients are filling enough in a good way. Plus, the location on Saint-Denis has an outdoor terrace which is lovely now that summertime is finally here in town!"}
{"text":"This is a reliable place for a healthy meal.  They have a great selection of hot foods, a decent salad bar and gorgeous desserts.    The beer and wine is reasonable  There is a student discount  I would say its also a good place for kids.  Great terrace. Lots of seating for large groups."}
{"text":"A great place to explore vegetarian varieties. It's a vegetarian buffet.  The food is charged by weight (kilos). The ambiance of this place is nice. People who works there are friendly. I have been 2 of their locations. But this is my favorite spot.  In North America, I haven't seen a huge variety of vegetarian food quite like Le Commensal. Even non-vegetarians like myself enjoys it. And it's also not cheap."}
{"text":"Wow.  So happy this place has an obvious \"vegetarian\" name and a big sign...we stumbled upon it and were so glad!  Buffet is about $13USD/lb, so pricey (but looked good), and has a price cap for a single plate, so good deal fir a big eater.  For bird eaters, get a to-go salad or a deli salad or deli flatbread.  We got 2 salads, a flatbread, and a dessert for $20CDN and wasted half of it, sadly.  Easily could've split a flatbread and a small deli salad.  Very yummy...a Montreal standby if I'm ever lucky enough to be in town again."}
{"text":"Manifestement le retour de ce restaurant explication (j'ai été l'un des premiers clients qui es venu mais ce restaurant avez un autre nom vue que j'ai t'ai jeune j'avais oublié sauf le magnifique goût des saveurs dans ma bouche.) merci beaucoup pour m'avoir fait rêver mon tendre enfance. Vous êtes géniaux vous méritez plus de clientèle bonne journée. Mesdames, messieurs"}
{"text":"With all of the other veggie and vegan options in Montreal I just have a tough time getting excited about what's on offer at Le Commensal.  This is essentially a pay by weight buffet/cafeteria and as such suffers from the freshness issue that it endemic to the delivery system.    Le Commensal gets a lot of extra love (in the stars department) because of choice.  Most veg-heads are frequently subjected to a rather frightening level of same-ness in available dining options.  The reason that love doesn't extend past two stars is that although there is variety, quite a bit of it tastes the same and I have yet to have experienced anything worthy of remembering well enough to include in - oh - let's say - a review?  I'm at best a demi-vegetarian, but I regularly dine with vegans and am well versed in vegetarian and vegan cooking.  There are many vastly superior options in Montreal.  Please check out my list of Veggies goodness for a better alternative,"}
{"text":"Excellente variété de plats végétariens servis sous forme de cafétéria.  Tous les plats étaient frais faits, colorés et succulents.   Et que dire de la table des desserts"}
{"text":"The food was alright, but I'd go to any other vegan places rather than coming back.  I feel like getting ripped off from a Groupon deal last time my friends and I came here. They were basically playing with words in the description making you think that you can get a dinner for four for only 30$. It was basically a 50$ credits that we bought for 30$, that can only pay for certain dishes, and cannot use the credit to pay the taxes. We ended up paying more with unsatisfied stomachs.  It's not about the money, it's about sending a message."}
{"text":"Une bonne place style cafétériat où tu te sers dans un buffet. Nourriture (non pas en poche comme direct l'expression), mais sur plateau, il est question de peser le plat. Le prix sera en conséquence du poids.  Si on veut manger rapidement, mais éviter tout fast-food qui ne sont pas santé, c'est une bonne place.  L'espace est assez grand pour recevoir une foule de personnes. L'accès Wifi permet de se poser travailler tranquillement tout en savourant ses mets végétariens."}
{"text":"Toujours frais et rapide.  La chaîne de restaurants le Commensal se distingue par son menu. En effet ils offrent un buffet chaud (burritos, pâtes, légumes grillés, ragoûts de seitan) , un buffet froid (salades, crudités, salades de riz), et un buffet de desserts (absolument divins, by the way, surtout les fruits frais accompagnés de crème fouettée au sirop d'érable)  Quelques plats et desserts vegetalien (vegan) pour ceux qui cherchent, mais pas tous. C'est bien indiqué sur l'étiquette au-dessus du plat.   Comme c'est un buffet il n'y a pas de service aux tables mais le personnel est toujours serviable et gentil. De la caissière au 'busboy'. Aussi, je trouve que l'endroit est bien divisé avec ses 3 étages. Il ya toujours de la place.  Pour le prix : très cher, attention au porte-feuille... ca se calcule au poids, donc y aller avec parcimonie pour la première assiette. Un 10% étudiant est offert sur présentation de votre carte :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre place with mediocre but overpriced food. I tried this place because I wanted to go meat free for my dinner. This place had good reviews but it fell short on deliverance. They charge you by weight but don't tell you the plate itself weighs around 500 grams, so basically you get charged before you even see or smell the food.  The food itself wins on quantity but loses on quality. Everything was bland and blah! The saving grace were the desserts - the carrot cake was delectable and crunchy because of nuts, it was just amazing. The walnut square was also phenomenal.   Go to this place but do a take out, that way you save paying for the weight of an empty plate."}
{"text":"Unique take on dishing out loads of good veg food. Lots of variety, pay by weight. Some dishes are losers, but so much to chose from! Pizza, samosa, mac and cheese, salads, many dessert choices. I always make it a point to stop a Le Commensal when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas été convaincu par le buffet à l'étage par contre le café Le petit végo en bas est vraiment bien! Il a plusieurs sandwich et pizza, ainsi que des salades et desserts. Et parmi ceux-ci de nombreux choix végétaliens!  J'ai pris une pizza-naan aux fond d'artichaud avec du fromage végétal Gusta et une salade de pomme de terre. C'était vraiment bon.  J'ai pu goûté la salade mexicaine (haricot rouge, avocat et riz) et le bahn-mi qui étaient aussi bons. Les desserts sont toujours une réussite."}
{"text":"Une restaurant parfait pour manger santé sans avoir à se limiter à une salade ! Le concepte du buffet est vraiment excellent. Cela permet de choisir le plat que l'on veut manger et la quantité désiré ! J'ai pris une tres grande assiette et sa ma couté 13$ !   Je vais y retourné c'est certain ! De plus , c'est pres de l'uqam ! Parfait pour les étudiants !"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to restaurant for an affordable healthy meal in Montreal. Not anymore! I have a black pepper allergy and I noticed that they list most ingredients in their dishes except black pepper. I asked about this, and several of their servers were rude and dismissive. They cater to people who are vegetarians and also avoid dairy, gluten and salt, but it's too much to ask that they also label black pepper!"}
{"text":"Of the two Le Commensal's we visited in Montreal, this is the nicer one. The food area is HUGE. Lots of fresh-looking food to choose from. They had this awesome asparagus phillo dish that was SO good. We love Le Commensal, and it's a great place to take a kid: no waiting on food, and hello- pizza!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, at least $20 for a large plate of vegetarian food, (is weighed) but what do I know, I'm an ex Montrealer, tourist now. Excellent and delicious food choices though. Yes, definitely go eat here!"}
{"text":"Pour bien manger dans un endroit pas trop dispendieux et surtout végé, c'est l'endroit tout désigné!   Vous payez au poids mais sans excéder 18$.   Tout est savoureux! Que ce soit les plats chauds, les salades ou la panoplie de desserts!  En plus il est situé à 2 pas du cinéma Quartier Latin."}
{"text":"Ancien Commensal, ce resto est grand et le choix des plats est varié! Un peu cher je trouve, mais ça a l'air de qualité, et c'est très bon Service très correct Bien situé pour continuer dans un bar autour après!"}
{"text":"For what it is, it's quite expensive.  I paid about $10 for a small soup and a very tiny amount of a vegan pie. Nah"}
{"text":"Only got the chia seed parfait in the ready made section and iced coffee but it was so amazing I might be back, service was nice and quick and I liked the outside eating area"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great veg food, totally relaxed, and hey, who doesn't love a good buffet?"}
{"text":"Tasty, delicious vegetarian food.  They have two areas - a cafe and a buffet restaurant. The buffet you pay by the weight of your food.  The buffet you get to choose from around 20/25 different dishes. They also have a good collection of desserts.  The food is really good - but a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Nothing looked particularly inviting on St Denis on this day besides this place so decided to give it a shot. The inside is clean and looks like they have wifi since there were a lot of people on laptops. Friendly service too.  I tried their soy meat wrap, raspberry brownie and raisin chocolate chip cookie. I'm not a vegetarian but the soy meat actually tasted like real meat (chicken). It was good, nothing outstanding but still good! Their baked goods were pretty satisfying and heavy. I couldn't eat both of them in one seating. Fair prices too."}
{"text":"N'étant pas fan de la formule buffet au poids , mon avis est peut-être un peu biaisé à ce niveau. Je suis quand même allé faire un tour avec mon conjoint et je confirmes! Passer ma carte à 3 reprises pour la deuxième assiette et finalement pour le dessert.. Comment pourrais-je deviner d'avance quand ma faim aura sa fin. Le prix Maximum indiqué n'est pas tout a fait réel dans le sens où à un certain poids il y a un supplément à payer. J'ai tout de Même trouvé qu'il y a une bcp de variété, certain plats sont vraiment délicieux. Je dois malheureusement ajouté qu'il y avait plusieurs petites mouches sur le buffet et même posés sur certains desserts. Je manges ni viande ni mouche ;p ! J'imagine que sur l'heure du midi c'est bien pour les gens pressés! Je suis déçue d'avoir été déçue j'aurais aimé être impressionnée par du changement."}
{"text":"As a non-veg I was quite satisfied with Resto Végo, the food was good and the options grand.   This is a buffet style restaurant so I had the opportunity to taste many of the various dishes offered here. The food was delicious, the chilli was flavourful, the pasta seasoned well and the vegetables were finely prepared.   I'm an amateur when it comes to strictly vegetarian and vegan dishes but if more restaurants served food like this, it would make the idea of being a vegetarian or a vegan much easier.   My vegan friend was delighted with the variety available and thoroughly enjoyed his full plate. The food was very filling and neither one of us were able to finish.  The restaurant itself is quite comfortable, it carries a very welcoming and green vibe. The staff was kind and the environment clean."}
{"text":"Good options for vegans and vegetarians. Very similar in concept to the Whole Foods hot/salad bar. You pick out your food and then it's weighed -- cafeteria/buffet style.   I had a good variety of salads to choose from. I ended up really liking the mini tempeh burger and chickpea marinated salad. The raw goji cheesecake was amazing. No need to pay for water since they have a water fountain in the seating area.   No English advertising is up outside, but then all the food is clearly marked in English, French, and with pictures indicating allergens."}
{"text":"The past two times I've been to Montreal, I've visited Commensal. I prefer the location on St-Denis over the one around McGill, just because of the atmosphere; it doesn't feel as cold and sparse as the other one.  The buffet has a good variety of hot and cold foods, as well as some desserts. There's not really anything I would call too exotic on the menu, so with that said, the food here will probably appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike, as well as different age groups. Some of the menu items are kind of bland tasting, but others make up for it.  Food is priced by weight, which can get a bit confusing, all you can do is eye it and hope it doesn't come out more expensive than you intended. Regardless, the food here is affordable."}
{"text":"A really cool spot for both vegans and vegetarians! Especially in the summer with their cute terrasse. I went twice and grabbed food from the buffet upstairs. You pay by the weight, but as long as you take very small amounts of everything you want, you won't pay too much and will still be able to have a lot of diversity on your plate. Also if you're a salad person, I can totally see how this would be awesome for you, because they have so many items in the salad bar and usually they don't weight a lot compared to more consistent food. The food is tasty and there is always different things to try!"}
{"text":"I liked the idea that you can pay $16 for an all you can eat buffet, amazing variety and tasty vegetarian and vegan options. I tried the buffet for lunch and also grabbed dinner to go since I was gonna be the whole day out.  The place is clean and big, they have a nice patio where you can enjoy ur meal.  I also had the chai latte (flavourful and strong) and a blueberry muffin (reallllllly good stuff). The thing I loved the most about the chai is that you get to choose what type of milk you prefer (soya, almond or regular cow milk) without additional charges... Starbucks should learn from places like this!  For sure I'll come again when I'm back in MTL!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I \"did it wrong\" aka didn't get the buffet, but I ordered the tofu curry sandwich, and it was amazing. The bread, spread, and filling were all on point.  Cheap, on a happening street, good people watching."}
{"text":"Mon resto \"comfort food\" préféré. J y vais qqls fois par semaine. L ambiance me plaît ! La terrasse derrière est intime, c est celle que je préfère. Y en une devant aussi.  Merci"}
{"text":"Je ferais un avis sur le comptoir en bas : Magnifique petit comptoir où il est servis des sandwichs, des pizzas, des salades, des soupes, des muffins et gateaux qui sont tous au moins végétariens et pour la plupart végétalien. A chaque fois que je vais là bas j'ai du mal à me décider tant tout est bon. C'est un coin parfait pour se restaurer avant d'aller trainer dans le quartier ou après avoir fait des longueurs à la piscine du Cegep pas très loin :) Les caissiers sont sympas et les prix raisonnables ! Je recommande fortement :)"}
{"text":"Really great experience. I came here end of August for lunch with my mom who isn't vegan or vegetarian. She loved the veggie lasagna and guacamole. I tried a multitude of vegan dishes including one noodle dish which was very good. I wish I would have known they have a cut off for price as you pay by weight because I would have ordered more! I'll go back the next time I'm there. Cafeteria-style with each item clearly labelled vegan, veg, gluten free etc.."}
{"text":"We went an hour before closing time and were told that we'd get a 25% discount because it is the last hour.  We ate at the location near McGill and really enjoyed the food!  There was a small salad bar, soup bar, entrée buffet, and a dessert bar.  The food was fantastic, but the hot pasta was a bit too salty.  For me, restaurants that charge by weight always come out a little more expensive, which was what I found with this restaurant as well.  However, the food was definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"the best vegan friendly buffet I have every ever seen.  The patio out back is to die for and best of all the wifi is super fast and free."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here because, as a vegetarian, I really like being able to go places where I have more than one choice.  Le Commensal has a lot of choices at their buffet and many of them are quite well executed.   I enjoyed the ginger tofu and the quinoa salad, but some of the other things were not memorable. The lasagne was just plain bad, so it is a little hit or miss here. All in all, there are some very good things, but it really depends on you to pick the right things to your taste. They had a nice selection of fresh fruits and salad items, as well.  It was nice and quiet when we were here, and I think it would be great for groups. I wish it was a little cheaper to my graduate-student-sized wallet."}
{"text":"VERY EXPENSIVE. Over $100 CAD for 2 people. However the choices and quality of vegetarian food is excellent."}
{"text":"I'm pretty positive this place has changed their name since I first went here in about 1994. Back then, if you were vegan/vegetarian, you had to look in the back of Vegetarian Times magazine for lists of restaurants. My then boyfriend and I drove up to Montreal for the first time with this being one of the top 3 reasons. We were absolutely stunned and giddy like children that we could eat EVERYTHING, and if we couldn't, it was clearly marked. I love a buffet so I can get a good look at what I'm ordering but also because I can eat a little of everything then go back for the best. Everything is super fresh and the veggies are all brightly colored. The last time I went here was in about 2014 and it had gotten fancy. Not in a \"i feel like i don't belong\" kind of way but in a \"wow, they stepped up the decor and the food and I'm excited\" kind of way. The variety of dishes always gives me ideas on combinations I haven't thought of. I kind of want to drive up there right now. It's not cheap but it's worth every cent."}
{"text":"Nice staff and ambiance, lots of variety in terms of food options, delicious food.  A bit awkward to have the buffet upstairs, especially if you sit down stairs. Carrying a tray down narrow stairs, made me nervous.  The food is way too expensive, to my liking. I love the food but can only afford to splurge like that once a year, especially on a buffet. Im used to more affordable buffets."}
{"text":"Je vais souvent dans ce restaurant vegan et je ne suis jamais déçue ! Honnêtement, que vous soez herbivore ou carnivore jusque dans vos veines, le Vego saura vous charmer ! Il y a tant de gens qui ne connaissent pas la bouffe vegane et qui la juge avant meme de savoir ce que c'est! Allez faire un tour dans ce restau et vous y découvrirez d'excellents plats avec du goût et des saveurs exquises!! Le plus beau la dedans?! c'est sous forme de buffet, alors vous pourrez goûter à tout tout tout !!   Je vous conseille de vous garder de la place pour un dessert, ils sont délicieux !!"}
{"text":"I came here this week and took a sandwich to-go as I was in a rush. I tried the \"Tex-Mex\" sandwich based on a suggestion and it was very good. They have many options to choose from that even non-veg would enjoy. It's a bit pricey for just a sandwich but definitely worth a try. Next time, I would like to try their buffet."}
{"text":"Vego was my dream come true once we arrived in Montreal. Vegan and vegetarians of the world, rejoice!   They have a buffet style, with signs that show the vegan and vegetarians options.  Everything was very tasty, fresh and appetizing. And because you pay by the weight, most likely you'll ended up over eating.  But it's all good. Guilty free it's my motto since I call myself a vegan."}
{"text":"I went there for a late night dessert with my friends and it did not disappoint. They have everything you could ever dream for - from salads to wraps, cupcakes to ice creams, smoothies to coffees - and the setting is oh so homey! I am vegan so I definitely feel like I found my happy place (they advertise what is vegan and what is not, which makes it so much easier for me, and the staff is always available to answer questions about the different items) and there are a lot of tables, you'll always find a spot to eat or just sip on an ice tea while reading a book. The atmosphere is very laid-back and the noise level is ok if you want to study on the ground floor (the buffet is on the upper floor where it's always a bit more crowded).   The only downside is the price, like many others who have posted reviews, I feel a bit ripped off, mostly for the buffet. The food and drinks sold on the ground floor are still on the pricier side but nothing you would not see at the closest Starbucks. I definitely recommend the place, even if your wallet might suffer a little."}
{"text":"Anciennememt le Commensal, Végo est un comptoir gourmet proposant des mets entièrement végétariens. Vous y trouverez au 2e étage une rangée de réchauds proposant différents types de mets les plus savoureux les uns que les autres. À noter certaines fois ils peuvent devenir secs mais habituellement le roulement est bien fait. Vous pouvez débuter avec 2 choix de soupe puis remplir votre assiette des choix de salades puis de plat. À noter l'assiette sera pesée alors attention à ne pas manger avec vos yeux car la facture sera vite salée :) et par la suite terminez avec un dessert mes préférés: le cheesecake, la tarte aux pacanes qui est à tomber et si vous préférez rester santé prenez les fruits avec yaourt. Du café est également proposé je le trouve vraiment bon (corsé ou velouté selon les goûts) et à noter que vous pouvez même accompagner vos plats d'une petite bouteille de vin!!!!  Au 1er étage ils ont ouvert un café si vous souhaitez un goûter léger."}
{"text":"Vegetarian restaurant with vegan options which I find a real shame cause there is no need to keep harming animals for their milk and eggs when there are so many cheaper and healthier options to replace those.   Good food, nice ambiance, a lot of sitting area. Please try the maple pie!"}
{"text":"This is the best vegan restaurant I've ever been to. They had a buffet with hundreds of vegan foods. They even had raw vegan cakes. Everything was amazing and there were so many tables."}
{"text":"Je viens souvent ici pour des rencontres d'affaires! On est bien, les gens nous laissent tranquille, la bouffe est vraiment super bonne, et le wifi est gratuit!  Rien à dire, sérieux, mais quel merveilleux restaurant, j'espère qu'ils en ouvriront davantage!"}
{"text":"Si vous voulez manger \"vite fait, bien fait\" mais en gardant votre santé à cur, Resto Végo est un bon choix! D'ailleurs, si vous êtes nouvellement végétarien et/ou végétalien ou voulez initier un(e) ami(e), je recommande également de faire un tour au restaurant: il y a beaucoup d'options différentes qui permettent d'apprécier l'étendue d'un plant-based diet (burger, chili, tourtière, ragoût, une dizaine de salades, frites de navet, plusieurs soupes, etc.). Les recettes sont assez variées et plusieurs des ingrédients sont biologiques. Il y a également une grande sélection de desserts (y compris des gâteaux crus signés Rawesome!). Par contre, gérez vos attentes: il s'agit bel et bien d'un buffet. Il faut aimer ce type d'expérience! Vous vous servez vous-mêmes, le prix est calculé en fonction du poids de votre assiette et des ajouts (soupe et dessert), etc. Aussi, même si l'établissement est assez grand (même dans les heures de pointe, je ne pense pas que vous manquerez de place!), j'aurais aimé qu'il soit davantage chaleureux. Sans non plus ressembler à une cafétéria, le décor et l'ambiance vous rappellent que Resto Végo reste, malgré son orientation santé, un restaurant fast-food. Autres bémols: le personnel n'est pas particulièrement souriant et, si jamais votre assiette est éligible à la promotion du prix maximum, les autres rabais auxquels vous pourriez avoir droit (membership de l'Association Végétarienne de Montréal, carte d'étudiant) ne s'appliquent pas. Autrement, un comptoir est à votre disposition si jamais vous désirez plutôt prendre des sandwichs et/ou des salades à emporter."}
{"text":"Super restaurant végétarien mais aussi végétalien. J'aime beaucoup le principe du buffet qui permet de prendre et de gouter un peu de tout, en plus, il y a vraiment pas mal de choix chez Végo. Le seul bémol c'est le manque de choix en ce qui concerne les desserts végétaliens car lors de mon passage, il n'y en avait aucun ce qui est un peu dommage.  J'aime aussi l'idée de payer son assiette au poids car on peut alors la remplir abondamment sans dépenser une somme folle.  On peut également se faire des plats à emporter soi-même ce qui est bien pratique."}
{"text":"Fantastic find in Montreal! We had a three year old with us and the flexibility here is unbeatable. The options for vegetarians are limitless and the space is large enough both outside and inside. Perfect restaurant for a relaxed lunch! Must-visit for vegetarians visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but great selection of vegetarian/vegan food! We were in a hurry and found this place and it was the perfect get-in, get-out solution to our sudden hunger."}
{"text":"I like that this place is still around. I hadn't been for a long time and noticed the name change as it used to be Le Commensel before. It seems very much the same in how it operates except the prices have gone up. I like that they do have some variety, however it seems that they often only have small portions of food out and don't always refill it so if you go after lunch or after dinner it can be a little sparse. I do think it'd be nice if they charged less if you come at a time when only some of the food is out and not all of it, just because it can be quite expensive paying by the pound. I'm still not sure why we get free bread and forgot about this until at the checkout and took some anyway. But eating plain bread compared to the other food on my plate just didn't make sense so I left it."}
{"text":"Des plats qui donnent envie, beaucoup de choix et vraiment pas excessif ! J'ai trouvé que les plats etaient très salés, ce qui a gaché ma selection. Desserts très bons! Ca vaut le coup quand on est à coté. Mais d'autres restaurants vege ont ma préférence à Montréal !"}
{"text":"Je m'y suis arreté pour la creme glacé vegane !! Mmmmm , grand local avec bcp de tables en arriere."}
{"text":"This was a tad out of the way for lunch after Musee de Beaux Arts, but I had to check it out as I am mostly vegetarian AND this is basically a savory version of my favorite modern innovation: the self-serve yogurt shop. As further explanation to Americans if either of these mean something to you think Souper Salad (RIP!) or Fresh Choice, but more exotic. And better. And with maple syrup pie (drool). There is plenty here for both the I love vegetables vegetarian and the maybe if I close my eyes I can imagine it's a hamburger vegetarian. Watch those eyes in your stomach because you pay by weight, but once you get your plate full head over to the widow and grab a prime people watching spot. Watch the shoppers and business people on the streets below and watch your fellow first time diners plow through their plates stacked 10 inches high. The eyes bigger than the stomach thing."}
{"text":"Un choix de resto végé et vegan fiable depuis des annees. Ambiance relax on peut choisir de manger au sous-sol pour plus d'intimité et même se réunir dans des locaux prévus à cet effet.  Les mets sont étiquetés végé ou vegan. On peut prendre du vin ou de la bière. Pour une quinzaine de dollars par personne il est possible de bien manger. Les plats sont pesés. Et que dire de leurs desserts!"}
