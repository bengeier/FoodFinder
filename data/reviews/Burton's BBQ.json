{"text":"My son goes to school near Cleveland.  We were looking for a place for BBQ and we stumbled upon this place last night.  I had the Rib Tips and he had the Pork Chop dinner.  All I can say in the meal was Amazing!  This has to be one of the best kept secrets in Cleveland.  The food is very affordable and the taste is Fantastic.  I will be back on my next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food!!! My \"usual\" here is the fried chicken breast dinner (it comes with your choice of 2 of his amazing homemade side dishes). The chicken is cut into pieces and then fried into crispy deliciousness. It is not greasy, but moist and perfect, and definitely ask for a side or two of his homemade BBQ sauce. As far as sides, I usually go with the 7 cheese Mac and cheese (which is pretty ridiculously good!), and green beans with bacon. The bf cannot leave here without a side of hot water cornbread. I've also ventured out and gotten the fried chicken salad, it was good, but let's be honest this isn't a salad kind of place.

Expect a bit of a wait, and call your order in beforehand or you'll be sorry. He does everything by hand himself (probably why the quality and consistency are amazing). So if he says 45 min. It usually means closer to an hour lol.

Also, he used to take credit cards, but his granddaughter broke the machine, so be safe and take cash!!!! This place is a little known gem, please check it out!!!!!"}
