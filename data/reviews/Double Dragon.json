{"text":"The food @ Double Dragon is ok, nothing to write home about. My problem with Double Dragon is when they deliver the food, they stated if I don't give them a tip, they won't deliver to my home. My problem with that is you shouldn't ask for a tip, it's earned and if I live a little farther than you like to go, charge extra for delivery or don't deliver in this area @ all. I'm having a hard time finding a descent Chinese restaurant that delivers in Bedford, with good food and good customer service. They do not have to worry about me ordering from their establishment again."}
{"text":"The food is great and they actually don't put garlic in my food when I asked for no garlic unlike China Dragon, I asked them for no garlic , they put it on anyways. The price is decent :)"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices. I usually get the War Su Gai and it is consistently good. Tasty egg rolls, fried rice and wonton soup. Crab rangoons and fried dumplings.... meh. I would give this place 4 stars for overall quality and value, except that I got sick once. Having eaten their food 15-20x before, I know it was an isolated incident so I have continued to order from them without problems."}
{"text":"Best lo mein in town. Staff friendly, and great food. Easily my favorite Chinese around here."}
