{"text":"I've been here many times, and it's never failed to satisfy.  Like other reviewers suggest, this is indeed a hidden gem.    The menu is easy, there are two pages and a page for your sushi/sashimi/rolls which is kinda nice and beats the binders you sometimes get at other sushi places.  The seating area itself is small and intimate and can probably fit 20-30 people comfortably.    The sushi is delicious at Hibiki and I have never ever had anything that smelled like fish or that comes semi frozen (yes, i sent it back and was told from the chef that this is a sign of freshness).    Favorites at Hibiki include the tuna green onion roll, all sashimi, ramen and pirikara ae.  Consistenly fresh, always friendly and reasonably priced(!).  It doesn't get easier than this."}
{"text":"Sushi Hibiki is for fresh fish lovers. Prices are very reasonable. Staff is extremely friendly and everything (the beautiful bowls and dishes, the decor, even the waitress' writing on the bill!) is just so darn cute (not Hello Kitty cute... handmade attention-to-detail sort of cute).  Ever had buttery, melt in your mouth salmon sashimi? No? Well, this is the place to get it. The last time I had fish like this was in Waikiki & Honolulu. The portions were not too big and not to small... just perfect. Why would anyone want to do all you can eat sushi anyways? That's not how it's supposed to be eaten. Savor the mellow flavors, bit by bit!  Age-dashi tofu was divine. It was just perfect. Easy to hold with chopsticks, crispy on the outside and silky on the inside. No grease or unpleasantness to speak of.  The ambience was mellow... everything was good. I will be back to eat here often. I would like to try other appetizers and noodle bowls in the future."}
{"text":"I took my kids there for dinner and I was really disappointed by their deep fried food.  The tempura was not light and flakey and their agedashi tofu was really greasy.  I have made my own tempura many times and although it's good it never turns out like the beautiful light and flakey versions sold in Japanese restaurants.  Sushi Hibiki's tempura reminded me of the stuff I make.  The prices were great and the sushi looked good although we didn't order any on this visit."}
{"text":"You know when people talk about little gems being hidden away in strip malls? Sushi Hibiki is one of these. The place is small and unassuming, tucked away in the tiny Bridgeland square just off of Edmonton trail and right beside a gas station.  You walk in and are immediately greeted by smiling faces. There aren't a lot of places where you can get this kind treatment. It's a small place and a well kept secret, so most of the tables are usually full.  The menu is simple and delicious. The agadashi tofu and the calamari make great starters, and are crispy and delicious. The tofu is smothered in a subtle sauce, and the calamari comes with a delicious chili mayo. So good!  I highly recommend the chirashi sushi or the chef's special. The sushi here is cut so well, it just melts in your mouth. Either one of the two give you a chance to sample a variety of the excellent nigiri. The sushi is where the head chef and owner, Nobu, really shines. He's got skill!   And that is the best part! As a semi-regular, you'll get a chance to talk with all of the staff, hear stories and feel like part of the small community that feels that Sushi Hibiki is hands down one of the best traditional sushi joints in Calgary!"}
