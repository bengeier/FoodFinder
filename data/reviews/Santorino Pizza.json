{"text":"The pizza has gone down hill and the guys that work there are rude. They charge $1.50 for extra sauce. Also the prices have gone up $7.95 for extra large"}
{"text":"My family has always loved there pizza but very horrible service . So horrible we preferred a different pizza !!! They hung up on me twice , talked so horrible & rudely !! I recommend patience .... Cause the way they talk to their customers it's horrible , ugly & sad !! Ugly ugly ugly"}
{"text":"stay away! the proprietor/owner is rude and has no understanding of customer service.... he may try to bank on his Homeland for giving him an authentic background,  but it only leaves him clueless about Western culture.  Maybe this could be overlooked, but unfortunately the food is even worse than his awful disposition"}
{"text":"I love this Pizzeria! Realy tasty pizza! The best pizza in Vegas!"}
{"text":"i love their pizza! I've had just a basic bacon pizza and it was so delicious. Thtey're always so friendly, and they know exactly who we are once we ask for chicken & bacon. haha Their prices are really reasonable too."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu! I travel a lot and I have a favorite pizza place I go to if available. It is called Sarpino's pizzeria! What a joke Sarfino's is! They couldn't even come up with their own logo, menu and etc. Don't believe me? Visit www.gosarpinos.com and see for yourself :). Very interesting!"}
{"text":"Very casual place tucked in the back of a shopping strip mall. Very reasonable prices for everything. Wanted a quick bite so only ordered the small garlic cheese pizza. 7$"}
{"text":"We had the bellisima and a large pepperoni pizza. I enjoyed the zucchini in the pizza but the tomatoes made the pizza a little watery, and the cheese was a little rubbery. Other than that,  I enjoyed the crust not too thick and not too thin. The pepperoni pizza was better. They delivered to our hotel and had easy online ordering."}
{"text":"This one the worst experience I ever had with the owner of a business. They had messed up my order. I called to complain, and was told, \"Then go to Pizza Hut if you want things your way.\" If I wanted Pizza Hut, I'd call Pizza Hut. I asked for the owner, and he said, \"I am the F***ing owner!\" I asked if he would correct the problem, his response was \"Don't ever call here again!\""}
{"text":"I love this place. Pizza is great and they have a large one topping pizza for $5.95. Pick up only though."}
{"text":"Quick delivery via Eat24, gigantic pizzas and salads.

Pizza is greasy, toppings slide off when picking a slice, cheese flavors weren't particularly prominent. Didn't really like how onions were chopped so finely instead of in strips, and somehow tasted almost slimy? Pie itself seemed undercooked.

But crust is very good, and salads are fresh and gigantic- dressing cups in a bowl the size of which most other places reserve for portions of soup.

I'd order from here again in a pinch, but it wouldn't be my first pick."}
{"text":"This one is the worst experience I ever had ordering food. The attitude of the guy on the phone was like he didn't want to sell any pizza to me. We could not agree on the address and he just said \"...how do I deliver if I don't know the f..... number!..\" and he hangup. I will never order from this place and I recommend you the same! That man has to be fired from his job!"}
{"text":"The desserts were horrible.  I could taste freezer burn/the taste of the food that was in the freezer with the desserts.  Gross."}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is not for the food, because I left without eating.

The reason I did not eat was because of the following scenario.  We were all starved, and walking home from the nearby Smith's when we saw Sarfino's.  I love pizza, so we beelined in.  The place was completely empty, and the only two employees were two extremely unclean looking guys behind the counter, which was pristine clean and stainless steel.  While I was standing there, deciding what to order, I pulled out a wet-nap to wash my hands with, as the guy stood at the counter watching me.  I then approached the counter, and put my purse down to get out my wallet and tell him my order.  

Here's the bizarre part: this weird employee took out a ballpoint pen and proceeded to *draw* blue pen ink all over my freshly washed hand.  I was annoyed, confused, and unhappy with that.  Im not sure what he was trying to do - flirt with me, or just be an ass - he certainly accomplished the latter.  At that point, after I got my speaking abilities back, I told him to cancel my order, as I'd thought the better of ordering from his establishment, and we left.  

There are a lot of far better places in town if it's pizza you seek.  My advice is to avoid this joint, in spite of the glowing recommendations I see, because the guy in there gave me the serious creeps, and the place didnt smell like pizza. Ive always been taught that if you go into a pizza place and it doesnt smell like pizza, its best to leave."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great prices.

The pizza was a little greasy, but the taste made up for it. The garlic breadsticks, while not horrible, were not my cup of tea. I would reccomend going for the cheesey breadsticks instead. All in all, the food was good, we will be going back again!"}
{"text":"My go to pizza place in Las Vegas since Pizza Hut sucks out here! 

My boyfriend & I usually get the pepperoni/sausage pizza which is top notch greasy when hot. We love, love, love it! But after it gets cold it tastes like cardboard to me.

The customer service is great too. Always friendly and knows my boyfriend by his name because he goes there so often.

After school he usually buys 2 xxtra large pepperonis and they feed 5 hungry little kids."}
{"text":"I use to go here all the time when i lived just a couple of blocks away, I've never had a bad experience with this place. I usually get there $5 pizza for my son and ill order there Philly cheese steak. The pizzas pretty good for being only $5 dollars but there Philly cheese steaks are delicious i love them there greasy flavorful and mmm mmm good. Service is great food is good will defiantly be returning here =)"}
{"text":"Cheese bomb delivered to the Stratosphere for $36. okay! 

Did you know that pizzas can't deliver to the hotel anymore? I found out the hard way after being f-ed up and having to trudge my way downstairs to the valet area and needing to pick up my pizza. 

Anyway i ordered through the yelp app because I could barely speak much less speak to a person on the phone about pizza. I got a pizza and a calzone with just dill in it and let me tell you it was the shiz. I didn't think it would be so good but it was. Then again I wasn't in my full capacities soooo"}
{"text":"horrible service ever. if i could id put zero stars horrible service ordered a pepperoni pizza and sent me a cheese pizza and told me they can send me video of them making my pizza correct when clearly its wrong no type of customer service at all also called us retards. do not go here horrible place horrible customer sevice"}
{"text":"Their carry-out specials are great! The toppings are like extra toppings and the crust is crisp n chewy, I've read some ppl ask fir extra sauce but I thought it was good enough, unless u like saucy pizzas. Overall really good value n pizza were ready to pick up in 15mins. Nice guys that work there too..."}
{"text":"I seem to recall ordering from here once before I ordered today though I can't seem to remember when that was or even what I ordered.  I guess it wasn't too memorable.  So before I forget again, here is my review for the day.

My office ordered from Sarfino's for lunch today.  I ordered a lamb gyro.  One co-worker got a lunch special #6, a meatball sub with fries and a Coke.  Another co-worker ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  My gyro was loaded with onion which I don't like but it is my own fault for not ordering without.  I should have known better.  Aside from that, the meat was flavorful but on the dry side.  The tzatziki sauce was thick and very good.  The fries were soggy from sitting in the box.  The meatball sandwich ordered looked incredible.  Three big meatballs smothered in cheese.  I shant repeat myself on the status of the fries.  The Philly looked good too.  A good amount of meat with a lot of yellow cheese.  If you want cheese on your steak be sure to order the cheese steak rather than the plain steak.  Sarfino's has several varieties of steak sandwich.

When I placed my order,  hanging up the phone at 11:04, I was told it would be about 45-55 minutes.  I waited for one full hour before calling to check the status.  I was told the driver had left and should have arrived.  The driver called about 1 minute later.  I thought this was a long wait for a couple of sandwiches.  Then I realized that Sarfino's is not all close to my office.  I think we are on the edge of their delivery zone.  So the time it took to arrive, while irritating, is acceptable.

Perhaps now that I have written my review I will remember ordering from Sarfino's in the future.  It may be a while before I order from here again.  The food is okay but not for how long it takes to prepare and deliver."}
{"text":"Great food, I love their pizza! Highly recommend that place. I've had 16inch with ham, mushrooms and onion. It was perfectly baked and the cheese was delicious, I'll go back again for sure"}
{"text":"I learned about this place because they had slipped a take out menu underneath my door at the hotel I was staying at. Even though I adore pizza, I was feeling less than enthusiastic about ordering from some random business that I didn't know a thing about, but we ordered a large veggie and salad anyways. Turns out, the pizza was actually quite good! The crust was amazing - nice and fluffy and totally edible. Plus, they didn't skimp on ingredients - both on the pizza and on the salad. I really hate it when restaurants get cheap when it comes to giving you your vegetables, but Sarfino's did not disappoint. 

Next time I go to Vegas, I'm ordering my pizza here (plus it was a ton better value than the other overpriced food you find on the strip!)!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Ordered a 4 cheese pizza and they used something processed instead of cheddar. 
Imagine a layer of Velveeta on a pizza. Then they had the audacity to say it tasted processed because the oil from the pepperoni and sausage leaked on to it. 
It's 11pm, I'm high with the munchies, I waited an hour, and this pizza is inedible. How nasty does a pizza have to be that a hungry stoner can't eat it? 
If you're a smoker, boycott this buzzkill"}
{"text":"Woke up today to 5 menus on my patio. Not by my front door, but my freaking patio. Whoever dropped these off are lazy and obnoxious, and I'll never eat here... especially with the terrible reviews. I was going to call and complain about it, but it sounds like the owner/manager doesn't care about how he talks to his customers, so I'll pass on everything with this place"}
{"text":"I was lured in by the street side billboard offering a Large pepperoni pizza for $5.00-and as they say you get what you pay for.

It was fast & they were real nice and the prices on everything on the menu are real reasonable but...

When I first opened the box I thought they had given me a cheese pizza but quickly i realized they just put the chesse ON TOP.

I have had many a pizza and this was a 1st...the pizza was cheap and nothing to write home about..actually it was another 1st in my house. 1st pizza to NOT get finished.

I wouldn't bother with the pizza here again but I'd give their other stuff a try."}
{"text":"I'd leave pics of the actual pizza - the $5.95 large carry-out special - but it never made it home. It was so good, from cheese to crust to sauce to speed. It was my first from Santorino. It will not be my last."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I did not eat here. I thought it was a problem that the only way I knew I was in a pizza joint is because there were pizza boxes on the wall. It didn't even smell like pizza. It was confusing."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm the girl that ordered a mushroom cheeseburger from a pizza joint. My fiancé wanted pizza and I was craving a juicy hamburger. Didn't have high expectations because again I knew it was  a pizza place but wow! I loved their burger! It was juicy, the bun was fluffy, the veggies were super fresh. Yum! 

We were craving unhealthy food that day and also ordered the jalapeño poppers, fried mushrooms and a pizza. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. It's okay, the leftover pizza made for a good lunch the next day as well. The fried mushrooms were freshly fried and perfectly battered. The jalapeño poppers hit the spot and the pizza was topped with lots of fresh mushrooms, tons of sausage and pepperoni and had a great flavor. Good stuff!

Oh and we used Eat24 to order delivery and the delivery guy was super nice. He called us to let us know he was there because he didn't want to be all rude and knock on the door too loud and startle us or our neighbors. How nice is that? This place gets a big thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"We ordered burgers. The bacon was definitely undercooked, which made it hard to even complete the first two bites due to the elasticity. The patties were way too chewy, but I was starving so I muddled my way through the burger. A few hours later, I regretted it. I ate the burger around 8pm, started having problems around 10pm, and had explosive gas, diarrhea, and abdominal pain until at least 3 or 4 in the morning. Thankfully, I am still alive today."}
{"text":"I'll never order from these people again!! I ordered off of the Eat24 App, which screwed up my address and sent them to a spot that wasn't that far off from where I live. It sent them to Duneville and Twain, I live on Decatur and Twain. I ordered there Chicken Alfredo and the Mozzerella Sticks. The Mozzerella Sticks were mediocre at best, but I had no complaints about it. I tried eating the Chicken Alfredo entree, but it tasted like cardboard, and smelled worse. Not even 1/4th of the way through I couldn't eat it. Even the garlic bread sucked. So I called the restaurant, and they told me that they wouldn't do anything for me and that all complaints must be done through the app because I ordered through the app. They also complained that I sent their driver to the wrong location which was 4 miles out of there way. They're no more than a mile and half away from either location!! While I sympathize with their driver for the wrong address, it was some of the worst food I've eaten, and it's matched by their customer service."}
{"text":"On 29 July for total $25 I bought 2 extra large, thin-crust pizzas (and I asked for \"extra sauce\"): 1 pepperoni only and 1 combo/supreme.  It fed 5 adults and 2 kids, with 2 slices leftover to spare.  My friends and I thought the pies were excellent and I'll be buying Sarfino's from now on instead of Pizza Hut or Costco's eatery's pizza.  I had asked the employee (owner?) how long they've been open and he said \"10 yrs\" so it's strange they only have 4 Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"My new update..GREAT PIZZA again folks!  Ohhh..just had my fav pizza their pick-up Special..Large Sausage w/extra cheese..their cheese is to die for as well as their crust..delicious as usual!  My fav kind of pizza is New York style..but this pizza's crust is soooo good that I forget all about the NY style alltogether!!!!!???  You gotta try them..theyre the best"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little creepy. The bathroom wasnt working and neither were the soda fountains, but the pizza was a wonderful surprise! The cheese was great! I wouldn't dine in, but I'd take out again on my next visit."}
{"text":"it is not really good pizza I feel so bad about writing this because the people there are so nice and the owner has a really friendly attitude but the cheese just is not good and the bread is dry and crackly and it hurt my mouth one time and the toppings are always really scarce I mean I got more than like 5 olives but that should not be where we set the bar we need to raise the olive standard and yeah the prices are good of course they're good when the ingredients aren't amazing I don't know I just want to be a good person and do the right thing i am sorry sarfino's you are all so nice just please do pizza better"}
{"text":"This place is great. We basically selected it randomly from Yelp and they delivered right to our hotel room. The process was nice and easy and the pizza was awesome!!! Two large pizzas were very reasonably priced and plenty for a family of 6. I will definitely order from them again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My boy toy and I used to pick up a cheap pizza from here on the way home before play time. It was close to our homes and place of employment at the time. It was bad on both of those last visits. I was really counting on the nourishment since I was in for a long and active night in. On one of the visits the pizza was even burned charcoal black on a few of the slices crust. 


Ok so my biggest issue with eateries is that some of them are just not consistent. When I have a good memory then visit and it is bad, it really sucks round hanging flesh!

One day a pizza is great then the next it is thin, dry and bare of cheese and toppings. This is what has happened the last two times. 

I understand having an every day pizza special, but come on put some toppings on the pizza. If I wanted baked plain dough that is thin and dry chewy I would ask for it!

I wish I had snapped a photo of the last pizza we got, it was  bare with so many bubbles that were not even covered.

Bad, Bad, Bad.


Shame on you Sarfino's! You did me wrong, one too many times! We are over!"}
