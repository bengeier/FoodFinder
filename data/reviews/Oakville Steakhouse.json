{"text":"My wife and I dined here on 02/23/18 for our 15th anniversary. We experienced excellent food and service. My wife had an impressive looking seafood pasta and I had a wonderful NY Strip. The restaurant gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Very nice experience!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise at the Tropicana! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Luxor last weekend and decided to forgo the Vegas buffet experience for a quieter, more upscale dinner for the last night of our stay. We were seated right away for our 8pm reservation and enjoyed a seriously amazing complimentary array of warm sesame and olive breads, basil aioli and a bruschetta-type tomato spread to start. We then ordered the tomato/artichoke/mozzarella/ciabatta starter, which had a nice balance of flavors, and the ahi tuna poke. I've enjoyed a looot of poke in LA, and I can assure you that theirs is legit while being as refined as you'd hope for. The plantain chips were a tasty touch and made for a fantastic presentation. The scallop/asparagus/corn johnnycake starter was also lovely--the scallops were perfectly seasoned and seared. 

Our server Alex, who was helpful but never intrusive throughout our meal, guided my boyfriend in choosing the perfect steak among the many options. He was not disappointed in his wagyu ribeye! The (huge) steak came with a trio of cute little sauces for each bite. I'm not a red meat eater, but I was still impressed!

We skipped dessert, but I would return for a try, especially if I happen to be in Vegas again for a birthday or other special occasion. Or, you know, just to have that bread and bruschetta spread again."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on our last day in Las Vegas. The food was very tasty and fresh. Prices were a bit higher than I'd prefer for lunch, but I don't mind paying for quality. Service was decent. We came in right before they closed for lunch so I can understand the servers may have been a little disappointed as they may have been about to be cut for the afternoon. One of the better casino restaurants IMO."}
{"text":"Let's start with the wobbly table..should have  heeded the sign, nope we proceeded.  Started with cocktails, dirty martini for moi and above the weather for my beau, both were decent, nothing spectacular.  We were brought bread, told it was french and sourdough; I love sourdough, this was a hearty rye, not a hint of sourdough, the butter though was nice with the spiced top.  Moving on..I ordered prime rib with side of au jus, waiter acted like I was asking him for his kidney or something, he said well it comes with it, I said of course it does, I would like some on the side in a ramekin! Then he turns to my beau and starts to ask for his order, I stopped him as I wasn't finished :(  I asked then for a side of truffled mac & cheese *oy*..so he quickly went back to get beau's order.  Beau ordered the Texas Wagu filet rare and waiter was nice enough to ask him if he'd like a side, which he ordered the Brussels sprouts with smoked beef belly  *didn't know that was a thing* pieces.  Food came out of kitchen super fast, really too fast for $$$ eatery.  I do wish I would have taken a picture of my prime rib, it needed a raft to keep from sinking in the au jus pool, but hey good news is there was a ramekin with au jus as I requested..then I look to the truffled mac & cheese..I was surprised to be served gummy, undercooked orecchiette pasta, mixed with something white and cheese like..it was terrible, not sure where they hid the truffle.  I returned it and requested the asparagus, which was vibrant and cooked nicely.  Now the brussels sprouts...tasteless, blanched, then baked..so disappointing, the \"smoked beef belly\" was neither salty nor sweet, looked like brown hanging chads from a indecisive voter ballot, I bet the chads have more flavor.  Plus side, the meat was higher quality and tasted nice.  This dining experience was displeasing and regrettable, we will stick to Flemings or Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"I was expecting quality food but... I ordered the surf & turf meal and lobster bisque. The shrimps were charcoaled as well as my steak. The lobster bisque tasted burned and watery without any lobster pieces in the bisque. We waited 25 minutes to get out food and then all burned. We brought it to the waiters attention, Carlos who was very nice. He showed it to manager and they didn't charge us for the meal. What I thought was ironic is that we ordered 1 coffee and and 1 ice tea $10. wow and they did charge us for that, dumb. There were other guest who were walking out because they had waited 30 minutes and still no food on their table, SAD. The food court at the Tropicana was GREAT, fresh and reasonable wait time. We did eat at Robert Irvine's and that was fantastic, service and food was great!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and overall had a great experience. I think I enjoyed it more than my date but I thought the food was good, service was great, and the ambiance was nice. Took out one star because I thought it was a little expensive."}
{"text":"We went here on 1/7/18 about 8:00 pm and it was very slow, only one other customer, so service was quick. Food was delicious maybe a little expensive for the Tropicana. For two the bill was $240 with tip, no drinks, just one iced tea and water."}
{"text":"I wanted to splurge for my husband's birthday and to make up for his not splurging on mine so I made a reservation at Oakville. It was a Sunday and I told the person on the phone it was my husband's birthday and she said she would make note of it on the reservation. I thought that meant something would be done, like a scope of ice cream or something. I have to admit that was a big let down because I had nothing else prepared like cake or special treat. 
On to our dinner...... The restaurant is beautiful. The service is A+. Our server and wait staff was so warm and friendly. We ordered wine and a cocktail. The server gave us the most delicious breads with bruschetta and aioli. So fresh and good. You could easily fill up on this. 
For our dinner, my husband ordered a filet and I had filet with an 8 oz lobster tail. Yes it was to die for. The steaks were over the medium we ordered them but still melted in our mouth good so we had no problem eating them. We split a big baked potato which was perfect. The piece de resistance was the cream corn. OMG order it. It is the best I ever had! The meal was lovely and something we will never forget."}
{"text":"The price should have some equity to the quality of food. Service was 5-star. Caesar salads were delicious & very nice portion. Steaks lacked flavor and were luke warm when served. The two pieces of vegetable were lifeless and looked like they had sat on the plate for a long time. If we were not on a time schedule for a show I would have sent the steaks back. A steakhouse in a major 'strip hotel' should represent the hotel, this place does not live up to the Hilton standard."}
{"text":"Did not eat but the bartender was awesome Michelle made the best espresso martini I have ever had plus what a wonderful personality made us feel great!"}
{"text":"This steak house was ok we went here because we had 70$ dining credit and needed a place to go to ASAP. We made reservations through yelp which was all good they sat us right away and gave us booth like requested. The service here is really good our server was super nice and did a great job. We got the crab cakes which were alright my opinion they were way too small but they were delicious and crispy which I like. The oysters were delicious and highly recommended. For sides we got the Brussels sprouts and the baked potato and truffles Mac n cheese. Ok let me start with the Brussels they were my least favorite out if everything we got they were soggy and not very flavorful. Maybe over marinated idk but they could if been better. The Mac n cheese was delicious I couldn't taste the truffle but it was still good. The baked potato was great hard to mess that up. It's a lot on the pricey side so be prepared to spend over 100 here easy."}
{"text":"Great steaks, great server Anthony. A pleasure to enjoy. I highly recommend it. The bone-in Ribeye steak was tender and juicy. Staff very courteous and knowledgeable and enjoy their work."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here on our last night in Vegas. Dinner was wonderful. My filet was excellent. My waiter was very helpful when it came to picking out a wine. We ordered chocolate mousse for dessert and found the dish to be almost too pretty to eat. Almost anyway, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"The service is good and they are extremely polite.  My NY strip has great flavor.  Cream corn and Brussel sprouts are good."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with exceptional service however, I had the sea bass and came down with food poisoning. A dinner companion contacted management and it didn't appear that it was handled appropriately. We just wanted them to check the fish, but instead they appeared to blow it off because we were not actually staying at The Tropicana. I was hoping to have a good time in the downtown area with out of town guests, but instead I spent the night on the bathroom floor, sick as a dog, at the Monte Carlo. What a waste of money on food and lodging."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars.
Service 2 stars.

We had a $26 credit from the hotel for Breakfast and we decided to eat here, the breakfast options seemed better than the Italian place across the hall.
Antonia the hostess was very nice and friendly, and we got some help from Mark.

However, our main server was apparently not at his best. He did not stop to see us for a very long time, Mark noticed and got our drink order for us...

Once we ordered he stopped by a couple of times, but just like passing by and not really waiting for us to answer (specially when you have a mouthful)... Getting refills was a struggle, and at one time my husband got up to go get someone's attention, but we could not remember what is that we needed.

My steak an eggs was OK, cooked to my liking, but my hubby's breakfast burrito (Chorizo and eggs) did not taste like chorizo at all, it just had a little bit of color but no taste. 
Almost at the end of our meal we had a chance to mention to our server and he acknowledged the chorizo burrito it is supposed to be way better than that. At that time I also asked for butter and jam for my toast, which he said I was supposed to get with my meal.

As I said our food was OK, but I also noticed the table next to us had gotten sandwiches and both of them had burned bread. One of the ladies was eating it as is, and the other one removed the bread (after inspecting it) and ate the rest of the food. One, as a customer, I would have send both those sandwiches back, and 2, as a server, I would have not brought those items to the table.

Overall, not impressed with this place. If for the convenience you decide to come here, have low expectations and stand up for yourself : )"}
{"text":"Oakville is a fantastic restaurant for lunch! The ambiance is lovely, servers extremely attentive and the food is delicious. In particular, the buffalo chicken sandwich is out of this world! Mark- the server's assistant is so friendly and constantly refilling soft drinks and iced tea. Tropicana has a winner with Oakville!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time of day because I went there the same day as Trenna H.  I was at the Tropicana for a conference and I had sworn to my travel companion that I didn't want to eat at any of the food service providers in the hotel.  The prices were not competitive with what could be found elsewhere.  Nonetheless, I was strapped for time.  I had 45 minutes to order and eat.
The server was friendly, but he was in no rush to take an order.  (Other people from my conference were at the bar and they too were waiting).  The restaurant was also not crowded.
My friend ordered a burger and the lobster bisque.  I asked for chicken on a bun with a side of fries.
The order took the entire 45 minutes to deliver.  I insisted that it needed to be bagged (that caused another 10 minute delay).  My friend told me that the bisque was rancid and that the burger was nothing special.  He even brought the bisque back.  The friendly server took it to the cook and the cook refused to acknowledge that anything was wrong with it.  The server gave my friend another soft drink.
My chicken was dry and the potatoes were all over-salted.  This meal cost $40.  I would not recommend this place and I would not serve the leftovers to a dog."}
{"text":"Superb! My partner and I were short on time because we were seeing a show, so we ate appetizers. They were divine. I ate a carmelized onion soup with smoked bacon brioche and melted gruyere. It was deep and bold. Next I had a smoked scallop chop salad with pickled blueberries and citrus vinaigrette. This meal-sized salad was so good that I would come back to Oakville just for this. I topped my meal off with a deconstructed banana cream pie that was divine. We could only imagine how the entrees would have been like if we had more time. The service was attentive and excellent. Oakville is a culinary gem which you should put on your dining itinerary in Vegas."}
{"text":"Do not miss this place! Best filet I ever had! The wine, a red blend called \"prisoner\" was to die for. Ken, my waiter was so knowledgeable and fun. Pricey, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. It was adequate. In truth, I prefer the menu of the prior restaurant before they rebranded. The heirloom and tomatoes salad tastes just isn't quite right.  The beef all seems to have some kind of salt rub that is way way too salty.  I ordered it medium and it was too dry for my preference. Should have ordered medium rare. The broccolinini is too oily and way too much garlic and pine nuts.  

I'm sad because I used to really like this joint before they changed it :-("}
{"text":"Chateaubriand was tasteless and was of the same quality as a standard a NY strip steak.  The side dish of brussel sprouts was insufficiently marinated and was not truly roasted.  All in all a poor meal for the cost at the Tropicana  Hotel's premier steakhouse."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best meals of my life... Great staff and Dexter(bartender and server) was phenomenal. Recommended the WAGU NY strip and a glass of Napa cab... Amazing combo and I couldn't recommend any higher... Thanks everyone!!!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary and so glad we decided to go here. The bread was so good in the beginning with our bottle of wine that we ordered. We shared the chateaubriand for two and although it was expensive it was delicious and extremely filling."}
{"text":"Went to Oakville for lunch and had a great experience.  The server was very attentive and always made sure to check on us regularly.  I ordered the Lobster Roll and it was a huge portion, flavorful and perfect for lunch.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Tropicana hotel, so I decide to give Oakville a try!  Service was good, attentive and staff seemed knowledgeable.  

A few errors on the wine menu stating California wines as being from Washington state, gave me pause to their attention to detail and actual wine knowledge, considering they're naming themselves after a wine region in Napa! When I mention this to the way there he seemed confused and kind of blew it off.

The food was just OK and nowhere near the quality of a steakhouse at these prices.  The brussels sprouts were way overcooked and mushy!  Felt like vegetables that have been sitting in a pot for hours, and not something that I have been freshly prepared for my dinner.

The veal chop I ordered was overcooked, I requested medium rare which was what the waiter recommended as chefs recommendation. But the chop I received was more well done with the edges being dry and hard and the Center edible but still over done.  For $60 for a veal chop I expected significantly better preparation.

Overall, a very forgettable dinner and if you are used to dining in a good steakhouse, I would skip. If you are used to dining at Bonanza this is a step up."}
{"text":"It was a nice surprise to find this restaurant inside the Tropicana Hotel. My husband had the prime rib, I had the sea bass and key lime pie for dessert. Everything was excellent. The staff was extremely attentive. Give this place a try if you're in the area. I wish I had taken a picture."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Saturday and had the turkey burger which I loved.  Nice ambience. Service was friendly. Food came out quick. Definitely be back for lunch when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a serious hidden gem!  Oakville is my favorite wine region in the Napa Valley, and the fact that they serve wines from here by the glass for less than $20 is a score.  I used to love when the restaurant was Biscayne, but now i think they've made some improvements.  they still have the eggplant lamb tacos (sounds crazy but they're fantastic).  My sister got the filet and raved about it, while i got the lamb chops and was thoroughly pleased.  I usually get a NY Strip, but decided to be more adventurous and was well rewarded.  Service was pretty much flawless even though I drink my water too fast - it is the desert btw.  Salads and dessert were also really solid and well presented."}
{"text":"This place was kind of blah... It is okay if you are looking for something convenient within the hotel, but it would not be my first option. Both service and food could have been better."}
{"text":"The service was Ok, at times we wondered where our waiter was but when he did appear he was very nice. Maybe they were under staffed? I asked for my go to drink an Old Fashion but I think the bar tender put her own twist on it and must be thinking it's a New Fashion. Wrong! Soda and cherry?! Major foul.. After that I decide on just water while waiting for my food. I ordered the porter house. It was a mediocre nothing special. I have been to many of the Las Vegas steakhouses and I'm always up to try a new one. Needless to say I will not be back to this one. Two days later I was extremely happy visiting Joe's in the forum shops."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  Eaten at the older renditions of this place.  Still consistent, good service, good food, and well presented.   
Did have a drunk woman when we were first seated,  but they dealt with her was quickly and discreetly...it is Vegas."}
{"text":"All food was excellent.  Steak cooked exactly as requested. Vegetables fresh and flavorful.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the last 30 days, both times I got the Dry Aged Bone in Filet, absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was good! And great portions. But the service was outstanding! Thank you very much for a very pleasant night."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch at Oakville. We ordered the kale and spinach salad, and buffalo burger. Both were fantastic. The boysenberries and Mandarin oranges in the salad were fresh. Overall a nice spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Worth every penny!  Steak was tasty.  Scallops were heavenly.  Baked potato is enough for 2.  Staff is delightful"}
{"text":"Great service here and such wonderful cuts of steak they offer. Thank you for making our evening enjoyable without any bad service. Sometimes the food is just as good as the service. Tonight was great"}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude. Way overpriced for what you get. The waiter comped a attitude. Food was sub par. Don't recommend."}
