{"text":"The price is a great, but I was disappointed that it wasn't homemade ice cream. The girl behind the counter said one of the ones they use is Blue Bell. 

Still, I got a strawberry milkshake. It was incredibly bland. Other than knowing I picked out strawberry, there was nothing else to indicate it's flavor. 

Now, they have a selection of cookies you can choose from to make ice cream sandwiches that they indicate are made from scratch, but they didn't look all that appealing to me. 

Sorry, but there's nothing that would bring me back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My husband and I have eaten here three times in the past three days. Great cookies, yummy ice cream, and really cheap. The place is cute, too. And the owners seem really nice. The name doesn't make sense to me, but the product is awesome. :)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the price and quality of this ice cream sandwich. Butter pecan in between two sugar cookies was delicious. Size was perfect, cookie was fresh baked and the ice cream was great! You can switch it up and mix your cookie flavors too."}
{"text":"WOW! I just happened to stumble upon this place and I'm so glad I did!  For $2, yes just $2 you get to create a cookie ice cream sandwich to satisfy your craving. I had the strawberry cheesecake on snicker doodles cookies.  The ice cream was creamy with a great flavor and lots of cheesecake chunks but it was the cookies that stole the show! The cookies were fresh,  soft and the best damn snicker doodle I've ever tasted. The portion size was generous and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. The cookies were not chewy as they state but over cooked and crunchy. The ice cream itself was also not very creamy and a bit icy.  The only positive was the customer service was good."}
{"text":"Cheap, easy and delicious (not unlike your mum. . .  j/k). Their prices are super reasonable ($2 for a pretty large ice cream sandwich) and they have high quality product. It's a small business, so the folks that work there are the owners, and they're very interested in making sure you get served quickly and get what you want. I work right above this place and have been there numerous times, each time they keep the same standard up."}
{"text":"Best desert place on Mill if you're craving something sweet. Really cheap and delicious. Try the double chocolate cookies with mint chip ice cream. Fantastic"}
{"text":"Great make your own ice cream sandwich place by ASU campus. I had chocolate chip cookies with butter pecan ice cream. The ice cream was too icy, otherwise it would be a 5."}
{"text":"What fun! Who doesn't want 2 cookies of my choosing and a scoop of ice cream for 2 bucks?

Good fun while walking around Mill Street.

Fun concept- stupid name...."}
{"text":"For the first time being in Tempe I knew I had to go and try this place. Honestly it didn't disappoint"}
{"text":"So this place is wonderful... Drove all the way from California for this. Jk, we were passing through on a roadtrip. My best friend and I were craving ice cream... Like always.. So i googled this place and BAM. Ice cream sandwiches to the MAX. Dove straight into the cookies n cream sandwiched between perfect snickerdoodle cookies... MADE MY NIGHT."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. 
it's very inexpensive and so worth it! Stop by! I got the chocolate chip cookie with cookie dough ice cream it was greatness!"}
{"text":"I got a snicker doodle, white chocolate macadamia nut ice cream sandwich with triple caramel. It was delicious! The cookies definitely made me want to write this review...and I'm not a cookie person. Get the snicker doodle for sure! 

2 bucks! What a deal?!?!"}
{"text":"I love it! You can literally have one any time of the day. The Macadamia cookie along with rocky road ice cream is one of my favorites. You can also have a brownie with your ice cream, that is a good combination as well, goes without saying. On mill avenue, this is a great joint to grab some dessert after all the food you have consumed :)"}
{"text":"Slickables......where have you been my whole life?????

$2 for a homemade cookie and ice cream sandwich!!!

U pick the cookie types, u pick the ice cream and there is your sandwich for $2. How do you do it Slickables? The best!!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is: Two dollars!!! Slickables has a great product at an unbelievable price. The ice cream sandwich space is about to get more crowded in town with the arrival of San Diego's The Baked Bear, but I cannot imagine they will surpass Slickables perfect balance of quality and price. 

Slickables has a nice variety of cookies (snickerdoodles, red velvet, funfetti, double chocolate...) and ice cream (mint chocolate chip, salted caramel...). Enough selections so that kids, and I suspect the occasional late night college student, could have problems choosing. 

There is a nice little seating area inside. The kids loved the chairs that seemingly had bites taken out of them. With customized $2 ice cream sandwiches waiting behind the counter, the kids may be sitting in those chairs quite often."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely RIDICULOUSLY FABULOUS!!  How can two soft fresh baked cookies with a big scoop of ice  cream not be incredibly awesome??  And all for two dollars?  How can they do that?  I'm worried that this place will crash and burn on Mill Ave like so many other places. PLEASE !!!!EVERYONE must go here to keep this place alive and well and in business because it can't be making a lot of profit selling these delectable desserts for 2 bucks. I've had three this week alone.  Shout out to this place, they have gone above and beyond my wildest dreams"}
{"text":"Slickables is glorious. Fresh baked cookies (that you get mix and match), a ton of ice cream flavors, a great location, and it's only $2. 

I need to repeat that. Only $2.

This place just redefined desserts. Get the Dulce de Leche on two Chocolate Chip Cookies and your life might be changed. Clean store, friendly owners, and somewhat distanced from the homeless masses that now roam Mill Ave."}
{"text":"great $2 ice cream sandwich
pick any ice cream
pick any 2 cookies  (fresh made)
awesomenss!
tastes like type 2!!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY delicious! Kids loved the ice cream sandwiches with fresh baked cookies!  Bought two of these for the kids and a dozen cookies too. $10 is a great deal for all of that.  The owner is also super nice and helpful too."}
{"text":"This place was so fun. It's small and only has like 2 tables, but it's in a great location for walking around. I got the yummiest ice cream sandwich for $2!! Yes!!! $2. 4 of use had dessert and it was $8! I think it was the perfect amount to top of a dinner. I will be back"}
{"text":"Used these guys for a corporate event. Tina (coordinator) was real accommodating and helped with delivery to the event. Everyone loved the treats -- highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after having dinner next door at La Bocca, and the place does not disappoint.  It's not a flashy joint, but an ice cream shop doesn't really need to be.  It's a simple down to earth spot, pick a cookie flavor (can be the same flavor or different), then pick the ice cream flavor you want squished between.  And for $2!  Staff were cool, the ice cream and cookies yummy, and a nice bench outside perfect for people watching."}
{"text":"Cookie was fresh. Ice cream was good. In front of amc. Parking was great. No complaints. Similar to Diddy Reese in california."}
{"text":"I had been out of town for nearly four days and realized I hadn't yet had ice cream.  I knew I had to do something about that.  I found this place, and my addiction was fed.  The cookie options and ice cream flavor options were great, and I had a lot of fun mixing and matching to create my sandwich.  The only thing to me that would bring this up to a 5-star review would be if the ice cream too were homemade.  I think that would be simply amazing!"}
{"text":"It is hard  to not give a good review for cookies and ice cream.  I had a snickerdoodle cookie, a mint chip cookie with chocolate cookie dough ice cream in the center.  Delicious.  The best part is, it is only $2!  It's a generous scoop of ice cream too.  I will be back."}
{"text":"$2 for warm gooey cookies and great ice cream?! I literally would be in here every day if I lived in Tempe. So good!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Though there are quite a few ice cream/yogurt places on Mill Ave this one is my favorite. Very friendly service and a great deal. I'd give 5 stars but it's a personal rule of mine to never give 5 stars to a place that still gives styrofoam. I suggest having some lunch at La Bocca then popping next door for dessert. Salted Caramel Cookies with Dulce de Leche ice cream!"}
{"text":"Bomb cookies. Solid ice cream choices. Cheap prices. 
I'm in love with this place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is a little lacking (though the chairs with a bite taken out of them, adorable). That's easy to forgive because you can get an ice cream sandwich, made from fresh cookies and some of the best ice cream you'll ever have. For only two bucks. That right there is a starving-college-student-fat-kid's dream. I only wish they were more expensive to deter me from coming back again and again.

I don't even remember what the service was like, all I remember is deliciousness."}
{"text":"I've cream sandwiches are amazing. Do it!

Milkshakes are a bit disappointing. Like frothy cold milk without a ton of flavor... But the cookie sandwiches are amazing. 

Seriously they're amazing!"}
{"text":"We called today because we want to order nearly 40 ice cream sandwiches for our staff. After trying for five minutes to have the young man that answered the phone understand that we were trying to pre-order the sandwiches I finally gave up in frustration.  As a business owner, I understand and know that it's very important to make sure that the people that answer my phones are knowledgeable enough to take orders. We are now going somewhere else because this person could not handle the order that we were trying to place. This was on our 5th call. The first four times no one answered. I hope to give this location a try in the future since the other reviews were so good."}
{"text":"I love this shop!  It's simple and delicious.

Pick your cookies, pick your ice cream and they make a perfectly sized ice cream sandwich for you for a great deal - $2.  It's addictive, I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Great place to grab dessert. Cookies are baked fresh, milkshakes are great, and a perfect location on Mill. Employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my slickable today....needless to say won't ever go back. The first time trying one"}
{"text":"We had the best experience at Slickables in Tempe!  We were in town visiting my dad in the hospital and wanted to get a treat for his nurse and nurse aid team. We called Slickables and asked if they could help with a large order with no notice. Thankfully, they could and allowed us to purchase the pre-made, hard frozen ice cream sandwiches they had on hand for their catering service. They also let us buy a foam ice chest to transport them in. The young man helped me carry it to the car when my husband pulled up in front. We also bought them several dozen fresh cookies. Excellent customer service and delicious treats!!  The nurses were thrilled and absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Hubby and I come here on our late night ice cream/cookie cravings because it's fast and pretty cheap! Heating up the house to make cookies and buying ice cream is not something I want to do in an apartment in the Tempe summer. Four dollars for a rich and perfect cookie sandwich that you can create and have made in front of your eyes is something I'd spend money on."}
{"text":"Good service. Meh milkshakes. But I guess that's not what they're famous for really. My friend got a sandwich with two different cookies and it was not bad at all!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I love this place. Where else can you get a delicious custom ice cream sandwich for just 2 bucks? Heck, where can you get an ice cream under $2 these days? Anyways... this place is great. Convenient location to ASU students and anyone living in the area. 

You get to pick any two cookies and a scoop of your favorite ice cream and put them together for a scrumptious ice cream sandwich! All for only $2. 

This place is great and I will be here often."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Skip Sparky's (Cold Stone in disguise) and get better ice cream for WAY less. They are open late and the employees are always friendly. One time I saw a customer left her backpack and an employee ran after her for a block to return it! 

The strawberry cheesecake ice cream in a waffle cone is my favorite, while my husband prefers different combos of the ice cream sandwiches that you can create. We think their flavors are better than the other ice cream parlors on Mill."}
{"text":"Good ice cream sandwiches!!! For a very good price wouldn't mind coming here again. Like how they close at midnight . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A generous scoop of ice cream in between two freshly baked cookies for $2?? Yes please! The place is cute (albeit small, but you can always just take it to go and eat it at a random bench on Mill), and the owner is super nice. I went with her recommendation and it didn't disappoint! I got raspberry sherbet in between a double chocolate and chocolate chip cookie, and the tartness of the sherbet balanced out well with the sweetness of the cookies. Now if they offered homemade ice cream, then this would bump it up to five stars"}
{"text":"First time here. Got the chocolate chip and fun fetti cookies with strawberry shortcake ice cream. Omgggg!!! It was only $2 and was so delish!!!! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here and I've stopped by several times. Busy or slow, the staff is always friendly and they make THE best ice cream sandwiches you can buy. And seriously, $2 for a super scrumptious ice cream sandwich is a steal!

A perfect end to a nice walk on Mill Ave during the summer, or a cute little dessert stop for a date night. Get those day young cookies too!"}
{"text":"After ramen, I needed something sweet to eat. Per the recommendation of our server at Shady Park we walked over and was surprised about the price for an ice cream sandwich.

I got a waffle cone with a scoop of rocky road and hubby got a cup of chocolate and cookies and cream. Wow our total was below $5...get outta here.

I was really liked their rocky road, it had macadamia nut instead of the typical almond. It wasn't too sweet and being lactose intolerant my tummy wasn't disturbed at all."}
{"text":"We came here after fireworks on 4th of July.

Even though it was busy, the staff was still super friendly. Everyone got the ice cream they wanted, but I was lil disappointed by the lack of non-dairy option. I think they used to have it but not anymore. Nevertheless, my group and I enjoyed the experience and would come back again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Slickables! The cookies are always perfect, soft yet strong enough to withstand the ice cream. My favorites are the double chocolate chip, red velvet, & white chocolate chip macadamia. The ice cream selection is great, offering something for everyone. $2 for a generous serving of ice cream sandwiched between 2 of their delicious cookies? Unbeatable.  Best dessert in Tempe!"}
{"text":"After enjoying cheaper ice cream sandwhiches at Diddy Reese for 4 years, I guess the disappointment with slickables was only inevitable. Paid $2 for an ice cream sandwhich, which in my opinion is overpriced considering the taste. The cookies were disgustingly sweet (ordered red velvet which tasted nothing like red velvet and mint chocolate which had no hint of mint) and the ice cream tasted like dreyers ice cream... I would recommend making your own ice cream sandwhiches at home for a cheaper and tastier alternative!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Only $2 cash for an amazing ice cream sandwich! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good ice cream sandwiches and cheap!! $2 dollars for large ice cream sandwich- believe me, you can only eat one!!! Good ice creambut nothing out of this world...fast and friendly service as well."}
{"text":"It was ok. I mean I would definitely be more bothered if it wasn't so inexpensive, but honestly, I was a little let down. Lackluster food. A little boring on the actual experience.
Just nothing special about them."}
{"text":"The inside of Slickables was filthy--the floor had trash all over it and the counter had melted ice cream all over it. Honestly, I contemplated not even ordering ice cream because of how dirty it was and I was concerned for the sanitation of it. The ice cream sandwich itself was okay, but nothing special. I think if I wanted to go back to Slickables I'd need a few drinks in me after a near-midnight bar crawl along Mill Ave. This whole place just seemed kinda nasty!"}
{"text":"$2 FOR AN ICE CREAM SANDWICH. Guys! You get to pick your cookies, you can mix and match. Then you pick your ice cream....it's that simple."}
{"text":"UHMMM...where else does $2 get you so much delicious value? No where!

For $2 you get a satisfying cookie sandwich...and you can get two different cookies even, which makes it perfect for those who are indecisive.... =D But seriously though, the cookies are soft and chewy. The ice cream is great too. Add them two together = win. 

Oh yeah, they have other things too like shakes or something...haha, but why would you bother?"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST place for freshly baked cookie ice cream sandwiches! Baked Bear is overpriced and overrated. Support local businesses and delicious soft, chewy cookies that are baked fresh every hour! They also serve Thrifty ice cream, which is nostalgic for me and in my opinion, the best ice cream out there! You really can't beat a $2 ice cream sandwich! Unless you get their \"day old\" cookies by the register where you get 4 cookies for $1 (and they're still soft)! Check them out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm never in Tempe for anything really.  I'm not a huge fan of hanging out in Tempe.  While enjoying the Downtown Tempe Art Festival last Saturday I decided to grab a slice of pizza and a slickable for my first time.  I've had plenty of \"first times\" over the weekend.  Slickables from my understanding is the home of $2.00 ice cream sandwiches.  I loved freshly baked cookies, especially snickernoodles, chocolate cookies and peanut butter.  For the sake of my iced cream treat I went with 1 Snickerdoodle and 1 Sugar with Cookies and Cream ice cream.  A few hours later I also tried an old-fashioned Chocolate Chip cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream.  Yes, I tried 2 iced cream sandwiches in one day.  They were that damn good.  Near the cash register, there's a small bucket of 1 day young cookies (1-day old ) for only $1.00 a pack.  I didn't take advantage of that because I felt like I had enough.  Days later, as I'm writing this review I wish I would have taken advantage of grabbing a pack of cookies or 2.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream, great prices!  Quaint little ice cream shop. Our family of six each had a yummy dessert for under $20!"}
{"text":"Simple but tasty, a chewy cookie and quality ice cream. Mix and match your favorite flavors for a downhome comfort experience."}
{"text":"A $2.00 ice cream sandwich is a great deal already, but the friendly service bumps this up to a 5 star business for me. Sam and Tina are very warm and welcoming, they make my friends and I feel right at home everytime we stop in, which is quite frequently! The cookies are homemade and perfect for an ice cream sandwich; as some others have said, soft and chewy, yet holds up to a big chomp combined with the ice cream. Their brownie a la mode is really good too, and the tiramisu, while a little more expensive ($3.75) is delicious! Great to see a local business doing well, I will continue to support Slickables!"}
{"text":"There's a good chance I've died and gone to heaven. Soft, chewy cookies with a fresh scoop of creamy ice cream in the center... And you pick your flavor combination. You can't beat the price, too. I just might become a permanent resident of this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is a really great idea. It's $2 for a good cookies and ice cream.  I don't really think it matters that it's Dreyer's ice cream.  It tastes good and they advertise it all over the store so they aren't hiding anything.  The owners are very nice and my Reese's Cookie and chocolate ice cream was great."}
{"text":"yum yum! This place is cute and simple, nothing like baked bear. if you like normal ice cream flavors and delicious soft cookies, this is your place. Very simple and very delicious. Pictured is 1 snickerdoodle/1 peanut butter cookie, with mint chocolate chip ice cream."}
{"text":"Where else can you pick your own cookies and ice cream combo for $2. Amazing soft cookies and delicious ice cream!"}
{"text":"Great find and recommendation from our server at C.A.S.A. I tried a ice cream sandwich with strawberry ice cream and chocolate chip cookies, SO DELICIOUS! Ice cream was fantastic, not sure of the brand. Cookies were soft and chewy. Best dessert for $2.00 - next time I get a few to take home :)"}
{"text":"You cannot be serious okay let's talk about the good first  this place has a awesome setup really clean, and a nice welcoming atmosphere its trying to create a new modern appeal to Mill Ave but it lacks taste and originality I tried this place instead of my regular spot and thought the ice cream was something I could get from my own freezer not unique or homemade and the cookies I could of got at a local grocery store. The counter person was insistent that it was a cheap snack being $2.00 and all but I mentioned that it's not about quantity but much more about quality and I would pay more a product that was homemade."}
{"text":"Wow - this is some of the most affordable ice cream I've had out! For two scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone, my total was around $3, which is a steal compared to all the other places I've been back home! 

My ice cream was really good and the person working was kind, but there was only one person working, which made the wait a little longer than I'd like. But, overall great!"}
{"text":"This is one if my favorite dessert places to go to! Each ice-cream sandwich is only $2 & you can mix-and-match any 2 cookies which any ice-cream flavor. The cookies are soft & slightly chewy and the ice-cream flavors are really good sandwiched between them! My favorite combinations are the white chocolate macadamia cookie with the black cherry ice-cream or the red velvet cookie with the strawberry ice-cream."}
{"text":"HOLY CANOLI this place rocks!  The ice cream is pretty run of the mill but if you mix it with the deliciously chewy cookies, you're in heaven.  My toddler got a kick out of the \"bites\" on the chairs.  She kept staring at them.  Would love to come back again.  Definitely worth it ... and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best deal around. Two cookies and a scoop of ice cream for 2 bucks?! Plus it is the perfect helping. Not too much, not too little. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"They need to open a second location in Downtown Scottsdale ASAP.  $2 for a delicious ice cream sandwich.  Not to give them any ideas, but my girlfriend said she would have paid $4.50 for that awesome dessert.  YUM!"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite place on earth. Choose any 2 types of cookie and any of a dozen kinds of fantastic ice cream to make the best dessert of your life. And, it's only $2. Including tax. I would pay 5 times that for this level of bliss."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Every time I go into this ice cream shop, the staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. I always get the same things every time because it is so good. I get the ice cream sandwich. Apparently, you can mix up your cookies for the sandwich. The cookies are very fresh, and baked that day.

I did not give this place a five star because there is limited seating inside, and there will always be people that would just sit there without eating; since there are only two table to sit at."}
{"text":"Ice cream on homemade cookies, it's a winning combination.  I don't personally like it as much as Baked Bear but that certainly doesn't mean I disliked it.  The service was very prompt and very kind.  I have 5 kids so we're a walking circus wherever we go-so I always appreciate patience and no outward eye-rolling.  Yummy treat!"}
{"text":"The cookies are sooo good. They're chewy and have a ton of flavor. Their ice cream is soft and makes the taste buds dance. Not only do these sandwiches taste amazing, but your wallet loves them cause they're only $2.50!"}
{"text":"Bleh. I don't know how this place has such high ratings. I mean I guess it's pretty budget friendly but so is buying a pack of Chips Ahoy and a gallon of ice cream at the grocery store. And honestly Slickables tastes exactly like that. So you're better off replicating the cookie ice cream sandwiches at home for *even* cheaper!

People need to raise their standards for sweets in this town. These cookies were so unbelievably mediocre and the ice cream wasn't especially unique or flavorful. The cookies were hard, dry, and thin. The pictures people have posted may trick you into imagining that these cookies could be soft, warm, and thicker. Don't be fooled! You're getting exactly what you pay for. And then who would come here for just ice cream without the cookies?

Look at the higher star reviews for this place. They're all like \"2 dollars!\", which I get. The lesser star reviews are echoing the same sentiment as written here: why are the cookies so rock hard and dry and bland when Slickables brags about baking them fresh throughout the day?

I think because this place is popular with ASU students, it gets high ratings from that crowd. I'd have loved something like this in college. I would say if you're in your later 20s and have a little more to spend and a taste for quality beyond fast food level, skip this place."}
{"text":"Product is ok, prices are great, but lots of times when I've been here employees have not used gloves or hand washing properly. They handle money and then food right after without putting gloves on or washing hands. Not ok!! Also weird that they won't give you your ice cream while you wait in line for the cash register. If there's a long line your ice cream sits behind the counter until it's your turn to pay, a lot of times it'll be melted and falling apart by the time we get it. They could use a refresher in health codes."}
{"text":"Cookies, ice cream, reasonable price, good service...what's not to like?

Parking in the area is a pain, but it's not their fault.

The cookies had a good balance of being moist inside and enough of a crisp edge, although I prefer cookies in the crunchier side.

The ice cream was excellent. I actually also ordered a vanilla malt which was really, really great, especially because they added extra malted milk powder from the bottom of the Carnation can...nice!"}
{"text":"Fresh cookies and giant scoop of ice cream! Terrific and for 2 bucks totally worth a visit if you are on Mill. Hot coco was also good. Not much seating but take it to go."}
{"text":"This place was bomb. And cheap! Rye cookies and brownies are fresh. I don't like ice cream but u brought one anyway in a brownie. What the heck it was like 3 bucks. Next time when I come back I'm just straight buying cookies. More my style :)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this spot! 

Ice cream cookie sandwich is only $2.50 dlls! (Cheaper than the competition on the same street)

A lot of delicious ice cream flavors with a great variety of fresh baked cookie selection.

It has 3 tables with chairs to sit and enjoy your piece of heaven and 2 benches outside whenever the weather is not scorching hot.

Seriously you wont regret it. Hit me up if you go, I am always looking for an excuse to go. Lol"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hit up after a show at Gammage. You can walk down Mill and get a delectable ice cream sandwich big enough for two people to share-- all for $2! By the time you enjoy your tasty treat, the parking lot has cleared out, you can avoid the headache of leaving Gammage at night.

I've been here a couple times now, and I've gotten the double chocolate cookie both times. It's so good, and the texture is just right for an ice cream sandwich. I like the ice cream (got pb cup and cookies and cream), but I wish there was a few more flavors. I also wish there was water cups available for customers, but for $2 I can live with it."}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy! Their cookies are actually chewy! I loooove chewy cookies! So this place definitely gets 5 stars for their quick service and quality of ice cream and cookies!"}
{"text":"How can you not love Slickables?  Fresh cookies with ice cream in the middle. Perfect!  $2 so it's damn cheap and also to you can buy the day old cookies at a discount."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Where can you get a $2 cookie and ice cream sandwich (your choice of 2 cookies and the ice cream flavors) AND be downtown in the middle of a trendy college area?....Slickables!!  

Give them a try.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Ice cream and cookies. That's a sure fire win!  They need more seating and better lighting. It was a little depressing with the dull lighting and the homeless lady outside blocking the only available bench to sit on. Can't change the homeless squatting spots but the indoor lighting could be a quick fix to liven the place up."}
{"text":"I had seen their competitor on the news, so I drove way up north to that location...and I was disappointed...then when on mill ave, I saw this place...and at first was skeptical, but I gave it a shot...better prices, better quality product, over al better experience..and it is way closer to my home...I will go here every time I am in mill ave, guarentee"}
{"text":"The ice cream sandwiches were surprisingly delicious. I had the snickerdoodle, chocolate chip cookies with mint chip"}
{"text":"This spot is a dope spot to come to. Like if you want a simple ice cream and cookie this is the spot to go.  They have  like 12 ice creams to choose from and like tons of cookies also. They have 50 cent cookies that's the price and a scoop of ice cream is 2 dollars for 2.50 you get 2 cookies and in between an ice cream scoop. The place is in a college town and ASU IS RIGHT there so many student defiantly go there. For the price you cannot go wrong for a dessert cookies and ice cream. Honestly there snicker doodle cookies are off the chart. The guy at the front is super nice and they get busy but there super quick with getting to your order. Overall such a nice spot to go and they have other choices also like brownies and blondes which are a type of brownies. We went late night they close at 12 am so when you go you have plenty of time to go enjoy your day and know this spot is open. When I come back to Phoenix I will definitely be visiting there for sure and enjoy some warm cookies and some scoops of ice cream for cheap and super awesome."}
{"text":"After dining at another restaurant we were looking for dessert, we came across this place and were not disappointed.  For just $2 you get 2 freshly made cookies and a scoop of ice cream.  A great dessert choice indeed!"}
{"text":"All you need to know is $2 for an ice cream sandwich! 

The staff was friendly, it's easy to get to, and it's clean. There is not a lot of seating but we were lucky and grabbed a bench out front. 

I grabbed a double chocolate chip cookie and a chocolate chip cookie with coffee ice cream sandwiched in the middle. The cookies are soft and chewy. It was a perfect afternoon treat :-)"}
{"text":"Even though Dreyer's ice cream is available everywhere, it seems to taste better between two fresh baked cookies. You can even get two different cookie flavors and my choice was double choc. chip and red velvet. Peanut Butter cup ice cream was placed in the middle and off to Mill we go to eat as I walked past the hobo drawing photos nearby. Great sandwich to eat while walking, nice staff member and a great deal for 2 bucks."}
{"text":"place is yummy! $1.50 ice cream is a steal and at $2.00 for an ice cream sandwhich everyone should be screaming for ice cream!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat this place for the past two dollar custom made ice cream sandwich.you're able to pick the cookie type and ice cream."}
{"text":"Went to Stickables for the first time ever, today! For $2.50 I was able to get the most awesome customized ice cream sandwich! I got two double chocolate cookies with a scoop of chocolate ice cream, and it was absolutely amazing! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This idea is not revolutionary; a lot of places offer ice cream sandwiches (Diddy Reese, Cream, the Baked Bear). What makes Slickables so amazing is the PRICE. This is the cheapest place I've been to and the quality of the cookies and ice cream is just as good as other shops. You can't beat the price and for that, I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great little munchies!! But let me tell you about my experience last night. Myself and three other friends are sitting Inside having a great time, when all of a sudden the Asian girl turns out the lights! We're like \"so your closing?\" She responds \"it's midnight\" with a fuckin attitude. I'm thinkin in my head \"welcome to the service industry\". I guess I'm just mad cause when I have guests at tables I wait till they are done"}
{"text":"The ice cream sandwiches here are very good and I can see why it is their signature item. I decided on two kinds of cookies for the sandwich which in hindsight I probably should have only gone with one choice. For only $2 this was an unbelievable deal and it was quite good. There's not much seating inside but as this place is quite small it would be better to eat the ice cream sandwich on Mill Ave instead.

The location is good on Mill Ave and the prices are great. I would like to come back next time to try their milkshakes as well."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Got two bucks cash and a need for an ice cream sandwich? This is the place to be.

My friend and I come here about once a week to get our fix and never leave disappointed. Even the one time we got there just after closing, on my friend's birthday, they opened the door and allowed us to buy their last creations of the night. 

Couldn't be happier to have Slickables on Mill!"}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive.  I had the chocolate chip cookies with rocky road in the middle.  A nice treat and good addition to Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Cute little shop on mill ave. Simple shop serving up some delicious ice cream sandwiches with your choice of cookies. 

Cookies were soft and you can mix up each end of the cookie sand which. Love ice cream and cookies?!! This is the spot. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Took our little ones out for some ice cream after dinner. You can choose your cookies and ice cream type and they make you a cookie/ice cream sandwich for $2 - seriously, you can't beat it - they could definitely get a way with charging more. The cookies (probably not homemade) are pretty good without the ice cream too. The service is friendly. Parking is tough in this area. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I understand the concept of this place: ice cream in between cookies. It's not a new concept, but the quality of the service and cookies really stand out. Brownie is super fresh, mint chip ice cream is delish, and price is decent. I will be back."}
{"text":"A luxury hotel vendor treated us to these at work today. Amazing! Ice cream is my Achilles Heal and these do not disappoint. I can't wait to stop in soon with my kids."}
{"text":"A quick and affordable dessert spot near ASU! We had a good dinner next door at La Bocca and wanted something sweet after. The price is right here - we got two build-your-own-ice cream sandwiches for $5. I loved my white chocolate macadamia nut cookie choice; you can mix and match and select your own ice cream flavor, too. The combos are endless. Tasty and affordable and convenient - would return!"}
{"text":"I was in town for ASU's graduation and was looking for a sweet treat to beat the summer heat. We stumbled upon this place on Mill Avenue. This place serves up milkshakes and scoops, but are best known for their ice cream sandwiches. 

The cookies are fresh and soft, and ice cream is Thrifty's brand. You can also mix cookies. Not bad for $2 a pop!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. They even gave me change for the parking meter. Had the salted Carmel pretzel shake and it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Excellent taste, cookies, brownies, ice creams.
Price is $2 to 3
Mix and match. Yummy"}
{"text":"Came over after taking a walk around the lake.  If you're craving cookies and ice cream then this is your joint.  Not a huge selection of cookies or ice cream and the joint is small."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and it's always great, especially since it's so hot in AZ. The cookies are always soft. I love the double chocolate ones. The employees are really nice and for $2 the ice cream sandwiches can't be beat."}
{"text":"As a college student, I'm a huge fan of the value play.  Oftentimes, this means I sacrifice flavor for cost.  At Slickables, this could not be further from the truth.  For $2.50 you get a fantastic dessert.  Delicious baked cookies around a large scoop of an ice cream flavor of your choice.  No matter what you pick, you can't go wrong.  I wish they had one in South Bend."}
{"text":"$2 big ice cream cookie sandwiches... it doesn't get much better than that. You can choose two different cookies from five or so options. Theres also about eight ice cream flavor choices. Its not the best ice cream I've ever had, but its delicious and certainly worth the $2."}
{"text":"Come on; how do they do this for $2? You have several choices of decent ice cream that can be served between two worthwhile cookies. It was really good, $4 each would still have been a bargain."}
{"text":"Just had my first taste!  Amazazing!  Totally worth every single calorie.

Just sayin though, the shop was a bit hot considering it's an ice cream place...."}
{"text":"The ice creams taste so rich and the cookies are very freshly baked. Couldn't resist but to get another. It is so cheap for the quality you get. Plus, the staff were super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Da BOMB.
I'm torn between this place & the baked near because they are both sooo delicious. I want to think that because the portions aren't huuuge that the calories aren't either but let's face it,  an Ice cream sandwich AND 5 Cookies are gonna add I'm quick. #yolo & #cardio doe. I'll be black, stay white there"}
{"text":"It's good to see a small local business doing it right!  Great concept, simple menu and straight forward pricing.  Also lets not forget their great ice cream sandwiches - they aren't fancy, they aren't huge, and they aren't expensive.  Both the cookies and ice cream are of great quality and taste (even though my wife made me get the frozen yogurt instead of the ice cream).

For an even $2 ($2.19 if you use your credit card) you get a quality treat from a husband and wife team (I think) that are happy to have your business.  I shutter to think about how many ice cream sandwiches they have to sell to make the rent on that place, but I wish them luck.  The next time I am strolling down Mill I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Um... who knew the best dessert I'd ever have was two cookies and a scoop of ice cream?!?! It was AMAZING. You get to choose your ice cream and then your cookies - everything from chocolate and chocolate chip to peanut butter, snickerdoodle, m&ms and more. They were soooo delish i can't wait to go back to Tempe for another one! if you're anywhere near the area you MUST go!"}
{"text":"Exactly what many others have said.  $2 for a fresh ice cream sandwich?  $1.50 for an ice cream scoop.  Total bargain!!!  The service was quick and friendly.

I tried the chocolate chip cookies (mmm... soft and delicious) with the peanut butter cup ice cream.  Really, I ate the whole thing even though I felt like I was going to throw up because I was so full.  

A winner in my book!  I hope they stay open forever so we can make it a regular dessert place."}
{"text":"This place makes bomb ass ice cream sandwiches!  Such a simple menu I love it, $2.50 For two cookies sandwiched around a choice of ice cream, genius!"}
{"text":"I was walking around South Mill Ave and I ran into this place. This place is an absolute gem. For $2 you can get the ice cream sandwich of your choosing. You can pick the cookies and the type of ice cream. This place is worth every penny and it was very tasty! You will walk out satisfied. If only I had more time in Tempe. I will definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a great little gem in a great big world. This place is happiness for just $2. You are greeted by the smell of warm baked cookies wherein you get to choose two of them to embody your choice of ice cream resulting in your own custom ice cream sandwich. Two yummy cookies, a heaping scoop of ice cream and a belly full of joy again for just $2. What a great way to top off dinner"}
{"text":"I personally don't like ice-cream cookie sandwiches, so I will just review their cookies: delicious. I think the best deals are the $2 ice-cream cookie sandwich, and a bag of day old cookies for $1. Staff is always friendly and service is quick when they're not too busy."}
{"text":"What can I say.  My two favorite deserts served together.  How can I be disappointed.  the service is great too."}
{"text":"Overall, the store itself is a little small but that isn't really a big deal . My issue is with the fact that they sell store bought pre packaged ice cream. The cookies were very average. You're better off buying Chips Ahoy cookies and Blue Bell or Tillamook ice cream from the store. I personally don't see the point of selling something I could buy at Safeway for cheaper. It takes away from the concept of them selling reasonably priced ice cream sandwiches if I can make the same thing for much less. The people working there were nice though."}
{"text":"I was introduced to the beauty of this place by my roommate. It's hands down my favorite sweet treat to get while on Mill ave. delicious cookie and ice cream sandwiches and you get to customize the sandwich with whatever type of cookies and ice cream you want. They're also only $2, can't beat that price! I recommend that you try it if you're in the mood for something sweet!"}
{"text":"This ice cream sandwich place rocks!!!!! So cheap and amazingly tasty! :) friendly staff. I recommend chocolate chip cookies. Mint chocolate chip ice cream. Yummy."}
{"text":"I DON'T CARE (if it's 500 calories) I LOVE IT!

This place is great and is a fantastic value.  

$2 for a made to order Ice cream sandwich on your choice of really good cookies and whatever ice cream you want?? 
 
For $2???  

Insanity.


They also have $3.50 shakes that look fantastic!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and chose to go here because of the outstanding ratings. They have a good assortment of cookies and ice cream flavors to choose from. I got the ice cream sandwich and it was so good, be warned that it can get messy. The prices are really good and definitely worth it. The staff was alright. It's so good to get an ice cream sandwich on a very hot day in Arizona. Overall, this place is great and I highly recommend it if you like ice cream and cookies."}
{"text":"My sister in law recommended this place. She knows I seek out the best ice cream joints on any vacation or work trip. This was an interesting concept as you pick out two cookines and then the ice cream to sandwich in between. The service was excellent, even though we had 11 people. Loved the concept and ice cream was good as well. Will be back when in Tempe area!"}
{"text":"I walked by Slickable's many times, and wasn't allured by the cookie display enough to merit a purchase, although eventually I managed to pull myself in to try an ice cream sandwich.
Despite how the cookies appear dry and generically standard, they went down surprisingly well, especially with the ice cream. I had a caramel ice cream with the caramel-chocolate cookies."}
{"text":"This newcomer to Mill Ave. is a perfect addition.  $2 for an ice cream sandwich??  Unbeatable.  They also sell 4 backs of their \"day young\" cookies for a buck.

The owners are extremely helpful, welcoming, and friendly.  They have done their best to get involved with the community.   I would definitely recommend trying this place out and supporting this new business :)"}
{"text":"2 buck ice cream sandwich wooooowzers!
\"Declared the best ice cream sandwich\"
I went to Tempe for work related and walked around downtown and had lunch and saw this small shop.  I am a fan of fresh baked cookies and ice cream in the middle.  Soft fresh baked cookies and a cold sweet center is mind blowing.  I ordered a Snickerdoodle and Macadamia nut with white chocolate cookie with Cookies N Cream so delicious.  The ice cream they use was not some generic it was Dryers! yum yum yum.!!!

Well worth $2

**cash only**

**parking**

Street parking or parking structures."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places when I want cookies and ice cream. It's so cheap, only 2 dollars for a sandwich. This place is amazing and it has a good variety of choices!"}
{"text":"Awesome, cheap desserts! High quality and very tasty as well. Hard to beat for the price!"}
{"text":"So delicious and super cheap. My favorite combo is cookie dough ice cream with a funfetti cookie on one side and a snickerdoodle cookie on the other. The concept is super easy, the staff is nice and it's $2.50. Oh and the cookies are always soft! 

If you like ice cream sandwiches you really can't go wrong here.

*I eat mine with a spoon. Probably a weirdo but it's easier for me that way."}
{"text":"This is the original Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich shop on Mill and at least as good as the competition for much less.  Family owned and great customer service.  I'm still in shock how they keep their price soooooooo low.  Great variety of ice cream and cookie  flavors.  Simply the Best.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Only $2 for ice cream and two cookies of your choice! The cookies were fresh and had several ice cream choices. Gotta love eating ice cream sandwiches while listening to live music on Mill."}
{"text":"How do you pass up a $2 Ice Cream Sandwich?! Easily, you don't! For only $2 you get two decently sized cookies (of which, you can mix and match any two!), and a huge scoop of ice cream (also, of your choosing).

I will say, the taste of the cookies and ice cream are not, by any means, the highest of quality... but can you really go wrong for just $2?? Probably not! It was a delicious little treat and worth going to!"}
{"text":"Nice little ice cream shop on Mill Avenue. Cookies were OK, not great, a little hard, but maybe that helps when you're making a big ice cream sandwich with them. Ice cream was good. Nice place. We had a good time and service was good and we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap ! 
They cookies are soft and taste fresh also.
I recommend if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Visited this place around a hot summer nights. I have to admit this. The price for the quality of ice cream you get here is mind blowing.

I probably would have tried like 4 scoops all different flavors for under $10. Would love to try this place again and again."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Maybe I came on a bad day, but the cookie I got was so doughy and just flavorless. Took a bite and tossed it. The brownie my friend got was okay-better than the cookie but still forgettable. Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Perfectly made ice cream cookie sandwiches! This place is a sweet tooth's paradise. The cookies are large, fresh, and tasty. The ice cream is scrumpdidlyumptious. And for the $2 a pop...slickables is a dream come true. I wish there were more places like this in the east coast. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Small little ice cream shop and the prices aren't that bad either, very affordable. I like how we can choose 2 different cookies to make an ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and CHEAP! Which is the best part! I got a double chocolate chip cookie sandwich with coffee ice cream in the middle. So good!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Good ice cream- it's a mix of Dreyers, Blue bell and one other ice cream. Open late which is great! Also have Sparkling ICE zero cal water- SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"How can you pass up a 2 dollar yes you heard me right a 2 dollar ice cream sandwich on Mill.  You can pick two different flavors of cookies if you want or two of the same.  There are quite a few choices of creamy ice cream that goes between the soft cookies.  The couple are lovely.  

I love the simple decor but mostly I the chairs crack me up.  It looks like there is a bite taken out of the chair.  I loved that because when the boys were little and I made their lunch I always took a bite out of their sandwiches before packing them.  My way of saying I love you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - I think my boyfriend and I had talked about going for months before we finally went a couple weeks ago!! 

It's so cheap, $2 for an ice cream sandwich!!! I would pay at least $4.50 but who complains about reasonable prices??? You can choose any two flavor of cookies and they have a good variety (I love the double chocolate cookie) and whatever ice cream to go in the middle. The cookies are fresh and soft!! 

It's such a yummy and inexpensive treat!! Go and don't wait a couple months like we did!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Worth giving a try, reasonable price. Ice cream sandwich cookie is best."}
{"text":"Had Slickables yesterday for the first time and I was very pleased.  I got the chocolate chip cookies with cookie dough ice cream and my boyfriend had red velvet cookies with strawberry cheesecake chunk ice cream. We both enjoyed them very much. The cookies were fresh baked and absolutely delicious. The price is more than reasonable for what you get. The employees were super friendly and the store was very neat and clean.  I'm sure we'll be going there again soon."}
{"text":"I work right above this shop and its the perfect pick me up snack.  The staff here is extra friendly and always greet customers with a smile.  The desserts are HUGE and delicious.  :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a yummy summer treat come check out Slickables.  $2 for a Homemade cookie and Ice cream sandwich that is delicious! If you're in the area near ASU main campus it's located on Mill and 7th street."}
{"text":"Good concept, average execution. I had a brownie with mint ice cream while my friend tried the ice cream sandwich with one chocolate chip and one double chocolate cookie with chocolate ice cream. We both felt that the (homemade) cookies were mediocre and the ice cream wasn't anything special. 

It would have been two stars for the good idea and poor result, but each sandwich is only $2 so you are getting a large treat for the price. Next time I'm in Tempe I'll choose somewhere else for ice cream- there's about 5 other places on Mill Ave alone"}
{"text":"It's located on 7th and Mill next to the Steak and Shake. We had a bit of a hard time finding it at first because of the small shop with a small sign but we found it eventually! 

We have something similiar in Las Vegas so it's not new to me at least the idea, not sure who was first butttttttt this place was pretty good! 

Pick two cookies and your ice cream and then you get an AWESOME ice cream sandwich. I think the best part is that it costed $2 for it! So you get both deliciousness and it doesn't cost you much for it, can't ask for more! 

The cookies were delicious! And made fresh in the store. They use Thrifty ice cream which was pretty good. I actually kind of like their ice cream, but I love home made ice creams better."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! You really cannot go wrong with $2 ice cream sandwiches. Also, the cookies are always fresh and just slightly soft, nothing too hard or crunchy which I like. They have delish ice cream flavor options, and you can pick any combination of cookies / ice creams.

Amazingly good for just $2, fun for a date night dessert!"}
{"text":"$2 for a dessert out? It has to be an error. I can now tell you it is not.  My family and stopped by tonight in search of this $2 dessert I have heard about and it was all I hoped for. For a total of a little over $8 I was able to buy three ice cream sandwich desserts and a large water. Wow! What a deal! I just can not see how they can keep the doors open with that price point, but I hope they keep it going. For the ice cream sandwich, I went with mint ice cream slammed between a chocolate chip cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. The cookies were perfectly soft and had good favor and the ice cream was decent and served its purpose.  The size of the sandwich was not huge but perfect for a nice treat. The service and process was fast an efficient with no complaints to note. I would for sure visit again. Is tomorrow to soon?"}
{"text":"This place was pretty chill and the price point is amazing considering the other one I have been to similar ( all in San Diego). The only sad part was they had no gluten free cookies so I was only able to get a scoop of ice cream but my friends all said their cookie sandwiches were magical."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. I love ice cream and I love cookies. I do wish the cookies were softer as I thought it was a little hard to bite into the sandwich like a normal ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Tonight I went in to get my favorite combination of a double chocolate chip cookie and a peanut butter cookie with peanut butter cup ice cream. The guy working was really condescending when telling me that peanut butter cup ice cream ice cream has been discontinued for TWO YEARS! I know that's a lie because I came to Slickables a year ago. I didn't get any ice cream and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream sandwiches. Like really delicious. I first had Slickables at a festival and the pre-made ice cream sandwiches were so good. I had to go back for more.The store made ones were even better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Slickables - ice cream sandwiched between two cookies!? For only $2!? Who could say no? Unfortunately, you really get what you pay for. This is probably a super popular spot for ASU college students, and I'm sure it is packed on warm nights when everyone is out on Mill, but I'm sad to say that the quality is not that great. To me, quality is far more important than the price, and in this case they just didn't get that right. It satisfied the craving but I'll stick with Sweet Republic for my ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"Slickables is the people's champ and I fundamentally don't trust anyone who rates this place less than 5 stars. Endless combinations of fresh cookies and good ice cream. No, it's not the best ice cream you've ever had but at $2.50 Slickables far exceeds expectations. Now all they gotta do is come up with a better name for their business."}
{"text":"Nice people good cookies and Dreyers ice cream. Great combo. Go snicker doodle with dulce de leche."}
{"text":"I am always a sucker for ice cream and cookies. Who isn't? Well what if I told you that you could have both at the same time for only $2 bucks? Even better right? Not only do you get to pick the flavor of ice cream that goes in between the cookies but you also get to pick the cookie flavors you want on the outside. That's right, flavors. They have several cookie trays with different flavors and you get to pick which two cookies you want with your ice cream. I don't think I really need to say any more. Just go and try one!"}
{"text":"Nice little ice cream spot to try out near ASU's campus.

If you have ever been to Diddy Riese near UCLA, you will probably find this place very similar. 

Parking around the area is mostly street, and it's pretty busy around there, so you may be searching for a little while if you're driving.

The service was friendly. There was no line outside when we went, but this was on a weekday, so that may not be the norm. The inside is nice and cool (welcome relief to the 90+ heat outside at night). There are a couple tables inside to sit at, but no outside spots.

They have ice cream sandwich's for $2, which I think is the same as Diddy Riese (DR). Individual cookies are $0.75 each. The cookies were good. Nice and soft. Selection was also pretty comparable to DR in terms of cookies and ice cream, although it did seem a little more limited. 

Overall, great place to grab an ice cream sandwich in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with Slickables. I currently live down in Tucson, but any time I head up to the Phoenix area, I HAVE to make a Slickables stop. Literally every time. It's cheap ($2) but so satisfying. You can get any combination of ice creams and cookies you want. So good."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I noticed that Slickables served Thrifty ice cream. I honestly didn't know how I felt at first. I came here to try something new, but Thirty ice cream makes me nostalgic of my childhood since that is were my mom and I used to go together all the time in San Diego. I have nothing bad to say about the ice cream. Thirty ice cream will always be good and dependable. 

What I like about this place is that they could have marked the prices up on their product, especially their ice cream sandwiches, but they didn't. For $1.50 a scoop or $2.50 an ice cream sandwich, you are on your way to a good dessert. If your not looking for ice cream, you can buy the cookies alone or brownies. I didn't see how much the brownies were, but the cookies are $0.50. I appreciate a company that is not greedy. It says a lot about the owners.

The cookies were nothing special, but it provided a nice little crunch with my ice cream. I ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with my rockie road ice cream. Sometimes, chocolate ice cream is too much for me so the cookie helps break it up a little for me."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

I was invited to spend the day with my friend, Dr. Mel and her 11 year old son, Errol, on Mill Avenue in Tempe. 

Our first stop was Umami for ramen. It was a super cute place, hard to find, with weird hours, and now I see it has since closed down.

Next stop was Slickables, mostly to settle down her son, Errol, but it sounded super fun.

SLICKABLES

Slickables is right on Mill Avenue and has the iconic oversized Chocolate, Strawberry and Vanilla giant cones. (see pic)

Apparently, Slickables opened in early 2012, by Sam Chang and Tina Chau, to quite a bit of competition, according to the New Times. Their article claimed that Slickables was competing against \"old guard\"  Cookiez on Mill Avenue, as well as a third contender, Sparky's (which was a former Cold Stone Creamery with the iconic marble slab left behind). Although all three locations had other various things to offer, it all came down to who could make THE best ice cream sandwich.

The Challenge: 
Having The Best Ice Cream Sandwich.   

The ultimate ice cream sandwich came down to:

The Cookies: The cookies had to be original, creative and fresh. They also had to lack a \"crumble factor\" and a \"squish factor.\"

The Ice Cream: The ice cream had to be original, creative and fresh. Also, a generous scoop should not make the cookies crumble nor squish with biting down. 

At the end of the day, neither Cookiez nor Sparky's could match Slickables perfect ice cream sandwich, which apparently avoids the \"Squish Syndrome\" by having the cookies about as soft as the ice cream. Slickables became the Mill Avenue winner!

The Concept:
Make a custom $2 ice cream sandwich:

1. Pick any two cookies. 
Choices include: Chocolate Chip, Double Chocolate, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Red Velvet, Mint Chip, Snickerdoodle, Peanut Butter and Funfetti. 

2. Pick the ice cream.
Choices include: Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Mint Chip, Cookies and Cream, Cookie Dough, Rocky Road, Coffee, Strawberry Cheesecake Chunk, and Butter Pecan.

3. Assembly! Which they do for you! Enjoy!

THE STORY 

Me, Dr. Mel, and Errol enjoyed tasting the various flavors, watching them make our sandwiches, and most of all they were scrumptious. It was an especially nice afternoon to sit out on a bench on Mill Avenue and people watch whilst eating them. I can't remember seeing any place to eat them inside, other than standing room at the front.

CONCLUSION 

The concept is cute, the selection is good, the ice cream sandwiches were very good and the price is right.

{"text":"Love this cute place. The cookies are always soft and delicious. It is also super cheap too which is a plus!!! Awesome. Great dessert."}
{"text":"What a fun gem we discovered while walking along Mill Ave.  The ice cream sandwiches were wonderful!  We had two: one with white chocolate macadamia nuts filled with pasticho ice cream and then (with help from the woman behind the counter) the red velvet cookies filled with cherry ice cream.  For $2 each you cannot beat this great dessert place!  We'll be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Was hanging out with my daughters and grandkids and they wanted some ice cream, so off to Slickables we went.

This place is yummy!

They take fresh baked cookies, or brownies and mush ice cream between to the 2 to make the perfect ice cream sandwich!

I think I picked the perfect cookie/ice cream combo out the group, went with snickerdoodle cookie and salted caramel ice cream! Yummy!

Oh and these sweet treats are under 3 bucks! So go get you some!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

LOVE THIS PLACE! $2 for freshly baked cookies with delicious ice cream in sandwich form. I absolutely love the concept of being able to customize your ice cream sandwich. 

My favorite part is that you can also get everything \"to-go.\" Ice cream gets packed in a container, and the cookies go into a sleeve, and then you can assemble at home.

PS: They sell day old cookies 4 for $1. You couldn't even tell they were a day old."}
{"text":"This is the best ice cream sandwich I've ever had. I came here twice in one weekend.

Service is nice. Prices are fantastic. I wish I could come here more often.

The chocolate chip cookies are perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap ice cream sandwiches. Two bucks for a great and filling dessert is awesome!! Will return over and over again."}
{"text":"We go here often. The ice cream is nothing out of the ordinary. Very simple, quick and cheap!"}
{"text":"$2 ice cream sandwiches? Can't beat that! Tried this place out for the first time with my boyfriend and I loved it! Decided to get the traditional vanilla bean ice cream sandwiched in between two chocolate chip cookies! My boyfriend got the chocolate chip cookies with the Oreo ice cream. Cookies are baked fresh and the atmosphere is inviting along with friendly staff! Definitely returning"}
{"text":"I love love love the ice cream sandwiches at Slickables. They are made with two fresh baked cookies, with many flavored to choose from. An amazing treat for only $2."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided to get some ice cream after the Heat-Spurs game. So, we decided to come here and they sell cookie ice cream sandwiches (genius idea) and they had brownies. Been here a few times before and it never disappoints. This time I got the peanut butter and mint chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream Other selections I noticed there was of course chocolate chip, red velvet, sugar, snicker doodle. and white macadamia. It was really good and hit the spot for desert. 

There was only one person working there when we went and she was great. She was courteous and very polite so that made the experience complete! The location is a really good too seeing how there are so many restaurants it would always be a good spot to give your sweet tooth some satisfaction. Also, when we walked in there was no one, but as we got done ordering and sat down people just kept coming in the the bunches. I'll be back and next time I'll make sure to get brownies and ice cream."}
{"text":"This is quite the deal: two dollars plus tax for two soft cookies and ice cream made into a sandwich.  They have about a dozen differing types of ice cream and cookies.  Limited seating. A great treat if you are on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"$2 ice cream sandwiches?  Yes please!  OMG!  My favorite one is the birthday ice cream with red velvet cookies.  They also serve brownies.  It's my favorite place to go to on Mill Avenue (that's not a loud bar).  Slickables makes all my dreams come true with their bright atmosphere, fast line, nice employees, and delicious affordable ice cream sandwiches!"}
{"text":"$2 fresh made ice cream sandwiches?! Yes please!

Positives:
You get to choose from a variety of fresh baked cookies and pair it with an ice cream of your choice.  The cookies are perfectly soft and chewy. I got the white chocolate macadamia cookies with the salted caramel ice cream. Wow was it good! It was a great size as well. 

I can't believe it was only $2?!?! All three of us got one and a huge water for $8!! They are really doing something right here.. Serving a quality dessert at a price like that? Yes and thank you!"}
{"text":"Saw Slicksbles while walking around after dinner. Despite being full from my dinner, I still had room in my dessert stomach to give these cookie ice cream sandwiches a try.

I opted for a sandwich with a funfetti and snickerdoodle cookie. Inside, I requested cookie dough ice cream. 

Each cookie was perfectly baked and soft. Not too soft where it broke apart while taking a bite, though. 

The cookie dough ice cream was absolutely delicious with the perfect cookie dough to chocolate chip ratio. It wasn't too sweet and balanced the cookies perfectly. 

The service was great, we were greeted with a warm and welcoming smile. 

Slickables is perfect for a sweet indulgence."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place I wish we had one here in Dallas. I got two snickerdoodle cookies with the strawberry cheesecake ice cream. They were generous with the ice cream and it was really delicious. I would gladly pay more than $2.00 for this, but I appreciate that they keep their prices affordable! 

The staff was super friendly as well! I will definitely visit the next time I come to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for good ice cream. I go here a lot. The prices are just right. I buy from here a few times a week. You can't beat $2.50 for an ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. I can definitely say I will continue to go back. My favorite is the mint chocolate chip ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies. The service is always fast and the employees are so friendly. You cannot beat the price. Two dollars? Is this real life. Thankfully it is."}
{"text":"If simple things make you happy, this place is 5 stars. 

Homemade cookies not too sweet, ice cream on temp, all the basic flavors - only $2.50"}
{"text":"I'm a value guy and this place is fantastic value. Two cookies and a whole single dip of ice cream for $2. You can't beat that. The cookies were great but the ice cream is brought in from elsewhere, which is why I couldn't give this 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yes, ice cream sandwiches made to order.  Love them!  Highly recommended and affordable."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and it was really good, especially for $2. The cookies didn't look all that amazing at first, but upon actually eating them, they were soft and were perfect with the ice cream. Will come again many times."}
{"text":"We've come to the Mill Ave location a few times. Late at night, after lunch, and around dinner time. Every time the service has been fast and the workers were friendly. 
Our kids love this place and I love the price! Every cookie and brownie we've had was soft and yummy! It's a great portion for the price!"}
{"text":"Cool concept and low prices. I was expecting the cookies to be soft baked so that was kind of a let down. The sandwiches are hard to eat as is and ended up just using a spoon. Anyway, cute place to try when you want ice cream."}
{"text":"Slickables is excellent.  Cheap, good, and perfect for 100 degree weather.  The cookies were soft, the ice cream plentiful and tasty, the service fast, and best of all? Like everyone else mentioned, CHEAP!  As good as it gets, and it's always fun bringing an ice cream sandwich into a bar.  Someone is going to head out and buy one for himself as well."}
{"text":"$2.00 ice cream sandwich. NEED I say more?!

Located towards the south end of Mill in downtown Tempe, just north of the shell that used to be Borders. This place is awesome. We were greeted by the owner when we walked into this tiny shop, and she is super nice. We asked ourselves, \"Do we want a couple scoops in a cup or a cone or *suddenly distracted* $2.00 ice cream sandwich?! Sold.\" For 2 bucks you have your choice of 2 cookies and a large scoop of Dreyers ice cream, they do the rest. AND the tax is rolled into the price! Its literally *just* 2 dollars! The rest of my group went w/ typical choices ( 2 chocolate chip cookies w/ a scoop of peanut butter cup ice cream, 2 mint chip cookies w/ mint chocolate chip ice cream, etc) but Im a daredevil. A wild card. I opted for a snickerdoodle, and mint chip as the bases for my creation w/ a scoop of rocky road in the middle. The cookies aer all homemade, delicious, and super soft and chewy. Paired w/ Dreyers ice cream (Edys for you east coast transplants), its definitely a winner."}
{"text":"It was more of a 3.5 experience for me, but I rounded down, sowwy slickable.

The Pros:
-super cheap
-wide variety of cookies and ice-cream flavors to choose from
-opens late to serve college students' need for late-night sugar boosts

The Cons:
-the cookies were nothing spectacular, maybe it's because we went late at night?
-ice creams were oookay, not that creamy, nothing too memorable
(Sorry, Dieddy Reise in LA ruined my standards)


Overall, it was the best dessert $2 can get us, so I cannot complain! I can see Slickable being very popular with the ASU students and restaurant easters on Mill, but I personally would not make the drive out to Phoenix for this spot."}
{"text":"My sister told me this is a must have while on Mill Street. I was stuffed from lunch, but said sure. I enjoyed every bite! If I was actually not stuffed, it probably would have been even better. 

$2.00!!! What a value. 

We both got the cookie sandwich. My first thought was the cookies are so soft, there is no way I would be able to eat it as a sandwich. I was wrong. It was perfect, refreshing on a hot day, and when I am back in town another visit."}
{"text":"The price of $2 is fabulous for a treat and the woman that put together my order was friendly and helpful, so these aspects should garner a higher rating, but the blandness of the cookies (one chocolate chip and one peanut butter) and the ice cream were a major disappointment. If I'm going to consume the (I assume high-ish) calories, I want to be wowed by the flavors. 

I recommend giving this place a try anyway because everyone has different tastes and it seems like a lot of people like this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I repeat, this place is amazing.  We searched yelp for \"cheap dessert place\" because we wanted to treat my nieces without having to work overtime.  

Two of us got cookies with ice cream, one just ice cream, and one brownie and ice cream.  All different kinds of ice cream...sorry I can't remember which ones now...but four different kinds and we were all pleased!  

The cookies were soft and fresh, and I thought there was no way the brownie could compare. It did!  It was just as fresh and delicious.  

Great place to stop in and have a restaurant quality (better than, in most cases) dessert without going to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars rounded up. Slickables is simple, choose your cookie and your ice cream, pay, eat. It's cheap and delicious with freshly baked cookies and Dreyers ice cream, I just wish the interior was more put together... it isn't very inviting or well decorated."}
{"text":"Pretty good considering the low price. The cookies and ice cream sandwiches are great and the menu is simple. So far, haven't been disappointed and the employees have been friendly. Will definitely be back whenever I feel like I need an ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Pros: came in on an impulse. My sister loved this place, she wanted to come back the next day. We got the white chocolate cookie with salted caramel ice cream. Priced so cheap, how do they even turn a profit? Accepts credit cards. 

Cons: street parking"}
{"text":"Wow!  EXTREMELY delicious!  And what a price!  $2 ice cream sandwich, and $3.50 for a brownie with ice cream!  EVERYTHING was delicious--cookies were soft and chewy, and ice cream was top-notch.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent selection of cookies and ice cream. At $2 a pop I can't complain about the price. The product itself is nothing to rave about. I pictured fresh baked warm cookies. Instead I got room temperature cookie crackers. Keep in mind if your paying with your card there is a fee. Also be prepared to pay for metered parking."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, everything was great. $2 for an ice cream sandwich of my choice. This place is a replica of LAs Diddy Riese, which sells sandwiches at $1.50. The taste was good, but the sandwich was quite a bit smaller than Diddy rieses with a 25% higher price. I know it's not fair to compare it to something in LA so with my first visit I would have rated it 4stars. This time I walked in and was in a rush. I told all my friends from LA how similar this place was to Diddy Riese and everyone was eager to try some. But, when I walked in there was no one to be found. I sat around for 5 minutes and asked hello but no one came out! It was an utter disappointment and incredibly embarrassing to my eager friends. We left and got Rita's instead. So the biggest problem is the bad (completely nonexistent) service and the fact that their ice cream sandwiches are not that cheap! I dozen cookies at walmart is $3 or homemade cookies are $2 for 2 dozen. A bucket of ice cream is $3 and with two scoops on each sandwich, that comes out to around $1 a sandwich or less if you make your own cookies like they do here! Because they don't make their own icecream, save your money and stay home!"}
{"text":"I don't get what the buzz is about. The ice cream is nothing special at all. Very average. So what it's served with a cookie?"}
{"text":"Love this place always fresh if I had one complaint the cookies are too rich I feel like I need to run a 5k to make up for the calories so I don't eat here as often as I would like"}
{"text":"Slickables was good for a late night dessert. I had originally asked someone if they had been to a similar dessert store across from Slickables and she had recommended this place instead of the one I was asking about. She said Slickables was inexpensive compared to the other place. 

I didn't realize it was in a popular spot for the college students so it took awhile to find parking. Once in, you get to choose your cookie and ice cream. My order was made pretty quick. My husband sampled an ice cream and got a cone of it. We paid $4 for those two ice creams. So inexpensive! And I was happy that I was able to get something sweet so late. 

The only downfall is that the cookies were hard. It would've been better if they were soft and warm. The store was very basic and not upscale at all. There's not a huge amount of space to sit and eat. So we just took ours to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into Slickables while at a Tempe Art Festival a few weeks ago. Wow what a great treat for $2!!! We had two snicker doodle cookies with butter pecan ice cream - it was really good! 

The cookies were soft and chewy and the ice cream was Dreyers (decent)

Would highly recommend Slickables if your in the area and want a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"This is the only true way to make an ice cream sandwich. Freshly baked cookies introduce a whole new realm of quality to a dessert that most people have only experienced in supermarket boxed form.

Honestly, it really doesn't matter what you order. Just pick your favorite cookie and your favorite flavor. I don't think you can go wrong. Cookies and ice cream go together like white people and craft beer.  

We've only visited once and were quite pleased. Due to its location, we haven't returned, but plan to very soon.

The question remains: Is it really only two dollars? In present day? At a time when ice cream shops charge premium prices simply because the foodie crowd is willing to pay for it? Indeed it is!

I just hope it stays this way."}
{"text":"I've ate at Slickables a few times over the years and can say that they have always provided top-notch cookie sandwiches. I've had them from both the Mill location and at my office for a catered event. My personal favorite is the birthday cake ice cream with funfetti cookies -- SO GOOD! The vanilla snickerdoodle sandwich comes in close second.

Next time you're on Mill or need a dessert catered to your office, check this place out!"}
{"text":"An incredible way to cool off in the AZ heat! I am from out of town and this place was recommended based on how reasonable the prices are. $2.50 gets  you an ice cream sandwich with the cookies and ice cream of your choice. I had red velvet and strawberry cheesecake. So good. From what I could tell, ice cream flavors were pretty standard, no bone marrow green tea etc. Caramel blondie brownies looked heavenly."}
{"text":"$2 ice cream sandwiches... You can't go wrong going here. Freshly made cookies and hard ice cream. Usually 8 types of different cookies and 10+ flavors of ice cream. Best cheap dessert to beat the heat in beautiful downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Funfetti cookies Nuff said Add triple caramel and there's more than Nuff said Only problem that I had was that the line was too long"}
{"text":"Fresh, chewy cookies, mashed together with ice cream of your choice for $2 is an incredible deal. So tasty."}
{"text":"I am crazy for this place! The ice cream itself is nothing special but considering it's only $2 I'll let it pass. I love all the different fresh baked cookie flavors though and love how soft and yummy they are. I'm becoming a Sun Devil this fall and cannot wait to come here more often."}
{"text":"Super quick and friendly service. The cookies were very fresh and delicious and a perfect combination with ice cream. They had a nice variety of options. I will definitely come back. The price for this fresh me ice cream sandwich was very fair at $2.50"}
{"text":"I live and work right near this place and have found it to be one of my new favorite places to grab a quick treat when strolling down Mill Ave. The store is very clean and well lit making for a pleasant atmosphere. The ice cream sandwiches are delicious and come in very filling sizes as well as a variety of flavors/flavor combinations. The staff are all very nice and welcoming. I definitely recommend this place if you like ice cream and fresh cookies as much as I do!"}
{"text":"When this place opened, I kept looking for yelp reviews.  But they were all 5* posts from complete unknown users.  Soon these reviews were filtered off.  Not many other businesses have such a disproportionate amount of filtered 5* reviews.  It's a little obvious :/

I rarely write reviews, but I'm going to start because of things like this.  The place is not bad.  The owners are friendly, but I couldn't be their friend if you know what I mean.  The quality of the cookies are ok considering the cost.  Dreyers is dreyers.

They would have gotten a 3* review probably, but I knocked off 1 for being fake.  They called their ice cream \"super premium\".  Huh?  Compounded with the flood of fake yelp reviews, I knocked off a star to help average out the fake reviews.  Maybe I'll restore it when I feel like we don't need vigilante justice for these slick business owners.

In all, I think these guys will do well.  My friend had something at Cookiez the same day I had Slickables.  Slickables ice cream sandwich wins, but doesn't win my heart."}
{"text":"I first heard about this ice cream place on Instagram and when I was in downtown Tempe walking around mill with my husband we decided to try it and I've been hooked on it ever since! Anytime I down here I will get an ice cream sandwich and its very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"An ice cream cookie sandwich for $2.50?! Sold. Decent cookies and pretty normal ice cream flavors, but this place is a steal."}
{"text":"Relatively fresh baked cookies, cold ice cream, all smashed into an ice cream sandwich. All for a low low price. 
What more can you ask for?! Oh, more seats, haha. Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Come here quite frequently, but every time I feel guilty because I was a huge supporter of Cookiez on Mill and was very sad when it closed. 

Cookie sandwiches are great, have tried lots of combos. The milkshake isn't their speciality, I wouldn't recommend that.

I have a problem with the fact that they wait to see what kind of payment you pull out of your purse/wallet and then decide what to charge you. If you pay with a card it's 2.35, but if you pay cash it's 2.00. I know they're covering their vendor expenses, but they do it very sneakily and it's not like they post a sign (most stores who do this actually display it) to encourage you to pay for cash.

I also didn't like that when I saw them as a vendor at a local event they charged $4 for their product. I know business and the whole \"supply and demand\" thing, but being a regular customer it rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"I did a double take when I saw that you can get a customized ice cream sandwich for only $2! The cookies were perfectly soft and chewy, with a multitude of flavors including red velvet, mint chip, chocolate chip, double chocolate, and snickerdoodle. The ice cream is pretty basic, but they also offer a decent selection to choose from. Such flavors include strawberry, coffee, mint chip, chocolate, butter pecan, and vanilla. 

I opted for a mint chip ice cream center with a double chocolate cookie and a mint chip cookie for the extremities. It was a lovely blend of textures and complementary flavors. 

Although it was fairy busy when we went and there was only one person manning the store, service was still cheerful and pleasant with a smile. The total was $2 including tax, what an even better deal!

Definitely a great place for dessert at a fabulously reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Excellent idea! Cheap and delicious ice cream and ice cream sandwiches. Haven't tried their milkshakes yet but a homemade ice cream sandwich made with two fresh cookies for $2 is awesome. 

Great for kids. Great for adults. So glad to see this place on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"This is the biggest joke ever. It looks like a place that was just thrown together quickly and now they are calling it a \"business\". A business that has bad customer service and the most rock solid cookies I've ever had in my life. If you want a cookie other than chocolate chip then don't expect for it to be fresh. The only one you will have a shot with is chocolate chip since there is a higher demand for them. Essentially meaning they may be fresher since they make them more often. How I see it is after a while if a cookie is hard and not soft whatsoever it's time to toss it! 10/10 would not recommend"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! You choose the flavors for the perfect ice cream sandwich, and it will only cost you $2. I got butter pecan ice cream between a snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookie. Dreams do come true!!!"}
{"text":"As a native Californian, I was pleasantly surprised to see THRIFTY ICE CREAM when we walked in to grab up some of those totally affordable and delicious ice cream sandwiches ($2.50!) after hiking that little butte with our kids. 

The prices are so great and there are no gimmicks. The prices are simple, clear and end in 5 or 0. I love that. It's easy to manage, count and decide. And on top of it all, the ice cream, brownies and cookies we tried were all delicious! The whole family enjoyed a treat for less than $8. 

See you again soon, Slickables! Thanks for keeping it real."}
{"text":"Create your own ice cream sandwich! The double chocolate cookie with mint chocolate ice cream was delicious. Great treat but the service could be better. Try it!"}
{"text":"If you're craving a tasty treat then I recommend checking this place out. They have about a dozen types of ice cream available, and they serve delicious cookies too. If you're up to it, you can get an ice cream sandwich with two cookies and ice cream of your choice. 

The ice cream sandwich was big enough that I couldn't properly take a first bite without compressing it, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Went here on a date last week. I had been to the now closed Cookiez on Mill, but hadn't yet tried Slickables. I arrived early so I hung out inside waiting for the boy to join me. While I was waiting, a few people came in and who I'm guessing is the owner, greeted them, asked if they'd been there before, and gave them the schpeel if they hadn't. 

Once we were ready to order, I perused the menu and decided on a chocolate chip/red velvet cookie combo with caramel ice cream. The guy got a sandwich cookie as well. We sat inside and they put it in a cup for you so do you don't have to deal with figuring out how to eat it :)

The sandwich was good. Was it AMAZING? No. But for $2 I couldn't complain. I'll definitely return to try a milkshake blended with cookies, mmmm"}
{"text":"First time here. Service, icecream & cookies were superb. The vanilla milkshake did not taste creamy. Possibly due to the fact that skim milk was used to make it."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5
Happiness - 3/5

One thing I'll give Slickables is that the price is right. It won't cost you a mint (chocolate chip... ba-dum bum) to take your family out for a decent ice cream sandwich. 

But I personally prefer stellar ice cream sandwiches. And with the Baked Bear a mere few blocks away, I just can't endorse Slickables. The quality is just fine all the way around. OK ice cream. OK baked goods. But I want DELICIOUSNESS and Slickables doesn't have it. And when you ingest the incredible amount of calories and fat in fresh baked goods and ice cream mashed together, I think the taste ought to be worth it. And I just don't think it is here. So if you want a perfectly acceptable and very cheap sweet treat, this is the place. But if you want the same thing for a little more money but a LOT better quality, Baked Bear is the place."}
{"text":"Ice cream sandwiches made with cookies? I'll stick that in my mouth hole any day.

Cookies are good, the ice cream is good and they deliver on UberEats. Killing it. I haven't tried their brownies, but those are going in my mouth next time."}
{"text":"Nice execution, good flavor and perfect size. 
The selections were a little limited but what they do have is really good. I went with the double chocolate cookie and the strawberry ice cream which was fantastic. I would highly recommend that combo!
It's a great walk Around and munch on an ice cream sandwich snack."}
{"text":"Omg $2 for a slice of heaven
Tonight I had:

Snickerdoodle cookie
Mint chocolate chip ice cream
Chocolate chip cookie

My ice cream sandwich was soooo good

The workers were super friendly and offered several tips as to combinations

I will be back here more and more
Even if they decide to raise the price

It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Ok, ice cream, fresh baked cookies and brownies, served as shakes, sandwiches, sundaes .... For cheap! AND they're DELICIOUS!!!! You have to love this place. Had a scoop of cookies-n-cream between 2 chewy crispy chocolate cookies. Awesome! $2 yep, $2. You build your own delicacy :) Best deal and taste in town."}
{"text":"Slickables is the OG Tempe ice cream sandwich spot. The cookies are fresh and they scoop the ice cream PERFECTLY to fit inside the sandwich and not get all messy. The overall experience is always positive because the staff is cool, they have enough seating, and the sh*t is just delicious! Honestly, it blows Baked Bear out of the water. 
Slickables, I'm loyal to u bae."}
{"text":"I am a fan of cookie-ice cream sandwiches. They do not have to be anything fancy, I will always love them. This place delivers nothing super fancy, but the prices are so great. I always get a cookie ice cream sandwich for $2, a price that is unheard of basically everywhere else. I love a good fancy unique ice cream experience, but nothing beats $2 cookie sandwiches, plus they have many other really cheap options and the cookies are always soft, which is important. I recommend this place for sho"}
{"text":"Delicious shakes and ice cream sandwiches right along the main drag of Tempe.  Prices are reasonable, metered parking is easy, staff is helpful and friendly, atmosphere is bright and spacious.  My strawberry shake was tasty, my friend's mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich with freshly baked mint chocolate chip cookies was yummy too.  I'd come back here again if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good ice cream. But tbh..i feel like most ice cream places taste the same. Not overpriced like other bogie ice cream places."}
{"text":"Pretty good ice cream sandwiches and some not bad ice cream to complement it!

I've been to slickables a couple of times, and I'll say straight up that I enjoy it a lot more than Baked Bear for ice cream sandwiches. With Baked Bear, I feel like it's always overkill with all their toppings, all the weird flavors, and they're humongous sandwiches that leaves your hands all nasty and disgusting, and probably your stomach feeling like crap. 

I love the simplicity of Slickables. Normal sized cookies, with normal ice cream flavors, it's not super dazzling to the eye, but the taste is something you can't deny. The cookies were soft and had good texture. When you bite into the sandwich, it retains its shape, rather than completely crumbled with those ginormous sandwiches your get at Baked Bear. 

The ice cream flavors are normal, you'll find your classic flavors like vanilla, chocolate, strawberry etc. Its definitely not the best ice cream I've had, but like I said before, simplicity is key sometimes. 

I would highly recommend coming here instead of Baked Bear!!! Unless you just want a colorful picture of an ice cream sandwich on steroids and you don't care about the taste, then go for it! 

Oh and best of all, THE PRICE!!!! It's only $2.50!!!!! WHY WOULDNT YOU WANT TO TRY IT

Tips
1) there's more stuff than just cookies, there's brownies and a caramel one too!
2) mostly one sandwich will satisfy you, and doesn't leave you feeling like crap, so just get one
3) you can get different flavor cookies for your top or bottom when you make your ice cream sandwich, go crazy"}
{"text":"2 dollars even, for a custom ice cream sandwich (say whatttt?)!

When you first walk by this little ice cream shop, it actually feels small and unimpressive but don't let that deter you;  the magic happens once you reach the counter. Plus, even the chairs have Nom-Nom's in them (lol).

Pick a first cookie flavor. WHAM!
Pick a second cookie flavor. BAM!
Pick an ice cream flavor. Thank you MA'AM!

It's hard to go wrong, the ice-cream is thrifty/bb and the cookies are just the right size.

I opted for a red velvet+chocolate chip cookies with strawberry cheese cake ice cream.  It was the perfect amount of ice cream sandwich, sweet but very manageable (not an overdose of sweet tooth fatty guilt involved like most other related places).  You can definitely be creative here.  Go order 5 and you'll have enough cookies and ice cream to build a pazookie.  Order 2-3, and you can have stacks on stacks on stacks. The possibilities!

That's all there is too it.  There is room for improvement but it is quite solid as is (they need to work a little bit more on the layout/decor).  It really is one of those ideas where you sit and go, \"why didn't I think of this?\"  

There are DIY milkshakes also.  Delicious simplicity at it's finest.

{"text":"$2 for ice cream sandwiches! Yes please! I got their red velvet cookie and snickerdoodle cookie with caramel ice cream! May I singggggg delicious :) 

The cookies were soft, not too sugary and it was just oh so good! I didn't even feel guilty after eating this!"}
{"text":"The coffee ice cream was horrible. The brownie was fine and the rocky road was what you'd expect from rocky road. Hard pass."}
{"text":"The cookies are so soft !! Nothing special about the ice cream but together they sure do make a yummy dessert.  In my opinion, Slickables is better than Diddy Reese in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Simple delicious fresh ice cream cookie sandwich.  And for only $2!  Well done & start one in SE Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with some friends, and I couldn't believe what a great deal it is! I've always heard how popular this place is, so I assumed it would be expensive, but it totally isn't. Just $2 for a sandwich! Sure I could make one at home, but that requires effort, number one, and two, their cookies are dang good. I got carnival (m&m) cookies with cookie dough ice cream in the middle. Definitely coming here every time I'm on mill."}
{"text":"Great product and an even better deal.  The owners seem like very friendly people as well.  This is the kind of local business you just want to support."}
{"text":"Cheap place to grab yourself an ice cream sandwich on Mill Ave!

The shop serves student friendly priced ice cream and ice cream sandwiches. The cookies themselves were soft, but basic in flavor and the ice cream filling is equivalent to a single scoop. I got the Snickerdoodle & White Chocolate Chip Cookies with Triple Caramel Ice Cream and enjoyed that the cookies were soft and chewy, not hard or crisp at all.

Service was a bit rushed as they were close to closing and there wasn't much cookies to choose from. The cookies weren't spectacular in terms of flavors, but great texture- the ice cream was good though, but for price point the quality and portion was reflective. A good place if you're passing through and you want something sweet and cheap. Unfortunately, not open late for college students experiencing drunchies!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here late Friday night. I got an ice cream sandwich which consisted of double chocolate chip cookies and mint ice cream. The ice cream was good but the cookies were \"eh\".  I also got a mint cookie to go. Would recommend CREAM or Baked Bear for a better tasting experience. 

The two employees were great though! Very cheery and quick to help. Prices are pretty decent, $0.50 for cookies and under $3 for a ice cream cookie sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been to the location in Mesa and this one and the one on Mill feels a bit smaller but other than that, not a huge difference. 

If I were to stumble in here without reading reviews, I would more than likely walk out immediately. It's a small space, with 2 tables, boxes were everywhere, there was a broken chair on the floor, a tiny little beat up fridge and not a very appealing display case. So  aesthetically, this place is not pleasing. 

BUT! The ice cream more than makes up for that (although if the business owner is reading this, you should definitely make your place a little nicer to not scare away people who don't trust yelp). 

It's extremely affordable so it makes for a great after dinner dessert destination for a first date. The cookies are very fresh and there's a very good selection, the ice cream is tasty and goes well with most cookies they offer. You really can't go wrong here. I definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Went here on whim to finish off my date with the beau.  Super affordable ice cream, delicious cookies, however the only downside is the seating.  The space is small and is definitely not meant for guests to sit down and enjoy their dessert."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it's storefront on Mill, there was a pungent sewage smell walking in. I heard other customers make the same remark. So service was pretty quick. There were plenty of ice cream flavors and cookies to choose from. The price was great, $2! I don't know if I came in the evening, but my cookie was hard. It wasn't rock hard, but if I'm eating an ice cream sandwich, I should be able to take a smooth bite. I pretty much had a messy dessert and the ice cream kept sliding out of the cookie. If you were coming here for something else, I'd say go for it, but not for the ice cream sandwiches. Maybe I'll try it again sometime, but I'll check out other places first."}
{"text":"A Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich for $2!!!! Wahhh?!?! YES!! ...and they are AMAZING!! Especially  when its 110 outside :D Located in the heart Mill Ave. If ever in AZ you gotta stop by here and treat yourself!"}
{"text":"I visited a friend back in October and we came here before the ASU-Stanford football game, and it was the best ice-cream sandwich I'd ever had. I recently visited at the end of May and was walking around looking for this place (since I had forgotten the name) for 30 minutes, it's THAT good. For only $2 you get two fresh-baked cookies with a scoop of ice-cream in between. I suggest eating some with a spoon, unless you are cool with getting extremely messy. My go-to is chocolate chip with mint ice-cream..now I'm really hungry and sad that I can't go here for a while :/"}
{"text":"Seriously so good for the price!! This is what we have been waiting for in Arizona. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"nothing fancy, solid ice cream bar for hot, sunny day.  I don't really understand why it gets such high rating as you comparing to other ice cream shop as you walking down the street.  Perhaps they give discount or extra scoop or something...idk.  Honestly, they all literally serve the same thing....the ice cream weren't anything special; maybe the sweetness.  I have to blame my wife for eating the whole thing without letting me have the second taste of it on the day we visited.  So blame her if the review isn't accurate.  One thing I do agree tho is that it is fast and to-go, not expensive, so you can't expect great ingredient I suppose.  Perhaps the ice cream doesn't taste good on a slow day and when wife wants to be selfish and have the whole treat to herself?"}
{"text":"These ice cream sandwiches are honestly amazing!!! Took literally 3 minutes, in and out. I bough me and my homie a sandwich and it was only $5. Bomb asf and open late. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"2$ for a ice cream sandwich where you can pick both your cookies and ice cream is such an incredibly good deal. 
I'm going to be honest the cookies were pretty average, but the the employees were super friendly and engaged in making the customers happy."}
{"text":"Delicious.

We stopped in here for some dessert before catching a show.  They have various options depending on what you are looking for.

We opted for the build your own ice cream sandwich.  We had the salted caramel ice cream and chocolate chip cookies.  They built it and put it into a bowl which made it much easier to manage.  We split the dessert because we were still relatively full from dinner.  

The sandwich combo was delicious.  The cookies were crisp but still slightly chewy which added to the experience.  I would definitely stop in again if I am in the area looking for dessert options."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream, soft and chewy, baked fresh cookies, and friendly service from the most wonderful small business owners. It's definitely a bonus that such a satisfying treat only costs two hundred pennies ;) Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"TWO ($2) DOLLAR ICE CREAM SANDWICHES?!?! What? Yup, you heard me right....these delicious and heaping ice cream sandwiches are only 2 buck-a-roonies. 

When I say ice cream sandwich, you probably think of those ones that you buy from the ice cream section at the grocery store...that's exactly what I thought when someone suggested going to get Ice Cream Sandwiches. My initial reaction was \"meh, borning ice cream sandwiches\" but then as soon as I walked in the doors, all of my worries were put behind me. Slickables Ice Cream Sandwiches is a big heaping scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two cookies. I opted for two double chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter cup ice cream. The flavors were amazing and I was impressed! The variety of sandwiches you could make here is insane...or you could go the simple route and still have your socks knocked off."}
{"text":"A freaking mazing! Love this spot so affordable family of 4 for less then $10 bucks is just wow and the cookies were soft and chewy and oh so good. Came from out of town for a visit an will definitely come back everything we visit!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place , how friendly everyone is and the set up . Overall, they make you feel comfortable & the ice cream cookie sandwiches are really good !"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The price is right, the service is always great, and the product is top notch! The Tempe location is right down the street from another ice cream cookie shop that charges three times the amount for a less superior of a product. When visiting this past weekend they added salted Carmel blondies to the mix...I know what I will be trying next time. 
Supporting local is always a great feeling and when it's a great spot like this you will want to come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"I visited Slickables last night. I thought it was a pretty decent place to hit up whenever you have a craving for sweets. The ice cream sandwiches are only $2, so why not, right?

Other than the affordability and proximity aspects of Slickables, I wouldn't really go out of my way to go here. I didn't think the cookies or ice cream were incredibly wonderful tasting. I had the red velvet and white chocolate macadamia cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream in between. Even in my state of hunger, I was not that impressed.

The decor is definitely lacking. More seating would be great, and seats that aren't dilapidated."}
{"text":"An amazing value. You select two cookies, your favorite flavor of ice cream, and assemble it into an ice cream sandwich. All for just two bucks!!! The cookie assortment is good: Peanut butter, snickerdoodle, red velvet, chocolate chip, funfetti...  The selection of ice cream is more than adequate as well, with about a dozen flavors available: Chocolate chip mint, salted caramel, cookie dough... I'm shocked every ASU student isn't at least 30 pounds overweight with Slickables so nearby! 

The cookies are soft, chewy and delicious and the ice cream is the classic Thrifty brand. You could make the argument that there are better cookies and ice cream available separately elsewhere, but for the price, this is a perfect combination.

Slickables is located, a bit hidden, right next to the Steak n Shake on Mill Avenue. There are only three tables inside the shop, but the ice cream sandwiches are served in a cup and can be easily eaten while strolling down Mill Avenue. This is one of only three locations (Tempe, Mesa and Riverside,CA). Lucky us."}
{"text":"Did I mention how crazy delish the cookies are?

The beauty of this place is that it is classically good. Not trying to be too fancy, spend too much on decor, just solid, good ice cream and cookies. 

We just took 2 dozen cookies to an agency partner for the holidays and they said they were the best cookies they had ever had!"}
{"text":"Very good ice cream and good prices. I had a cookie ice cream sandwich and it was very good. Only thing that I think could be improved is the atmosphere. Ala and all if you want ice cream go there.."}
{"text":"We got completely addicted to an ice cream sandwich place in San Diego on Mission Beach (maybe it was north enough to be Pacific Beach) and were sad there wasn't anything like that here.  Well guess what?  There was!  We just never knew about it.  And the best part, ice cream sandwiches here are only $2!  We were paying close to $6 in San Diego."}
{"text":"Love this place! So simple and yet so delicious and satisfying. Choose your ice team and choose your cookies and tada! You have your perfect dessert. Oh and all for two bucks! You cannot go wrong with this place. Just keep in mind that seating is quite limited so you'll have to mosey along but you probably won't care because you'll be so excited about how great your treat is. I want to go there right now actually!"}
{"text":"This place is an OK alternative if you liked \"cookiez\" (the other ice cream sandwich shop that closed) Great price for the ice cream though, that can't be beat!"}
{"text":"they could easily double their prices and id still come here twice a week. great ice cream sandwiches at a small joint"}
{"text":"$2 for an ice cream cookie sandwich? I'll take it. Not too shabby. I like going to this place after a meal. If I'm craving a small dessert, I definitely go here all of the time when I'm at mill ave. Cookies are always nice, soft, chewy, and fresh. Ice creams they have are fantastic also. Although, I wish they had more flavors but it's okay. The ones they have are still delish. People are always friendly which btw I love the most : )"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you're missing out. Ice cream squished between two fresh cookies of your choice... Heaven in my mouth! I like using white chocolate macadamia cookies and vanilla ice cream. The cookies are usually fresh and soft. The line is occasionally quite long on weekends. It's a nice date night spot. And these babies are on the affordable side for sure. Yay!"}
{"text":"$2 for an ice-cream sandwich? Seriously?!

It's almost like they're giving them away for free! On top of that, you get to choose your cookies and ice cream flavor. It's customized for your liking, this is pure genius I tell ya! I ate next door at La Bocca and was in the mood for some dessert. Any why not? For $2, anyone would want dessert... am I right?! I got the Butter Pecan squashed between a Snickerdoodle and Mint Chocolate Chip. Kinda odd pairing, but surprisingly it worked. Best $2 dessert ever and the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"there are numerous places on mill out but I always come here quick easy and friendly at a good price there's no need to pay twelve dollars for our ice cream challenge when you can come here in pay to fifty sneaker due to ice cream which draw Berry cheese cake in the middle delicious"}
{"text":"I live in LA so I've had the original Ice Cream Sandwich place - Diddy Riese cookies near UCLA. Is it really the original? I have no idea, but run with it. Diddy Riese has awesome cookies that are super cheap. Their ice cream sandwiches have slowly crept up in price, but still a steal relatively speaking. The thing with Diddy Riese is that it's really a cookie place because the Ice Cream they use is just Dreyer's Ice Cream, so not great...

But then I came to Tempe where I found Slickables. Great reviews, not as many as Diddy Riese, but just as high of a rating. They charge $2 for their cookie sandwich, so still a steal. I walk in and see the casing of cookies. It wasn't the most appetizing casing. The cookies didn't look particularly fresh and it wasn't the best eye candy, but I was intrigued. The ice cream flavor choices were solid (e.g. Salted Caramel, Birthday Cake, Butter Pecan). I went with Snickerdoodle with Salted Caramel my first time and White Chocolate with Butter Pecan the second time. The Snickerdoodle was definitely the better option, but that could have also just had to do with the freshness of the cookies because the white chocolate was still delicious. 

I didn't think I would ever say it, but I think this place has Diddy Riese beat. The price is comparable. The cookies are just as good (Diddy Riese might have a slight notch up on some cookies and Slickables might have a slight notch up on other cookies). But the Ice cream is way better here. So if you just want cookies at either of these locations, you're golden, but if you want an ice cream sandwich you should probably come here - assuming you live between ASU and UCLA and you don't mind driving for hours."}
{"text":"Best desert on Mill by far. A simply delicious treat: two fresh warm cookies that sandwich a cool scoop of ice cream in the middle. For only $2 flat when paying with cash, Slickables trumps all. Favorite combo: snicker doodle cookies with vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I know this is an ice cream joint but the brownies are worth the 4 stars alone! Also, it's cheap and quick service. None of us got an ice cream sandwich which is what we came for but we got side tracked and had to have cookies and cream shakes and scoops and plain brownies and chocolate chip cookies. I had just a brownie with a few spoonfuls of the ice cream on top just because..... brownies!!!"}
{"text":"$2 ice cream cookie sandwich?! Can't beat that! Wishin' they had more selection though."}
{"text":"My new obsession! This was my first time here, and ordered the mint chocolate chip. I can't believe how good this was!! And huge for the price. They have many differant flavors so unless they ban me, I might be here everyday to try em all!"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable! 3 people were able to get dessert for $6.50. One ice cream cookie sandwich, one ice cream cone, and one brownie with ice cream. The amount of options was great and ensured that everyone could find something they liked. As a chocolate lover I got the chocolate cookies with chocolate ice cream. It was amazing! The cookies were perfectly baked... Not hard but not too soft so it held up the ice cream well. The flavor combination was delicious! Highly recommend checking this place out. I will be back any time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Not as great as I expected.  Cookies were not soft but rather hard.   Ice cream was good but price can't be beat"}
{"text":"$2 cookie ice cream sandwich is totally a deal! Unfortunately you totally \"get what you pay for\". 
I finally made it in here the other day, and I just wasn't all that impressed. After reading all the reviews, I was expecting the most adorable/amazing ice cream cookie place ever! What I walked into, however, was a kind of grungy store front. 
I asked for the m&m cookie and snickerdoodle cookie with vanilla ice cream. After paying I was told to help myself to a spoon and napkins. The cup (or spoon holder/spoon display?) for the spoons had one lonely spoon in it. One! It was dead in there, how long does it take to refill the spoon cup? I thought it was the ice cream-sample-spoon-trash. Ugh, gross I really hope it wasn't.
Anyway! My cookie sandwich had the tiniest scoop of ice cream on it, which tasted fine (I've had Dreyers a time or two). The cookies were pretty good, although the selection was seriously lacking when I went in there (around 4). My m&m cookie had 4 m&m's in it. Really, it did! I'm not just trying to be a snobby bitch, I swear!
So, $2 dollars in exchange for an ice cream sandwich is a good deal. But like I said, you get what you pay for, and in this case it aint much. I'll keep going to Cookiez for my gigantic 1/2 ice cream sandwich that costs maybe $3, but has homemade ice cream, and ample amounts of spoons! (Cookiez on mill is pretty grungy, too, I know!)"}
{"text":"This place needs to franchise... everywhere. I am surprised they haven't! 

The concept is easy and brilliant:
1. pick your favorite cookie (if you can't decide then pick two different types)
2. pick your icecream

then salivate as they put the two together into the best thing your mouth will enjoy over the next 3 minutes (or until it's gone!)

The cookies are all baked to perfection and icecream is equally creamy/delish. And it's easy on your pocket too? Who knew $2 could make you so happy!!

THis is no frills (they focus on what they do best- which is icecream sandwiches), just the best icecream sandwich you can pickup and go. You dont' go here for the decor or even to sit here."}
{"text":"Simple menu. Enough variety of cookies and ice cream to choose from surprisingly cheap. It was two bucks for the ice cream sandwich. They probably had 5-10 different types of cookies to choose from 10-15 different common ice cream flavors. It's all thrifty brand ice cream so no super exciting flavors. The cookies are soft and the staff is friendly and chill 
Just so you know if you get the brownie instead of cookie they can't /won't warn it up. The oven you see on the counter top is just for baking cookies?"}
{"text":"Awesome place! My husband and I stopped in for a sweet treat and were greeted cheerfully by the owner who happily gave us samples and let us take our time as we made up our minds.

$2 for two cookies and a scoop of ice cream to make your own custom ice cream sandwich? Yes please.

I had a brownie, chocolate chip cookie, and peanut butter cup ice cream sandwich. It was great! Definitely a fun little spot, plus they have little bags of \"day young cookies\" that you can pick up for a buck or two if you're feeling extra fat."}
{"text":"Awesome, had an ice cream sandwich, a single scoop and a single in a waffle cone for $5.50, and it all tasted great"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Where else can you get yummy ice cream and homemade cookies this cheap?! One scoop of ice cream is $1.50. A homemade ice cream cookie sandwich is $2.00. Seriously, $2.00. I will definitely be back. This is a great place to bring your kids for a small, inexpensive treat."}
{"text":"For the price, it's a nice summer treat. You get to pick two cookies and a scoop of ice cream for your ice cream sandwich for like $2 bucks? Their cookie dough ice cream wasn't the best but their cookies are soft and overall if you like cookies and ice cream, this is a good spot to check out after lunch!"}
{"text":"Loved this place while I visited Tempe. Staff was decent, cookies could have been softer, but overall a great experience. Would definitely go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh cookies and good ice cream turned into a delightful cookie sandwich all for $2!!!"}
{"text":"Limited flavors, but it's the perfect selection. I love this place and it's so cheap!!! Best ice cream spot in tempe!

$2 ice cream sandwiches and waffle cones!"}
{"text":"Raise your hand if you are just sick and tired of froyo? Ohhh K, no hands up, eh.  I totally understand.  With so many unique flavors you get and the assortment of toppings, that's hard to beat.  BUT you know what's still around? That's right, good ole' fashion ice cream sandwiches.

Inspired by DIDDY RIESE in LA, Slickables wanted to bring the same level of quality in its homemade cookies and pricing.  In fact, the target market is so identical--poor college students.  Located on downtown Mill Ave, it does not get any better than that.  Students roam amok here throughout the day. 

Having had Diddy's, I must say the difference is that it cost 50 cents more here and the cookies slightly tastier and chewier.  Wedge two cookies together with their Dryer brand ice creams and you will be quite content! Just $2 plus tax!  You get a decent choice of ice creams from Peanut Butter to Almond flavors.

So take a break from froyo and munch down on some chewy cookies and ice cream! It might get a little messy, but totally worth it! $2 or 8 quarters! + tax! ;-)

A side note, they do not toss away their cookies, they will sell a small batch of 1 day old cookies for $1.  I advise parking at the structure near 7th St on the east side of Mill.  The elevator takes you up to ground level and you will be near the shop.  Get your pass validated at the Bank of America branch.  Order the RED VELVET cookie, I promise you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Holy wow!!

Slickables catered our monthly office birthday party today and it was funtastical!

We had the option of two cookies (big duh) Chocolate chip, Double chocolate chip, Snickerdoodle, Oatmeal raisin. Both cookies didn't have to be the same. Our ice cream choices were vanilla, chocolate, chocolate chip mint or coffee. I order two chocolate chip cookies with the mint ice cream. Mel ordered a chocolate chip and a snickerdoodle cookie with the mint ice cream. I also ordered a second sandwich for tomorrow, because people like to give me food. That one is double chocolate chip cookie with coffee ice cream.

I love that this shop is off the light rail. 

On a side note, there are times when I'm eating ice cream and it reminds me of babysitting my cousins one weekend. That first night the youngest kept crying for \"ouch cream\" and I was really annoyed because I'd already missed the first 8 minutes of Twin Peaks. The next morning she wanted \"panic cakes\". Kids really are stupid."}
{"text":"I had the Funfetti Cookies with Birthday Cake Ice Cream! For $2, the value is great! Super soft and fresh cookies with freshly made ice cream. The size is perfect, not too big but just enough to fill you up. We will definitely make the trip back again this summer!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the price and sooooo good! $2 for an ice cream sandwich made with ice cream between two fresh baked cookies of your choice!! Open late which is nice for late night, pregnancy cravings ;-) 

Warning: Don't be turned off by the cookies in the glass case! The first time I went I almost turned around and walked out without trying anything because the cookies looked so old and sad in the case. Luckily, I asked the employee who explained those cookies are not the ones they actually use; they bake fresh cookies every half hour for the sandwiches and use those. Management may want to put up a sign explaining this or replace the cookies in the case every so often, because I almost left and would've missed out on this amazingness!"}
{"text":"Slickables is everything I like about small businesses.  It is run by its owners.  It is friendly and welcoming.  They're trying new things out to get customers in (like their signs on the window which really did work on me - I pulled a U-turn).  Their product is great and at a great price.

Their business model was inspired by Diddy Riese in Westwood.  I asked about it because it reminded me of that straightaway.  They said they loved Diddy Riese, as well.  

You can pick two cookies, mix and match if you'd like.  The owner bakes the cookies herself.  They are soft, but firm.  Chewy and not so crunchy that they fall apart when you bite into your sandwich.  Then you pick your ice cream.  It is standard grocery store fare, but delicious nonetheless.  

For $2 per sandwich, bring the whole family down for a delicious treat.  You cannot beat the price locally, unless you're at home (natch).  And, IMHO, they are LEAGUES above the other Mill Ave. ice cream sandwich shop in price and flavor.  

Plus, the owners are really friendly and seem to love what they do.  

Come support local business on Mill Ave.  This area is in need of a revitalization... and businesses like Slickables will bring the customers back."}
{"text":"Who does not like cookies,  who does not like ice cream.

Select your cookies or brownies and then choose the ice cream of your choice. I asked if they made their ice cream and they said no it is either Thrifty Ice Cream or Blue Bunny. I grew up with Thrifty Ice Cream and remember getting the double scoop Pistachio for $0.25.

We shared the snicker doodle and double chocolate cookies and then got the mint chocolate chip, Carmel swirl and cookies and cream ice cream. 

Best thing was it was $2 a sandwich there was not a line on a Sunday afternoon and we were able to get a table inside.

Located on Mill Ave and 7th St next to Steak and Shake so in a prime location and we were lucky to get a parking space in front of the store just ad someone was leaving.

We will certainly be back and recommend this place to everyone we like."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the Aloha festival. So many varieties of fresh made cookies to choose from and ice cream is absolutely delicious!!!! This is one of my most favorite places on Mill."}
{"text":"Location: it is located on Mill avenue where everything is happening. There are only 2 tables inside the place. If u have a huge party with you, it might be tough to hang out in there. If u just want to make a quick shop for some delicious ice-cream, this is definitely the place to go. 

Service: the lady who works behind the counter was friendly. I definitely feel bad for her giving us ice-cream and working as a cashier at the same time. Nevertheless, she still has a very positive attitude at work. 

Food: their mint and cookie ice-cream is delicious!!!! 

Rating: I'll definitely come back here again. Good location. Good food."}
{"text":"Slickably good!  

I went here based on the photos of the ice cream sandwich.  So, if you're perusing reviews and taking a look at pics....... well....... In this case, a picture truly is worth a thousand tastes.  

In a single word...  FANTASTIC  Homemade cookies.  Ice cream made in house!  cute little shop on a popular corner in Tempe.  You can't get any better, but if you could, Slicables is where you'd look.

I went with about 3 other friends one day after having dinner nearby in Tempe.  We wanted ice cream.  We.  Needed.  Ice.  Cream!  Everyone turns to me to figure out where to go.  I turn to my trusty Yelp App and discover a highly rated ice cream shop less than a mile from where we were.  So, we park on Mill Ave.  (I add this part for those who might end up making the same mistake.)  Unfortunately, we went to an ice cream shop across the street by mistake.  Watch out, that area along Mill Ave can be confusing (especially after a few glasses of wine at dinner), so be sure to use the address.  That \"other\" shop doesn't have the ice cream sandwich.  So, we leave that shop and cross the street and hit up the correct location.

I had a nice simple sandwich, a scoop of delicious creamy vanilla ice cream between 2 delicately sweet and chewy chocolate chip cookies.  I was more than satisfied.  I licked the sweet ice cream in the middle of the cookies and then I finally took a hefty bite of the sandwich and I was sold.  

My friends had various combinations of mint and chocolate and other cookies.  They were super happy with their sweet sandwich-loves.

Being sandwiched in the middle of Tempe at Slickables is the right thing to do.  Go lick that creamy middle and thank me later!"}
