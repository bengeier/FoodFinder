{"text":"Good for nearby Thai.  Can't compare to Thai Taste (the original one on East is by far the best!). The steamed basil rolls are delicious and the chicken in red curry sauce suffices.  The service is good, prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"The first impression I had of Thai 1st is that the prices are notably higher than more favorable Thai cuisine offerings in the Queen City.  That would be acceptable if the prices were justified by a really satisfying dining experience. The entree I ordered, Pad See Ew, reminded me of something I might be able to whip together at home, so its authenticity factor was lacking.  I found the American pop music piping through the sound system somewhat distracting as well.  The service was cheerful but not as attentive as I routinely find at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was good, but very pricey for what you get. Ordered lunch portion of curry with shrimp and chicken...$14.95. Got two pieces of shrimp. Disappointed all around"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte. I've been there maybe 4 or 5 times, and every time it's delicious. The helpings are generous, so you get a decent bang for your buck. The presentation is always gorgeous. I am a lover of duck, and although it's pricey, I got it once or twice, and yum! I'm also just a lover of meat, and unlike some places that are stingy, Thai 1st is NOT. You order a dish with meat or nuts, and you'll get meat and nuts. Highly recommended, for a friendly outting or a lovely date."}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants in Blakeney Shopping Center that doesn't make me want to hurl myself over a bridge. My wife and I eat here often; the service is generally pretty good and the food is consistently good. It's also one of the only restaurants where I will intentionally stop myself from eating my entire meal so that I may take some home and enjoy it the next day."}
{"text":"the service was good, we went there to celebrate a birthday and we all got something different, i hav to admit i didnt like what i got but, my friend got some soup and it was really good, the appetizers where great, and the sushi was my favorite part!!! Best i have had in a while!!! we also ordered a desert forgot what is was called but it was really good also!!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at Thai First! The food and the service are consistently awesome! My favorite dishes are Ginger Sauce with shrimp and scallops, and Pad Kaprow. My husband likes to try different dishes, and he has always enjoyed every one he's tried. Once when we were there on our anniversary, the server asked if we wanted dessert. I asked if they serve gluten-free desserts, and she said she'd be right back. She stopped back by our table and said it was taken care of! Shortly she came back with a gluten-free dessert she had the chef create just for me! It was delicious! The food is tasty and plentiful. Recommend."}
{"text":"I love all the waitresses they're so sweet and really take the time to help you decide what to eat if you're unsure. Food comes out pretty fast and never disappoints!"}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give this place 0 stars!  Worst restaurant experience I've had in decades.  They brought out a dish totally different than what I ordered.  OK, not a big deal, but when I tried to tell them and ask for the correct dish, they very rudely insisted that I had actually ordered that dish. I was very certain I didn't because I didn't even look at that dish on the menu.  They were so rude to me about bringing the correct dish, I didn't feel comfortable eating there and just said that I would come back to eat another time.  They said I couldn't leave until a paid for the dish that was wrong, even though I didn't eat a single bite.  I explained to them this didn't make any sense and they said if I called back when the manager was there, they could refund the money, but that they had no choice but to charge me.  I did as they said and called back many times, but all the people involved claimed they couldn't remember anything about it.  Poor management, Rude service, HORRIBLE policies... stay far away from this place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch to grab a bowl of chicken noodle soup. The place was dark. Like the lights weren't on. But decided to give it a shot. The server looked puzzled that I was dining alone. It was very awkward and wasn't very welcoming. It was lunch time... I can't be the only person to come in to grab a meal alone. She blurted out \"just one?!\" When I asked to sit.   My soup was good but nothing special. The chicken was super dry for being soup. I almost felt like it was pre cooked and just thrown into broth when ordered. The soup was piping hot but the chicken on top was just room temp.   Sadly, I don't think I'll try it again."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from the Detroit area and are used to award winning Thai food.  Since moving to Charlotte we had yet to find a good Thai place.  We got some carry out tonight and after paying $35 for 2 small to average size portions I figured/hoped that the food would be worth the price.  I really wanted it to be great.  Not even close....  I ordered one of the signature dishes, Thai Lover, and asked for it to be spiced HOT.  What I got was a bland Masaman sauce with zero heat whatsoever.  The vegetables were soggy and didn't seem fresh.  The chicken and shrimp were underwhelming as well.    My wife got the broccoli w/ tofu. We saut√© fresh broccoli weekly in our house and know what fresh broccoli is...what she got was small dark little shrubs of broccoli with little to no crunch.  The brown sauce was basically a very salty soy sauce which made every bite a salty letdown.  The tofu was cooked decently but was mushy inside.   I called them back after a few bites just to politely discuss the matter.  I was told by a manager that all produce is selected daily and prepared and all sauces are made \"in house.\"  She hesitantly offered to make us something else but we saw little to no hope that this place can actually produce authentic Thai dishes so we declined.  I stated that we would appreciate a refund and would be happy to return the food.  I was told that she would speak to the owner and call me back after dinner rush.  11PM...no call.  Not surprised.  This food was MAYBE worth $6-$7 per dish...$35!?!  Needless to say, one and done with Thai First Bistro."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Pad Thai around, look no further. Seriously, though. The food is REALLY good, and service is very fast too! Officially my favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in CLT. I LOVE the Pad Thai and shrimp rolls. The food is fresh, service is excellent and location 5 minutes from home. What's not to love about it?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really wanted to like this place because it's so close to our house.  Went here tonight for dinner. Coming in I was positively surprised by the decor and atmosphere - not your typical Thai restaurant decor, more contemporary, almost NY like.   Service was good and swift and we ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup, the crispy duck and the cashew chicken.   The soup was just ok... Very watery and i definitely had much better.  My wife thought the cashew chicken was average, not bad but nothing to remember either.  The duck was crispy, the meat tender and the red curry sauce nice and spicy.  So you might ask did i rate this 3 stars?   Well, its because even though the place looks good, has good service and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the food - it was just that: good, average Thai food.   There are definitely better Thai restaurants in Charlotte - but if you're in the neighborhood and crave some Thai curry or the smell of lemongrass you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great Thai place around south Charlotte and this is it! I LOVE the coconut cilantro chicken soup. The service is great and I like that I can order to-go as well (because I prefer that after work)."}
{"text":"I spotted Thai First on my way to a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant round the corner and decided to try this place instead. I was really wanting to like this place as I've just moved to the area, Thai food is my favorite cuisine and this place is close to where I live. If I liked it it would be become my regular dining place whenever I was in the mood for Thai.   So I pop in, take a look at the menu, unfortunately they didn't have one of my fav dishes - mango shrimp - but no biggie. I order instead the red curry which shows as $14.95 on the menu. The friendly staff ask if I'd like white or brown rice and I say \"brown rice\". I was taking out as I had somewhere to go. I get the bill and instead it's $16.95! .. I guess because I'm getting shrimp and not chicken or beef? The menu doesn't tell you that shrimp is more or how much more. While I waited I was offered some water .. unfortunately it was tap water that didn't taste like it was filtered. So I get home excited to dig into my nearly $20 takeout meal and what a let down! Not only was the portion size really small, they gave me white rice instead of brown (why ask if you're not going to honor the customer's choice). The red curry sauce was so watery and coagulated - not creamy and smooth as you'd expect. The bamboo shoots were tough and stringy and, on top of all that, they threw in 5 measly shrimp.   Needless to say I won't be patronizing this restaurant again in a hurry."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food that they served. The only meal that tasted okay was the Chicken Satay with peanut sauce. No way you can mess this appetizer up.  Ordered the Pad Thai which came with Shrimp and Chicken. The Pad Thai was too sweet, do not know why they put tons of sugar. Have eaten in many Thai restaurants in the past and Pad Thai is not suppose to taste like this.  The other item that was ordered was the Pad See EU. The flat rice noodles was all curled up at the edges. This definitely not how it is suppose to be cooked. They must have over cooked the noodles. The broccoli was not fresh. Do not know why they made this dish spicy. It did not list this on the menu.  The place was not busy at all. Walked in and hostess was busy on the phone.She stuck her finger out so we waited. Finally, waitress sat us down. They quickly want to take your order, bring your food and check if everything okay. Give you bill and send you on merry way.  Food is over priced and not authentic Thai. It is american style Thai restaurant. What Thai restaurant has Sushi thrown into the menu.   If any yelper, know of any good authentic Thai restaurant in Charlotte. Drop me a line."}
{"text":"Good location and excellent food ! I love chicken garlic with Thai hot at this location."}
{"text":"It used to be good. But they reduced quantity and increased price. And they have different prices for lunch dinner for same food. Some days, even if they go for lunch, they say we apply dinner prices Today. They say we are changing menu for new prices, but they never update even after months. Front desk people are rude, and lie all the time."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food. Service has always been excellent. Nice atmosphere, nice patio. Kids can play on Blakeney playground.  Pad Kaprow is very good."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant and ordered their specialty duck dish. The price was hefty so I expected to be at least decent. What I got was a piece of duck that was fried to a crisp. The meat tastes like jerky and hard as a rock. When I complained to the staff, the manager said that this is the way the duck is usually cooked at their restaurant and would not even bother to replace it for me. I had only eaten a bite! Even their staff member did not agree with the managers decision to do nothing. For 23.00 dish it was a waste! Don't bother with this establishment. It does not even deserve a 1 star!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!! Pay attention to your bill.  We eat here regularly and had something slightly different tonight.  Looked at my bill cause it seemed higher than normal....and they had added 18% gratuity to our bill.  We are a family of 5, two adults and 3 children.  I was told any bill that contains 5 entrees automatically is added 18%.  I have been tipping for the last 1.5 years which means I have given this restaurant 40% in tips.  So upset that no, one has ever said that gratuity was added.  I've never had gratuity added to our normal size family."}
{"text":"Searched for this restaurant on here.  Never saw the word Blue anywhere at the restaurant but I pulled up the website and this is definitely the restaurant we dined at for lunch Wednesday.  Basil Thai 1st in Blakney Charlotte NC.  The food was very good, coconut/chicken soup for two came in bowl with a flame in the midde to keep it warm. very light but filling and flavorful.  The Tiger springrolls with plum sauce were also good.  Our waitress was just as friendly and helpful as she could be.  Really enjoyed this restaurant and looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm, mmmm, mmm good!  Had lunch here with my hubby and teens to celebrate my birthday and I wasn't really that thrilled about going at first because another place was really my first choice.  We got there about 15 minutes before they closed after lunch so apparently they close at 2:30 and then reopen at 5:00.  They were very kind to us despite our timing and we were only \"rushed\" so that the kitchen staff could be done by 2:30 and leave.  We order three Pad See ew, two with tofu and no eggs, one with beef and for myself I decided to try the Massaman curry which comes with a crispy spring roll. My hubby ordered is tofu pad see ew with a level 4 spice, highest you can get and he enjoyed it but he said he likes the wider noodles that you typically get at other thai restaurants and I must agree with him. His portion size was good as well. My daughter had the same thing with a level 3 spice, wished she'd gotten the 4 but enjoyed it nonetheless.  My other daughter got the one with beef and enjoyed it but she was upset that she didn't really have enough noodles and I must agree.  It was a lot of beef and broccoli but very few noodles, bummer.  Now, on to my massaman curry, level 4.  Amazing!!  At first I looked at the portion size and it seemed really small but it wasn't because I ended up having enough to share with my hubby and daughter.  We did have to order another bowl of rice because most thai restaurants never give you enough rice it seems.  But it was sooooo good!  Great flavor, perfectly seasoned, hot and spicy!  I was pleased as punch with my selection.  The waitress was really nice because she told me that if the kitchen hadn't closed she would have given me a dessert to celebrate but that next time I come in to remind her and she'd take care of me.  The meal with tax and tip cost us about 62 bucks which was a bit steep for a lunch that didn't include any appetizers, drinks or dessert so we may not come back much as a family but I'll certainly be back to get some more of the curry and maybe try a few other options but overall, it's worth a try for sure.  Enjoy!  That is all! (Don't forget to hit the useful, funny or cool button.  Would love the feedback.)"}
{"text":"We go here regularly and it's always good. I get different appetizers but I always order the same entree since it's so yummy.   All their apps are good. The food is fresh and I never wait long to get my appetizer. I always get pad see ew with chicken for my main course. That is my favorite Thai dish and it has been for years. This place does a great job of making it and I would highly recommend going here for Thai food. I've tasted other dishes people I've eaten with have ordered and everything is always good!"}
{"text":"Don't know about their Thai food but their sushi is not great. Had some veggie rolls and shrimp tempura rolls along with some edamame and it was nothing special and very underwhelming. Hopefully their Thai is better!"}
{"text":"First time here and impressed with the service for starters and the menu had ALOT of options.  3 of my group did curry, slightly differently ordered and each one was served as order and everyone loved it.  I wish I could remember the name of what I had but it was under Rice and Noodles and highly recommended by the waitress who answered all of our questions with a smile.  We didn't try any sushi, but they did have a sushi bar and the atmosphere was great.  We all really enjoyed the night and will def be back soon.  It was very cold inside but once we tasted the food, the chill didn't seem to bother us.  Really glad we found this one!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible!!   I've been here numerous times, but with the poor service, I can't see bringing myself to come back.    Our Last Bad Experience...  My friend and I decided to dine outside on the back patio. It was a pleasant day with the sun, but slightly on the chilly side. I asked for the umbrella to be closed. That helped, but it was hard to see my friend and get the sun where the umbrella was shading. We lifted out the umbrella out gently and put it out of the way on a vacant table. There weren't any severs around to ask. Shortly after, a server comes out saying the umbrella must go back in. I ask why and she said her boss is watching everything on cameras all over the establishment. -- can we say creepy --  She also said that her boss told her that in the past he had too many umbrellas that broke, he had to pay for them, so he wanted them to stay in the table.  End result, the umbrella went back up. My order was also specifically placed and they had to re-make it twice due to adding additional unwanted foods that ruined the taste.   This is not the first time I've had bad service so for us, we've decided to rule it out of our regular restaurants. Also, Knowing that I'm being watched is pretty freaky.    Cuisine Ordered in the Past..  SPRING ROLLS Egg roll fillings (no meat) wrapped in egg roll wrapper. Served with sweet and sour sauce.  *These are incredible! Yum. To perfection!  MASAMAN CURRY Potatoes, onions and cashew nuts.  *Omg! Delish. I have cravings for this now. I never used to like curry or anything spicy before coming here. This dish really isn't all that spicy. I order it with only potatoes, pod peas, and broccoli. AMAZING!    I wouldn't recommend the onions in any dish though. Not cooked all the way..crunchy.. and not the sweet vadalia kind.   Spicy Tina & Yellow Fin - #1 plate here for my friend!!! She loved it!!  PANTHER - My friend ordered this, with tuna and fish eggs, she loved it 9.5 out of 10.  SHRIMP FRIED RICE Excellent, once again minus onions + broccoli.   PAD SEE-EU Flat rice noodles stir fried with egg, broccoli, and garlic in a sweet soy sauce.  *Amazing!!!  I ordered it with no meat, and loved it!  CUCUMBER SALAD  *Eeek.. only if you like acidic, vinegar tasting cucumbers with little thin rice noodles on the bottom. It came as a complete surprise. Not a fan!    A tad bit about the Servers..   Jackie, a neat Asian dude that was a great server!  Love his attention to detail.   Bunny, also a very sweet older lady who was very kind and helpful.   Nicki, a new girl. Very sweet and accommodating. A great addition to the team.  Maria, initially a great server and seamed to always have a great experience. She was always extremely helpful in knowing the menu. As a regular, she started to call us, \"my ladies\" (not appreciated) and the service provided went way down."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early lunch shortly after opening today.  There was no wait for a table an no one else there yet.  Customer service was good and friendly.  Our first impression was that the lunch prices were about 10-15% too high compared to the other restaurants in the shopping center.  My yellow curry was fine though more potatoes would have been nice.  If it is listed on the menu, having only one small one in the bowl may not be right.  My wife was not happy with her dish which was too salty and barely warm.  We would have thought being some of the first visitors, the food would have been hot.  We are glad we finally tried Thai 1st, but we are not likely to return."}
{"text":"The pad thai was overly sugary and soupy.  We also ordered the basil rolls - they were TINY!  I was expecting a substantial sized roll, like I get at other Thai places.  To be fair, we got ours take-out, but I was not impressed to say the least.  Nothing to write home about....nothing to crave to return to.  I think I will drive the extra 15 minutes to get to Viet-Thai."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food. Recommend the Pad Thai. Good beer selection. I like this place due to the Blakeney location it backs up to the open air park. Good for dinner before listening to music on Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great hidden jem. Located in a corner of Blakney   This Thai restaurant has a great flavor and knowledgable staff. Make sure you talk to your server about the different spice levels."}
{"text":"Food- average,Service- horrible. automatic gratuity added for a party of 4. That's ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Every time we order we always get the same thing chicken pad Thai and yellow curry beef. The food is SO GOOD and their customer service is always satisfactory and so nice. I called to place and order on a snow day and they called me back to tell me they were open and took my order. Haven't found a better pad Thai, and I'm a picky eater."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in South Charlotte! Everything was fresh and tasty. Very clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"I must say, the first experience I had at Thai 1st was a little under-whelming.  However, over the past couple of months I have had some good experiences there.  Their pad thai was enjoyable especially with a little red pepper chili sauce on the side.  On my last visit, I tried their red curry with brown rice.  It was not the best red curry I have ever eaten, but it was pretty good.  On the last couple of visits, we had really good service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place going to the shopping center.  My husband and I LOVE Thai food and was skeptical we'd get NY quality in Charlotte.  This place was pretty good - we had the coconut chicken soup and it was delish.  The prices are a bit higher than I'm used to paying for, but it was alright.  The service was great and super quick, thus the four stars!  We'd go back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Thai restaurant. I had the Tom Yum hot pot with a side of steamed rice and Thai iced tea. The broth of my soup was so flavorful, I couldn't stop eating. They really cook it to perfection! The broth is one of the most well rounded flavors I've ever eaten. Staff is really friendly and I can't wait to go again and enjoy more dishes."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Thai 1 and the food didn't disappoint.....kinda! Half way thru our meal, my Bride noticed a live fly in her dinner. Needless to say, it interrupted our meal. But that's when the entertainment began!  Our waitress said she wouldn't charge us for the fly and removed the meal. We assume to replace the meal. She did return, within 2 minutes, with what she said was a child's portion but assured us it was a fresh meal. Funny thing is she never returned to our table.  Another waitress, also part of the comedy team, cleared our table and brought our check, which included both meals. When I mentioned the live fly she responded, \"see even the fly wants to enjoy our food\"!   While the meals cost wasn't significant enough to debate with a skilled comedy team, I was a bit taken by their flippant attitude. So I asked if she really expected me to pay for a meal with a live insect in it.   The comedy routine continued, as she asked, \"was you meal served with the fly or did it enter during the meal?\". I suspect my facial expression reflected my displeasure.   She begrudgingly removed the meal from our check but couldn't resist one final joke, drawing our attention to an open door,  with a chair strategically placed, to assure the staff easy access to the outdoor seating. \"See, that where the fly came from, not the kitchen\"! I couldn't help but wonder if the open door was part of a health code?  Next time your craving Thai food and live comedy, I suggest Thai 1st Bistro! Good humor and free fresh protein!"}
{"text":"Has been years since I have been here, now I remember why...$16 pad Thai with no shrimp (because I didn't want it) and small portion.  Seriously ridiculous and it was mediocre.   Will stick to my favorite Thai place not far from here."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Thai food. These guys were average. Taste is unremarkable. I'm not sure why they got an award. Possibly the food was better three years ago. Maybe it was from someone who didn't eat a lot of Thai food.  *I asked for a receipt and the cashier told me they usually don't give one for cash payment. When I asked again for the receipt, stressing that if I had been dine-in, they would have given me my receipt, she had to get the manager to show her how. Manager was telling the girl that you always give a receipt (me: duh. Also me: duh) as they were walking up to the register. *I had to ask for soy sauce and she gave me one packet. It's a good thing I had extra in the car. *Whoever tied the bag tied it pretty tight. I really had to dig to untie the knot. *She did give me chopsticks in the bag but no napkins. Again, it's a good thing I have them in my car. *At least the service was fast and there were at least four pieces of shrimp in my order (my standard fav, Pad Thai).  *Not much green onion or chopped peanuts, and they gave me a halfway dried lime slice with a few drops of juice left. Maybe their other dishes are better, though I dare say you shouldn't mess with the national dish of Thailand. *If you're desperately really craving Thai food, these guys will do. I'm from California, where they have loads of different Asian communities with lots of real family restaurants, and I miss real good Pad Thai. *I will continue the search for good Thai food that's not a formal foo-foo restaurant. I'll let y'all know if I ever find one."}
{"text":"First visit to this Thai restaurant. It is located in the Blakeney Village just beside an Italian place called Cucina Italiano.  Greeted and seated by very friendly waitstaff the booths are comfortable and the atmosphere was inviting.  The menu had a lot of what appeared to Me to be Chinese and sushi options which I wasn't expecting...  but there were Thai items as well so there was that option for some whom may want other options?  I ordered an appetizer- Edamame and the special- Pad Woon Sen with chicken.  My friend ordered the Pad See-Eu with chicken and fresh Basil rolls.   The edamame came out just minutes before the meal so we really ate our way through the appetizer as well as meal at same time.  My food was delicious and I had a shrimp basil roll as well.  It was really good!  There was such a large lunch portion that the \"to go\" box will surely serve me another complete meal!  The food was flavorful and delicious! I would say this will definitely be a book mark on my list of places to eat!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, friendly and attentive service, and great food.  Got the yellow curry with tofu.  Ate it ALL!  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I meeeeaaaannnn... maaaybeee I need to order something different. It's like when you go to a restaurant and you just pick something off the menu that looks good and by the end of the meal you're practically licking your plate and scooping bits up with your finger cuz it was a dope a** dish. You just know if you go somewhere else for the same dish it won't be the same. Well I've experienced that with some dishes including Green Curry. Now I understand every restaurant is going to be a bit different. And compared to what I've had previously... well that was the case this time.   I LOVE me some green curry. I love the coconut flavor, some cooked but crunchy veggies and shrimp or chicken... whatever I prefer at the time. There's no point in saying where I've had the best curry because it was overseas.   On to this dish. Yeaaa ummm... it was aight. Really just aight... and I say that because of the price compared to the portion size. I paid muthafreakin $17!  Check the pic and you will see how anyone would be a bit befuddled by the fact that they paid so much for such a small dish. That's like barely 2 portions and this was TO GO!  Luckily I wasn't that hungry because I would have torn it up with nothing to show for it the next day.   The flavor was aight. I had to add salt and pepper for mas flavor. It was a light coconut flavor, like they used diet coconut when they mixed the veggies and shrimp or maybe it was water? The veggies were crisp and the shrimp were a nice size. Also, the rice was good, even the next day it held together fine.   The lady who took my order was very accommodating considering I pretty much made up my own dish practically switching out all the veggies for different ones.   Now the lunch price is about $10. I would be willing to pay that price for what I received... sooo... i would be willing to go back and give it another try for lunch obviously hoping I get the same amount and maybe a lil bit more coconut flavor in that bad boy.   So....  Star: Service Star: Accommodations Star (potentially) for portion of food/price of lunch"}
{"text":"Maybe its my being a North Eastern food snob that has me dissapointed in the Thai 1st bistro, but I have to say I was extremely dissapointed.  A friend in the Tyne advised me to this place and said they heard it was pretty decent so I decided to try them for takeout.  Perhaps one day they had decent food, however I will definitely not be headed back.  I ordered the Pad Kee Mao, also known as Drunken Noodles based on its origin.  The noodles were not the correct style of noodles for the meal, let alone quality.  It was as if they had boughten the cheapest noodles they could find at Harris Teeter.  For 15 dollars I thought I would be in for a great meal, but in the end it was just tasteless.  My search for excellent Thai in the Charlotte area continues, but to anyone who is looking for an honest opinion, for both quality and price point, I would avoid grabbing Thai here, as Pad Kee Mao is an extremely common Thai dish, that should give an indication of a majority of the menu."}
{"text":"$40 for a quick lunch for 2? No appetizer or drinks. Really? Tried this restaurant for the last time. Much better and less expensive options available in the South Charlotte area. Food okay, but too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I have eaten here more than 10 times. Everything has been great, super fresh and delicious. In my opinion they have the best thai food in Charlotte. The sauces are amazing. If you like Thai, you must try this place."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai in Charlotte. This is our favorite Thai restaurant pretty much anywhere.  The sushi is really good. Service is always awesome. Great patio with play area for kids too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai food and have been to the few (and far between) Thai places around Charlotte, but this place was awesome last night! The food was so fresh and delicious, I think I ate the entire monstrous dish of pad Thai in record time (after stuffing my face with their basil rolls). And honestly that's impressive because the portion size could've fed my family of 6. The wine was great, although I was tempted to try some of their martini specials because they sounded amazing! (Thurs is half price martini night) I'll be back soon and I'm bringing my other Thai loving friends!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST Thai food in Charlotte!!! Terrible food,  worse service!  Save your money and  go elsewhere. We'll never go back there."}
{"text":"Normally this place is really good.   Tonight,  not so much.   Ordered 3 appetizers, all of which came out at different times.  Threes lay off the 3 at the same time as one of the 4 meals.   All 4 pad Thai meals, all of which came out at,  again different times.  The other party we were with had issues with their meals,  when asked to speak to a mgr we were told she was not here.   When we asked the server to see the mgr, magically there she was.  Standing behind us the whole time.   Meal was missing normal cilantro, no chili paste or even asked if we wanted it.   Adked for a spoon 3 times,  no refill of waters.  This was a really bad night.   It will be a while before coming back."}
{"text":"The service was laid back, but very good!  My niece and nephew both have allergies so, the waitress told the cook and he made up a bowl of soup that was good and met their needs.  My sister had a Nom sod salad, and I had a Laab salad, and we split a hot pot of spicy shrimp soup.  There were no complaints! The food all had good spice and tasted fresh.   Overall a good experience!  The only reason for a 4 star rating is the price and portion size is a little out of balance. Its not that I wanted more food, but the prices are a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"Good is great. Server was super nice. We love the Pri king, Thai jasmine tea, prad Krapa and we had an awesome appetizer like a lettuce wrap. Sorry I forgot how to spell them and some names, but the food is really good and the service too."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I've ever had. I actually made a Yelp account just so I could write a review about this place. I've worked in a restaurant/waited tables since I was 16 years old. I understand that everyone has bad days, but it took 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge I was there. I then ordered an appetizer and my lunch. It took 20 minutes for my shrimp rolls to come out, and the waitress never even came by to ask me if I enjoyed them (which I didn't). I then got my entree. It was okay. Again, no one checked on me. I went my whole lunch without a drink refill. The lunch was okay, just incredibly salty. I had to ask the hostess for my check because the server was chatting in the back. I asked to speak to a manager and I told him my complaint. He told me that they did team service, and that everyone was my server. Now, I've done team service before at my restaurant and if you team something, you should be giving twice as good of service and you should have multiple people checking on you. The point of working together as a team is to make sure at least one person has a chance to check on a table. Let me also add that this place wasn't very busy. Needless to say, the manager was very unapologetic and it was an awful experience. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"This is excellent Thai food. Three of us went out to dinner and got different dishes.   Pad Thai was the best I've ever tasted. Absolutely perfectly seasoned. Pad Prik was very spicy and tasty. Thai Lovers with a massaman curry was a new dish for me and was unbelievably tasty.   My wife spent the entire meal saying \"mmm\" after each bite.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Jeep and Malia extremely helpful.  Smile and great service.  Great great thai food.  Tom yum soup really great. Happy that we decided to come here!!!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars for the food, another one star for the drink specials  Pretty good but not great and I don't know how they can justify the priceson some of the items : $23 for a so-so basil duck, $10 for a Tom Yung soup??? Crazy,   On the other hand the Nam Sod appetizer ($6.95) is excellent and the Spicy eggplant w/ pork ($14) was very good. Tuesdays and Thursdays they serve serious martinis for half price (4$!!!) other days they have wine specials,  Conclusion: if you order judiciously and you can have a fun Martini-Thai dinner, order indiscriminately and you'll spend too much on too little. If we lived nearer by we'd probably go back often ( I'm a sucker for Martini)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Best Thai in Charlotte. We go weekly and are never disappointed.  Pad Kaprow and Pad Prik are among my favorites. Wait staff is excellent."}
{"text":"They charged me dinner menu prices at lunch time, gave me a small lunch portion, wouldn't allow me to talk to the manager, about the portion and mediocre quality of food. Then manager's wife came out and yelled at me in front of the rest of the restaurant and said that she couldn't predict the size of my stomach when cooking."}
{"text":"If I could get ZERO stars, I would. I've eaten here several times. Aside from being a little over priced, the food and service are generally good. Not tonight. I opted for my usual. Pad Thai, no egg with shrimp only. When  my plate hit the table, all I could smell was fish sauce. I took a bite, and could hardly swallow it. I informed my server, she argued that the sauce is a shrimp sauce, swearing that there is no fish sauce in the pad thai. She said something to another server and just walked off. She never came back! The second server was sweet. I told her that my meal reeked of fish sauce, and asked if it was indeed in the recipe. She said \"there's fish sauce in there, there always is.\" She went on to explain how the sauce is made in large quantities daily and the recipe is usually the same, but they may have added too much that day. I asked what my options were, she recommended a different noodle dish. Explained that it was \"full of veggies\".  Now, I will say, I should have asked what kind of noodles, but at this point, I'm super hungry. The dish came out, it didn't look appetizing at all. It was full of veggies, but had thin clear noodles in a brown sauce, it was dry. I didn't care for it, at all. I asked if I could pay for my appetizers and drink. She came back and informed me that the Manager would not remove the food from my bill. He said there was nothing wrong with it. I explained that there was DEFINITELY something wrong with the pad thai, and that I didn't know what to expect for the second dish, as it was ordered solely from her recommendation. The manager NEVER came to my table. He wouldn't come and face me. He sent messages back and forth via the server. Who does that?! I was made to pay. A $30 tab for food I didn't eat. I will never patronize this restaurant again, ever."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! Pretty good size servings my only issue with this place was I looked at the menu they have on there website to place my pick up order and I guess they have a lunch and dinner menu but only have the lunch prices on the menu online so I was planning on 2 meals being about 23.00 and it was 32.00.  Food was good tho and my husband and j shared some noodles and curry"}
{"text":"Worst Thai food ever! No lunch specials, no side dishes, no side salads or side soups available to order ($10 for soup? Really?), terrible service, everything was too expensive for what you got, annoying music, and worst of all, their food sucked. Frozen crinkle cut carrots in my curry?! Really? Sauce on our dish tasted fake and from the freezer. The cream cheese stuffed rolls were gross. I'm not too hard to please with any kind of Eastern-style food, but this was atrocious. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Tonight we were treated to two amazing meals. The flavors were outstanding and the service was friendly and prompt.  Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my dining mate. We were greeted by a very friendly waitress in a very cozy restaurant. The menu features a nice assortment of Thai dishes: appetizers such as lettuce wraps, various rolls,  soups, salads, traditional Thai dishes in all categories for beef, fish, seafood, duck, chicken, curries, noodles, rice and sushi rolls etc. all available for take out. The prices moderate, adequate portion size and plated nicely. Food came out hot and was tasty. We ordered the almost $10.00 chicken coconut soup, enough for 4 servings. It was delicious. The spring roll, crispy and basic. Our chicken satay appetizer was tender with a tasty peanut sauce. We certainly would return to order a dinner entree. See my photos for specific menu choices. The restaurant is open 7 days a week ."}
{"text":"So this was our first visit to Blue Thai Basil, Waitress was very nice, Shelby was her name. We ordered  1 order of Chicken Satay, and the special Basil Rolls. The Satay and Peanut sauce were good.. tender and grilled. The Basil Rolls were like a Rubber Eraser... gummy and thick skinned...On to the Entree's,We ordered the Chef's Specialty Crispy Duck that looked beautiful on the plate...But alas.... Not Crispy..at all...The coconut sauce over the duck and the veggies ( pea pods, carrots, red pepper) was really incredible...We had Chicken Fried Rice ..it was excellent...Service was good...but I don\"t think it will top Thai Taste on 51....Nothing surpasses them except the other location of Thai \"Taste!!"}
{"text":"It was great restaurant, however the server i seem to always get the same lady and she can be a bit much. Its great that she know what i want to order however she does not have to be rude about it. Which she has been several times that i've been, the way she comes off isnt friendly at all."}
{"text":"My wife and I pulled up reviews on \"THAI 1st\" in the parking lot of the restaurant. My  wife put the blinker on for the exit to \"Crankyville\" because she was hungry. I was skeptical because of the bad reviews, but when my  wife is hungry, decisions need to be made quickly. So we jumped!    The waitress we had was an absolute sweetheart, didn't catch her name, but she was of asian descent. We made her aware of my wife being Celiac and she quickly got us a Gluten free menu. We both order the typical PAD THAI, which we love. The food arrived lightning fast (Thank you GOD), and was very tasty. My wife's PAD THAI included large shrimps, which she said was not fishy at all.     The place had a steady flow of customers with heads down and forks in mouths, so I'm not sure of the bad food reviews. Maybe something else on the menu would change disappointed YELPERS minds."}
{"text":"The food is not so great but out side ambiance is good. Every thing is too sweet and lot of creams.i feel that I'm missing some thing real Thai food taste. Price is also bit of expensive. But still I give 3 stars since  The area is near to kids play area so you can have fun some evenings family with kids when you visit this place."}
{"text":"Bad sign when they only offer dinner menu on sunday lunch. The server told us that the dinner portion is larger...not true! Ordered chicken noodle soup ($9.95) and garlic chicken with white rice ($13.95). Both are in my opinion WAY over priced. Both dishes uses thinly sliced chicken breast which was blanded, the soup had bean sprouts, green onions, and fried garlic pieces. The garlic dish is just stir fry with some garlic soy with cilantro with some sliced lettuce. As you can see in the pics these 2 dishes don't worth the price respectively. I can get bigger portions for less than that at Pei Wei or at Ghengis Grill. So the verdict is that I won't come back ever again."}
{"text":"Great thai food and service here! Can't even complain. Best beef salad and coconut chicken soup I've ever had. I don't even like coconut that's how good it is."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today since it's so close to my work, and I was really pleased throughout the entire experience! I chose to do take-out since I was short on time between meetings, so I called in and Julia answered with the enthusiasm that I wasn't expecting from a hostess. She took my order, gave me advice on what to order since I'd never been before and said my 2 entrees would be ready in 5-10 minutes ~ this was a definite plus since I'm always looking for something quick!  When I arrived, the decor and lighting of this place is really modern with a touch of Thai - since I'm used to Thai House's elaborate wood work, this was a welcome change and somewhere I could see having a dinner date or group there.  Julia was ready with my food, and she was so helpful about what else was in the area since I mentioned I never knew they were there until I saw them in the Entertainment Book! Now on the the food....  Pad thai - I chose spice level medium and it was PERFECT in terms of spiciness. No burning in my mouth, but enough spice to make me grab some water after a few bites and to me that's perfection. The portion was generous, but there was only 1 shrimp in my order and 3 pieces of chicken, amongst a lot of thin noodles.   Pad Karpow - God I hope that's how you spell this dish. Delish! A friend got it with Tofu and spice level medium. Rice on the side, I literally hated myself for not ordering this! A lot of onions, it could have been a bit more varied in the vegetable dept, but other than that this was a 5 star dish.  Overall, a great spot with friendly, quick service. Expect to pay $8.95 for a lunch entree, wait only 5-10 minutes and be sure to accurately ask for your spice level!"}
{"text":"Good food, comfortable, and causal, but they could use a little help with service.  I'm not sure if it was because it was the day after Christmas or if it is usually like this, but there were only two servers for the entire establishment, so there was a little bit of a wait. To their credit, even with the lack of help, our waitress still managed to regularly visit our table.   The food, as good as it was, was a little pricier than what I'm used to for Thai food although it certainly could have just been because of the upscale area that it's in. I ordered the fresh basil rolls ($5.95) appetizer, but was a bit surprised to only receive two small rolls for that price. I ordered the green curry ($14.95) and added the sea food combo (additional $4) which included shrimp, oysters, and what I believe was imitation crab. With the white rice mixed in it was absolutely delicious.   My two dinner mates both ordered the same mild pad thai ($14.95), but when they began eating they realized that there were distinct differences in the level of spiciness. Even the color of the noodles were different, but it wasn't immediately apparent because of the low lighting. I can't attest to their meals myself, but despite the spiciness not being what they ordered they still throughly enjoyed their meals.   If you're looking for decent Thai food this place will hit the spot, but it may be hit or miss on the quality of service you receive and again it's a bit on the pricier side for what it is."}
{"text":"I'm super surprised by the rating on here. We've been coming here for years and I have to say they have some of my favorite sushi! I've had almost everything on their menu and have never been disappointed. On one occasion I actually ordered the wrong thing and when I requested the other dish, they made it without charge. Their staff is super friendly and will go out of their way to make sure you're taken care of. We especially love sitting on the patio while the kids play at the park. My husband loves their chicken pad Thai and I have too many favorites to list but I love, love, love their Nam Sod! The flavors are so fresh! I also really love the Happy Garden sushi roll!"}
{"text":"I'm always around the ballyntyne area, but I never realized there was a thai restaurant in blakeney! My friend told me there was a thai restaurant around the area so we both came here for the first time. My friend and I were craving thai food and It didnt seem too busy for lunch hour so we were seated quickly by a very sweet waitress who was also very attentive. My friend and I both ordered the pad thai. Usually when we go to thai restaurants, I can never taste the spiciness so I decided to get the very spicy option where my friend decided to get a medium spicy one.  As my friend and I were conversing, the food came out surprisingly quick. The pad thai was nonetheless VERY SPICY even for my friend who got the medium spicy option.  I've always considered myself to be able to hold down my spice well but after a few bites of my spicy pad thai, my glasses began to fog up. It was delicious! Inside, the restaurant was darkly lit but just enough light came through the windows for a good atmosphere. The decor was not the typical older asian restuarant as it had a modern twist. As the only thai restaurant where I can actually feel the spice I'm my mouth, I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Food is tasty enough... chicken in Pad Thai tough as leather though and it's not like our waitress came back to check on our group.  Nooooo not at all.  She never came back to check on drinks, on our food. Nothing!! No the only thing she did DO is charge us 18% Gratuity for a party of 5!!!  Charged $2.25 for Seltzer Water!  My first visit to Thai First.... kinda left a bad taste in my mouth!  Literally!  So many restaurants to choose from around here... which means why do I need this aggravation, right?  Poor service and the prices on the website is not what they charge at the restaurant!!  :("}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but the service and policies stink...  In our group of four, one of us asked about the special and whether it was spicy. We were told it had very mildly spicy but once it came, we had one bite and it was way too spicy for our taste. We sent it back and ordered a different dish but when the bill came, our server brought the boxed returned dish and explained that she had only taken 50% off the price of the returned dish and had also added the gratuity. When we expressed our disagreement, she said that was their policy and she couldnt do anything else about it. Eventually we sought out the manager and after speaking with him he refunded the whole amount of the dish and also took away the boxed dish!   In a market with many excellent restaurants, it is unlikely that a restaurant with these policies will stay in business long. As far as I am concerned, I am not going back!"}
{"text":"My son and I moved to Charlotte just over a year ago. I was on a Pad Thai kick right before we moved so when we arrived needless to say I was immediately in search of a new place. My son prefers Chinese dishes, so when I saw that Blue Thai (now Thai 1st) had fried rice and Pad Thai we had to try it. We were not disappointed. The decor is simple and modern with low light and some asian decor. It is a small restaurant, but we never have trouble getting in and the service is fast. Our servers have always been knowledgable and fast. Now to the food!  The fried spring rolls are great. I prefer the spring rolls to the egg roll wrappers so that was a major plus for me. They are rolled tight and are vegetarian, which is also a plus. The sauce that it comes with is sweet and spicy and really good. The first time we went I got the Chicken Pad Thai and my son got the Beef Fried Rice. You can add heat to either dish so I got mild and he got medium. The mild was almost perfect, but might be a little too hot for those not used to it.  The pad thai had a good amount of meat and vegetables and lots of pad thai flavor. I like mine extra peanut-y so I always get a side of peanut sauce, but it really is good without it. You get a decent portion too, so it could almost be two meals for a light eater.  The beef fried rice was so good I started getting that along with my son on future visits. Lots of beef, fried nicely and seasoned!  We've also had the chicken skewers and Pad Prik - again both great.  Overall a great place and the only down-side is they don't deliver!"}
{"text":"The service is amazing & so is the food!!! I love how they have their own menu for vegetarians and lays out what is suitable for veggie lovers to eat.  My favorite place in Charlotte & I've tried many places!!"}
{"text":"Lived in Charlotte for almost 8 years now & this is probably my favorite Asian restaurant in the city. The Thai food is phenomenal. Their sushi rivals upscale japanese. The environment inside is very relaxed & enjoyable. Outdoor patio is the best view in Blakeney shopping area."}
{"text":"Man I love Thai 1st! The servers here are so nice and the food here is just absolutely amazing! My favorites are pad Thai, if I want something sweet and sour and a hint of spicy (you can choose between mild, medium, or Thai hot) and pad see-eu is an all time favorite that I will never get tired of. The place has a Thai feel and the way the servers treat you makes you feel not pressured to choose anything and are open to many amazing dishes. And they serve sushi now! And man it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Came here with the hubs for a dinner date. It's been a long time since I've been here and my husband has never been here. We got sat right away and ordered without any issues.   My husband got a sushi appetizer and he liked that it was very fresh. I got the pad kee mao with chicken and my husband got the pad prik. Overall, the food was very good but the service wasn't that great. Once we got our food our server pretty much disappeared even though we were only one of two tables in the whole restaurant. I never got a drink refill. She stopped by real quick and we asked for boxes and she said ok and walked off and literally didn't come back for 10 mins. I'm not even kidding. I can hear her talking with her coworkers the majority of the time. She finally came back and asked if we wanted dessert and we declined. She said she would be back with the check and she didn't come back for another 10 mins. We tried to look for her but couldn't find her but could hear her voice. We were so ready to go. We finally paid and left. It's ridiculous to wait that long when you are only one of two tables in the whole restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go one night and I got the Pad See Ew with chicken (I hope I spelled it right). First off, way overpriced. I understand it is in Blakeney and this is a prime location for restaurants but charging $16 is too much for the quality of their food. The ratio of noodles to chicken is poor, I got so many noodles and probably about 5 pieces of chicken. The dish was plain tasting and I've had better Thai food In Charlotte.   On some positive notes,  the waitress that took my order was nice and friendly. The order was ready in about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Changed my mind, would give 1/2 a star or none if possible. After explaining my experience to a few others, I remembered I left out a critical part of the experience. I asked for a \"fried egg\" for my dish and was told that the \"mexicans\" in the kitchen could not make said fried egg! A FRIED EGG! SERIOUSLY! Yes they had eggs I was told, but unable to serve a fried egg... nuff said... NOT coming back... back to Bahn Thai!"}
{"text":"Positives: I've never ordered anything here I didn't like. Negatives: Ballantyne pricing.   My typical order entails an order of the summer rolls, tom kha gai, and ginger chicken over white rice. Oooh, don't forget to order a Thai Iced Tea!"}
{"text":"Best experience for sushi in Charlotte last night. You will feel you are in New York City. The fish was very fresh!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Ballantyne.   The basil rolls are refreshing & unbelievably flavorful. The Tom Yum soup is fantastic.   The service is always on point."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  High quality.  Soups incredible (and meant for 2x people).  Relaxed atmosphere.  Understand some of the prior concerns regarding cost; yet, prices not out of line.  If you want a Fabo restaurant in SE Charlotte, expect paying a buck more for the setting, location and convenience.  There are some decent cheap, greasy Pud Thai joints.  Love those too.  That's NOT Thai 1st."}
{"text":"The sushi at this restaurant is absolutely delicious! I sat at the bar and had a wonderful experience with sushi chef, Sangki.  He asked me a few questions about the types of fish I liked etc. and then gave me a few recommendations on what to order.  My favorite was the happy garden roll.  Each roll was packed with flavor and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Off in the corner of Blakney, this spot could easily be missed, but shouldn't. The inside is quaintly decorated with paper umbrellas and the service staff was very friendly and never rushed you.   I only came for their sushi, but the presentation of everything was like art. The cucumber salad was thinly sliced and delicious, a great light start to a meal that could easily be shared. I also ordered the spicy crab tempura roll, and it was piled high with spicy crab, which had just the right amount of heat. It was light and filling, definitely a perfect dinner for the warmer Charlotte nights. I certainly will be back again to try some of their traditional Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Just moved here from DC and had a tough time finding a superb Thai restaurant in Charlotte. I must say this place has saved my lifeeee!! I ordered takeout from here and The pan see-eu was so delicious. The broccoli was cooked to perfection. In addition I order my cousin the shrimp fried rice the presentation was beautiful. I'm glad I found this place. Thank you."}
{"text":"Yay! I moved away from my favorite Thai/Vietnamese restaurant, so I had to find a place that could curb my cravings for delicious Thai flavors. Thai 1st is great! I absolutely love their wonton soup. I seriously craved it everyday during my pregnancy...and after. The fried garlic, juicy chicken-filled wontons, and rich broth is so decadent. If you order some, its enough for two people. But I'm not sharing! No way. I need every last drop in my tummy. Why not? Its just soup...no one's going to ruin a diet eating soup. So eat up! I promise you, its worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I can see why this place is rated 3 stars.... now granted, I only tried one dish here and it was the Pad See-Eu.   I didn't care for the sweet brown sauce that they used.  And their noodles wasn't what I was expecting.  I don't think that I will be a frequent visitor here.  I do know that my co-workers loved the Pad Thai. On the bright side, this restaurant was able to accommodate a large party without a reservation."}
{"text":"I just relocated to the area and wanted something besides drive thru (unpacking is a not for the weak) so it settled on here. I order the pad Thai that comes with chicken and shrimp with a medium heat. OMG it was yum. Stayed piping hot until I got home.  I thought it was a little spendy but worth it for sure."}
{"text":"Guys! As much of a foodie I am, I have to admit I had a bad experience when I was younger. Bad as in, it was my own fault for not really reading the menu and having my father order something for me. I walked in sat down and my waitress greeted me instantly. I told her it was my first time to avoid the explanation for time sake, told her my dietary restricts and offered me two options that best fit what I was looking for. I had pad pakcow... (spelling...?) it was delicious. I would have licked the plate clean had I been in there solo. It was so delicious.  I will return not only for the food but the knowledge and service I received from the waitress."}
{"text":"Came here the night before Valentine's Day.  There was a wait, but honestly I didn't mind,  I expected to wait.  Once we were seated I asked the waitress about their Valentine's Day drink,  \"sweetheart martini\". She said it was \"raspberry flavor\" so I decided to give it a try.  The drink was served with a cherry in it,  I'm allergic to cherries. Unfortunately I had to wait 10 minutes before she came back with napkins or silverware to fish it out.    After taking our order we waited about 20 minutes for the food to arrive.  Ordered the pad thai with no egg (another allergy) and it was just.... ok. The sauce they used didn't taste very good to me.   Our waitress was impossible to find (at this point they were maybe 40% full). The few times she did breeze past the table I'd try to politely get her attention,  only to be ignored.  I finally had to do what I  HATE and wave like a lunatic. Our checks were messed up,  she charged me for 3 drinks,  I only had 2. She didn't charge my friend for her 2 drinks... again,  waitress was no where to be found to correct them.  I finally asked a different waitress if she could help and it was taken care of.   The atmosphere was \"meh\". The food was \"ok\". The signature drink was good,  once I took the cherry out.  Would I go back again?  Sure,  if someone else was paying and I wasn't in any particular hurry. I've had better thai at less expensive places,  I'll probably stick with those restaurants."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in charlotte by far. Food is amazing. Best curries I have ever had.  Prices are extremely well prices. I've been to Thai basil and Thai taste, and they have nothing on this place. And this place is a quarter of the cost. Place is small giving it a cozy feel. You don't feel like you are eating at a chain like pf changs."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this little gem.  I was DYING for Thai food the other night, so my friend obliged and we checked his place out, right across the street from his house.  It was a Friday night and we got a table right away. They seemed totally understaffed and it took us at least 5 min to even get water and menus. I could tell it wasn't the waitresses fault---she just had WAY too many tables. She was very apologetic.   I had the Pad Kaprow which was insanely good. My friend had the shrimp fried rice and he liked it too. Waitress recommended a special sauce with a sriracha base and some Thai chili paste. It was SO good.   Fair prices and good local place to check out"}
{"text":"I had sex on the beach, it was amazing...the spring rolls are also good.  My friend ordered the masaman curry and loved it.  Have been there a couple of times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to Thai First with a coworker for lunch. We walked in and were seated immediately. It wasn't much of a crowd for it to be noon. We were also able to give our drink and meal orders pretty quickly. My coworker ordered the Thai Lover. Their Masaman Curry sauce is her favorite. I ordered the Three Flavor Shrimp and an appetizer of the Shrimp Rolls. As I ordered the Three Flavor Shrimp she explained that it would take a bit longer to cook and asked if that was ok. I asked her how long it would take and she then replied \"not long\". Imagine my confusion. But we had time so I ordered it anyway. Plus we had the appetizer while we waited.   The Shrimp Rolls came out fast and looked delicious. I bit into it and it was piping hot. Their serve them with my fave, Thai Chilli Sauce to dip. I must've missed the ground chicken though. Was more like deep fried shrimp, but still good. Though I doubt i'd order it again. Our food came out and it looked amazing. So amazing that I forgot to get my yelp pictures for it lol. I dived right in. They were both served with a side of rice. We shared our meals and they were both absolutely delicious. All of the flavors came through and just danced on my palate. But, were they worth the $20+ prices? Nah. Their prices are a bit steep. I mean I only got like 6 shrimp and a bunch of vegetables. How is that worth $25?  We finished up our food and asked for our checks so we could head out. This was a 30 minute process even when telling her we were rushed to get back to work. We asked for the check, took her 10 minutes to come back with them. When we gave her our cards, took another 10 minutes, then she came back and we asked for boxes, yet another 10 minutes. She also rarely came to our table to check on us while we ate. Was weird as there weren't many people dining. So we finally head out and get halfway through the parking lot and the waitress comes running out saying they charged me for the wrong check. O-M-G!!! Now i'm super mad because i'll be even more late! So I go inside and she shows me the correct price, so I ask them to charge the difference instead of voiding and re-charging. She takes my card, and comes back with a voided check and a new charge. Then I ask for a receipt for the new charge and voided charge, they write \"void\" on the old receipt and give me the receipt of the correct charges that doesn't show my credit card charge. I've never gone through something so ridiculous in my life. And guess what, this took another 20 minutes to do!  While the food is good, I doubt i'd return to Thai First on my own...."}
{"text":"Ive been to this establishment about 3 times in the last 6 months and it seems that every time I go, the service seems to get worst. Today I ordered to go and had to ask for more rice to be added to my order. For the price, theyre very stingy with the portion of food. I asked for plastic utensils and a server told the hostess that they do not provide utensils unless requested... umm.. ITS A TO GO ORDER! I didn't fuss about that as the food is relatively decent. Id visit again but only if I have no other options. Id say save your money. Just WAY TOO PRICY for the portion of food."}
{"text":"We love this place, we've never had a bad meal here. The food is excellent. I usually have the chicken pad prik and my husband usually orders the pad thai. They have a cocktail called Mango No Sticky Rice and it is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii, this was a very comfortable meal. Although the poke wasn't made with Hawaiian ogo, the bright green seaweed was an okay alternative being that we are in North Carolina after all. The Tom Yum soup had body and it was very tasty but on the sweet side. I'm looking for more of the lemon grass touch. Masaman was home cooking tho it could hv a lil more zing added. The waiter is very sweet and attentive!. Will be back over n over I am certain. This is my go-to place for the home cooking cravings.   07-05-17 Power outage n construction work forced us out tonight.  Closest comfort food was here. Tho, too bad the basil roll sauce was too sweet n the shrimp salad a bit too spicy. Shud've requested less  chili.  Ate it cuz we were hungry. Red Lotus drink n Lychee Martini hit the spot just rt. The Tom Yum soup was tasty enuf to want to bring some home. Just a lil salty, not so bad. Love the Masaman curry with cashews shrimp n chicken. Just that and two bowls of rice can b for two ppl. We also took home an order of Pad Thai but it's best to eat it freshly made. On the sweet side, a bit too sweet for me."}
