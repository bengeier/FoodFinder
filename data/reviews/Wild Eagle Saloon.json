{"text":"We came here while visiting Cleveland..and we hit the jackpot!! While most bars are just \"stand around and talk\" bars, this one had so much to offer! First thing we did was get a beer- which you pour yourself from the three different beer stations (each has a different selection- so make sure to look at all three!). While walking around to choose a beer we also kind of got a tour of the bar- with a ton of arcade games, darts, air hockey, pool, bocce ball and ping pong..this place had so many options of things to do! We spent a lot longer at this bar than expected because of this! It's a great change up from your boring old bar. Definitely a cool place to go with friends! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday with three couples.  We really enjoyed the place.  Great food. Liked the games and beer taps.  Really enjoyed he band - Shake 3 X!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I actually did.  The upside would be there are plenty of things to do and games to play. The downsides are #1 the pour your own beer selection is pretty limited and not very impressive. A better craft selection would serve them well here. The whole point of having multiple serve your own stations is to sample a variety, a variety that doesn't include Miller lite, summer shandy, etc. at every station. The place it self is pretty gross as well, I'm not sure if they plan to actually finish the floors and walls or if they think the dilapidated look is making a comeback. I'm gonna assume they'll address this as they may have rushed to open in time for the Indians season. But as it sits now its really a horrible looking place.  Food wasn't bad but wasn't anything great either. Everything deep fried. And I mean everything. If you're looking for something with substance, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had! I chose the coleslaw instead of fries and it is oddly delicious as well, has a bit of a spicy kick to it. The cook himself came out to check on me. The bar staff were very pleasant and funny. They didn't have captain Morgan but a substitute of Sailor Jerry was almost just as good. Very happy I stopped in. Cool place to stop in and check out"}
{"text":"Good drinks for a good price. It's a big place with lots of TVs and fun stuff to do. It's pretty clean and the staff is pretty nice. They have a lot of fun theme nights so check the website! My favorite part of this place is the half price apps after 11pm on week days. Try the spicy mac and cheese balls because they are awesome.   I love to go here with friends to get a beer after school or to just hang out on the weekends. A regular place for us!"}
{"text":"Not a bad bar, I recently moved into the building like right next door so I thought maybe it was time to try Wild Eagle. We decided to go here because my girlfriend was indecisive which is nothing new about what to eat so I figured I heard the food was good, it is close, and I was done waiting for her to find her journey's end.   The bar was relatively quite when we arrived with probably 30-40 people total. This is good. You go up to the sign that says order food and do just that. The bar was full nonetheless but the tables spread all over were pretty empty so we just grabbed one in the main area and waited. I did the online club membership so I got a free app, which was a deep fried Mac&Cheese ball which was pretty dang good. My girlfriend got Chicken and Waffles which came with fries. She ate it so it must have been good as she is picky about food and life. I got the plain burger which was quite good as well. Tasted like those frozen angus patties you get at the convenience store but it was fine. I left a tip and then realized it was basically self-serve so I probably wont tip again because they didn't do anything but it was only a few dollars.   The bar looks nice but a little small town run down bar like. But the odd part is it isn't and it probably appears that way because it is a historical building.   A bunch of younger people frequent this bar and overall it is a nice place to go. I tried it and it wasn't enough for me to run back over and over again but it is definitely a place to consider if friends are over and want food and don't want to walk far from the 9. They have some pretty good happy hour deals as well and the drinks are supposed to be a good price. I asked for a water and I waited a while and never got it but it is a whatever kind of thing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Was there for 30 mins and never once got service. When I went to leave a group of 6 people had the door blocked. Someone spoke up and said very rudely for me to go around. I stated I could not because they had blocked the door. Then a lady got in my face and continued to yell at me to leave. Which honestly is what I was trying to do but this group had the door blocked. I finally lost my cool and yelled for them to get out of my way. Granted they were drunk but simply not an excuse to be rude. I will NEVER go back nor will I recommend."}
{"text":"What a cool place!! But I must warn you that if you don't have your eyes peeled, you'll probably miss this place once you make the turn and its squeezed between buildings (I did). I know downtown has its fair share of bars but I found Wild Eagle Saloon to stand out for many reasons. First off, to get your beer, you load a card and you go to a station with the beer of your choice, scan your card and it fills up your glass (you pay by the ounce). I love that! It's so spacious inside, plenty of room for large gatherings on the weekends. Upstairs and downstairs is filled with a ton of game choices - bowling, golfing, pool, arcade games, basketball or darts. The best part is that every day of the week is a certain event! Whether its live music, monday free game nights or trivia nights. If you don't watch yourself, you could end up at Wild Eagle every day of the night."}
{"text":"We had tickets to State Theater and luckily walked up the street against the theater crowd...and tripped upon this place to have a pre-show drink. We loved the vibe so much we went back after the show to play skee ball in the converted bank vault (so cool!) and play a few rounds of pool. Everyone was chill (workers and crowd) and we are already planning on hanging out again for our next date night. Did I mention the throw back beer shelf? Finally...personality and fun!"}
{"text":"I expected to like this place as it is certainly a cool concept.  Went in for lunch on a Friday, ordered the oversized pork cutlet sandwich with cheese (+$.99).  It arrived with no cheese and was honestly the saltiest thing I've ever had in my life and didn't have any other flavor.  The bun was also scorched.  Without waitresses you have to take it back up to the bar which is awkward when they are busy so I said screw it.  My co-worker had the saloon burger and onion rings and said they were mush on the inside and the burger was OK at best.  I certainly won't go back for food, maybe drinks.  There are way too many good lunch spots around town to bother with this place."}
{"text":"So, we stopped here on a lark, before a show at Playhouse Square, and my, was I pleasantly surprised.  The Wild Eagle is a place that I find unique and interesting. Firstly, they have beer taps on the walls...yup, THE WALLS, a concept that I'd never heard of before. You sign up for a \"beer card\" and the taps on the walls are like BEER VENDING MACHINES, which you pay for with your beer card! I'm not a huge drinker, but the selection was pretty great, and on top of that, the food we had was mighty tasty. We got their chicken and waffles, which were delectable, and the service was also really amazing. The folks there extended every courtesy. The Menu has a lot of quirky foods, including some of the best Mexican Eggrolls I've ever had...come to think of it, they're the only ones of that kind I've had, but they were amazing!   The Wild Eagle appears to be inside of what was an old bank (as is evidenced by the fact that the Ski-ball area is inside of an old vault with the original door in place:) It has two levels with plenty of seating for large or small parties, and plenty of games to play from pool to ski ball to pinball.   Prices were not bad, and, at the time, it was relatively quiet, but I can see the place getting crazy when there's a game in town. One of the few difficulties is that, as with anything downtown, parking is at a premium, so you might have to park one of the many garages in the area and spend a few dollars.   All in all, I have to say, whether you're looking for a wild time or just a nice spot for food and drink, the Wild Eagle is a great place to roost:)"}
{"text":"Stopped here before an Indians game. The way they do beer is probably the coolest method I've ever seen at a bar--put money on a card, tap the card above the tap, and pour away. Not to mention, the price per ounce is ridiculously cheap. I had several Summer Shandys, which typically run you at least $4 a bottle or draft, and that's being kind, and filling my cup to the brim each time was right around the $2 mark. So no waiting at a crowded bar for service plus cheap, quality beer?! Count me in. Then the food...we went for the chili cheese fries and Mac and cheese balls. I've had Mac n cheese bites and balls at different places and they're always good, but these were honestly the best. They were huge and had a spicy bite to them, too. The chili cheese fries were great too, nothing tops curly fries in my book. I wanted to try the pepperoni mozzarella sticks because that seems like a fun twist, but two apps was enough for our first visit. The place is huge and open and I love the rustic/industrial feel. You can write on the walls and beams with sidewalk chalk, which I'm sure will tell some interesting stories once the place has been open for a while. There's also ping pong and bocce ball upstairs, how fun. I'd love to return and with WES's location to Progressive and my boyfriend's work, I'm sure we will."}
{"text":"They have \"inebriation stations\" that let you fill up your beer from a pre-paid card.  Refilling the card can be a pain in the ass, but after that it is really pretty simple.  The food is literally all deep fried, so don't come here expecting to find a healthy option.   Live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"New spot in Downtown Cleveland.  Really cool place!  It's not huge but it's decent sized and occupies 2 floors.  The service is fantastic, the food looks great and the self-serve beer at 3 different libation stations is super convenient.  The grand opening Friday night was perfect.  The place was packed - often at capacity. Everything ran smoothly and everyone appeared to have enjoyed themselves.  Nice to see a new place that supports live local music open up in the area. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Wild eagle is a nice addition to Playhouse Square. They have all kinds of fun activities to do with arcade games, ski ball, air hockey, and darts. They even have an eating challenge that I was lucky enough to walk in and see a participant attempting. They have an innovative way of distributing beer on draft. You can purchase a draft card that you put money on. The drafts are then accessible to the patrons. You just scan you card at the tap for the beer you would like and you dispense your own. Pretty cool!  The only down side is that they were not able to accommodate two of the drink requests made by our group. They could not make us Irish car bombs or Irish breakfast shots... A little disappointed by that.   P.S. Rumor has it that two levels above the bar is a strip club known as \"spread eagle\", but I cannot confirm or deny that fact. I can't help but laugh at that name though! Haha"}
{"text":"I like the close proximity to my work. I went here for lunch to see how it was. My coworkers and I had to ask how to order,  there's no service so you have to order at the bar. Which is a little bizzare at lunch time with how busy the place was. I hope they can keep up with demand given the size of their kitchen, it seems small. I think the big pull for the place is going to be the games available in the bar.  As far as the food, my ordered was messed up and I got the wrong chicken sandwich. I ate it anyways and it was nothing special but at an ok price. I was left still hungry for $9 though, so i was disapointed there.  I don't know why they chose to paint over an existing clock...."}
{"text":"Great to see a fresh new business in the playhouse square/gateway area.  I stopped by for lunch to check them out, and tried the wild chicken bbq sandwich with a side of coleslaw.  The food arrived in a cramped basket, with the cole slaw in styrofoam cup--straight forward, no frills, and very good.  The spicy BBQ sauce has a unique flavor, it's not sweet at all but it works really well in the sandwich. Even though it was during a workday, I had to try the house moonshine apple pie shot too...wow.  It's incredibly smooth and literally tastes like you're drinking a shot of Christmas.    The bar is filled with different types of entertainment like bocce ball, pool, arcade games, skee ball, darts, etc.  Should be a fun place to hang out on a weekend or before a game.  I also really liked the western theme they have going on, the bar is set up with one of those wooden mirror frames behind it.   Overall it seems like they are going for the higher-quality-but-not-pretentious vibe, and I think they nailed it. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Southern place themed and they actually had sweet Tea, doesn't taste like Georgia Sweet tea but it was ok. Vegi burger available .... Multiple floors with basket ball, pool,etc. Good place to hang out while in town."}
{"text":"Quality food for a good price!  Really good burgers, chicken salad, and chili. Cool beer wall with rotating selections. A few arcade games to play while waiting for food. Will be returning."}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air for downtown Cleveland. I went here for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, variety of entertainment and beer selection.  I would describe this bar as an adult version of Dave and Buster's where your player card gets you any beer you can think of and the screaming kids running around are replaced with a refreshing caliber of young professionals.  As for food, we tried some appetizers which were all reasonably priced and super delicious-short wait time too, which of course I appreciated on account of all the beer. Time flies by rotating games of pool, foosball, bocce-oh and did I mention there's a beer pong game that you can play with up to 4 people.  This is definitely a one of a kind bar..and avoiding the stumbling 18 year olds in the flats is just another plus. Check it out, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty interesting.  They seem like smaller more intimate punch bowl social.  Nice old building pretty cool set up.  Games darts bocci plenty seating.  The beer taps pretty cool even bathrooms were nice.   We came down with 15 people. So issues I noticed no one was cleaning tables the garbage and empty glasses building up on tables. NO VALET.  It's awkward street figure they have valet. I understand demographic is 21-30 most do not valet. The Halley building you have park on 3 floor up.  Outside that bartenders were on point hustling."}
{"text":"My company loves to do happy hour here. They offer discounts on well, beer and even apps. They have the pour your own beer option and free games on Monday night. It's a fun different scene for downtown."}
{"text":"I have found my home. Everything is perfectly seasoned and fried. I had the chicken, curly fries, chili, slaw, pepperoni roll thingies, and got their amazing spicy garlic dipping sauce. While eating I watched a screen above the bar tempt me with pictures of their deep fried thick bacon strips. I am coming back to try that! The staff is friendly, attentive, conversational--unlike most of the service industry in this town. Kudos for grease and good cheer!"}
{"text":"Beer- a cool experience with a good variety but pretty over priced (over $5 a beer on a Sunday night)  Had the chicken sandwich- burnt to a crisp. It also seemed like it was very cheap/frozen chicken breasts   French fries were good.   Darts- they had the cheapest darts I've ever seen. The darts literally bounced off the dart board. They can get fairly decent darts off of amazon for less than $20 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XVK5RHW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_jhOqxbETMRB1P  Basketball game- wouldn't sync to two players... Small detail but I would have played more if it did   Bartender- super cool. She was attentive and friendly  Overall this bar COULD be really cool. I think the theme is awesome and the people seem competent. The problem they have is the execution. With some small changes they could make this bar way better!!"}
{"text":"I have to tell you this place is fantastic!!! Stopped by last evening and watched the Cavs game. We served ourself beer of choice by buying the card and then using the card at the libation stations!! So you pick the beer you want and swipe your card and pour. You pay by the ounce. I think this is totally neat! Whenever you want to fill up your glass you can. No need  to wait for a bartender. There are over 20 draft beers to choose from. You can also purchase cocktails or shots or food as well. I ordered chicken along with Mac and cheese and both were very tasty. The place is full of TVs to watch in hi-def and full of games ranging from pool to bocci ball. I stopped and played Galaga! While enjoying a beer.  This location also is great because it's very close to Progressive Field and the Q. It is right next door to Playhouse Square. The place was full but had plenty of help. They are probably over staffed because it's new but I think the setup with the self serve beer stations won't need a lot of help. So the help can focus in other areas.  I will definitely come here again and soon!!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I visited the Wild Eagle Saloon on our last business trip to Cleveland.  It was such a fun place!  I thought the Fill Up Stations (basically beer vending machines!!) were so cool - you load money onto a card and can pay for different beers by the ounce by holding your card up to an electronic card reader - which is a great way to try the beers before paying for a full one.  We also had fun pouring our own beers - I could see how that could be annoying for some people but they also have a full service bar so it's not that big of a deal if you don't want to \"pay to play\" at the inebriation stations.  We did not have any food while we were here so I can't speak to the menu.  I will say that we were heading into the saloon at the same time most of the City of Cleveland was heading out to a Cavs game so it was great for us because we literally had the place to ourselves.  I still have money loaded on my card and am looking forward to coming here again on my next trip to CLE.  I sure wish we had one of these kind of places in Buffalo!!"}
{"text":"Plays terrible loud music. Is the place suburbanites like to get wasted in the city when they come in for sporting events. Like really wasted. And is the racist logo really necessary? Couldn't it just be an Eagle? Chief Wild Eagle was bad enough the first time around."}
{"text":"Very cool bar. We went on a Monday, so all games were free and burgers were $6. Bartender was great. My only complaint is with the pour-your-own-beer system. The idea is great, except twice the line blew, meaning we ended up wasting our money on foam. Another time the beer we poured did not look or taste anything like the beer it said it was. Other than that, it was a fun place."}
{"text":"Ok for drinks I suppose. Food is BK whopperesque with an onion ring or something \"fancy\" thrown on. Not appetizing at all. I got just a normal burger and asked for lettuce. The lettuce was a mixed green salad blend that easily wilted and cooked from the overcooked burger patties (literally mass produced frozen patty). Meat was too char-broiled and thru the bun and L/T/O I requested, all I could taste was char. I had to add ketchup and mustard. Curly fries were extremely over seasoned. I love spicy, that wasnt a problem but too much artificial, salty, msg loaded seasoning was on there. I only ate a few fries and half the burger. Fry seasoning stuck to my fingers worse than cheetos/dorito residue.  Best part was the Two-hearted ale in a can. I didn't feel the pour my own beer was a good idea since you have to load money onto a plastic card for the beer. I wasnt going to try and figure a budget on the beer when it was likely i wouldn't give a second chance at the place. After experiencing the food, I definitely wont be back. Awful experience. I will try the pour my own beer at the Jake as I go to many tribe games. It makes sense there."}
{"text":"The Wild Eagle is quickly becoming a go-to spot, especially on our trips to Playhouse Square. I love the casual and fun atmosphere so it's great for pre-show drinks but also as an all-in-one fun night out destination.  During off-hours (pre-dinner) on Sunday it's relatively easy to get a spot at the bar - prime for watching a game - and/or have your pick of their arcade and other games. As far as I can remember they have indoor bocce, air hockey, basketball hoops challenge, electronic beer pong, skee-ball, and other arcade games (and probably many I am forgetting.)   While I've only eaten here once, I would recommend their sports-pub style offerings. The Southwest Veggie Wontons were good and I REALLY enjoyed the Curly Wolf burger which features a fried hunk of pepper jack cheese. (DELICIOUSNESS!!!!)  Drink-wise, the first thing I ordered here was the Gunslinger, a cocktail that's right up my alley with its blend of bourbon and lemonade goodness. It's telling that in the four times I've been here, I've ONLY order that drink since (sooooo good!)  I would like to return when I have some more time to peruse the games and check out the self-service beer taps they have.  There must be at least 30 of them, all featuring a variety of awesome options.   One time we stopped in with a group of friends to show them the place and they had live music with a rockin' cover band and it was packed with dancing. It was so fun and I'd absolutely love to stop in again when they have live music.  Overall, just a really fun place to hang out with friends and have a meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I usally stop by Wild Eagle Saloon before a sporting event for a few beers and the arcade games. They have a wide selection of beers that you can pour yourself which is pretty neat. Wild Eagle Saloon also has a myraid of games, tvs, and a full bar. I've never tried the food but from what I've seen it looks appetizing. It is a great place for groups or a date night. If you're downtown stop by Wild Eagle Saloon for some fun!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. The Bacon Apps were good, although they were way too raw and fatty. All the other apps were amazing!! I agree with the other folks on here, ordering food is difficult and took a long time because it was so busy. They should purchase the Ziosk machines so you can order right from your table and then go pick it up, or just remove the chairs from the bar when it gets busy. Games and self serve beer made the place a lot of fun, so I will go back. Hopefully they fix the ordering issue."}
{"text":"For the beer and games alone, this place rocks.  I've never experienced the food at Wild Eagle Saloon, but the booze selection, along with the full bocce courts on the top floor blows this place out of the water.   It's a good \"first date\" place, I would mention, as my boyfriend and I had our first date there. You can stay active upstairs with MEGA Jenga, pool, or bocce, or you can stay downstairs and hit up the basketball arcade games and full service bar.   The cool thing about the beer is the \"Pour your own\" feature. You load a card with money and you can go to any of the taps around the restaurant, swipe your card, and fill your glass with the beer of your choice. It's pretty sweet, and convenient, saving you a trip to the bar every time you want another drink.  You go here for the fun. It's a great spot and a beautiful set up. The aesthetic of the place is beautiful and worth a gander."}
{"text":"I've stopped here a couple times already- which is impressive considering it hasn't been open that long. This is a fun new addition to downtown and I hope to see it do well!   If you aren't aware of the concept it can be a little confusing at first because you basically pour your own beer - don't be like me and seem like a confused idiot. To get drinks just stop in at the end of the bar to the left of the entrance and preload a card with however much money you want. (They said for craft beers expect $4ish a glass). Then, there are two \"inebriation stations\" on the first floor and one upstairs that you can get your beer from. Pro tip: if they're out of the beer you want check the other locations cause some are doubled up. One was out and told me to alert a staff member and they promptly (I think, my time scale might not have been the best at this point) switched over the keg.   If you're already tipsy I hope you have as much fun as I did with the games, whether that be air hockey or darts or one of the other 8272 random things in this bar. It might be my new guilty pleasure.  I can't speak on the food quality but my friends ordered the bacon fried bacon two nights in a row so it must have something going for it."}
{"text":"I'm a local and go out to most places in the city and this place is a pit. The interior is dark and dreary and very loud due to the lack of acoustic details and The food is basically fried everything you can think of. If your in the mood to to people watch the trashy folks in Cleveland then this is your place. Otherwise I'd stay far away"}
{"text":"This place is a ten out of ten! It absolutely went above my expectations for a bar. I loved all of the taps that were around the bar. You basically get a debit card and can get drinks on your own time- no need to wait for a server! This place had a great band on NYE and I had a terrific time with all of my friends there. The staff was very friendly too! Also excellent location within a short walking distance of the Q and the Jake! Have a blast with your friends and family and meet them at the Wild Eagle Saloon!"}
{"text":"Really cool new bar downtown. Has some awesome bar games, taps on the wall and some pretty great menu items. The mac and cheese balls are fantastic and are a must get. It's a great place to go before a tribe game that's not crazy slammed. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I chose this place for a quick dinner with the girls. There was a Cavs and Indians game that day but thankfully we got there in between the action. There are no waiters. I was unsure of where to sit for the first two minutes. No one greeted me or made eye contact for the entire duration of my 15 minute wait for my friends. I am fairly certain I looked out of place. I should have read the Yelp reviews first. There is limited seating available. Get there early if you want to sit during peak day hours.   There are arcade games to keep you entertained while here, but I did not play any. The crazy amount of beer on tap leaves one happy and undecided because you want them all. You get to pour your own beer here. No more blaming the waitress for extra foam. It was happy hour so my group took advantage of the offering. The deals are pretty good. I started with the Cowboy Candy. This is literally one thick, long, giant strip of bacon covered in some sort of syrup. I expected it to have a sweet crunchy sugary coating. I am actually not sure it was cooked properly. I was not impressed. I did not eat more than three bites. Next, I had the Chiseler Chili Cheese Fries. I am 100% certain the chili comes from a can. It was awful. The fries were skinny and cheap. I was over this place really fast. My drink was not mixed well and it was quite expensive for happy hour pricing. I would hate to stop here when happy hour is not happening.   If you love beer, you could hang out here for a bit and pregame. The vibe is definitely for the younger crowd. Although, there were no young people in there at the time I dined there. Save your money and eat elsewhere. I realize I only tried two things but that was enough. Looking at the plates of others did not make me want to get anything else. I left quite hungry and sick from the food. It is dark and loud inside. Not a good place to hold meaningful conversations. The floor is sticky. Be careful wearing heels."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland for the RNC. Great bar with great food and so many ways to have a good time. So many games like air hockey, golden tee, pool, ping pong and Bocci ball. Crazy fun time. The Mgr Justin was super cool. Great time."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprise as this was our first time here. We ordered the quesadilla which was fantastic. Made with pot roast and smokey cheese.  A different twist to quesadilla. The chili cheese fries and chicken fingers were also very tasty. We used our CLEseats app and saved 15 % off our bill. There was a lot going on in there including arcade games, basket ball, pool tables also live music."}
{"text":"We went in before a Cavs game last night and there was not much of a crowd. I prefer having a bartender pour my beer, not a fan of the pour it yourself wall. I don't work here, I'm not pouring my own beer. I do think we'll be back though, it looks like a fun spot with the games and it has plenty of elbow room. Love the building. Bartender did a good job. No idea what the food is like, but I do know they don't have wings because my friend asked for them. I thought it was going to be more country themed and was happy to hear no country music the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"To tell you the truth, my apartment is across the street and I pretty much have \"Cheers\" status (they know me by name) so I might be bias with the 5 stars. But wanted to state the things I like from a local prospective.  First if you haven't looked inside, do it! It use to be an old bank and then turned to a bar. Its actually really stunning so don't let the saloon part throw u off.   Second, games everywhere! Also every Monday it's free games. Pool, air hockey, golden tee, pop a shot, etc. everything is free (except for that punching bag game)   Third, great place to pregame before tribe and cavs games since it's so close."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to Downtown Cleveland!  Wild Eagle Saloon is conveniently located right off East 9th St by The 9 hotel.  Its a great spot to grab some drinks, food and play some games.   When you walk into the door there is a bar on the left.  Here is where you place your beverage order, food order or buy a beer tap card.  The cards are used like reusable debit cards except inside of money you get beer or hard cider.  There are roughly 20 beer/ciders on tap with a lot of local options. Once you put money onto the card the bartender hands you a glass and you're on your way (the cards are reloadable so don't throw them away).  One thing to note: the taps charge by the ounce and do not tell you automatically how much one ounce costs until you tap your card and start pouring.  Food is typical bar with an unique twist.  We ordered multiple types of bacon, curly fries, fried pickles and chicken sandwiches and they were all very good.  When you walk in, you place your order at the bar and they will hand you a beeper to let you know when your food is ready.  Once the beeper goes off you head back to the bar area and pick up your food.  It wasn't bad when I went however I can see this becoming an issue once the space has a crowd inside.  There are arcade games on the first and second floors.  Including but not limited to skeet-ball, darts, air hockey, boxing, beer pong, and bocce ball.  The games are around $1.00 each to play.  The space in itself is very industrial with cement floors, exposed ducts and exposed brick walls. There is also an old bank vault with the door still attached, inside is where you can play skeet-ball.  There are high top tables and bar stools scattered around the multiple rooms on the first and second floor with wide open spaces between to linger.  There is also a small stage in the main area which will have live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  Overall I think this will be a good place to come after work to grab a drink and blow off some steam playing some games.  I also can't wait until the weather is nice enough to be able to drink and hang out on the patio."}
{"text":"A country themed bar is definitely something that was missing from the Cleveland scene. I love the location chosen for this new establishment too; this downtown neighborhood needed some late night revelry.   The entire place appears as though they tried to salvage/restore as many building original materials as possible, which aids in creating the old school saloon look. The two-level interior has a nook and cranny for everyone. If you want a bustling open bar area stick to the entry area. My favorite spot was in the back, either up or downstairs. The space there gets a little more cozy, there is more seating, and there are a myriad of fun games that quickly let the time fly by. I liked Foosball the best followed by pool and air hockey. They have two boccie courts as well upstairs and the balls are free to obtain. Come on a slower weeknight and it's a fun atmosphere to learn a new game.   The main bar is on the small side, but they have some nice bourbon/whiskey cocktails. Beer is plentiful too. There are three tap stations (one upstairs) where you pour your own beer after purchasing a prepaid card at the bar. You can pour yourself as little beer as you want so you can sample a few before making a decision on which $4-5 beer you want. The stations were easy to use and conveniently located.   As for food the kitchen service was fast and the burger messy, but delicious. I got the 10 buck Saloon Burger with an onion ring, coleslaw and spicy BBQ sauce. The two thin meat patties, cooked to the kitchen's preferred temperature, were good and juicy. The sauce definitely had some heat to it. Do note that you have to walk to near the front door to pick up your food.   I'll be back to try out a live music night and play some more games."}

The bar has tons of self-serve options so you can try many different ones while enjoying tons of arcade style games that are located all over the bar! If you go on a Monday all the games are actually free so you can enjoy yourself with your friends without worrying about paying for games! The food is also pretty good which makes the whole experience even better!"}
{"text":"Great daily deals, on Mondays all their games are free! Even on other nights some of the games only require you to provide your ID in order to play. They have bocce ball, jenga, air hockey, and ski ball. You can either get a drink card or if you'd rather not, you can just get a regular beer or drink at the bar."}
{"text":"This place has great intentions. It wants to be a mini punch bowl but totally misses it. The \"pour your own beer\" is great in theory, but you get nothing but foam. Take it from someone who is a \"wipe the oil off your face to get rid of the foam\" connoisseur, not worth it. And they even have instructions on the wall! Great concept, just needs kinks worked out."}
