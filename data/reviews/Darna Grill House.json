{"text":"Came here to get lunch take out after a coworker told me the food here was good. This location used to be the old Pizza Hut. 

However, upon ordering our food it took quite a long time. They were apologetic but still felt it took way too long. Once we got our food we brought it home. After a 3 minute drive home we started digging in. I had ordered the beef shawarma meal and honestly I've had way better. The salad was average and so was the rice. I wasn't expecting fries in my meal and it didn't go with the meal. At least my kids like fries so they ate it. 

The beef was terrible. It was really fatty, chewy, & dry. I couldn't find a piece of beef in my meal that was not fatty. This was extremely disappointing. I had maybe 6 strips of beef before I called it quits on this meal. 

I wouldn't go back here. After my meal I wish it was still Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Food is not bad.  However, they ripped us off.. advertised on both their menu and website, the price is 5.99 for shish tawook sandwiches, they charged 7.99.  Watch out for secret price increases!  Better options in area.."}
{"text":"We went there Sunday, the girls servers were great, however they have one kid that works there that ignores your requests on purpose...Not sure why but happened twice in row

We got appetizers with no bread (how you going to eat it?? like hummus..) so we asked for bread, he said ok and 15 minutes later no bread on the table, we asked one of the girls and she got the pita bread, it wasn't fresh pita (old) but at least we got pita finally after at least 20 minutes of waiting

We found it hard to eat because no one was taking the empty dishes until we left..., table was a mess

I was existed to try their kenafeh and I asked if they have it, they said yes they do but when I ordered it from the same kid that never came back when we asked for the pita, he said he will check, and guess what, he never checked and never came back for like 20 minutes...We asked other girl and she said she will check, she came back that they don't have kenafeh, I was disappointed

My wife wanted ice cream but by the time we waited for that kid to come back to us the kids were acting up and she left

The dish supposed to come with kebab and vegies, it does not look like the picture, there was hardly any grilled vegies on the dish 

We also ordered Shawerma plate, the chicken was coocked very well however it needs some spices, tasted bland, also the dish didn't come with garlic sauce, only tahina sauce (shawerma should come with garlic sauce, its not falafel)

for halal place, they don't have any room to pray, but they have close by masjed 

their hummus and baba gannoj is awesome"}
{"text":"I just left this restaurant, the food was good, the personal and the lady were kind but please and please, serve fresh bred!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband Decided to check this place out to says ago and was pleasantly surprised.  I had the appetizer platter which came with freshly baked bread.  I have been to many middle eastern restaurants and have not had such good bread in a while.. It was soft and flavorful. The appetizer platter came with 9 things which included generous portions of babganoush,  humus,  tabuli and falafel.  It was quite filling for two of us.  Since we got the meal deal it came with the specialty grill with a variety of meats.  The chicken was tender and the lamb chops were flavorful. If you don't like your meat well done make sure to request that to ur waiter.  We were also informed by the staff that they serve sheesha and decided to order one to enjoy it on their patio for the last few remaining summer days.  The sheesha we ordered was orange mint and we being big sheesha lovers were very happy with it.  
Would definitely recommend this place to try a new touch to the Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Decent middle eastern food. Great pita!"}
{"text":"I am giving Darna Grill 5 stars for an overall great experience and in comparison to every other middle eastern cuisine in the GTA- it is by far the best I have ever had. 

The place is impeccably clean, the kitchen area is visible to customers and is clean as well. The lighting is bright (I hate dimly lit places) and the background music is appropriate with a good volume (I hate places where you can't hear yourself talk!). Overall, it was a new beautifully renovated location (I'd like to emphasize the fact that it is a very pretty restaurant!) with a classy ambiance. The place is huge and can accommodate large families and groups which is a huge plus as well! They do take reservations and you get to eat free on your birthday when you sign up on their website which also gives you 15% off your group bill. I thought that was a great incentive to go there for a birthday dinner party.  (2 STARS!)

One thing that can make or break a business is their service, and theirs was also top notch. They were friendly, smiley and very quick- our food came hot (and stayed hot because of their awesome Darna Grill!). The manager Aliza checked up on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed. (1 STAR!)

My husband and I ordered their special, the Darna Grill (mix-chicken and red meat). It is 39.99 and came with a full mezza that included falafel, tahini dip, tabouli, hummus, baba ghanouj and sliced pickels/tomatoes. They had a special in which they also included 2 bowls of lentil soup. The actual grill came with 2 drumsticks, 2 kofta kabobs, 1 shish taouk, 1 shish kabob and 2 lab chops. The order comes with rice or fries, we opted to do half/half. The meal was satisfying, and filling....and most importantly...DELICIOUS! The meat was tender and melted in your mouth, the grill keeps the meat warm so you don't have to chow down so fast...because who likes cold meat? The portions were very generous and overall it is amazing value for such a meal. (2 STARS!)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and the friendly staff.

Everything was good, especially the falafel and pita bread.

Our son really protested going here but at the end of the meal he reluctantly admitted that loved it too.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a girls luncheon with my sister here today. We were completely blown away with the service and food. The service was very attentive.  They really went above and beyond. The portions were large. The restaurant itself is well kept and cozy. We would both come again !! Keep up the great work guys ... Be back soon."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times already with the fam. Nicely renovated; very attentive service and good food. Good value for the money. Will likely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Worst grill house i have ever been to
We went there around 4 pm and wanted to add fetah to our order but were told the chief is not there so they cant prepare it without him
Then when our main order of mixed grill was served it was extremely dry and most if it was burnt
It was really the worst i have ever had, the kofta was so dry that my son was not able to cut it on his own
I would never recommend this place and will never go there again myself"}
{"text":"Food was cold.service was bad and staff was rude and kabob taste old.they forget to bring the whole order.bread was overcooked.I won't ever go there and never recommend anyone.It was terrible service."}
{"text":"As per our event today the food was very good and the service was very good
