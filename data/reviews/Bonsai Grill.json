{"text":"Fourth and final stop today. We've been trying to make it here for a few months now. They're hours are 11am - 2pm and 5pm - 10pm. It seems that we're always in the area when they're closed. We stopped in today after 5 and enjoyed a couple decent rolls. We were spoiled at the Peninsula just before we came here. Overall a nice little place."}
{"text":"Great asian food in downtown davidson.  Within walking distance of many places, family friendly and varied menu.  My wife who does not like asian dishes will only eat at this Japanese flavored eatery.  Would recommend for a casual night out."}
{"text":"I am a raving fan of any sushi joint that actually delivers... especially one that delivers DELICIOUS sushi at reasonable prices.  The nice part about this place is that they have an entire vegetarian section so if you aren't a raw fish fan, you can still enjoy something besides edamame and California rolls.  We've never dined in, so I can't speak about the facility, but the delivery has been great three times now.  The last time, they even delivered to our pool -- awesome."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this, but something seems to be amiss at Bonsai.  The last few visits have produced really mediocre food, and it never seems to be as full as it once was.  Candidly, the food is now overpriced given what is available elsewhere in Davidson.  The sushi lunch special - at $8.95 - is simply too expensive for what you are getting.  I hope that they will get things turned around soon."}
