{"text":"Really liked this place.. It's geared towards quick and easy and healthy. I'm trying to watch what I eat and the portions are perfect size. The food is not seasoned which is great because I can season it myself and know what seasonings are in it. It is nice for people that can't have all that salt in their food. They can do it themselves and know what they have added. I had the chicken pasta and after microwaving it is was cooked just right. I hate when noodles get soggy, that want the case here. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I was in Chandler this weekend and picked up some food for this week. I like this concept as its quick, easy, fresh and healthy. They are perfectly portioned as most restaurants tend to give you 2-3 servings and the variety of foods is excellent. I particularly like the yogurt parfaits, its like dessert in a cup! Can't wait for more stores to open near my house."}
{"text":"The food is healthy while still being tasty. The store has a variety of options, but it is not overwhelming and the staff is always open to giving you suggestions. Additionally, the food is great for a busy lifestyle. You can just go in, grab what you want, and check out without waiting in line. Once you buy it, all you need to do is microwave it for a few minutes. They even have microwaves at the store to use! Overall, this store has been a great addition the Ocotillo area."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Bright, clean and friendly staff. I like the vast selection of low sodium foods. Foods can be a little bland without jazzing them up. To their Fajita Chicken Bowl I added a couple tablespoons of salsa and a dollop of light sour cream. Hitting some of their breakfast scrambles with salsa and seasoned Mrs. Dash made a huge difference. Not cheap, but didn't think it was outrageously priced. That being said, my wife get's two meals out of a large, so that effectively cuts the price in half."}
{"text":"Restaurant  was very well organized. Employees very eager to help you. Food... A little bland. They have Sirracha and other hot sauces to add to it.  Definitely healthy choices as I knew exactly what I was eating. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Gross! I am so angry with this place! I went tonight for the first time and chose the burrito spinach wrap! A very small portion for 10.00 plus tax! After the first bite I almost threw up! It was so disgusting! The rice was gummy/hard and I know for a fact it must've been sitting in that fridge for days! The burrito had a weird fish taste!! It was literally a ripoff! Will never go again!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend because we were eager for a new healthy place to get food. I got the pesto pasta, steak fajita bowl & the jambalaya bowl. The pesto pasta was ok, but still very plain & made with regular noodles. The other 2 meals were plain as well & made with white rice. This blows my mind. The meals are supposed to be healthy but they are filled with all of these empty calories. Also, none of the rice was even cooked completely. Super disappointing & a waste of money."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and had the salmon alfredo and protein balls for a snack. The staff was really helpful in picking out food and everything tasted great. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It is a little hard to find the location but once I did, I was really impressed!! The staff is super nice and very helpful! It was my first time coming in and the person behind the counter picked up on that, and explained everything really well! I was very impressed! I purchased three items, while they were a little pricey, I enjoyed how healthy there were and pretty good!! I'm always looking for something to make my life easier and this place sure helps!! Combined with going to the gym and eating right, I may just achieve my goals!! But totally check this place out! It's clean, friendly and well organized. I will more than happily come back again and again."}
{"text":"I decided to try this new place tonight after reading about it online.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  The person behind the counter provided me with a menu and explained how everything worked.  I bought two meals and had one for dinner.  It was delicious and very filling.  I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"For meal prep this is actually good. I see some reviewers who seemed to think it was a restaurant... it's not, just an fyi. You can eat your food there but it's more to grab something and go. 

From the \"grab and go\" perspective I think it's pretty good! I like all of the meals, they reheat well, the kids at the counter were super nice. 

The ONLY reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price. Like another reviewer on Google said, you can get a Chipotle bowl for the same price and let's face it- no one F&@$s with Chipotle in the burrito bowl Department. 

I would STRONGLY recommend that Eat Fit Go corporate try to reduce the costs of the meals. Instead of 8-12, 6-10 would be much more doable. 

The fact that so many people say it's too expensive is a flag, the fact that THIS LOCATION is in a solid six figure income zip code is a bright red flag with LED lights attached."}
{"text":"It is based on the My Fit Foods concept that closed which is great however the food is not as tasty or quality and not near as many options. However I would use again because convenient and a healthier option especially for food on the go for a flight crew. I do hope they step up the taste options. It is more expensive then what my fit foods offered as well by a bit"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Staff very polite and helpful. I got the lemon salmonella n with asparagus. It was really good! My only complaint would be the $13 price per meal, but that's the price of convenience. I will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"It's awesome there is a healthy place in the area! I was looking for something that was quick and healthy. They have small and large meals, snacks, and drinks in their refrigerators. I got the large citrus salmon dinner and the veggie cup with dip. The veggies in the cup were dried out. The carrots were really really dry. On the other hand, the salmon dish was delicious! I really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again. If you are looking for a healthy portion sized meals, this is your place!"}
{"text":"He food was decent, but the price a little steep. I can make three times as many vegetarian tacos for the same price as the three I purchased. Also, they didn't have vegan options."}
{"text":"Came in here today after driving past a few times and wondering what it was. I was highly confused when I walked in because it has the appearance of a restaurant but had microwaves sitting in the corner and a wall of fridges. The employees were helpful enough to explain how the food and prices worked but left me confused after I bought a tray didn't point me to where to go or what to do afterwards so I heated up my small plate of food that was way over priced for how much you actually get and microwaved it and ate it in my car. I'm disappointed I thought this place would be more enjoyable but there was a lack of explanation by the workers and another disappointment when you realize your literally getting a single serving portion of bland food for $8-10. Good idea but definitely needs refining. Oh well."}
