{"text":"Pretty, pretty good. I ended up here the day after thanksgiving after seeing that the wait to eat at a deli was out the door. I wasn't thrilled with the change of plans because I didn't want to eat bar food, but I was pleasantly surprised by the American Tavern. The perogis I ordered more than made up for it. Hot off the skillet they were served with caramelized onions, sour cream and apple sauce. Seriously yummy. We got an order of garlic wings to start and they were crispy and very meaty. The guys I was with ordered burgers and enjoyed. And a woman at the table next to us ordered the biggest, juiciest looking grilled hot dog I've ever seen. We were actually all jealous of her. Very friendly service, the waitress made it seem like we were eating at someones house and not at a restaurant. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Although the menu could use a few new items, this place is a weekly staple.  Wednesday is wing night and they might just be the best in town.  Cold beer, great wings, juicy burgers and plenty of dinner sized salads.    If bar food is in your plans, this is the right bar."}
{"text":"Has a vibe like eating at your great uncle's house or any other place that is dark with old pictures on the walls and hasn't been updated in so many years. The servers were very friendly and the portions are pretty big. I expected greasy bar food but actually it was decent. Lots of nice flat screen TV's everywhere. Had a huge piece of peanut butter cheesecake for dessert. But couldn't get past the fact that everything kind of seemed sticky."}
{"text":"Really solid food.  The atmosphere is laid back and service is always friendly.  This is not where you go for fine dining, but it's a really useful go-to when no one at our house feels like cooking."}
{"text":"Nothing special, was in from out of town and this was recommended. Had a burger, fries and a drink at the bar. Not a very friendly play and nothing special at all about the food. Just an average place and one that i would not come back."}
