{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Amazing Chicken and Waffles. The restaurant is located as part of the food court at Fiesta Mall, but it feels like you're sharing a bit of home. The owners provide REAL flatware (rare for a food court), your own caraffe of syrup, and your own bottle of hot-sauce. The owners were engaging and helpful. The food was made-to-order and was absolutely delicious. Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Julies used to be located on Dobson and Guadalupe but had shut down, we only noticed her restaurant because her sign was still up. My BF and I wanted to check it seeing that it was a \"Chicken and Waffles\" restaurant but come to find out she was no longer there. Besides having to drive across town to go to Lo Los we thought it was cool that there was one closer to us. One day we were wondering Fiesta Mall and we noticed the same name. Went up to her and asked if it was the same place and sure enough it was. We ended up ordering food from her. We got the entree with a chicken wing and thigh with the waffle of course. and a side of \"fried corn\" very fattening I know lol they also suggested that we get the \"Obama\" drink which was enriched with ice tea and brown sugar and some other stuff. It was really really sweet too sweet for me and I have a sweet tooth. Anyways the food took quite some time to cook, which is good because we know its fresh. 

It was a mother and son running the business which I am all for supporting family owned businesses. They were very friendly and can have a good conversation with. I would definitely recommend it, but sadly they are no longer there. I dont know if they moved to another location or they completely shut down. So I cant help you there."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and had a pretty good experience both times.  The first time, about a week ago, I got the basic Chicken and Waffle combo.  The chicken came out piping hot.  Both were delicious.  The only problem I had was five minutes after I got my food and before it had a chance to cool off, a security guard came up to me and told me the food court (and the mall) were closing in 15 minutes, hardly enough time for the food to cool off enough to eat it.  It was a Sunday so they closed early.  I would have enjoyed my food more if I hadn't had to rush.

The second time was yesterday.  I got the Fish with One Side combo.  The credit card machine must have been out or something, there was a sign saying they could only take cash.  I got collard greens as my side.  The fish was excellent and my grandson loved it too and kept getting bites of it from me.  The tarter sauce tasted homemade.  I wish there had been more than one piece of fish, tho it was pretty big (see photo).  The collard greens had wonderful flavor but were also way too salty for my taste.  The kind of salty that hurts your taste buds.  They were cooked with real ham that gave them their wonderful flavor, don't know if they added salt on top of it or if it was just that salty from the ham.

The man behind the counter, who is also the cook I think, was very nice, the kind of guy who welcomes you the first time, and more so as a return customer.

 I look forward to returning here, both for more chicken and to try other dishes."}
