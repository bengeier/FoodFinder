{"text":"First time here and thought it was excellent and should be a 4.5. The food, ambiance and service were excellent. I had a chopped salad and spaghetti and meatballs. My wife had the baked ziti and a salad. All the food was tasty and very well priced. Avg entrees are $12 and how can you beat that in Las Vegas? They provide you with bread and very high quality olive oil and balsamic at no charge. Definitely going back! BTW our server Eddie was a true delight and attentive server. He went out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Italian food isn't that difficult to make taste good. Apparently for this place, it's asking too much. I ordered something simple, spaghetti and meatballs but the meatballs were oh, so bland.   My wife ordered a meal with chicken and the chicken was rubbery. I didn't believe her so I tried it and it was worse than she had stated.   There are better places to eat in the area. Take the drive, even if your staying at the M."}
{"text":"The food and service is always excellent. The kale, sausage and potato soup & the linguini w/ clams is to die for! :) The prices are very reasonable. I love this place."}
{"text":"Salty!!!!! We had the Veal Marsala, Filet, Sea Bass, and Shrimp Capellini. All were terribly salty. Also, the piano player was AWFUL. We felt like we were eating in a honky tonk saloon because of his playing style. We left before dessert because of him. So sad because the service was great and so was the decor."}
{"text":"This was our second time here, we made reservations at the same time we booked our trip to Las Vegas. We started off with a salad and the antipasto platter which was a lot of food in itself.  I had the special which was an 18oz bone in ribeye. My wife had the linguini with clams. Both dishes were superb, the steak was one of the best I'd ever eaten.  One thing to mention, ask the waiter TWICE about the specials, I didn't hear him mention the salmon or another dish, but did hear him mention it to other tables, I'll be sure to browbeat them about it next time to make sure I know all my options. But this was a wonderful experience, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Marinelli's with a small group of people at 5:00 on a Friday evening and from the minute we sat down I could tell that we were going to have problems with the waiter. We informed him that we would like separate checks and he curtly informed us that they did not do separate checks. I could understand if they had been very busy but they were pretty empty. I asked to speak to the manager and she told me that it would not be a problem and that it was done all the time. Then he took forever to bring our drinks and to return to get our dinner orde. When the food came out the portions were small and nothing to write home about. I ordered \"prawns\" which consisted of 4 shrimp albeit they were large , but certainly not worth the money. The waiter barely checked on us and our water gasses went un refilled for most of the evening. When it was check time the waiter dis courteously informed us that it would take awhile to get done. I could have understood if it was a very large party, but there were just six of us there. We paid and hurried out of there. Against my better judgement we went there with another group of friends on another night about a year later thinking maybe it was just that server. The drinks took forever to be delivered and the food was not delivered much better. Some people were almost finished eating before others had even been served. I was one of the forgotten. I called the manager over and she hurried off and assured me that mine was a priority and would be brought out pronto. I had ordered Maine Lobster and it came out very under cooked and needless to say I could not eat it. We were running late to go dancing so we asked for the checks. Oh boy what another fiasco. The waiter brought out some checks while totally forgetting about the others. A very mild mannered friend was so upset I could hear him speaking to the manager all the way across the room and he was not pleased to say the least. I will never return to Marinelli's in the M Resort. I love the M the lounges and other restaurants and cafes but Marinelli's was a disaster twice!"}
{"text":"So the reviews about the service is so correct! It is very spotty and took forever to get our food, like an hour. We were close to where the staff conversed and there was another table that was unhappy, the waiter was telling the manager that he wanted to offer them free desert, the manager was like ice and just said .....no ( positive we were not supposed to hear this) ! It really took us forever to get our food and we did not ask for any compensation and we certainly were not offered it. The food was just ok, nothing too special, on top of that I was surprised that they didn't offer a children's menu. One time at the pasta bar was enough for me I will not be returning, high prices for mediocre food in a city where you can get anything."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really looking forward to eating here. However,  we ended up walking out of the restaurant because after patiently waiting for 30 minutes, they didn't even come by to get our drink order. Don't waste your time and go somewhere else where they actually appreciate your business."}
{"text":"We shared a Italian Chop Salad. It was very tasty, plenty for two. We then had Orecchiette with ricotta, roast chicken and spinach, and Onion and Cheese Risotto. Both dishes were rich, but very good. Only would've preferred smaller bites of chicken, some of the large chunks were dry. Service was good. It was a nice meal.  Would like to return on a warm night without winds to sit on the outdoor patio.."}
{"text":"I went to this location within the first few months that M opened up so it's been awhile. I will tell you it certainly shocked me on good and economic it was (considering the quality of the food). The interior of the restaurant is beautiful with a display of bread and anti-pastos in the center. Upon sitting down, we were given a small plate of anti-pastos and bread with olive oil and vinegar. Our server was attentive and the wine list was VERY well priced. I worked at a fine dining Italian restaurant on the strip at the time, and we were selling the exact same bottles of wine for double. We both ordered a glass of wine, and I ordered the arugula salad and he had the carpaccio. Both were excellent. For our entree's, he had the Veal Milanese and I had the Branzino. They were incredible. Seasoned and cooked to perfection. The presentation of the plates were clean and beautiful. All in all,  I think the bill came out to about $100. With tip it might of been $120-$130.  That seems a little steep, but you would easily pay $200 or more for a meal like that at any of the chef driven restaurants on the strip. It was superb. They also have an outdoor patio which is gorgeous, and we finished our glasses of wine outside enjoying the beautiful weather. All in all, I would most definitely go again. I especially want to try their creme brulee next time I do."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after spending a few hours at the pool. We both got the set meal, which was perfect, because we were pretty hungry. The restaurant overlooks the pool and the windows let in a lot of light so the room has a nice airy feel. The cheese was really good. As was the bread. Actually, our whole meal was really awesome but for some reason, the cheese and bread really stand out to me. Would love to come back; it's a perfect place to unwind after a day at the pool."}
{"text":"I enjoyed sitting at the pasta bar. I had the fish, branzino. Delicious. The wait staff were very attentive. I was comfortable as a solo diner. The pricing is reasonable for the quality and ambiance.  I would recommend that with the open kitchen the cook not throw his towel/rag into a recepticle right in front of me, the diner.  Otherwise everything was good."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Marinelli's.  The food is amazing (\"homemade\" pasta made fresh every day), service is top notch and friendly, prices are reasonable.  I've dined there several times, and have never been disappointed with their pasta dishes.  I've heard mixed reviews about the steaks, ... but quite honestly if you are going to an Italian restaurant for steak ... well, you get what you deserve.  I highly recommend the roasted peppers as an appetizer, along with the walnut and olive breads.     And the italian chopped salad is amazing, and quite reasonably priced.    Don't forget to grab a few chocolate mints as you're walking out the door.  I have friends who eat at Marinelli's just for the mints - they are that good."}
{"text":"I came to Marinelli's with my husband and daughter to celebrate my 2 year cancerversary. For appetizers we chose the crispy calamari, the bruschetta, and the beef carpaccio. Everything tasted the way you expect it to taste. Delightful, we were very happy. Our main dishes included the baked lasagna, the linguini con vongole, the spaghetti & meatballs. We loved the Italian food, and we will go back for sure. But it not only tasted delicious, it was presented in a beautiful and artful manner. You can tell, the chef loves his job!  The wine choice was a Francis Ford Coppola Merlot - lovely!  And besides the food, the staff is very pleasant, very professional, and friendly. They are very polite and don't interrupt guests when they are in the middle of a conversation. (which often happens in restaurants, and that disturbs me very much!)  Thanks to the Marinelli's staff! A great place! We loved it so much, we will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ate at Marinelli's again on Thursday July 28, 2011. The food was amazing, the service was stellar and the atmosphere...warm as usual. Highly recommended. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The bread is served freezing cold, oil and vinegar is nothing special.  I ordered the clams, I couldn't even stand the smell of it. Their broth that they serve this dish in is gross to say the least. I only had one clam and decided I couldn't even couldn't take another bite. My boyfriend had the chicken parmesan, 1 thinly sliced piece of chicken for $16 doesn't come with anything else. We ordered a side pasta for it and that dish was probably the only decent thing about the dinner. Our server was speaking so low we could barely hear him, never asked for drinks, and never came back to the table after our dishes were put down. Another server came over to clear our dishes but wasn't attentive enough to do anything about my dish. He just said \"oh you don't want to take these home?\" \"Are you sure your done?\" I told my server I really didn't like them and he just replied oh I'm sorry about that. So we paid $40 for clams, a chicken parm and a side pasta. We were in and out in about an hour thank gosh the experience didn't last any longer."}
{"text":"Nothing remarkable about this restaurant.  The Italian food is just average.  GF and I had two different entrees.  Neither was especially good.  She had chicken piccata and the meat was tough and veiny.   I had shrimp linguini.  Four (4) medium to small shrimp in a bowl of pasta half filled with water.  Even the waiter remarked that the chef failed to drain the water properly.  I had to send it back and ask that it be re-made.  After that, it was only fair.  There are tons of good Italian restaurants in Vegas.  Chose another."}
{"text":"At first glance this place looks great that is until I said no thank you after being asked if I would like to start with a bottle of wine. She was rude and short with us. The food was just okay... Really nothing to get excited about. Not planning to Come back any time soon"}
{"text":"We didn't really come here by choice, but by necessity. Two hungry and cranky toddlers needed to be fed and we had just arrived from the airport and checked into the hotel. But what a great forced decision it turned out to be. The meal itself was rather expensive, but the food was absolutely delicious. We went family style and ordered the pear and blue cheese salad, crispy calamari, steamed mussels, spaghetti bolgonese, baked lasagna, wild mushroom tortellini, capellini, and one of the specials of the day: salmon with linguine. All ingredients tasted fresh, each pasta was extremely good and noodles were all well cooked. I was especially a fan of my pick of the mushroom tortellini. You could smell the truffle oil and the mushroom sauce was delicious. Service was also top notch. Our server was on top of things, constantly clearing plates, refilling our waters, and bringing new plates or utensils when necessary. I'm now officially a fan of two restaurants inside the M Resort."}
{"text":"Tonight, we got here a little bit early to see Kesha concert. My friend, Maria & I wanted to get something to eat before the concert. We walked around & thought we give Marinelli a try.      As soon as we got seated, The waiter gave us water and bread with butter right away. I thought how great the service was!! Sometimes, I go to other restaurants and it takes forever to get Water, or to get anything. I was very impressed with the waiters and their food here tonight.        The calamari with the marinara sauce was delicious, and I ordered the veal marsala that was also very delicious. My girlfriend had an order of chopped salad.        We definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!  Had an awesome waiter named Freddy!  Loved the baked ziti and spaghetti and meatballs!  Chopped salad was so good, bread and olive oil was yummy too.  The prices are great!  It was our first time eating here and we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in the food and everything was okay could have been better up to par the the ricotta cheesecake my husband like very much and then his also Boca was delicious he said my chicken parmesan was so sew and our waiter who was named Ken was very one-of-a-kind I wouldn't say a bad waiter just kind of out of it or has been in the business too long"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for a surprise birthday dinner.   The restaurant ambiance was very pleasant.  Everything was clean and spacious. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful.  She was very attentive and gave us great service throughout our meal.   I had the Pacific Salmon.  The portion size was good.  It wasn't overly filling but enough to satisfy my appetite. It was cooked perfectly but lacked in flavorful sauce or marinade.  I had expected a little more for a $30 piece of salmon without sides.   I suppose the average meal brought down my rating for this restaurant.  This was our first visit to this restaurant.  I can always give it a second chance and see if they can bring up my rating."}
{"text":"Okay, it's been a couple weeks since I've been here but seriously been thinking about going back. They offer take out too which is nice.  The atmosphere seems upscale and the service is friendly.  You can get a lot of food for the money.  I would say try sharing first.  The sides are only $5, but the portions are decent.  The vegetables and the marinara have a wonderful flavor with fresh ingredients.  Recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times before and the food and service was excellent, this last time the soup was salty, the sauce was salty , server was good but not excellent, it took  at  least 45 minutes to receive our main entree,"}
{"text":"Decided to grab dinner while staying in the hotel. Without reservations, right around the dinner hour, they were able to seat us within a few minutes. They initially sat us on the balcony, but it was uncomfortably hot and sunny, so they put us at a decent table inside. Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well.  A lady came around with a basket of tasty assorted breads, like, six times. For dinner, I had the branzino with cauliflower and asparagus, which was fantastic, if a little smallish. I'm a huge crème brûlée fan, and they happened to have a flight of 'em for dessert (regular, coffee and chocolate), which I'm still thinking about. Drinks were small but strong. Not sure I'll ever go back, but for those staying at the M, I heartily recommend this place for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is another 3.5 star restaurant on Yelp that I feel is a little more deserving of 4 - 4.5 stars rather than the 3.5 it actually has.   As you can see by my checkins, I've been here a couple times. I started coming here right before they moved. I was actually quite worried because I had fallen in love with one of their dishes and was told by my waiter that the restaurant was closing for remodeling in a week and they weren't sure if they would even have a Marinelli's at the M Resort anymore. Just my luck! And whatever they were putting there was top secret and even staff wasn't privy to what was happening. I was so bummed because I had finally found a place where I could get my pasta with vodka sauce craving in check, as evidenced by the Yelp tip I left here & now, in the blink of an eye, everything was all in limbo.   Well... what ended up going down was that they remodeled the old Marinelli's spot and gave that space to the new Jayde Fuzion restaurant and moved Marinelli's to where the old Anthony's Oyster Bar once was & renamed it Marinelli's Pasta Bar.   I was pleased to see that I didn't lose my beloved restaurant after all! I have major issues with losing a faved place to order Penne ala Vodka ever since Ago in the Hard Rock closed down. I still have yet to recover from that whole experience and have been searching high and low for a similar place to get my fix ever since. So... I always order the same thing here. I get the Penne ala Vodka off the menu but then I get all high maintenance on them and have them add prosciutto (to make it like the dish I fell in love with at Ago) along with roasted garlic slices & crushed red pepper flakes. I recommend my fave concoction with a glass of the Prisoner wine. I also really enjoy their Caprese Salad.  Service is excellent here... Particularly if you sit at the bar. The seating is very comfortable and there's plenty of room, so you aren't giving up anything by sitting at the bar as opposed to a table. Plus, if you need anything, there are at least two chefs right there cooking in front of you that you can ask as well as your waiter.  I must say a big thank you to the M Resort for keeping Marinelli's around. I am going to keep patronizing their restaurant for as long as I am eating carbs. :)"}
{"text":"SO disappointing! We are locals and often eat at Jade fusion, Vig Deli, Anthony's and the buffet-which are all good! We decided to try the pasta bar for the kids. We ordered all sorts of items from the menu and nothing was very good except the bread and the nice Waiter that put our order together. My son got food poisoning from the spaghetti and meatballs (we've been up with him since 4am!) The pasta with the spaghetti tasted like dirty socks!  I ordered salmon and it was fishy and dry. It was supposed to have a lemon caper sauce (I think) and it had nothing but a sad piece of broccolini and a big canned marinated artichoke heart. The papardelle with short ribs was not great either. Very little meat and a big fat chunk for flavor? Fried mozzarella was flavorless just like everything else! A little salt goes a long way guys! We won't be back. Major bummer."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great price and good sized portions.  We have never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"Open for dinner only. For seating, there are tables and the pasta bar.  We walked in and were immediately greeted and then seated by Chris, who also was our waiter for the evening.  I liked that process and it made me feel comfortable, and it didn't hurt that Mr. Chris was a cool cat.  Drinks (water and soda) always kept full by various employees and cocktails were good. Appetizer and dinner was served promptly and tasted good. No room in belly for dessert, but we will return again. Prices are very reasonable and quality is high. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service was good. BUT... food was very basic and bland. Also portion sizes are so so small. My mom and daughter decided to split raviolis. Mom even asked the waiter if it would be enough food. The waiter said of course! The entire order consisted of five ravioli. When you split that it's 2.5 ravioli. We told the waiter we were disappointed that he said it would be enough. He said he usually eats 2 or 3 and is full. Setiously!!! Who eats 2 ravioli and is full? Atmosphere and service definitely not enough to save a restaurant, you need to have good food too."}
{"text":"We have been here several times over that past two years and have seen some changes.  The food is always good, portion sizes are good.  Wine list is always fab!  Service is good.  Last visit was for my husband's birthday and the piano player even sang Happy Birthday to him.  It was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This review is based strictly on the food. It is poorly prepared, tastes horrible, and is an insult to Italian dining.  How they get away with charging people to eat here will forever be beyond me.  If you enjoy overcooked pasta. Sour tasting dry veal. Dry salmon that tastes like chicken. This is your spot, if not, I suggest finding another place to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered the Seafood Diavolo ! Delicious !  Never disappoints ! Ambience is excellent ! Views - beautiful !"}
{"text":"First 2017 Vegas meal after 6+ hours of flying at the M Resort. Decided to sit at open kitchen bar and enjoy the food prep show which did not disappoint.  Knowledgeable waiter gave good recommendations that were spot on. Opening bread was the weakest part of meal as they were not even warmed or heated at all, no butter but there was olive oil and balsamic vinegar sitting right in front of me that I used to make a dipping sauce.  Now all the good.  First course was the well seasoned and dressed Caesar salad of mixed greens with crotons and shaved Parmesan, hello.  Then 2 perfect veal cutlets covered in Marsala wine and mushroom that screamed at my palette. Finished this feast off with baked ziti with grilled pancetta and peas served in boiling hot bowl with a slightly burned crunchy rigatoni top that brought tears of joy to my eyes.  The food came fast and piping hot, good portions for an extremely reasonable price.  I left smiling and happy, a winner."}
{"text":"More like 2 1/2  Food is good. Menu is small and unusual. And service is very spotty. Because of how good their chicken parmigiana is, I do come back I admit BUT... Every time, it's the same service or lack of service (unless you're in a suit). I guess jeans and t shirt doesn't cut it for type of restaurant?  The menu is weird because this is the first Italian restaurant I've been too where you order chicken parmigiana and it doesn't come with ANY pasta. You have to order sides with any dish you order which is ridiculous.   The wait staff is slow and always forgetful... Why do I still come back... Cuz it decent food at my fav casino but I'm just counting down to the day they really disappoint..."}
{"text":"This was our first time staying at the M and dining at Mainelli's. I have to say we had an incredible meal here on Saturday. Our service was excellent, the prices reasonable and the food exceeded our expectations.  All 5 of us had different menu items and we all agreed that each item was excellent. In my opinion, if you are looking for a good Italian dinner you will be very happy with this choice."}
{"text":"This place served the best pasta we've ever had! It was al dente and the sauce was perfect. We had the veal Marsala which was also excellent and the beef medallion filets. The atmosphere was upscale and waiters, waitresses and hostess very attentive and nice. Love this place! They have a full bar. Will definitely come back. It was our first dining experience here.  We we didn't expect such great food and service for a casino restaurant. Definitely would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, I was here for a convention, sat at the bar where you can watch the chefs in action. Great choice, chef Erika does a great job.  Had the Halibut 2 nights with spinach and broccolini. Also had shrimp scampi which was great, 3 large whole shrimp."}
{"text":"I gave Marinelli's 4 stars but its not quite 4 for me but better than 3. The service is very good. Attentive, informative if you have questions and professional. The presentation of the dishes is quite nice. My date and I ordered The Caprese and Crab Cake roasted Artichoke. I was really impressed with the Caprese. The Crab Artichoke was good but not amazing.  The bread basket service was a nice touch and pleasant suprise. We  really enjoyed the olive bread and raisin bread but all were pretty good.  For entrees we order Capalinni  and Osso Bucco. Both had very nice presentation and tasted very fresh. The food was good. Wine selection by the glass is decent but not large. They have some nice selections.  For desert we had Tiramisu and Gelato. But looks great but were just slightly above average.  If cost was not a factor I would give Marinilli's a solid 4 stars but since it is pricey for Italian I expected more. For a nice place if you like the ambiance I would suggest Pane Vino. For food alone Nora's tops the list and Lucio is right behind it. Much better than Nove at Palms though. There are too many options to not be excellent and only be good or pretty good.  Its worth trying since everyone has different tastes but I think money could be better spent."}
{"text":"Meh. $5 to add dry chewy chicken to penne alla vodka. $ 9 for an acidic house chianti. The open kitchen is not interesting in the least, there's a reason why most chain food type kitchens are usually hidden. Pasta was fine but completely forgettable. Service was fine."}
{"text":"I ate at marinelli's pasta bar last night for a late Christmas dinner with my girlfriend, the pasta was great. Our entrees were chicken piccata and veil marsala they were really well made dishes. What I most enjoyed was the pasta which is additional but well worth it because it really completes the dish since they pour the sauce over it. The sauce was a little watered down but all in all they were both pretty good.  Now my biggest disappointment was the calamari which was an epic fail. I took one bite and had to spit it out. It was rubbery, not crispy the batter didn't taste well. It really made for a bad first impression.   When it comes to the service it was really great. He checked up on us often and treated us very well so the service really elevated this rating. I don't think I will be making it back to this pasta bar doesn't have much to draw you back."}
{"text":"The food here was great, the prices were great, and the wait staff was great!  I ordered the chopped salad, one of the best that I have had, me and my spouse split the salad so it is certainly enough to share if your having an entree.   Also order the lasagna, I like cheese but not a \"cheese lover\", so for me it was a bit cheesy, but for those of you that love cheese you will love this...they were very generous.  We also had the spaghetti bolognese, it was absolutely delicious, the pasta was fresh and thick, you can tell it was home made.  Since I the took the spaghetti to go, I was able to mix my with my lasagna and it was great.  I also love that the prices are reasonable.  I will certainly go back, can't wait to try other items off the menu."}
{"text":"Sat down and waited and waited AND waited for the server to address our order.  Hmmm that took some time and it wasn't even busy yet.  Not off to a good start here.  Ordered the Arugula salad which had way to much vinegar.  The entree we ordered was the Chicken Parm, a Pasta all Vodka, which arrived luke warm and the Chicken Parm was chewy and rubbery, oh and yes...COLD.  We had to track the waiter down, as we had ordered wine and, ooops he forgot, so we got it mid meal.  Needless to say, this is one restaurant which shouldn't even get One Star.  Save your money....Olive Garden is better( although I have only been there once, and it is not one of my favorites either)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a date after hearing that the butternut squash ravioli was pretty good (which my date agreed with).  The setting here is very nice, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the pool area and Vegas skyline and modern decor (similar to the resort itself).  I ordered the lasagna which was OK.  I was disappointed with the portion size being small and not very fulfilling.  It also was a lasagna which didn't have many layers and was very cheesy making the meat separate a bit.  Bread and oil was served before the course as well.  The service here was crazy inconsistant.  Refills were prompt and prior and during the meal the waiter was very attentive and checked on us frequently (almost too much)  But then when it came to get the check he took forever to drop it off and pick it up (approx 15 min).  We were trying to catch a movie @ South Pointe and ended up having to re-route to Town Square because of this.  I think the ambiance is awesome, the food can be found better at another restaurant in town and the delay in service left a bad ending impression."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great hospitality and good food."}
{"text":"Went to Marinelli's because I had a friend of mine staying at the Resort and what I found was a gem of a little restaurant.  The space is comfortable and the noise level was perfect.  Snag a seat next to the terrace and you have wonderful views all the way to the strip.    I love that they didn't start off by pushing Bottled Water on us and brought out some decent bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The wine menu was smart and affordable.  Its based of Italian regions and showed a nice blend of very drinkable and appropriate wines.  The food menu as well was very affordable and showed a nice balance between classic Italian favorites like Spaghetti Bolognese and Rigatoni and some more daring offers like Genoan Pesto Pasta and Osso Bucco.  I opted for the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and ordered a Caprese Salad for the table.  The Caprese came out in a generous size which is always appreciated in these days of the microscopic appetizer.  My Shrimp Fra Diavolo followed and the pasta couldn't have been cooked more al dente.  It was truly fabulous.  The shrimp also was very good but my only complaint would have been I would have like the sauce a tad more spicy as a true Fra Diavolo  should have a nice, strong kick to it and this was on the tame side.  My associate ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and very much enjoyed it.  The only complaint was perhaps a bit to much salt, but he loved the very flavorful beef that blended so well with the light and subtle red sauce.  I'm also a huge fan of the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese at the table side even though a lot of Italian foodies will tell you its a travesty to grate such an immaculate cheese for a simple topping.  Its so full of flavor that it should be eaten as a stand alone cheese.  Well thats true, but it does make a damn good topping!  Unfortunately we didnt have room for a desert but their offerings looked intriguing.  Service overall was attentive and unobtrusive.  As mentioned before there were a couple small hiccups that Marinelli's had but overall its a brilliant choice if you ever find yourself down in those neck of the woods.  And therein lies another problem.  The M Resort is fabulous but if you live in most parts of the Valley, you might as well drive to California to get to its location at St. Rose and Las Vegas Blvd.  I cant wait to go back, I just need to save some gas money for the journey!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for this place, and were seated immediately upon our arrival.  The table was well-set and the decor on the inside was under-stated and neat.  I liked it fine, and there seemed to be a lot of space, unlike other restaurants where you feel like you're crowded into other people's tables.    The servers were always well-dressed (especially the ladies..  All of M's ladies are very well-dressed, aren't they?).  Our main waiter was good, as well, and refilled the water glasses as quickly as we could drink them, and poured wine for us as well.  Very impressive was the tray of different kinds of breads, which a nice female server gave to each of us.  After sampling most of them, I liked the green olive and the sourdough the best.    The menu was actually quite affordable, ranging in price from $20 to $40 per plate, depending on what you ordered.  I myself had the lobster with shaved truffles and corn, and it was excellent.  The lobster was fresh and just the right (non-rubbery) consistency, and the accompanying sauce was amazing.  I almost wanted to drench everything in it, but thought better of it.  The lobster was pretty much the whole lobster, but the claws were missing...  Apparently they use the claw meat mainly for the lobster risotto, which someone else at the table got, and was stuffed full of lobster claw meat.  I had a taste of the lasagna as well, which was good, but not as good as my lobster, of course.  I did not sample the wine, but something i thought was odd was that they don't automatically provide lime with their Pellegrino...  I thought that was understood already, but I guess some people do like it without....    Someone had a birthday with us, so they gave us a free dessert tiramisu, which is to die for, and plenty to share with 3 or 4 (not too greedy) people.  They even gave us a candle, which is a nice touch.  Overall a good experience.  Check out the entrance, too, it's rather striking."}
{"text":"I took my mother for her birthday to Marinelli's restaurant they just finished a remodel The food was very enjoyable and the customer service was impeccable!.... I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a quiet well crafted Italian meal....   Ask for Laura as your server, she made excellent recommendations and took great care to make my mother feel super special on her birthday thank you!...."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere but the food was not good. They really need to re think the menu and food. A beautiful setting like that needs way better food, bigger portions and can even charge more."}
{"text":"Appetizers were really good, but 2 out of 4 meals were so salty that they burned when you tasted them.   This is suppose to be a high end Italian restaurant and the chef does not taste the food before he sends it out?"}
{"text":"Generally the food is was good.  Service was excellent.  At one point the manager noticed we were trying to get someone's attention and he sent a different server to help us immediately.  We had Caesar Salad, Veal Marsala and Penne Vodka for our me and I was very happy with all three.  We did order a soufflé from Anthony's next door for dessert and it was good, but a bit small.      Again service is as the top star here.  The waiter was attentive and friendly, and all the staff we interacted with really did a great job."}
{"text":"Nice quiet Italian place at the M. I've been here a number of times by myself; either just to grab a quick sit-down dinner after getting out of the office, or to work on something while I'm having dinner.  I usually get the Chicken Marsala, and pair it with a Syrah and it goes together really well! It's amazing! The food is very reasonably priced as well--certainly no complaints there. Service has always been on point on every occasion I've been there. I wouldn't do a fancy dinner date here, but for the occasions that I go here for; I think it's a great place."}
{"text":"I stayed at the M Resort, and when I looked at the dining options, this was the only restaurant in the hotel that seemed to be able to make me a vegan meal. I was going to ask the server to bring me pasta with tomato sauce and veggies, and he responded that they had an off-menu pasta primavera. It was flavorful, the portion was substantial but not too much, and the servers were attentive without being overbearing. Unfortunately, there was no way to veganize any of their desserts - so they loose a star for that."}
{"text":"I enjoyed quite a few meals and drinks here when I stayed at The M. They have all these yummy appetizers and they are not only priced well, they are nice sized portions too! We had the calamari and the antipasto plate and they were very good. The polenta fries were delicious and the fried asparagus was yummy too!The service was excellent. The drinks were delicious too. They have a happy hour special and that was a great way to try a bunch of stuff for 1/2 price! The have a drinks/food special were they have 5 drinks listed and each one is $5, and they have 7 appetizers listed and each one is $7. I'm always willing to try a bunch of stuff when you have those offerings. Food was real good, prices were good and service was excellent. Nessa very happy!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was blah.  Price was steep. Had a family birthday celebration here during the week.  We had a large group of 10, and a great server (Charity).  We ordered a number of appetizers to share and wine.  Our server was attentive and kind.  She made suggestions on the menu, and kept the wine on ice.   The 2 stars are really for the food.  It wasn't very good.  I had the short rib pasta, and the meat was really fatty.  The sauce needed salt or some sort of better flavor, and the noodles were too al dente for me.  There are a number of Italian places in town that are more affordable and have better food.  Even Macaroni Grill is a better option than the food at this place."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday dinner. One good thing about this place is there's no wait even on weekends. I always get right in and seated. (I don't know about the holiday season.) Linguine with clam sauce was OK. Calamari was not crunchy. Soft and oily but it was OK. The fish tasted bland but edible. The service was attentive. Right next to Anthony's. I'll come back next time I have comps for this place."}
{"text":"In general the food was decent, prices were good, but service was bad.  Went as a party of 4 and food arrived in a relatively timely manner.  Unfortunately, our server, Ken, seemed uninterested in his job, and even the assistants refilling drinks were not that good.  Our table ordered two salads and only ever received one.  We had to remind Ken about our side order of meatballs as well.  He also bumped into my chair at one point without saying anything.    That said, the food we actually did order was good.  The prices are relatively low, probably because if you want pasta with most dishes you have to order it separately.  Everyone agreed that the best part of the meal was the fried mozzarella.  It's very smooth and both somewhat similar and somewhat unique as compared to a traditional fried mozzarella stick.  It is odd that this place doesn't take reservations."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatballs was terrible. Very watery sauce, meatballs did t taste like any kind of meat that I've had. Pasta was blah, seemed over cooked. Save your money and just hit up a Olive Garden instead."}
{"text":"Meh, not impressed. The portions are small which is fine, it's the pasta that's the problem. Way undercooked pasta, with watered down sauce.....yuck !! And it's a pasta place!!!!!!!!!!!! The chicken piccata and veal marsala were fine, as well was the bean soup & Caesar salad. Ordered the broccoli rabe, it was over cooked to the point of almost mush. The best thing we had was the caesar salad."}
{"text":"This menu has recently been revised to include Italian favorites like Lasagna. One of my favorite is ordering a dirty martini with blue cheese olives from the bar. Having frequented this establishment a few times, I have grown to enjoy Ken as my server. He is prompt, familiar with the menu, and will always give you an honest opinion."}
{"text":"At first We split the Caesar salad and cheese sticks. Both were good but after that it went downhill. My ravioli arrived at room temperature.. If that.. I'm not one to usually send food back but I've never received food that cold so I did. When they brought back the pasta  I noticed that one of the raviolis did not even have cheese not the middle! I was frustrated since I already sent back the food once. My third ravioli had something hard (plastic?) in it! I was so disgusted that I couldn't eat anything else. My boyfriend said his meal was just eh as well, def not worth the price. The server was very nice though and comped my pasta as well as a desert and took a discount off the rest of the food."}
{"text":"It seems every casino must have a steak house and an Italian restaurant.  Continuing the great Las Vegas tradition of uninventiveness and mediocrity, Marinelli's is the Italian eatery at the new M Resort.  (By the way, the steak house is called Terzetto...which frankly sounds like another Italian restaurant to me.)  If last night's meal at Marinelli's is any indication, the M Resort is not much of a player in the intense competition for our gullets.  THE DECOR: Whoever designed the room should be sent to Guantanamo for unconscionable acts of aesthetic terrorism. It looks and feels like a buffet with too-small tables and a generically psychedelic carpet (all the better to hide the stains I guess).   Speaking of stains:  the bar at the front is odd. The counter was designed with a 4 inch slope on the outside edge. I guess cuz it looks nice.  It wasn't so nice, however,  when I watched a man put his glass of beer down, then a second later see it slide off and break on the floor.  THE FOOD: My steak was overcooked and had the consistency of a piece of choice-beef from Vons. My friend's Osso Bucco was cold and tasteless. My other friend didn't finish his risotto.   I'm struggling to find something positive to say....hmmmm, let me think....Okay, okay I got it...the bread was pretty good. The rest of the experience was forgettable.  THE RESORT IN GENERAL: It's nice although it doesn't look like a billion dollars to me. It's rather Red Rockish in overall feel.  The bar upstairs at Veloce has a nice view...although they weren't equipped to make Absinthe in the proper way.   My favorite part of the complex was The Hostile Grape: a comfortable, stylish room with a very good selection of wines by the glass, including a Sine Qua Non that is almost NEVER available by the glass. Those of you who know wine, know what I mean. Although I must warn you, the SNQ is $49.50 an ounce.....or maybe I should say it's $49.50 an OUCH!  I'm not a buffet guy but the buffet at M Resort looked interesting. The line-up was certainly long enough.  It's called Studio B and appears to combine the usual buffet experience with \"Show Kitchen\" entertainment where you see dishes being prepared. Perhaps I'll put a bag over my head and check it out one day."}
{"text":"Don't go there! All the sauces taste the same too spicy and the pasta is undercooked. Vodka sauce is the worst!"}
{"text":"I tried.  The space is beautiful and upscale; suggestive of competing with those other joints further north on LV Blvd.  The views are great.  And we had a lot of people \"attending\" to our table.  Those are the hits...all three of them.  We were here on a Thursday night for a birthday dinner.  There were three other dining parties seated throughout the restaurant.  Despite it being that empty, not a single table was seated near a window to take advantage of the sunset view...but perhaps that's just how things are done.    To service the four dinner parties were several waitstaff: it appeared we had two servers and two bussers assigned to our table.  Unfortunately, we did not see them very often past the appetizer course.  Maybe they got to go home.  Maybe they went on break.  Maybe it was the fact that we were there for three hours.    Three hours can be broken down (roughly), as follows: 30 minutes to place our order, 30 minutes for our appetizers to come out, almost another hour before we received our entrees and 30 minutes to get desert (which we also asked for the check concurrently so that we could leave).  Keep in mind we had two kids with us, who, by the time their BUTTERED NOODLES came out 2 hours after we were seated, were absolutely famished and inhaled their dinner.  I guess we should have asked for the noodles to come out with the appetizers (our bad), but who would've though it would take ONE HOUR for entrees to follow the apps?  So, needless to say we weren't all that happy about the service and timing of the food delivery.  That in and of itself does not warrant 2 stars.  To say the food was a disappointment is far too kind.  The salad appetizers were decent...just salads.  The calamari was cooked nicely and had a really good lemon sauce.  Out of the five different entrees, only one was good: the osso bucco had a good sauce and was fairly tender...though the accompanying risotto was severely overcooked.  The lobster and shrimp risotto (ordered by two people) were also overcooked and had absolutely no texture to them, on top of smelling overly fishy and tasting like sea water...in other words: inedible.    I really wanted to like this place.  Even though the food was sub-par, the restaurant was was nicely decorated.  But I already said that didn't I?  Oh well, I tried."}
{"text":"This is among the worst Italian food I've ever had. Clams were flavorless, calamari was chewy. Chicken parm and veal parm were soggy. Expensive and a la carte portions. Pasta is separate. Who ever heard of pasta not being served with chicken parm at an Italian restaurant??!! This restaurant is no spice, no flavor. Non va bene! Misero!"}
{"text":"We were recommended this spot by a Chef  It was a long trip  M Resort n Casino - from the west side.   Pasta bar is section of the main steak house, with an open plan kitchen. Its right in the main foyer of the casino.  Menu is short, with focus on pastas and few appetizers. The smaller the menu better is the quality and this is absolutely true in this case too.  We enjoyed the pastas we ordered, very good quality, but the showstopper for us was the desserts. They were just outstanding  Recomened this spot for good easy Italian fare."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate at Marinelli's last night and we loved it!  We ordered Roasted Red Peppers and Buffalo Mozzarella as our first course and it was absolutely delicious.  For our main courses I had Chicken Parmigiana and my fiance had a pan roasted Branzino.  Both were also quite impressive tasting.  It was very reasonably priced as well.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Staff was rude.   Thank God at least our food was delicious... we had penne alla vodka, linguini con vongole, alaskan halibut, and lobster and shrimp risotto."}
{"text":"First timer here and I don't even really like Italian food. This was fabulous !! My grandma and I shared a Caesar salad and chicken Parmesan with spaghetti . The service was wonderful, the guys were rally nice and at least 4 people tended to us, making sure we were okay, and that we had everything we needed. Wonderful place to eat and I don't think the pricing is unbearable"}
{"text":"Freddy was our server and he was great! Gave excellent recommendations and was very polite. Brian got our dishes removed quickly and wasn't distracting while we visited with friends."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken parmesan. I've had better.  I was disappointed that it did not include any pasta, in a restaurant with the word pasta in its name. Any other place I've had this meal included pasta/spaghetti so I assumed they would as well. It's so inexpensive for them to add a little pasta. If by chance l do go back I will order something else but will likely eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We are locals that frequent M Resort. Decided to try Pasta Bar for our anniversary dinner. We were seated promptly and we were served water and 1 roll each on our bread plates. No butter was served but we used oil and vinegar that was on the table. 15 minutes later (place was not crowded), our waiter, Pedro, came to take our order. We had not even been offered a cocktail or any other drink. He was very disinterested and even had a toothpick in his mouth! Hubby had veal Osso bucco and I had veal piccata. Food was OK, but service was just awful! When we declined ordering dessert, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away! Needless to say, we will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner. Decent atmosphere, service was good.  The chopped salad was good but the pasta was below average. Pasta was not fully cooked and the chicken parmesan was not very tender or juicy.    Pretty small portions. You will probably have to order multiple plates to not be hungry.  Definitely a little pricey. There are definitely better Italian places nearby."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there right when they opened, so was not busy at all, we had the server Pedro, who was either high or hated his job. Bus boys helped us more than he did. Got the cheese raviolis cause we're vegetarian, they were delicious but when we finally got dessert menu we sat and waited forever for pedro to show up again. So once bus boy finally asked if we've been helped we just decided to leave. Awful service but decent food, maybe not for the price though."}
{"text":"I ate there for dinner last night for the first time.  I was not expecting to eat Italian food,but was sorely disappointed in the service and/or wait for AYCE sushi at Jayde Fuzion next door (there will probably be a separate review for that).  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the restaurant and food.  I was served two dinner rolls with olive oil and balsamic already at the table, both great tasting.  I then ordered the caprese salad, which had sliced heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzrella on a bed of arugula.  It was perfectly seasoned and dressed, and tasted fresh.  For my entree I ordered linguine with clams (comes in either white wine sauce or red sauce, I chose white) and thought it was quite delicious. The sauce felt delicate and light, but was packed with flavor.  I am a fan of garlic, so garlic haters beware, but there was a lot of sliced garlic in the dish.  I loved it!  My friend ordered seafood linguine with red sauce, and he also had no complaints.  The menu does not have a lot of items, but I prefer less items made well, then many items that taste mediocre.  Service was fine, I really have no complaints there."}
{"text":"The worse Customer service place I have been too in Vegas   It was Friday night. We came in 10 of us at 7 pm , we were told the wait was about an hour and that there's no reservation done in that place. So we set at the bar waiting    We went back & Forth with few servers while waiting , one nice waiter told us we will have 2 tables soon   An hour and half later , the waiter told us to go head & sit in our tables. Few second later few people cane over to us yelling \" it's our table \"   We didn't want to argue , few minutes later a rude manager came over to ya & told ya to get up   Never go there if your more then 4-6 people they don't know what the hell there doing there !!"}
{"text":"First the positives: The decor is modern, open, and very pleasant. Prices are reasonable, and the service was good. But the food is just average at best. We shared a few entrees: linguini with clams was a little bland, rigatoni bolognese was just average, chicken parmasen was also average, and meatballs were ok, but a little too hard for my taste. Overall, the food was not bad.... but considering how many great resturuants there are in Vegas, there is nothing at Marinelli's that would make me want to go back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. However on my most recent visit I was rather disappointed. They changed the menu and its really not as good anymore. I mean they charge more for some things and give you less. And on top of it they STOPPED MAKING CANNOLIS! I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I would recommend if you are in the area, great food!   Food - 5 stars   Lobster risotto.   It could of had a few more pieces of lobster but was really good and flavorful    My husband had the filet mignon and he said it was awesome.  There is a nice streak house in Green Valley called Hanks and he said hands down a way better steak than Hanks.   Plus, Hanks steaks are way more expensive.  I had the salmon.  Wow, fresh tasting, melted like butter.   Loved this dish.  Salads were awesome, I can't recall the name but I had one with walnuts and it was so good.     The chocolate cannoli was just okay. I think an overkill on the chocolate.     We cleaned our plates and literally waddle out like penguins."}
{"text":"Hidden in the M Resort, Marinelli's is an average restaurant at best. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was comfortable. A little warm. I ordered bruschetta for an appetizer and gnocchi for my entree. The entree came first for some reason. The waiter was very apologetic. I was disappointed in the bruschetta anyway when it did come out. It was served in large portions and lacked the flavor and quality I have experienced at other Italian places. The gnocchi was good but I've def had better. I would have given this one star had I not gotten my meal at half off and my appetizer comped. I'll probably never eat here again. There are much better places to eat especially if you have to pay full price."}
{"text":"This place is a mildly upscale Italian restaurant with good food.  I ordered the Lobster Risotto (I have a habit of trying any place's risotto, paella, or jambalaya).  I also shared a Caprese salad and tried a slice of someone's Veal Chop.  I was pretty impressed with everything that came my way.  One of the highlights is their selection of bread.  Someone periodically comes around and offers you slices of bread.  I especially enjoyed the walnut and raisin loaf."}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing 5 star service. Loved it! House wine is amazing! Can Franc is a must."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night and thought it was great all around! We had a nice waitress that knew what she was doing, our appetizer, main dishes and dessert all tasted excellent!! I will definitely be coming back here all the time!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I have always like the M Resort.  It used to be the best Buffett in town.  I had wanted to go to Marinellis Italian restaurant as I wanted some great looking food you see in gangster movies.  However, some the Marnelli lost control of this once great resort things have fallen apart. To begin with Italian restaurant has been relocated and gone from a family style to gourmet with small portions.  4 waiters standing around with our meals sitting ready and appetizer at same time?  Food was OK.  Nothing special.  Not worth $19 for a small pasta dish."}
{"text":"We have dined twice at Marinelli's and though the room is very plain, the bar area and any table near the expansive windows is very nice.  On our first visit at around 5:30PM, we were unable to secure a table, but ordered off the menu at the bar.  We were soon brought a basket of bread with EVO/balsamic vinegar.   Since we were having our entrees at Veloce Cibo later in the evening, we decided to share an antipasti (San Daniele prosciutto, salami, mortadella, Reggiano parmersan, assorted olives and grilled vegetables) and an order of lightly breaded calamari accompanied by a fresh tomato sauce.  Everything, including service, was good, but not outstanding.     On our second visit less than a week later, we had a 7:30PM reservation, but it took about 5 minutes before a table was ready.  A bread basket and an EVO/balsamic vinegar mix were delivered to the table while we perused the menu.  We each ordered the grilled \"sea bass\" served over spinach and orange butter sauce.  In a service glitch we received a complimentary appetizer (mixed olives, prosciutto, parmesan cheese, and an artichoke hears) seconds prior to our entrees.   I enjoyed the sea bass, actually striped bass, while my wife was disappointed.  Overall the meal was only satisfactory."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Marinelli's last night.  The M Resort looks great and we have heard a lot of people raving about their restaurants.  We have eaten at the steak house and I would go back over returning to Marinelli's.  Our waiter helped us pick a bottle of wine, turned out to be a good bottle of cabernet from Napa, great suggestion.  We ordered the grilled shrimp on a salad and roasted peppers and cheese as appetizers.  The roasted red peppers and cheese were better than the grilled shrimp that were unexpectedly served cold.  For our main course we had the rib eye and risotto.  The grilled rib eye was o.k. according to my husband, although the risotto was good, the waiter convinced me to try it with the Kobe beef...mistake.  The combination just wasn't working for me.  The Kobe been was just thrown on top of the porcini mushroom risotto.  So I just ate around the beef.  Dessert was probably the worst course.  We had crème brulee and tiramisu and neither was tasty.  They actually tasted like they had been made way too far in advance.  The mascarpone cheese mixture in the tiramisu had a \"gummy , I sat in the fridge overnight texture\"  or doesn't Bill Cosby call it jello pudding skin?  It was gross.  The strangest part of the evening was our waiter.  We ordered a bottle of wine and at the end of dinner when we ordered dessert, our waiter poured some (but not all of the remaining) wine into our glasses and was about to leave our table with what was clearly just under a half glass of wine left in the bottle.   He was conversing with someone else as he was walking away with our bottle and my husband had to ask him to leave the remainder at the table.  His response was \"all that's left is the sediment, I didn't think you would want that.\"  Well, in all the times we have ordered a bottle of wine at dinner, no waiter has ever offered to throw away the sediment for us.  It was too strange.  Now had he asked us for a glass or taste we probably would have shared, we just shared a glass with a waitress within the last month.  Although the entrees are all probably less than $30, last nights dinner for two with a bottle of wine came close to $180.  I don't think we will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre and once you factor in the price its just not worth it. There are better places in the area and definitely better on the strip for the same price."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour. They have 5 drinks priced at $5 and they have 7 appetizers priced at $7 The drinks were amazing due to our having a fantastic bartender named PJ..I actually went to the Facebook page to give him props since he was so fab to us. They have this wonderful app thats a fried asparagus..it has a light tempura coating and comes with a garlic aioli thats addicting. We also had some polenta fries with a spicy dipping sauce. Those were good but will order a double of the asparagus next time. It was a great ending to a great day."}
{"text":"Not bad,  Short ,simple,  decent menu. Not cheap.  Have to order each course.   Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"We were there the other night with a party of 7, and had a reservation for 7:30pm.  When we arrived at the hostess stand no one was there for about 5 minutes.  Eventually a young lady seated us and said our server would be with us right away.  15 minutes later our irritated table was greeted.  He made us feel like a complete incovenience.  After someone came by and gave us water and bread, we waited 20 MINUTES for our server to come back over and take our order.  We hadn't even had our drink order taken at this point.  Bread and water had run out.  I had to personally wave down our server to come take our order and even then he checked on 3 other tables before coming over to us.  So, finally we get our wine and beverages and then he runs off again.  We ran out of bread and water all over again.   The restaurant was not busy by any means.  So, our food comes, my eggplant parmesean is cold and tastes like cardboard, and 2 gnocchi dishes that came out were so over cooked it was uneatable. Since nobody cared to come check on us until I had to wave down the server again, their food was't returned till everyone was almost done.  In need of a meal to come out quick, they both ordered ravioli to replace the gnocci.  The ravioli took over 25 minutes.  Lets be honest.  It's noodles.  Pop them into their already-boiling water for 5 minutes and done.  But nope, 25 minutes later they get their meals.  In the meantime, we have a table full of dirty dishes.  I went to the hostess stand to ask for a manager since one was nowhere to be found and she said I could have a seat and someone would be with me shortly. She had no idea I was already dining.  I said no, and wanted to see a manager immediatly as we hadnt received the other meals at that point and we had a table full of dirrty dishes.  Eventually about 5 minutes later a manager comes over.  Not only do we have a laundry list of things wrong, one of the raviolis has a black hair in it.  The ONLY reason why this restaurant got 2 stars, was because of the managers service, even though with a large party in a not-busy restaurant, you'd think a manager wouldve come over at some point to just say hi. This was supposed to be a special dinner to celebrate our engagement and it was a complete disappointment.  We are locals and we will never be back."}
{"text":"Excellent date place.  32 bucks for a three course meal, you cannot beat that."}
{"text":"Several of our friends had advised us the food was great, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. We had friends over and especially one from France for a special occasion.  Location - Where is the signage at?  Took us a bit to find it as there is very little signage for this restaurant at the M Resort, but we did eventually stumble upon it.  Reservations - Very nice, accommodating and easy to make changes.  My party changed from 6 to 7 and they had no issues, especially as it was a holiday weekend and a Saturday as well (Thanksgiving.  Bar Service - Very attentive and relaxing. I enjoyed it.  Food Service - Not bad, but not great either. Wine knowledge seems a bit mundane, especially if you are a novice like me, but at the end, the waiter did finally suggest a nice wine and a reasonable price and it was very enjoyable.    Menu -  Bread selection is fine, but a bit sparse in quantity. I think that this should be fine though , as you do not want to load up on this stuff.  They also serve some antipasto at the table as a courtesy with the bread and that is good, especially the Gran Padano cheese, which is a hard Parmesan type of cheese in larger chunks. This is great tasting.  Overall selection of food on the menu was extensive.  Menu Quality - Whenever I am at an Italian restaurant, I test it by the quality of the Osso Buco which is a veal shank and with bone marrow.  I finished about 30% of it, as it was okay, but a bit overcooked. The risotto it was on was great, but oddly, they do not provide you with the small spoon to scoop out the bone marrow from the shank, which is an essential part of the meal as far as I am concerned.  The Chop salad was great.  Dessert - Surprisingly good, but very small in quantity.  Perhaps exactly what we all need, especially after the Thanksgiving weekend.  Just don't expect large portions.   I will go back for sure as the ambiance is quite nice.  The food is fine and I would like to try it again as so many friends have raved about this place, and maybe I was just a bit off that night......."}
{"text":"Had very good service. Great wine. House cab was fabulous. Not cheap $14 a glass. I had the ravioli which was very good. Salad is ala carte and had the chopped for $8. It was quite small but very good. Friend ordered chicken picatta. It was served without a bed of pasta. I guess you have to order that on the side which seems so strange since pasta is so inexpensive. Bread was a roll and not warm. It was good but I think next time I will go for Italian at Don VItos."}
{"text":"Pros: Nice Decor. Good Service  Cons: Spaghetti Meatballs and Baked Lasagna  This is the first time we ate here. The meatball was COLD and did not taste like a meatball. It was dry and tasteless. The Baked Lasagna was a huge disappointment. Just gobs and gobs of cheese and pasta but NO BEEF! I am positive that on the menu it said it contains beef as one of the ingredients. Stouffers frozen lasagna dinner tastes better and has BEEF.  I cannot speak for the other entrees here, but save yourself the trouble and go to Olive Garden instead. Or go to Anthony's Burgers and Steakhouse next door. Food there is MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable dinner last night with friends. Nice atmosphere, excellent waitstaff & very good food. I ordered the Bucatini Seafood Fra Diavalo ($19) which was packed full of seafood. The table shared broccolini & spinach ($5 each). The cannoli were to die for & priced at $6 for 2 large pieces. I have enough leftovers in my frig for 2 full meals-yum, I think I'll head that way now!  Next time I'll try sharing a pasta dish & sampling a few sides."}
{"text":"It opens at 5pm so we made sure we were there right at 5pm. Thank goodness too because it had a long line soon afterwards. We stayed at the M resort and didn't want to leave to eat, so we decided to try it out. Our food was delicious and good sized portions that left us very full. Our server Pedro and Brian were very attentive and always refilling our waters and made sure we had everything we needed. We stay a lot at the M resort but this was our 1st time here and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My word for Marinelli's is CONSISTENT.  This place is consistently excellent.  I've been about 10 times now and I've tried different things each time. Not because I don't love what I had the previous time but I'm so excited to try something new and love it just as much!  I usually sit at the bar when I go but on rare occasions sit at a table.  The service at either the bar or table are always excellent.  If you want a superb meal don't pass this place up!!"}
{"text":"Staying at the M Hotel for a work conference and decided to try out Marinelli's inside the hotel.  Excellent food and service!!!!!!!!  Everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed everything that was ordered, from the apps to the main course and especially the wine list!!!!!  Our server, Doug was great too!"}
{"text":"Originally, I had wanted to take mom to the buffet in M Resort for her birthday.  The line was just too ridiculously long to wait.  My bf and I decided to look around and see what else is available in the casino and found Marinelli's.  There was no line, intimate setting, and a fine dining restaurant.    The hostess was very friendly and the smile on her face was just enough to think this might be a good place to celebrate mom's birthday.  Not only is there inside seating, but also patio seating.  Mom liked that idea and basked in the sunset lighting overlooking the majestic mountains.    Our server was courteous and friendly enough.  One good thing about him is that he's not overly friendly.  Sometimes, that can get annoying.  We got served water immediately, olive oil with balsamic vinegar and bread to go with it.  After ordering, we received a complimentary plate of olives, salami, assorted vegetables, and parmesan cheese.  This was definitely a good starter.  Mom ordered their Spaghetti and Meatballs, Stepdad ordered the salmon, bf ordered pasta with beef, and I ordered Kobe Beef with risotto.  We also ordered two types of side salad: Caesar Salad, and garden salad.  The Caesar salad didn't have enough dressing on it for my liking.  I tasted mostly the romaine lettuce.  When all the plates arrived, all looked fantastic.    Mom and Stepdad definitely loved their dishes, the bf said it was good, and mine... hmmm... I should've ordered something else.  It was my fault really.  I forgot I was in an Italian restaurant and in my mind, when I think of Kobe Beef I think of Japanese style and flavor.  The Risotto was too salty, and the Kobe Beef didn't have enough good seasoning on it.  It just didn't agree with my pallet.  It was also my fault because the server did ask me how I liked the food.  I didn't have the nerve to speak up and say how I really thought of it.  Needless to say, my full plate spoke for itself.  I couldn't finish it.  I rated it 3 stars just because I didn't like the food I ate and wasn't worth as much as I paid for it.  The ambiance and feel of it is a definite 5 stars."}
{"text":"Service was poor. Food tasted blend. Salmon looked and tasted like chicken. Dry and blend. Meatballs here were top three worst meatballs I have eaten in my life."}
{"text":"The place was packed so we sat at the bar. Ambience was top-knotch and service from our bartenders was great. I did however have to wait 30+ minutes for a bread basket (despite asking for one).   We tried...  Kobe beef risotto with white cheddar - It did have a good amount of kobe (more than I expected!), but it also had mushrooms (why was this not mentioned in the menu!). While I love mushrooms this rendered the dish gross for my fiance. Overall it was good, but not great. Portion was huge.  Pappardelle (veal bolognese) - wow, this dish was incredible. I almost want to give this place 4 stars we loved this dish so much! The portion was a decent sized, but not huge, and my fiance and I were definitely fighting over this one ! Great pasta, and the sauce was perfect.  Chocolate zucotto - way yummier sounding on paper. nothing exciting  I now scan the menu to jog my memory on what we ate a couple weeks ago when we were there I'm disappointed to notice they took all the prices down! The prices were relatively reasonable if I recall, but unfortunately I can't verify.   Overall - Great ambience and beautiful patio. The pappardelle was amazing. I'll go back and give the place another shot. I'm hoping there are other yummy dishes on the menu to discover."}
{"text":"After the wonderful dining experience at Terra Rossa at Red Rock, Marinelli's didn't quite measure up. I wanted to like it but many factors waged in a war that dissuaded me from doing so...  We arrived for dinner around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night with no reservations. The place was DEAD. With the exception of a couple patrons at the bar, we were the only customers in the entire restaurant. Well, look on the bright side, it'll be a nice, intimate & cozy experience (is what I was telling myself). Instead, it made for many awkward moments. Our server was very nice & friendly, as was the Front of the House Manager, and the expo that brought out our food (cuz our server was busy?? - insert dry sarcasm). But because we were the only ones there, everytime someone came to check on us, they seemed uncomfortable, like they were being intrusive which then made ME feel bad for them for having an empty restaurant!! Oh, did I mention the kitchen staff was taking full advantage of the empty house and whooping it up in the back?!! It was audiably clear... expo had to come by our table to apologize for the noise. I found it mildly amusing.  Oh right!! The food - bread basket and complimentary olives plate was ok, again Terra Rossa's was far more superior. Shrimp Arrabiatta w/ linguini & fettucini Alfredo were nothing to write home about sadly. Really dull... something your roommate would whip up.   Some pluses? Very extensive wine list with a great selection of by the glass choices. The restaurant itself has a beautiful layout and comfortable seating w/ plush high, circular booths, as well as low tables and cushioned chairs. It's got a lot of potential so I still have high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver on this night."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Came here for the first time as a party of 7 for a friend's birthday party.  The setting is intimate with comfortable and simplistic decor and live piano entertainment.  When we arrived to check in with our reservation there was no one to seat us for a couple of minutes.  This is a big no-no to me.  I think someone should always be manning that front area.  But once we were greeted it was service with a smile from there on out.    Our server gave us space and time to look over the menu while never leaving us alone for too long.   I ordered the four cheese ravioli and, although the sauce and ravioli were delectable, I ended up not being fulfilled.  I admit, I'm not one of those \"I'll have a salad and a diet coke\" kind of girls, so I may not be the best judge of this, but I felt my portion was too small and I was actually still hungry afterwards.  The ravioli are not large and there were 6 of them.  As far as fine dining goes, the prices were not horrible but, for the price of the dish, I hoped to be satiated at the end of the meal.  The guest of honor was given a complimentary creme brule and the musician sang happy birthday for him and personally greeted him towards the end of our meal.  A very nice touch.    The wait staff was very attentive and service was terrific all night.   They were very gracious when the birthday boy was mistaken on a type of wine he ordered and they happily returned the bottle and helped to figure out which one he was thinking of.    Overall nice decor, good service and food, but prices and portions don't seem to match."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was THAT good!!  Went for a work dinner and was seated in the private dining room overlooking the pool and had a door connecting to the high roller room so I could stay on top of the Celtics/Lakers game..fn Lakers.    I started w/ the caprese salad ($12).  By far the greatest caprese salad I've ever had.  I'm not sure how much crack/cocaine was put in the cheese but suffice to say it was enough to rock my world.  I was torn w/ either getting the a pasta as I'm a sucker for handmade pasta on the premises...the rigatoni with braised beef, sweet potatoes and tomatoes sounded awesome or the lamb chops or the osso buco.    I eventually went w/ the osso buco ($42) since I wasn't footing the bill :) Wow...the mushroom risotto combined w/ a super juicy piece of meat on top was incredible.  I might have blacked out for a couple of seconds but who knows.    Too full for dessert...guess I'll have to do that next time."}
{"text":"Marinelli's is a nice looking restaurant, but our meal was mediocre and the staff was inattentive, at a time when the restaurant wasn't even busy.     I started with the Pear and Blue Cheese salad.  It was the only part of the meal that was ok.    The salad was followed by the Ricotta Gnocchi Alla Piemontese and the Chicken Al Mattone - both of which were recommended by the server.  Though the gnocchi itself was pretty good, the ragu was very salty.  Also the broth that surrounded the chicken and drench the escarole was extremely salty and difficult to eat.    We also ordered a side of jumbo asparagus.  Unfortunately, it finally arrived at the moment we finished our entrees, so we asked the server to take it back.  Unfortunately, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Simple menu and appetizer sections.  I've tried most of the items as I'm a fan and if you like freshly prepared, and not over indulged sized options then you will be a fan too.  Never very crowed so you can enjoy a tasty meal as you watch it be prepared.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very limited menu. They started out with a really cold bread roll which was an omen. We ordered the caprese salad which had tons of arugula (but no basil), tasteless unripe tomatoes and uneven pieces of mozzarella. The white bean soup was tasteless. The beans were undercooked and the soup was under seasoned. The calamari was average. The penne a la vodka was good; however my penne was swimming in the sauce. My partner had the spaghetti with meatballs. He said his was average. The pasta was al sentence. The meatballs were okay. Nothing to write home about. At least the service was good."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. I grew up on Italian food.. so for me to find a good Italian restaurant nearby is always a gold mine to me. The food is good and that's really the only reason I keep giving them chance after chance. I haven't tried everything, but one of my favorite dishes is on the menu and it's good...  I dislike giving a bad review after only one experience. I've been here at least 5 times in the past 10 months... While the food is the only reason I come back, the experience I have with staff is another story.   You would think I'm walking in to look at 100k cars by the way they seem to judge. From all of my experiences here, it seems if your drink order doesn't consist of alcoholic beverages, then the service is an afterthought. I can only assume it's because they know the tab will be under 100 (for 2) and thus the tip won't be much and therefore, not worth the effort.   The last time I went, we had no silverware and had to ask for it after our food arrived. The waiter didn't come back once to ask how my dinner was or if we needed anything else. (more drinks, parmesan cheese, etc.) Which has been the 'norm\" here. Really disappointing that this is the typical experience here.   If you're not ordering drinks, don't expect good service.  Lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Plain Jane pasta shop.  Bread bowls are served cold.  Bread may have spent to much time in the microwave at some point.  Olive oil is the thin cheap stuff on the table.  Not the thick rich bursting with flavor kind you may have come to expect from a vegas resort.   Once again, vegetarian options had been limited.  We had shared a salad and pasta penne dish.  The salad popped with flavor and was surprisingly good.  The penne was also pretty good in a zesty red sauce.  When it comes to past I just expect something near perfect and anything less is... well a letdown.    We ended up going off property to eat after our first visit."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant and fantastic wait service.  Start off with 2 kinds of fresh bread and oil & vinegar.  So good you can't eating!    Had their green salad and it was a fairly big portion.  Very fresh.  Had the Linguine Vongole (Clams) - very good and tasty.  It was served in a big bowl.  I had the white wine sauce.    I'd come back again and have their steaks next time!"}
{"text":"That it 3 start weak nice place but service so so  Bread are serve ice cold in your b&b plate  No plate for the oil.... seriously is an Italian restaurant no cocktail or beer list just the  expensive wines and champagnes  We have to ask for cheese fo the pasta... Wow... idk if ill return."}
{"text":"My friend and I stayed at the M resort the other weekend and we at dinner at Marinelli's- I ordered the Garganelli which was decent but my friend ordered the lasagna which was covered in melted cheese and sauce and was cold/not fully cooked in the middle. She brought this to the waiter's attention but he was not very helpful (partially because it was the end of the meal time and this was because he never really came back to our table to check on us). The waiter was, however, very accommodating when the couple next to us complained about something being too spicy, which he promptly removed it and took it off their bill. The service was not great in my opinion and the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Will go back in a heartbeat! Met the manager introduced by a high roller friend, very pleasant!   Pros:  Fresh and hot pasta. Excellent service Good price Quick seating  Cons: Outside the strip Cold bread :/  Will go back here. Enjoyed my shrimp scampi, calamari and will have desserts next time."}
{"text":"Hmm...  Such a disappointment.  Caesar salad was pretty awful, but the real disappointment was the \"Margarita Pizza\".  OMG how can I describe this...  instead of any semblance of fresh tomatoes, cheese, etc it was just a yellow bland scary looking and tasting thing.  Nothing about this pizza was fresh or even remotely tasty.  Think first generation frozen pizza that you can microwave.   This restaurant is in the M Resort so the audience may be somewhat captive.  I stay at the M frequently.  I have noticed a significant change in the place since it was bought out by Penn National Gaming, unfortunately the changes are all to save money.  Message to the management: We noticed.  However, I'm not sure Marinelli's was good ever, this restaurant is just not where you would go for good Italian food."}
{"text":"I had a gift certificate so I figured I might as well use it. Atmosphere/decor was very nice. The location in the building is ideal because they have a nice view. The only booths that they have are located right by the kitchen so it was a little loud and I had to speak a little louder during conversation. Our waitress Charity was very nice. The menu has a decent selection considering its authentic Italian food. The wine list for bottles was pretty extensive. We ended up getting the mozzarella impanata for an appetizer, the salmon dish, and the beef filet. They were all delicious. I asked for a recommendation on what wine is best and our waitress recommended the Pinot Grigio. I was happy. The only problem I had was I asked for my beef filet to be good medium rare but it was more on the medium to almost medium well side. Other than that no other complaints. They pay attention to refilling water cups pretty well too."}
