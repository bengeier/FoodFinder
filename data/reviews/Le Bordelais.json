{"text":"Recently visited this cozy restaurant located on boul gouin and was quite impressed with their dishes. It is located on boul Gouin and is truly a picturesque site ...perfect for taking a stroll after dinner. The resto decor is cozy and service is friendly. The restaurant is frequented by an older generation living in the area. The cuisine is classic french cuisine and every dish we tried was truly impressive and tasty. Had their ny grilled steak accompanied by their classic french peppercorn sauce and loved it. I would recommend trying this restaurant at least once as it is worth the experience...would recommend Sunday afternoons or Friday evenings."}

{"text":"This place caught my eye by it's nice sign and exterior facade so I was very interested to try it! The location is great for summer since theres a trail to walk on right besides the water. When I walked in I found the interior a bit outdated however the service was amazing! Very courteous and attentive waiter we had. When we got our food we took the \"table d'hôte\" that was honestly not worth the trip , I ordered the salmon with hollandaise sauce and was disappointed by how basic and minimal it was. The entrees we had ordered to share were better tho , escargot and beef tartare. I wouldn't personally go back to this place but I feel it caters more to an older crowd and maybe I was out of place on my gastronomic adventure."}
