{"text":"Forget Dunkin' Donuts, where the donuts are the only thing not worth eating, this is the real deal.  A neighborhood donut shop, for reals.  

Do the time warp.  Seriously, do it!  Because this place will take you back in time to when donuts were made by...people!

First, peruse the nicely varied selection of donuts and other pastries. Then, sidle up to the counter and give your order to the somewhat surly, but efficient server.  Finally, your heaping box of doughy goodness home or take a seat amongst the chatting oldsters.  If you're prone to Homer Simpson style drooling, check yourself.  

What are you waiting for?  Get yourself a donut, or three."}
{"text":"The owner got me hot donuts and recommended a very tasty treat, very hospitable ! Loved my first experience here! So delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for the first time, but we will definitely be back! Donuts & pastry are Delicious, the service was great. They have a great variety. We brought a dozen home, think I just gained a few pounds."}
{"text":"Been here once.
We ordered the ice cream on the cone and the lady scooping it, is shaking so the ice cream keeps on falling. It took us about 10mins to wait for 2cones of ice cream.We really wanted to help her ,but i think she is not in the mood that day. 
Tried the glazed donuts and its fine..will love to try the other flavors next time we visit this place! 
Hope there is somebody with the old lady to help her with the customers."}
{"text":"worst customer service I've ever had. We went there one night & the employee had an attitude like \"wtf do you want.\" Now that I think of it he didn't even ask \"how may I help you\" we just told him what we wanted. The atmosphere was very uncomfortable too. Maybe its because he had his rap music blaring & was on his cell phone cussing. We decided to take our teas to go because we did not feel welcome at all."}
{"text":"First time stopping by this morning and I had a maple bar, blueberry cake donut and baklava. All three were delicious! The blueberry was the best, not too dense and not too sweet...perfection. Although the selection is limited the donuts I did get I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Some of the worst donuts I ever had. Bland and stale. My wife and I walked out and left the donuts on the table after two bites. This was 2 years ago. Never been back."}
{"text":"Best doughnuts around! The owners are very nice and the hours they are open, suits pretty much any schedule. These doughnuts melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Saw lots of good reviews and im always looking for a late night coffee joint. Hubby and i went at 10:30 am. Not busy at all one table with 3 kids running all over...even behind the counter! 

Heard the apple fritters were good. Not so much. Quite dry and not much in the way of apple flavor. I also ordered a blended iced mocha. What i got was some creamer and a premixed drink of some sort over ice...last i checked blended implied the use of a blender.

Service was soso.  The lady wasnt behind the counter when we came in. Slow to make drinks. Disappeared again after we sat down. Every table was dirty and both do it yourself bus tubs were full.  Not the least bit impressed. My coffee maker and Albertsons are both closer to home...and faster.

Rather disappointed and not sure what the other reviewers were raving about."}
{"text":"Looking for a #Cronut in Mesa? The 19th Donut Hole carries them. Today they had plain (my fav) whipped cream and apple."}
{"text":"When I walk into the 19th Donut Hole I feel like I've gone back in time. I don't think that was ever their intention, they just haven't changed anything since the beginning. The decor, etc. it just plain and reminds me of...a donut shop! 

I've been coming to the 19th Donut hole for 3 years now and I've highly enjoyed the atmosphere and donuts each and every time. The older lady who helps me has always been really polite and helpful, and really just reminds me of my grandma fixing me a snack. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm from Ohio and I've been trying to hunt down creme filled sticks or creme filled long johns (whichever lingo you prefer).  I went into 19th Donut Hole hoping for a sighting.  Again they had the long bars with chocolate icing but no filling.  After I questioned about them having any, they offered to filled them for me.  They split the donut in half lengthwise and filled it with creme.  It's not visually what I'm accustomed to but it was decent and fulfilled my craving.  I also had a cinnamon/sugar twist which was excellent.  My husband had 2 cake donuts and a maple bar and I hear no complaints.  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts around and the people are so sweet. I love getting the Doughnut holes!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I'd say these are on par with bosa donuts. Donuts are a little smaller but also cheaper I think. Friendly owner. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owners aways treat us like family, super friendly, and love showing off new treats. They were willing to make things off menu and were happy to let us try new things; maybe our Cronut and Cheese breakfast sandwich will become a new menu item!"}
{"text":"Their dougnuts is delicious! Ive never stayed and ate at the shop always pick up and go. The cashier who was thier didnt say much, but he definitely needs work. He started putting our doughnuts in a paper bag when hubby and I were choosing our dougnuts. I told him we were ordering more so we'll need a box. When we checked out he didnt give us a lid I had to asked for it haha. I swear he wasnt in a hurry no one was there but us. But oh well... I will definitely be back for more their CRONUTS IS DELICIOUS! You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Crappy donuts. Rude workers. They almost seemed pissed when you want to buy a donut. There are a ton of good donut places around but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Better than BoSa ... the locals have been wrong. Try the blueberry or strawberry varietal.
Note: 35-cent charge for debit card but, really, guys...it's 35 cents."}
{"text":"They have cronuts !!  One of the owners was present when i went in to get a few treats.  He added the chocolate drizzle over the cronuts.   I always get the same cream filled guys.  Unfortunately i haven't tried any of the other donuts.  These little are not cheap at $2 each."}
{"text":"The owners, Nick and Anna, are very friendly and go above and beyond to make you feel welcome! After you go a few times, they'll remember you. They know many of their customers by their name. It's your typical mom and pop shop feel and very family oriented. If you want stuffy, pretentious service, this is not the place for you. Many winter visitors flood this place during the winter months and I know it's because they're made to feel so welcome and much like the small town breakfast spots in the mid-west. I bring my two children here and often this is where we'll meet grandma and cousins for a treat. As for the donuts, better than anything else around here and very affordable. Coffee service is great and refills are kept coming. My daughter loves getting their tuna sandwich at lunch time which is made fresh to order. We've ordered several birthday cakes from here which were not only beautifully decorated to our theme but also delicious!"}
{"text":"I was never a fan of cheese danishes before I discovered this bakery. Up until this point, every danish I had eaten was sticky, cloyingly sweet, and covered with greasy icing that failed to hide a dry dough. 

The cheese danish at the 19th Donut Hole may be one of the best things I've ever eaten. The dough is flaky, with a crispy outside and chewy inside,  with buttery soft layers. The cheese has a nice consistency to it, with a sweet, creamy flavor and the while thing is drizzled with just enough icing. No cloying, sticky glaze here! They sell quickly so if you want one sleeping in is not an option.  They usually sell out before 9AM.

I also need to mention the chocolate chip donuts. When I was a kid,  the local bakery had these and I loved them so much. They went out of business years ago, and I have since moved out of state and had yet to find them until now, and they make them just as good as the my former town bakery. :)

I've never eaten a donut from this bakery I didn't like. The owners and employees are always polite and wonderful. They love what they do and it shows."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to check this place out, especially after all the great reviews. I love supporting local business but unfortunately our experience was just so-so.

For a Saturday morning, I guess I expected there to be a greater variety of donuts. The offerings looked like what I could have gotten at Safeway. The price was reasonable and quality was ok. I had a chocolate covered old fashioned, the kids each had a sugar covered twist, and my husband had an egg and cheese croissant. 

It was pretty busy when we walked in and from what I overheard it sounded like a lot off the snow birds were headed out of town until next winter. The lady working behind the counter was chatting all of them up, so she must have known them pretty well. As for us newcomers, I felt like I was getting stared down when we were trying to decide what to order (and when two kids were trying to make up their minds) so we ended up with stuff we probably didn't really want. And the coffee? Forget about it. We didn't order any because there were way too many choices for a small donut shop and it cause unnecessary anxiety. 

I'm sure we will be back to give this place a second chance. It is just down the street after all."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place is the holy grail of donuts. The buttermilk bar is simply mouth watering.......I would consider being fat if i could eat here on the daily!"}
{"text":"The donuts are average, my favorite is the buttermilk bar. The breakfast sandwiches taste like gross microwaved premade frozen things. The tall young man working there is really awkward and almost sort of rude. You can tell there are a million other things he'd rather be doing than helping his customers. He also speaks very quietly and I can barely understand him. To top it off, he grabbed our donuts with his bare hands! I tried to assure myself they were clean but I really doubt they were. I don't know know they don't use tongs or something. I was disgusted! Wondering if he even has a food handlers certification."}
{"text":"Reviews are right about service. Dude didn't even take out his headphones, then after every donut selection he was like, \"HUH? WHAT?\" 
I wish the owners read the reviews and fixed their employee issues.
Cake donuts are awesome. Raised donuts are .... hard and chewy... it's difficult to describe. But the complete opposite of light and fluffy like they should be. The buttermilk is decent. And apple fritters are hard and the ones we got were a little overcooked, maybe on a different day they're better, the flavor is ok though.
I'm not going to start going to this place instead of BOSA, but the late hours are pretty nice even though the help makes you never want to go back."}
{"text":"Really top notch doughnuts!! Love supporting a local, family owned business. They have great maple bars!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in the valley! This is coming from a chubby guy who's family were almost all cops. The donuts are made fresh everyday starting at like 2 AM. The variety is fantastic and the owners are absolutely wonderful. I walked in this morning and Nick said he was making a new variety from France or New Orleans or somewhere cool and wanted me to try it. I did and wow!
Friendly gather place, fantastic food and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"19th Donut Hole is a family tradition for us. Been going here regularly since my parents move to Mesa in 1996. Great family owned business. Very friendly. Don't try the chocolate chip bars because my kids already have trouble finding them in the display case because they are so popular.  They are too sweet for me though. I get one of their delicious Apple Fritters. Good fresh traditional donuts."}
{"text":"Fresh donuts every day. The place is packed every morning. Reminds me of a donut shop in Ohio where the whole town started their Saturday at the donut shop. Owners work hard and have done a great job. The cronut is nuts."}
{"text":"Don't usually order apple fritter but there is something about their apple fritters here at 19th Donut Hole.  I don't know what it is but  ever since my wife and I move to Arizona, I've been ordering an apple fritter and coffee every time I go here.  The place is just simple but their donuts is good!  Try their apple fritter and see for yourself!  God bless."}
{"text":"Lovely quaint little place. I know this has been here for at least 9 years and I just never made time to STOP. Glad I wandered in on a FRiday Late night..to find the Doughnut maker hard at work. These are delicious...just like mom would make. This place is open 24/7..so a nice little place to stop by and just have a cup of coffee and a TReat. The donuts are nice and crispy on the outside...and the cook is a sweetheart too"}
{"text":"Love this place. We come every Sunday after church. They are always fresh and taste amazing. Staff is super friendly as well. Highly recommend. Our favorite donut is the blueberry glazed."}
{"text":"This is my second review after trying the coffee.  The donut's were still great.  Tried the blended coffee and regular coffee this time.  The regular coffee was good, had it black and it went well with the donut.   The blended coffee was not so good, but it's not what I would go there for again.  Stick with the regular coffee and donuts and you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Best donut shop around, great donuts, friendly service, goodbye Dunkin, I hardly knew ya!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this donut shop.  I work nearby and stop in once a week for a coffee and a freshly baked donut because I simply can't help myself... The donuts are made every morning by the owner (who is a fellow Michigander!) and he is the type of small business owner who gives you the service and the product that makes you want to support him.  He even makes the Boston creme filling in his donuts from scratch!  If only the rest of his service staff was as genuinely kind and neighborly as he is when it's bright and early just after he's just finished baking his daily batch of product... But hey.  This shop also serves Thrifty brand ice cream.  Gotta love that for creative dessert endeavors, especially in the summer after a long shift if I can catch it before it closes at 5 on weekdays. 

America doesn't have to live on Dunkin! Local family owned businesses ftw."}
{"text":"No, just no!! Do not waste your money here.  The Bavarian Cream tasted like grease and the apple fritter was not very appley.  Forget the deluxe latte, it was just \"gas station\" coffee.  So disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place has good donuts. We have been there in the am and also late at night. Service is like night and day. I think the owners are there in the day because the people working in the AM seem to have good customer service. 
At night, the 1 man crew is very unpersonable and a bit rude. Since the night person makes the donuts and can close up and leave whenever they are done, they seem to be irritated when someone comes in and interrupts thier work.
So you never know when they close on a certain night. You just have to call.
But as far as the donuts, we have always been happy with whatever we get."}
{"text":"Its delicious not just the typical donuts ive tried before! I have tried online delivery & order another one the following day! My favorite is cronuts! Lol i need to do a lot of cardio to offset the number of cronuts that i have been eating! But for me its worth it! If you are gonna splurge with donuts- this is the place ! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The donuts are really good! They aren't out of this world amazing but they are good and are at a fair price. The service is also just good and not over the top but it isn't really bad either. Cronuts are amazing. And the best time to get the donuts are early in the morning when it's still fresh and soft!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this blessed little shop months ago at eleven at night and my life just hasn't been the same.  My roommates and I were back two more times in the next twenty-four hours.  I mean, I have been to a few late night donut shops.  And they are all TERRIBLE.  No selection, and what they have is old.  This is not the case.  I love donut shops.  Love them.  And I have never found one to compare, from New York City to LA.

I have no idea what their hours are, I do think they close sometime in the evening.  But they seem to always be open after 11 pm (this place should be a stoner's dream) and a lot of the time you can catch a fresh batch around then.  Their blueberry are amazing, their chocolate uses real fudge.  I have never had a bad donut there.  Never.  Go.  You won't regret it.  Unless you eat all of the chocolate on chocolate cake donuts before I get there."}
{"text":"Went there after disappointment with the fractured prune and we where not impressed. The place  Smelled like old greasy donuts and the donuts tasted the same way.  Gave my husband an upset stomach for rest of the day. Glad i only ate half of a blueberry one so i didn't sick."}
{"text":"Best donut shop in the East Valley!  Fresh donuts and the perfect cup of coffee that comes with free refills.   I love the apple fritter and the blueberry cake donut.  The owners are lovely, generous, friendly people who take time to know their customers on a first name basis.   Always a good experience!"}
{"text":"This guy knows how to make a repeat customer!

Came in for the first time today and got a dozen, the proprietor gave me one of his special croissant glazed donut for no extra charge! (Amazing and awesome unique recipe BTW) Then he threw in an extra apple crueler because i said they looked awesome, then did it all for a normal dozen. WOW, I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Great donuts and friendly service I highly recommend & good coffee. I have no idea what the guy was complaining about the owners English was fine"}
{"text":"Nice selection of doughnuts. I got the cronut, french cruller, apple fritter and the gentlemen at the register threw in a regular glazed for me as well. 

Overall, the doughnuts were fluffy and tasty. I did taste some of the oil they used for frying - so that's why 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after many weeks of longing for a cronut. It is an old school neighborhood style donut shop. Several senior citizens in there that seemed to be regulars since the employee was sitting with them when I walked in. Promptly greeted and I told him it was my first visit. He gave me a run down on the favorite donuts.

I ordered the creme filled cronut and the cherry filled donut burrito. The cronut just might be the best pastry or donut I have eaten. Certainly earns a place in my top 5. I really enjoyed the cherry burrito. Basically a sweet tortilla filled with cherry filling and fried then glazed with donut icing. Quite the yummy departure from a normal breakfast pastry.

Service I thought was great. Very friendly and helpful. Good enthusiasm for the product and someone new to the store. I will definitely be back and have placed the 19th donut hole on my regular rotation of donut shops on the east valley. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it is the greatest experience. It's very family oriented and the donuts are delicious! If you're looking for a friendly atmosphere and yummy treats-this is the place!"}
{"text":"Donuts were average in flavor and consistency with not many toppings or flavor options to choose from. Also had the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich which was again, mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"I stopped by here around 2 am because I was on my way home and was craving some donuts. The employee was very friendly and attentive. Seriously the best chocolate cake donuts ever. Every place I've ever gone to has let me down when it comes to chocolate cake donuts, even my favorite donut shop back home, and I'm a picky girl. But these were so good, they had like a slightly crisp outside (not dry or crunchy though) and the insides were soft and fluffy and just melted in my mouth. And this was at 2 in the morning, I was honestly expecting kinda stale donuts since it was so late. I will be coming back many times until they close down, more excited than I should be to try the different flavors they have."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a donut on Monday Morning. The shop is small with several tables inside and one outside. There is a wide variety of fresh donuts, coffee, bagel sandwiches and croissants. There is also ice cream. I chose a chocolate frosted long john. It was fresh and so good. The place is clean and service is friendly."}
{"text":"We rode our bikes over to this shop down the street. We got there late on Sunday around 12-1230 and to our surprise there were still some doughnuts/pastries available. We got 3 doughnuts and two iced coffees. The doughnuts were amazing but the coffee a little on the weaker side. We will definitely return and I'll find something a little more for me on the drinks side. 
The outside furniture could have been better. A new patio set is cheap and adds curb appeal. 
See you next time!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem**** Family owned and operated small business. The owners are extremely friendly and I love their doughnuts."}
{"text":"Late night donuts! 
Their blueberry donut is quite delish! If you like blueberries and you like donuts, try this out!"}
{"text":"Incredible donuts and CRONUTS!!! Owner is sweetest guy! Come early for freshest and best selection. I bought a dozen ( and he threw in an extra for free ) at 3:30 in the afternoon and they were wonderful the chocolate chip filled donut rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Got a half dozen to go. There are a lot of varieties of donuts here, and other sweets that make this shop unique. When I was here they had glazed fruit filled burritos. Interesting!

I was on a more non-adventurous route though, and went with some cake donuts. I got a mix of plain, cinnamon crunch, blueberry, and chocolate covered old fashioned. The donuts were very good. They had a lightly crisp outer coating, and tender soft interior. They were the right amount of sweetness. The only negative was that some of them were slightly too greasy for me, but only slightly. The chocolate glaze on the old fashioned was a perfect smoothness and very evenly coated which made it look quite nice. The blueberry was easily my favorite, with a lot of blueberry flavor packed into the donut and a light sugary glaze.

Service was warm and friendly. The donuts are a very reasonable price too. My half dozen was $5.50 total. I'll be back to try more delectable donuts!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place as the hours are so abnormally awesome for Mesa. We are new to this area and we have found it odd that nearly everything closes at 8PM most nights.  We were happily surprised to read that this place was open most of the night.  So we planned a family outing and went to check it out.

We were looking forward to trying the Cronuts and maybe an iced coffee.  We stopped in and found only one young man working the counter.  Unfortunately we quickly saw he had an attitude as if we were disturbing whatever he was doing in the back.

We asked about Cronuts and were told \"you see what we have, we are all out\".  We asked about iced coffee drinks and if they have those and were told he doesn't have time to make that.

He couldn't even speak well enough to be understandable when we asked about ordering a dozen donuts.  I wasn't sure if they even sold them by the dozen after his response.

So while their service sucked, the donuts looked pretty good.  Aside from one completely stale and hard as a brick cake Donut we had, the others all were quite tasty.

It's a shame their service turned us off of this place as we live in Mesa and would love to make this a frequent place to stop for a late night sugar high."}
{"text":"The best donuts in town! The only place I'll ever go to for donuts omg I absolutely love the maple bar and strawberry glaze with sprinkles! Sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick donut and ended up buying a little of this and that! Believe me, these are the best! Forget mainstream donuts! These is the place to go. They have fountain Coke products and a few specialty  coffee's along with regular coffee. The customer service is awesome! I will definitely be returning! Thank you.."}
{"text":"The donuts were nothing special, just a little better than Dunkin' Donuts. But what really put a bad taste in my mouth was the hidden credit card fee. After I was given my total, I took out my card, and without saying anything the girl added $0.35 to my bill. Only because I was paying attention and because I asked, was I told this was a credit card fee. There were no signs mentioning this policy. It felt deceitful so I won't return."}
{"text":"Best donuts around, nice people. Why would you go to a chain place when this little mom and pop gem is dominating east Mesa?"}
{"text":"Tried to buy a dozen donuts today but after waiting 5 mins while the worker chatted with people at tables gave up and went to another place. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday (May 5th). Had to try the \"Cronut\" they sell. It was amazing! The taste of the donut outside and croissant inside was well worth the drive to Mesa. 

Also tried a few of the other donuts. They had this square looking donut with chocolate topping along with the apple bear claw. They were also amazing. 

My only complaint was that I came back later for some more Cronuts and they were out. Man, that sucked."}
{"text":"I love donuts and when you walk out of your car and head to the door the donut smell hits you right in the face... mmmm donuts in my Homer Simpson voice... walking in I was greeted everyone in the place was smiling really nice atmosphere... I got an old fashion donut and a cup of pecan praline ice cream, not a bad donut shop I'll be back.."}
{"text":"My dad just came back from here after I asked him to pick up a cinnamon roll and a dozen donuts. Based off of the reviews I chose this place but what a waste of money! He said they gave us the remaining donuts from earlier that day but if you're a donut shop wouldn't you be stocked with donuts all day?? The cinnamon roll they gave us looks pathetic. I don't get off work til 5 and that's why I asked my dad to go (this place closes at 5) so I guess I have to truck my ass someplace else to get a decent cinnamon roll after all! The donuts are for my friends but still, I wish the donuts I were giving them were better or at least a variety of cake/glazed. All that's in the box are glazed twists and chocolate. BORING! It's not often I want to buy a bunch of treats unless it's for a special occasion like it will be tomorrow. Thanks for making the day less so! I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Bosa's is our usual stop for donuts, but his place was good too. I arrived pretty late at night and the selection might not have been what it was earlier in the day, but I still found some of my favorites. A friendly face behind the counter was nice, too. I'll go again if I'm in the area and in the mood for a donut!

They also have Thrify ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place has an old timey feel to it, I mean if you woke up here you probably wouldn't be sure what decade you were in, but it is a quality to love about it.

Come here for the good old fashioned donut and a cup of joe, and do not expect anything else.  I had the sour cream, which is an all time favorite of mine, and it did not disappoint, perfectly crusty and glazed on the outside, with a soft and tasty middle.  To drink I got a vanilla iced coffee which came out of a pre-mixed dispenser, therefore it was a lot sweeter and thicker (almost like chocolate milk) than I'm used to, but I drank it regardless because it paired well with my already bad-for-me donut."}
{"text":"Surprised this place has so many good reviews. Stopped in there this morning instead of going up the street to my \"regular\" donut place because the road was closed. The selection was pretty limited and the place has a really strong odor of natural gas. Waited in line behind one other customer for quite a while before being (sort of) greeted by an uninterested employee. Got my donuts and paid, price for a dozen was reasonable so that's why I gave 3 stars. The donuts, however, were hard and crusty for the most part - at least 6 out of the dozen were this way. Seems like maybe they were leftover from another day.. Just dried out and not very good. For the price, I guess I got what I paid for but don't think I'd go back. My regular place never fails me."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite donut place! I have been coming here since I was little and it's still the best around. Their buttermilk bars are to die for! Always friendly staff and a great selection of donuts. I would also recommend their blueberry donuts!"}
{"text":"Contender for Bosa! I love the freshness, service and variety. If you like donuts (everyone) you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"Need a doughnut? grab-n-go here. This is a small doughnut shop that sells most of the doughnuts you find at your average bakery. The apple fritter I got was ok. The selection was not what you'd find at Dunkin Doughnuts, but the quality is good. There is also a variety of sandwiches as well as ice cream. This is a nice store to get your morning coffee and doughnut if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times..Very nice place to get fresh donuts that taste good. My daughter loves this place and she loves donuts."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Really cheap good quality donuts!!! Plus the costumer service was really good. I'm definitely making this my one and only donut shop"}
{"text":"Great donuts, a little hard to find but worth the hunt. Must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters. My wife loves the chocolate chip rolls. They can also make your next party cake. We have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past. Always excellent!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town in taste, texture, quality, price all of the above. Its become a little off the beaten path stop on our weekend routine. Some mornings the place is packed to the gills with locals enjoying the fair and coffee, others its a ghost town; ill take it either way. The staff is welcoming and kind and can i say a million more times the taste is amazing. Theres something about a warm, flaky doughnut that made to perfection that sends all diet rumors straight to hell. . If you're a donut lover take my word for it and drop in a Friday morning and see for yourself; but bare in mind that the later in the day you go the smaller their selection gets, they make their product fresh and dont have the ability to restock the shelves with mass produced frozen product, earlier the better = fresher by the dozen (plus theres that time in the morning when the light of the sun keeps the glazes warm and self heats the glass cases - my mouth is watering at this very moment). ."}
{"text":"Cute little store! Went in on a whim, just to try it out - owner was very nice, and they were a little busy, so I knew it must be a good find! I was right. Donuts were delicious and fresh, coffee was good - definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews for the donuts in the area and all were favorable.  We decided to try the 19th Hole and weren't disappointed. We got there before 6 and they were still warm! The guy was really friendly. We got a mixed dozen for less than $10. My favorites were buttermilk, maple glazed old fashion and the apple fritter."}
