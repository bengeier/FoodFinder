{"text":"What business closes but leaves their front door UNLOCKED!!! Well Smoke's did and I'm highly upset. Checked on Yelp and the website for the closing time. It clearly said Saturday at midnight. So we arrive just before 11:30pm. The door is unlocked and we walk inside. Stand there for a few seconds looking at the menu and young girl approaches saying the business is closed and has been since 11pm. I asked well why is your front door unlocked? She couldn't give me an answer. So I said why does you website and Yelp say you close at 12am? Still no answer. I've been to the Smoke's in Vancouver and it was amazing. Well too bad I didn't get to check out this location and won't be back. Do your business a favor and update your store hours on Yelp and your website. And when you close its best to lock the front door especially when there are shady characters hanging around outside. Teach your staff a thing about customer service. It wouldn't have hurt to show some courtesy to give out coupons for the trouble and mistake in hours posted."}
{"text":"Full of loud post-clubbers late at night, the poutine itself isn't amazing but it's filling and good for the post-bar stomach. Not a huge fan of their gravy - it's heavy and gelatinous but it does the trick when you need the fix. Their chili poutine is filling, but I find their pork options way too much even for my appetite.
I ate there for a pre-theatre dinner with friends. I remember feeling really heavy and quite frankly gross while Maria sang about the hills being alive. From this, I learned that Smoke's is only really good when you're tired & tipsy - perfect for stirring a greasy, heavy, appetite.

Also, keep an eye out for the Smoke's on Wheels truck, touring Toronto"}
{"text":"Amazing! 

From Toronto and sooo happy to see there is one out here now! Great gravy, great price. This is a must eat place if you like a great poutine!"}
{"text":"WOOO overall a worth while experience if the midset is right. I love going here after a long night chasing boys at the Brunny or nazigating the habo hotel that is the Maddy. Nothing feels better after a night of molson canadian 67's then a nice poutine. I prefer the Nacho Poutine which is Super yummy! Lines can be a bit crazy and seating is nonexistant. I like all the variety Even though I never order anything else I like the option!"}
{"text":"Here is the problem...the poutine is just not that great. their fries are average, the sauce is average and the cheese tastes average. Go to Montreal for a real poutine. 

If the french fries were just tastier by themselves i would give them one more star. My suggestion is to skip the place"}
{"text":"The place was filthy and the cashier was rude. Definitely staying away from this location."}

Small just to try.  Mind you,  it was 10 pm  and didn't want to overeat. 
The nice counter guy  came to the table with two orders, and insisted 1 could  never be enough .. He set it down and said Enjoy.. He was right,   it wasn't enough! 
We most  certainly  did  enjoy it and Smokes on Adelaide will be a full stop next time in Toronto! 
Thank you Smokes for rocking it !!   

A great Vacation memory..."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while as I'm a big fan of poutine. I love the fact that they're open late. I don't think they're open late every night, but I went at about midnight on a Thursday and they were open.

The place is small with counter seating for about 8 people and an order counter. The menu is easy to read on the back wall. The only problem with it is that so many of the options look so good it might take a few minutes to make up your mind. As it was my first time at Smoke's, I decided to try the traditional poutine. My brother took longer to decide and eventually went with the nacho poutine. The guy working at the counter was cool, helpful, and patient even as my brother changed his mind a couple times.

My poutine was good but not great. The fries seemed a bit old, the gravy wasn't as delicious as my favourite spots in Montreal, and the cheese wasn't squeaky. It was however the most authentic poutine I've had in Toronto and I will definitely go back and perhaps up my star rating if the fries are fresher. My brother raved about his nacho poutine. He said it was a way better version of Taco Bell's \"Fries Supreme\".

As far as the sizes go, get the small one. Trust me. I ordered the bigger size as I generally have a fair sized appetite and I hardly put a dent in it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the poutine here. I was in the area after checking into a hotel after the Toronto power blackout and stopped in here for a take-out lunch.

I ordered the Deluxe Vegetarian poutine ('Wow size') and I was pleased with the overall product. However, the green peas tasted like they were frozen (didn't have that soft fresh taste), and the gravy/fries had a little too much salt. The gravy was a veggie blend (extra spices added to add depth of taste?) but I would have enjoyed a little less salt. Perhaps the salt was normal and it was just a factor of ordering a large poutine size? The cheese curds squeaked on chewing, and the caramelized onions and mushrooms were excellent.

The staff members were friendly and I didn't have a long wait to get my order. I'd order from this place again but I'd try another poutine iteration. Perhaps the non veggie poutines have a little less salt in them?"}
{"text":"It's ok. Customer service was great. But had huge discrepancy between two poutines I got. Same size, one was heaping the other was concave almost. Both a little bit too salty. Would still come back for more"}
{"text":"The appeal of Smoke's is the array of poutine toppings on offer, what is not appealing is the poutine itself.  In full disclosure, I'm from Montreal so I am consciously trying to suppress the 'snob factor' in my review.  I also ordered the regular veggie, which I'm guessing (based on taste), is not their specialty.

From the top.  I had to wait for what seemed to be an excessively long time for gravy and cheese to be applied to french fries.  Is it just me or should this not take all but one or two minutes, as opposed to ten?  And what's with the cameras all over the place? I always find that level of surveillance unsettling since it suggests that management is mistrustful and overbearing on staff.  The counter staff are actually the only reason I'm giving the place two stars, they were friendly, competent and ..well, that's about as much as I expect from fast food service. 

On to the poutine.  I find $6+ to be pretty steep for regular, which is essentially \"small\".  I might have been able to let this go if the poutine had made up for it but the gravy was beyond underwhelming: bland, overly sweet, kinda gross.  On top of that, or maybe below(?), the curds weren't all that fresh and nary a squeak could be heard. The fries didn't exactly steal the show either, there was nothing 'bad' about them but I didn't have any \"mmm, these fries are delicious\" moments.  

I knew going in not to expect the blissful poutine of my Quebecois yesteryear, but my only hope is that Smoke's does not become the standard for Toronto."}
{"text":"Never really had a poutine my Co worker said that the food was good and I took his word. We both had a  Philly cheese steak meal I asked for bacon on mine. The service was very slow and boring the lady who worked there did not look to happy and she was playing Punjabi music in the back nothing wrong with  that but it's a chan so does it fit. I got my food it was big but no bacon that I paid for and salty the potatoes taste like it was not washed i did not eat it just the toppings. I guess it was a bad experience and never will i go back to any chan because of this restaurant. The sad thing is that I was still hungry and it cost me $16.09"}
{"text":"Best Poutine I've ever had no complaints. I've been to most of their locations and they are all flawless. Screw the haters they don't know what they are talking about."}
{"text":"Great fries fresh and hot made from real potatoes gravy is great also like roasted chicken yummy"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 or 5 times and the poutine is pretty good. One time my poutine was not as good as it normally was but I thought the cook looked like they were still learning. Another time I had amazing customer service all because of the two ladies working. They had awesome attitudes and my food was good. Lots of choices on the menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Been here a few times all meal size poutine were good but some days it is a little salty, decided to try triple pork, after got order tried it find it excellent especially the pulled pork which has a smoky taste to it, overall it is a fine poutine joint, I will come back when in the area."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews for Smoke's Poutinerie, I had hopes for this place.  But that quickly changed after trying some.

The fries were smaller and more wimpy looking.  The gravy was really salty and had a strong yet weird aroma.  I can't really describe the cheese as my tastebuds were overwhelmed by the gravy.

Would I recommend this place to a friend?  No, I'd drag em over to Nathan Philips Square and get the best poutine in Ontario from Mr. Tasty Fries.

{"text":"Meh.

The fries tend to be waxy, the gravy is fine, not great. I've been a few times, and the staff is always surly and the food is always disappointing. I want it to be great, but it just isn't."}
{"text":"How could anyone not like smokes?  It's packed at lunch, so be prepared to wait in a long line and then probably not get a seat right away.  It's ok though, because it's more than worth the wait...  Try the triple pork, sausage, bacon and pulled pork, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Looooove the poutine here. Good portions and great toppings that make one delicious box of clogged arteries. They offer a variety of different kinds of poutines from the traditional gravy and curds, to veggies and to meat-lover specials (choice of chicken, pork or beef). The service was kinda slow the day I went as there was only one person behind the counter taking the orders AND making them. The wait didn't bother me too much as the poutine here is awesome so definetly worth the wait. It's kinda messy with the gracious amount of gravy they give, but if you're looking for some pretty good poutine, check this place out! I highly recommend the peppercorn gravy, yum!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the buzz about smoke's, i went over to taste this poutine for myself. the place was quite small, with inadequate space for a group of 10, but we decided to stick around anyways. I tried country harvest for myself. The small size was quite generous. After getting our orders, We found out that there was a WOW sample size, which would have been a much 'health-conscious' option. It was found In small print at the bottom of their menu.Oh well...

The country harvest was bustling with chicken, bacon, mushrooms and peas. It was quite delicious for the first few bites. The experience went down hill after that, feeling all bloated and stuffed. 

Overall, I didn't think smokes lived up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Pretty good poutine for what you pay for.  The veggie nacho is great.

Line ups can be long after the bar, but the staff is usually pretty friendly."}
{"text":"First off, don't order the large unless you are a big eater with a big appetite. It's huge. I eat a lot and yet was completely unable to finish the portion. I had the pulled pork, came out fast, was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Having never had poutine before, I had to stop in this place before leaving Canada.

Trying it, I have to say I don't understand how this isn't popular in America, it seems like an all-American food: French fries, gravy, and cheese. What's not to love?

Their regular size is larger than I was expecting. And it was delicious. Not too much to say about the atmosphere other than that I dig the chalkboard on the wall, that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Okay, to start off, I am the biggest lover of poutine. As a gay man who is in love with poutine I wasn't happy to take a bite of EXTREMELY salty poutine! Too salty!!! Jheez Louise!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  The meal size is more then good enough. Loved the peppercorn gravy.  But I really needed a beer with this meal :("}
{"text":"Canadians know how to eat! My husband and I visited Toronto in May and we knew that a famous local dish in Canada is Poutine (we have a version in the states called disco fries, simply fries gravy and cheese, nothing fancy like poutine though) so we knew that we couldn't leave without at least trying it once somewhere! We did a lot of research and found that lots of people fancied smokes so we decided to check it out since it was only a few blocks from out hotel!
 It was so good!!!!!! Thankfully we each ordered the smaller size cause they really fill up that container plus the dish itself is pretty filling!  The cheese curds were amazing, the gravy was really delicious, i only wish the fries were a lil less greasy, but other than that it was a delicious meal. So delicious we knew we had to have it again before we did, and so before we left we made sure to stop in and grab 2 orders for the road! This time we got it with bacon!! Yum! 
The menu id great, they have so many varieties and options it was kind of hard to choose from!! If you are in the toronto area def check them out!"}
{"text":"I like that they have a variety of poutine. They also have coke in actual glass bottles which is great. I do wish the fries tasted like NY fries though. Great place to grab a snack after a movie across the street"}
{"text":"I've had really awesome Poutine and Smoke's doesn't quite hit the mark. Excited to head there for lunch today after reading their website and the reviews here.

They profess to serve \"fries that are hand-cut daily from Premium Yellow Fleshed potatoes\". Well, you may have pretty branded potato bags at your entrance, but I can tell you the fries are not hand cut. And if they are, I wanna hire the person who hand cuts your fries so each fry is perfectly shaped like it came out of a machine. The gravy was simply okay with a hint of flavor. Apparently the fries are also tossed in a \"custom made seasoning recipe\" of which my palette detected zero. I will say that delivery was fast, fresh, and steaming hot.

Gourmet hype without the delivery."}
{"text":"As a Montreal boy living in Toronto it's really hard to find a restaurant in Toronto that can satisfy that poutine craving.... Until now! Smokes is awesome!  Fresh-cut fries. PROPER GRAVY and squeaky cheese curds! All packed in a cool wax lined box! 

A must try for all!!!"}
{"text":"A poutine at Smoke's is such an indulgent treat! It may seem pricey for poutine, but each box is packed to the brim with food. We ordered a meal sized prime rib poutine to share (I don't know how anyone can stomach an entire poutine without feeling sick afterwards) and it was topped with a ton of meat, peas, mushrooms and onions. Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's fries. It's gravy. It's cheese curds. It's delicious. It really is such a good combination and Smoke's does it well. I personally like my fries a tad crispier, but I still devoured my regular sized traditional poutine. Can't beat $5.99, either. My boyfriend just had to get the WOW size pulled pork. The pulled pork won and he couldn't finish the last bit. 

While there were 2 seats that we could have taken, it was approximately 1000 degrees in there so we took our poutine to the streets and sat on a street ledge just around the corner where it was a perfect fall temperature."}
{"text":"I love good fries, gravy and cheese, and I love poutine, but I can't stand this place. The cheese and fries are tolerable, but the gravy tastes like it came out of a can, and makes the whole thing inedible for me. I'm probably too picky about gravy. I don't like to cook, but if I ever have meat drippings of any sort, I will make gravy. The \"gravy\" at Smoke's tastes nothing like any real meat juices I've encountered. Actually, I confess, I've never bought gravy in a can, so I don't know what that tastes like. I imagine watery and cornstarch-y like Smoke's."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The last time I came, took the cake in terms of never returning. I'm surprised I have never written a review before. Any time I have been, the actual space never looks clean. Like they never tell staff (or the staff are not self-starters) to do simple wipe-ups of the counter, dust, clean throughout the day. There's always dust on the cash, dirty counter, dirt near the potato bags. 

I had gotten cold old fries before (discovered in take-out) and the last time I went as I was ordering I asked if the fries were fresh or making a new batch  - due to the past stale fries I had gotten. The guy was blatantly rude, told me the fries are always fresh, rolled his eyes and didn't bother to be nice about it or finish the order. And that was that. 

Service aside, the fries and poutine are OK (from past experience). There is much better. 

I'm more mad about the service and cleanliness of the place. I've never seen any senior management in this location or the Queen Street West location. Lack of staff management, training and protocols, and basic etiquette / manners gives this a pass for me now. I have had good customer service here before - but far too many negative experiences /observations and no to cold stale fries! (by the way, I can imagine a lot of people ask if the fries are fresh which could get tiring, but if you've had old and cold fries two times before - then there is a problem or it is done purposely to save money). The bad manners are no excuse."}
{"text":"As a poutine enthusiast, I was initially really stoked to hear that there was a poutine speciality shop - I even took the day off of work make sure that I got their as they opened on opening day. 

That being said, I was totally disappointed with what Smoke's had to offer. Fries were ok, and they used cheese curds (which is a plus, because if it aint curds it aint poutine, ya diiiiiiiiiig?!) but the gravy? ugh. 

The \"traditional\" was a hybrid of beef and chicken gravy which was totally weird and unappetizing. Then I went again thinking that maybe I got a bad batch...but alas, this time was worse. The boxed meal of my people totally smelled like baby vomit. I thought that it was just me, so I asked someone else...and they concurred. 

I have not gone back since and I'm debating giving it another shot. I feel like I owe it to them, but at the same time? sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeit."}
{"text":"Never again in life, XP !! Go to Quebec and learn how to make a decent Poutine....funny thing is, Poutinerie's is bad everywhere I've been to. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Smokes is just alright...its a little overrated in my opinion. The topping selection is very vast but im a regular poutine kind of gal and it doesnt really cut it. Every time ive been here my cheese curds have been cold. Im assuming they are frozen before put on the fries? Or maybe the gravy is not hot enough?"}
{"text":"Definitely will go back again.  I tried the pulled pork poutine which was pretty amazing.  Pulled pork was sweet, kinda like a sweet bbq taste - not a smokey or salty taste which kinda works well with the gravy and cheese curds.   Unlike another review, the curds were squeeky when you bite into them.  I had a regular size, price was about $9 + tax, which was pretty expensive, but i did enjoy it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my poutine, but at the same time, was a little disappointed - I got a traditional and while it was good, it could have been better - the gravy seemed a little flat - richer and/or peppery.  It needed a little salt too.  I suspect high expectations gave it a high bar to clear and it did... but just."}
{"text":"Smoke's is awesome for a late night option if you're hungry (I'm a poutine lover), and for cheaper poutine. But it is just not the best Toronto has to offer. The fries aren't crispy, the gravy isn't that flavourful, and the curds aren't that squeaky. Tasty late at night, but when compared to other poutineries, not the best. There is a lot better out there. Also, sometimes the establishment could just be a little cleaner for my liking."}
{"text":"Convenient location, offering lots of options for different types of poutine. But some of their items fail in providing proper flavour and many times their fries are dry, with very little gravy.

Depending on whose making the poutine the standard changes too, sometimes we had a poutine with enough cheese curds sometimes with barely any.

So all in all its a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day, it was easily the best smokes i've been to . Others i've been to in Kitchener and Niagara were good but not amazing, but this one was amazing. I consider myself to have a pretty huge appetite and was full after only a regular size. I had the chilli cheese poutine and it could possibly be the tastiest poutine ive ever had. The guy at the counter was also super friendly. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because it cost me just over $10

The tase= Awesome 
The size= Large & in charge 
Service= Great 
Cost= a little much, but good for what you got"}
{"text":"What is this thing called poutine?  Apparently invented in Quebec, it consists of cripsy french fries, cheese curds, and some brown gravy, with your choice of additional coronary-inducing toppings.  In other words, late-night hangover prevention food (see Carl's Steaks in NYC).  I know I would have loved this more if I had been wasted.  An interesting experience, but I prefer my native chili cheese fries, or better yet, a Frito pie."}
{"text":"The best poutine is found here. I especially enjoy the convenience of it being open late after getting out of the bars. Only downside I really have is the price which seem a bit steep even for a basic dish. Although the service is excellent and the food is consistent every time I go here!"}
{"text":"Visited this place today during lunchtime, from what I could make out seems to have open yesterday, or the day before. I've heard good things about Smoke's from its other Canadian locations (mostly in Toronto) and figured that as a poutine afficianado I should give the place a whirl.

DECOR:
This little shop on the corner of Bishop/Maisonneuve doesn't look like much from the outside, nestled into an old apartment building ground floor, but once you go inside the kitsch abounds. There is a plaid and sleek metal decor using some diner tropes mixed in with an abundance of what I can only guess is Smoke's mascot (glasses face guy - perhaps Smoke himself?). It's clean serviceable, and there about a dozen tables to enjoy your food at. Though given the menu this will easily become a take-out type place.

MENU: 
There are over 20 varieties available for your eating pleasure, all poutine, all the time. The only non-gravy offerings are plain fries or sodas. The print/website menu is fabulously constructed, breaking down poutine variations by category (traditional, pork, italian, beef, vegetarian) however there exists no logical hierarchy for the in-store display, leaving all newbile customers scouring the tableau for a poutine that might suit there tastes. Thankfully I came prepared and ordered a large (~500g) Double Pork Poutine (chipotle pulled pork, double-smoked bacon & peppercorn gravy) -.9.99$ Unfortunately, they had run out of peppercorn gravy (I know it's non-traditional gravy, but I figured I'd give a whirl), so my selection was upgraded to the Triple Pork (chipotle pulled pork, double-smoked bacon, Italian sausage & traditional gravy) without charge. 

In order to quench the thirst that this salt-bomb would most certainly bring on, I opted for one of their \"Pop Shoppe\" sodas on offer - specifically the root beer. These fancier pop offerings come at a premium though versus their corporate canned contemporaries and thus I paid the 2.50$ for the upgraded soft drink.

PRICE:
My total bill with tax came out to 14.07$ for my large Triple Pork poutine and Pop Shoppe Root Beer. Definitely steep for a fast food fling, but the does food measure up?

SERVICE:
Although the cashier and cook were polite and quick to respond to the lack of peppercorn gravy, you can tell these guys are still pretty wet behind the ears as it took my compatriot and I about 10 minutes from walking to sitting down with our food (with only 1 person ahead of us). Hopefully as business picks up at this place, they'll get their processes down pat and be able to churn out the potato-gravy-cheesey goodness with haste, they simply cannot afford not to IMO.

FOOD: 
The packaging is certainly an interesting take, with the poutine served in a flat version of an Asian takeout box, atypical of poutine take-out which usually comes in a styrofoam or aluminium container. I must applaud this packaging decision as it most certainly promotes the best doggy bag strategies and should essentially impart no off-tastes to the contents. My poutine was presented quite appealingly with crispy bacon, bits of actual sausage and pulled pork on display at the top of my stack of fries, and again here nothing to fault. The taste test of the individual toppings yielded favorable results with the bacon offering a satisfying crunch, the sausage being very meaty and the pulled pork having a good enough twang to not overpower to poutine itself. Unfortunately it becomes a bit of a disappointment at the base. The fries on their own are pretty bland, the traditional gravy a little watery and tasteless (just salty, no beefy undertones or special blends of spices to be detected) and the cheese breaks the cardinal rule of the ultimate poutine - it melts. 

Now this last bit is really more of a personal preference, but I just can't take any poutine with cheese that's just melted into a string mess seriously. I've been fortunate enough to enjoy poutine all over the province, and there some great cheese factories that produce some the best cheese curds that don't fall apart when surrounded by hot gravy and fries, they preserve the squeakiness and marvelous structure that is Quebec cheese curds.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
If you are hankering for some poutine with a vast assortment of varieties with great toppings, then Smoke's is worth checking out. It's definitely going to be pretty big with the late-night downtown crowd, provided they can get the word out since they are off the Ste-Catherine strip. However you should go in expecting a rather bland base poutine complemented by great toppings. I do look forward to trying this place out again in a few months to see if they've stepped their game a bit, where hopefully some of the short-falls are mostly due to its recent opening. Is it better than Banquise, I'd say about the same. If you really want some unsung poutine hero, try Depanneur Nouveau Forum at Crescent/Ste-Catherine (yes a dep...) that one is a tough contender.

{"text":"I got the WOW-size regular poutine and shared with someone else. 
It's good, but the cheese curds are like pieces of rubber. I expected the cheese curds to be melty and soft....But then again, I had poutine at a poutine-specialty place in Montreal, and their curds were also like that....I hear that good cheese curds are actually supposed to taste like that. 
The location isn't great, nowhere to sit to eat, and the only place to pout your box of poutine down is the inward-facing ledge by the window, which faces a metal dumpster bin. Why...Why...why is there a dumpster bin in plain view of where I must put down my food. Even if you do takeout, it's not like there's a park or anything nearby to sit down and eat your food. Neighbourhood is pretty ghetto-y as well. 
Poutine wasn't bad, but it was mostly bad location and the dumpster bin that turned me off. I would go to another location if I was really craving poutine, because of the non-food factors that I've mentioned."}
{"text":"If I could give 5-star ratings for theory and concept I would. I mean the ingredients are these: fries, cheese and gravy. You know what that doesn't have room for? Other stuff! In fact, some might argue the cheese and gravy aren't needed.... not me, but some.

Being a sucker for bacon I had the Bacon Poutine which I should've known what I was getting into adding salt to salt. It did not go so well. Even when trying just the straight fries/cheese/gravy blend sans pig, I can honestly say I've had better. Most poutine make me feel sick after an hour or 2, this one went straight to work.

What pushes this review from 2-stars to 3 is the location, the decor and servers.

Location - as yelp reviewer Kat F. pointed out, poutine is the perfect thing to soak up bar night belly so it's a perfect late night stop after stumbling about the Entertainment District thinking you look hot.

Decor - they give out stickers and the place looks like an afterschool hangout with a masco that looks too similar to Napoleon Dynamite.

Servers - the guy giggled when he told me my order number: 69"}

{"text":"It was absolutely delicious! I had the pulled pork poutine. it was perfectly flavoured but could do with a bit more meat on it.  The gravy was very flavourful.  It was a huge portion without having to wow-size it."}
{"text":"As a self-nominated fries connoisseur, I don't think the fries at Smoke's can compare with the Frite Alors fries back in Montreal. But for what it's worth, the poutine's great.

This place has been such a great pick-me-up during one of those I-don't-care-if-I'm-fat-I-need-my-fries-now days. My friend and I particularly enjoyed their chalkboard there, while waiting for our poutines, we entertained ourselves by leaving random messages on it. It's a great way to connect with the community!

My friend's a purist, so she ordered the normal poutine, which is still delicious. The cheesecurds are always fresh, and the gravy, wow, to die for. I was being adventurous on that day, so I got the Italian one. It had sausages and ground beef in it, which is meat-lover heaven. Of course, everything's nice and dandy during the moment, afterwards is a whole different story (food baby alert!)

One thing to say though, unless you're really hungry when you come to Smoke's, two people can share one. They've got generous portions, and their boxes (yes they put their poutine in take out boxes) seem to be bottomless."}

I was walking along queen street in the early winter, around November. I heard about this place for a while, but never really get to try...

I don't think I have to say much, this is definitely very filling and a very bad diet, but it is worth the try and binge out once in a while. The cheese isn't as chewy as the one you can get from Quebec, but it is a good substitute when you are no where close to Quebec and you are craving for one in Toronto, right?"}
{"text":"I don't know much about poutine, but after eating here I was full and satisfied my poutine craving. They have lots of different kinds. I was a little overwhelmed."}
{"text":"We were heading to get pizza at Inna Gadda di Pizza and came across Smoke's Poutinerie. I am a sucker for poutine so we got an order to go with our pizza. The staff was very friendly and explained their sizes and toppings. We went with the traditional. It was yummy. There was a good ratio of cheese and gravy to fries. The cheese could have been a bit squeakier, but the gravy and fries were really good. I would stop by again on one of our next trips to Vegas. The stickers are cute :)"}
{"text":"I'm glad I ran into this place by accident. This is one of the only places that clearly state that they have a vegetarian option for the gravy. I found the gravy, and cheese flavorful. The fries were good too. On my first day I had the veggie deluxe w/ caramelized onions, peas, and mushrooms, and the next day a regular veggie. I was really happy, and surprised with the  non-rubberized cheese curds they use. I don't get why people want cheese curds so rubbery that they can bounce right off the floor, that squeaky feeling doesn't do it for me. And people that like the rubbery feel is because they probably grew up eating it like that and not because they actually love it. I really hope they don't replace to cheese with that rubbery madness some people want. I'm glad I left Montreal already because I could have their poutine every single day. The guy behind the counter was really cordial, and even allowed me to bring my road bike in. I hope this place does well, and if I had the money I would open a franchise in Florida right away. Whoever came up with their \"mascot\" concept was a genius, very iconic face. So yes, check out the place. Flavorful, vegetarian friendly, and best of all non-rubberized/non-squeaky cheese."}
{"text":"Good variety of toppings for your poutine - vegetarian options too! Staff was friendly, and service was quick. Forget the calories and dive in!"}
{"text":"Deceptively small. I was disappointed with the size of my poutine -- until I ate it and realized it was more than enough. My physician will thank me. If you were wondering, yes, this is the small size we're talking about. 

Looking forward to exploring all the choices. We're not in Québec so this will have to do."}
{"text":"Talking about Smoke's in a Montreal context is weird.

Everywhere else in Canada, Smoke's is more or less the only game in town when it comes to poutine. What they mostly offer is a kind of stunt poutine that you can also find in the wilder sections of La Banquise's menu, but in massive, 'roided-out form. Theirs are nothing like the poutines you get at chipstands and most other greasy spoons in Quebec, which are a lot more minimalistic in their construction; fries, cheese curds, gravy, period. Almost every item on Smoke's menu will challenge your stomach to an epic wrestling match with the sheer volume of stuff they put in it.

Obviously, there's trad poutine on the menu, but there are literally hundreds of other places you can get decent-to-transcendent trad poutine in the city. Smoke's is not one of them. However, if you're in the mood for some laugh-in-the-face-of-death hot-rodded stunt poutine, go nuts. Their triple pork poutine is artery-clogging goodness at it's finest.

So get a tenner and laugh in the face of God for a spell while an awesome soundtrack of 80s detritus plays on the PA. Good times."}
{"text":"The traditional regular-size poutine ($6.95) is really large enough for three people. While it has good squeaky, salty cheese curds, the herbs (rosemary or thyme?) in the gravy overwhelm like one of those pine-scented car deodorizers in a sweaty taxi cab. The fries could be fresher and the entire concoction ought to be hotter to melt the curds.

Beware the beer-goggles effect when coming here:
3 stars, A-OK; when you're soused.
2 stars, Meh. I've had better; the morning after.

No seating area except for the bench outside. Open till 4 a.m.  on weekends to cater to the drunk munchies-seekers. I'm still wondering what the story was behind the two young men who arrived in their cotton briefs."}
{"text":"This place is epic. Never thought they can make a poutine as a meal. 
Great place to visit if your high and have the munchies. You eat, feel good about life and forget how ur abs use used to look like.."}
{"text":"Came in to order poutine and was asking the Asian dude at the counter for their menu and he was a little rude for my liking so I walked out.  For that I give this store 1 star for lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Not a good locations. Service sucks and the food was not good

Staff is really not a good one and they don't really care about customers

Also products were not prepared... Don't go there"}
{"text":"Had the curry poutine. Sauce and fries were spectacular, but the dish wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese curds adequately :( Definitely overpriced, but worth the try."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, their poutine used to be really good but it's gotten worse every-time I've had it. Most recently I had one n the gravy was literally soy sauce, well looked and tasted like it.  Won't see me back here....overrated"}
{"text":"I love a good poutine. I visit Smoke's almost every 2 weeks. Most of the time, I get exactly what I ask for and I can't be happier.

But the last two times, I have been getting wrong order and old fries. First time, I asked for a Veggie Deluxe poutine but they ended up giving me the Veggie Nacho poutine. It was still good but I was craving for peas and onions... I got neither.

Second time, I ask for a Veggie Deluxe again but with an order for meat (sausages) on the poutine. When I got home, not only it was just a regular poutine with sausages, the fries was also old fries (I should have recognized it when the order was given to me 30 seconds after I ordered). Once again, there is no peas to be found in my poutine. 

Will I keep on coming? In the foreseeable future, yes. But if this keeps on happening to my order, I may take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"So unhealthy but so good. 
Heard about this place from a coworker and thought I'd give it a try. 
I really liked how they made it fresh. I just got the traditional poutine, and it was wonderful.
Just a little to drown in gravy, but its all good.
Would recommend to anyone who likes a good poutine"}
{"text":"I didn't like the fries, I didn't like the gravy, and I didn't like the cheese. Most people will approve of the cheese I suppose, as it is curds, and for some reason most people think it's sacrilegious to use anything else, which in my mind is stupid. Shredded mozzarella tastes better and can be more evenly distributed across your poutine allowing cheese with every bite. Think about it, while you're not eating smokes crappy poutine."}
{"text":"They have a big variety of different Poutine styles such as the old style traditional poutine, Vegetarian, philly cheese steak, bacon and many many more. I really enjoy the poutine that they serve here. Sure I mentioned a lot of meat, but for the vegetarians out there, they have variety's of vegetarian poutine.

The only problem I have with this location is that; I have heard from a few people saying that this Smokes Poutinerie does not give you as much toppings as they would at many other places. 

So I do recommend Smoke's just perhaps a different one.

Overall, 4 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional poutine. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't get it again. The gravy was very thin and watery and tasted more like sweet and sour sauce than gravy. There was a generous amount of cheese curds and the fries were good, but the poutine wasnt very hot either. The service was very good and the restaurant looked clean."}
{"text":"Great poutine! Had the hog town it was amazing and service was great! Not sure what other people Are expecting though as far as toppings it was loaded and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I arrived in Toronto on Good Friday to my favorite restaurants closed & Smoke's was the 1st place I found open. I really enjoyed the mushrooms & peas variety & would recommend this place to any American who isn't finicky about how poutin is prepared.
I'm sure there are better places but, Smoke's was open & overall a good experience,.
I'll be back."}
{"text":"If your looking to grab a quick bite of poutine, Smokes is they way to go. 

One thing i love about the place is the \"culture\" that they've created around the franchise. They're always playing 80's rock, and the lumberjack colours suit the place perfectly. It's also a great late night joint. The place is booming late at night, and many of my stoner friends will tell you it's the best place to satisfy the munchies! They sometimes also have fun little stickers which you can place in creative ways around town!

While it's definitely my go to place for poutine, it's not the greatest poutine i've ever had. My only real concern is the fries. They just don't measure up to many other fries i've tried over the city. Even the fries from some mediocre restaurants i've tried are better. Smokes saving grace is in it's gravy and cheese curds, but especially the toppings. While the gravy and cheese curds are great, the toppings take it to the next level. My favourite is the double pork, which comes with double smoked bacon and pulled port. The smokiness of the bacon with the super tender and sweet pork is a perfect balance. On the odd occasion, i'll sometimes get caramelized onions in there to, which is heaven.

I would give it 5 stars, but the fries just aren't as good compared to everything else. Still, if you haven't tried poutine, or you're just unsure whether or not the poutine at smokes will be as good as the stuff in Quebec, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"The bacon poutine is a must have. I would suggest large so there is some for breakfast the next morning. Perfect drunk food and morning after food"}
{"text":"I looove poutine! 
Actually I dont think I've ever tasted bad poutine. Is there even such a thing? Please tell me no. Poutine here is goood though!

Just not a big fan of the location. Place looks kinda shabby, not that nice staff, and barely any people. Oh and people laughing and pointing at you for taking pictures (something I noticed a lot in Toronto.. ) So? 
I'd prefer the Queens st. loc."}
{"text":"After arriving in Toronto late and craving poutine, I turned to Yelp to help me out.  This downtown location was nearby and open.  Perfect.

First of all, the service was great.  The guy running the register was very accommodating since our debit card wasn't working and helped us figure out a solution.  The food was cooked quickly and looked great.  Since we were taking it back to the hotel, the guy even boxed it up for us.

Okay, the bad.  Short list: despite Yelp saying Smoke's takes credit cards, the machine was down.  Hence our payment issue.  No biggie though.

The good.  I liked my pulled pork poutine and my dining companion also liked her veggie nacho grande.  Very, very tasty but also exactly what I was expecting so hence the 3/5.  And despite my ravenous hunger, even I couldn't finish off a large.  So please heed the reviews and get a REGULAR."}
{"text":"A very poor experience with a mouthy worker, a friend wrote to corporate expressing their concerns - outright ignored. The apple does not fall far from the tree."}
{"text":"I realize this is supposed to be a late night spot, but we could not resist tacking on a trip to Smoke's as part of our three spot lunch.  Smoke's does a fantastic job of serving up many types of poutine.  In retrospect, I wish we didn't order the Classic.  Having said that though, the Classic was great.  They chop up the curds so they're melted and stretchy.  The coverage of gravy was nice without making the fries soggy.  I was happy with this version."}
{"text":"Ok. I do not understand the fuss. And they hosted the Poutine Championship? Argh. I give kudos to the dude that could stomach all of this mess. I thought the fries were too soggy (no crispiness at all), the gravy too salty (especially the beef one), and the curds did not squeak. Fail on all 3 counts.

As for service, they were friendly enough but the food was not prepared from scratch. I think they have buckets of ingredients that they just dumped together into a cardboard box. I would much prefer another double fry of the fries or something.

P/S: We ordered the Country Chicken (better of the two by a small margin) and the Prime Beef.

At least I did not have food poisoning. B/c of that, I give you 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've read about Smoke's Poutinerie in several newspapers when they first came Toronto and been meaning to drop in and check out their poutine.

They offer everything from regular poutine to poutine with different toppings like Bacon. Chicken, Veggie etc.

Went here for Dinner and had the Bacon Poutine. Wow was it ever delicious. One thing I'll tell you right off the bat is that they are very generous in the amount of bacon added to the poutine. There was more bacon on it then I usually get when I go out for breakfast!!

Bacon wasn't overcooked, lots of gravy, lots of cheese. Mouth is watering just thinking about it.

One tip I'll give is that they have two sizes, a regular and a large. Unless your extremely hungry stick to the regular size. With all of the topping and the poutine itself you'll find the regular size more then enough.

There are a few tables and bar style seating but depending on time of the day or how many people are in your group you may need to take your order to go.

Positives
- More then generous on the toppings
- Lots of Gravy, Lots of Cheese
- A good selection of Poutines to choose from

Negatives
- This is not a wheelchair friendly location.

Neutrals
- Seating may or may not be available"}
{"text":"Oh, Canada. I'm an American, but I've seen the light and life is better in the north. For starters, there's poutine. Us Americans have been trying to mimic poutine for some years now. There's even a place in San Francisco making vegan poutine with shiitake gravy and Parmesan topping. No, thank you. And there's even a Smoke's in Berkeley now. 

But nothing compares the the first Smoke's I ever visited: the one on Adelaide in Toronto. The  classic poutine is one of the best things I've ever tasted. The fries aren't too crispy or greasy, the gravy is plentiful, and the cheese curds squeak just so. Service is friendly and there's even ample seating at this Smoke's. The bacon cheeseburger poutine is a treat too, albeit a very greasy one. The Montreal smoked meat poutine would be terrific if it were not for the saltiness. 

I only wish that the Smoke's in Berkeley had quality control down as well as this one does. It's okay, though. All the more reason to visit Canada."}
{"text":"Die Kanadier lieben ihre franko-kanadische Erfindung: Pommes mit Bratensauce und Käse.  Bei Smoke's Poutinerie kann man ca. 20 Varianten des Klassikers ausprobieren. Wir hatten einmal die Nacho Veg. Also die klassische Poutine aber mit vegetarischer Soße und Salsa, Guacamole, jalapeños und creme fraiche. Herrlich.  Beim zweiten mal hatten wir die Chili Cheese Poutine: chili con carne und cheddarsoße. War ganz ok. Das Chili war etwas fad. Aber sonst ganz ordentlich.  Zu empfehlen ist die Montreal Poutine bei Smoke's: klassische Poutine mit geräucherten Rindfleischsteakscheiben und einer Essiggurke. Freunde von uns hatten Phillysteak variante und waren auch sehr zufrieden. Smoke's hat als kleiner Laden für die Partyganger in Toronto angefangen und soviel Popularität erlangt, dass sie sich in der Stadt zu einer Kette ausweiten. Auf jeden Fall mehrere Besuche wert. Und für sowohl Fleischliebhaber und Vegetarier geignet."}
{"text":"After living in Ottawa for a year, I became addicted to poutine and since Toronto lacks in representing French Canada, it was hard to get my fix. 

This isn't your everyday poutine. This is your let's push the envelope of poutine cuisine. Where else can you find poutine that is topped with pulled pork, or philly cheese steak? No where, and that's what make this place awesome. 

All of their locations are close to bars and they are open until 4 am on Saturdays. And let's face it, there is nothing better than getting fries, gravy, and cheese after you spent the night partying hard.

My only criticism is that their cheese curds aren't always squeaky. And everyone knows for it to be the best poutine the cheese curds have to be squeaky.

After spending the night getting stinko and you want something that isn't McD, go here if you can."}
{"text":"I had to write this review while it's still fresh on my mind. I just got back from Smoke's Poutinerie before i headed home. Wow...what a disappointment..in fact really..this is the sh*tiest poutine I've ever had. Pardon my french.

I've had their poutine before but with stuff on top like the Hogtown and etc. So I never really had a traditional poutine here. But this time i decided to do the traditional and found the fries to be cold, the cheese curds next to frozen, and the gravy to be like gelatin (ie. packaged gravy). They portray bags of fresh potatoes in the shop but honestly the fries are frozen before fried and you can taste it. The gravy is just absolutely disgusting. I guess when 90% of your guests are drunk when they order they can't tell the difference. It actually takes a lot of work to ruin a simple yet delicious dish but Smoke's manged to do it. Scary thing is they started to set up shops around the downtown core and even have a food truck, I would hate for visitors to think that's the best poutine T.O. has to offer."}
{"text":"Qualité, et quantité sont au rendez vous rue Bishop! La montée met en appétit, la descente est facilitée par l'impressionnante quantité qu'ils font rentrer dans leur boîtes!

C'est con mais devant un tel choix, je n'ai même pas testé la classique! Mention spéciale pour la sauce au poivre et la recette avec les poivrons (pas radins dessus!)"}
{"text":"They make some tasty damn poutine. Plenty of different types, but the original is still the best. Can't think of anywhere else I'd go in the downtown for my fix."}
{"text":"Came here at 9pm and there was only one worker...and he was running back and forth from the back kitchen to the front to take more orders. For three orders, it took him approximately 15 minutes to make, which was not that bad considering he was running around solo. (Later that night, his coworker returned....). I ordered a bacon poutine and it was tasty, not the best poutine, but descent. There's limited number of seating and the place is relatively tiny. My bacon poutine wasn't a die for and it's not good to the point that I crave for it. Overall, I'm not too impressed with this restaurant, but I know I will return...and likely, this place is a chain around Toronto. 

I will do an update review the next time I end up here late at night!"}
{"text":"I like that this is poutine o'clock. A tribute to cheese, gravy and fries, but here's the thing. It's all about the gravy, and for me, Smoke's gravy could be better. Sheer gluttony. Not so good for lunch, but i'd imagine great after a night out."}
{"text":"This place gets a sober 2 stars...and a drunk 3 stars.  I say this because after a solid night of dancing and drinking I'm starving and a greasy cheesey poutine is always a good idea. But in reality the poutines here are not that great.  Sure there are curds, but even after paying for extra curds, it hardly looks like extra curds (I was so skeptical I had to ask the girl there whether there were in fact, extra curds).  The fries are a bit on the soggy/undercooked side.  The gravy is plentiful though, which is an obvious plus.  Not the best poutine I've ever had, but I continue to buy poutines here as the locations are conveniently located to bars and open late!"}
{"text":"Out of all the locations I've been to for Smoke's, this is probably the best one I've been to. The decor for the place is fun and there is actually places to seat. Plus reading some of the chalk drawings on the blackboard provides some entertainment while eating there.

My friends and I came here for lunch one day where we shared a large Triple Pork. The pulled pork melts in your mouth and is sweet and tangy. The bacon was crispy and the sausage was to die for. My friends and I wanted to just buy the meat and not the fries!

The only complaint I have is that the fries are never hot enough when you eat it. But overall, this is a great place to eat poutine (although I wouldn't recommend it on a daily basis)."}
{"text":"More than generous portions, but I think it's hit or miss at each location. I tried the one at 218 Adelaide recently, while starving and in a rush; I ended up with cold, congealed slop, which of course left most of the cheese curds un-melted (a SIN!). 

This was around 6PM, so it can't be blamed on late night dregs, however, I imagine this location doesn't a lot of foot traffic in the evenings.

Still, I doubt I'll be heading back to a Smoke's anytime soon again."}
{"text":"Generous portion sizes, good veggie options and have never had to wait in line yet."}
{"text":"The \"veggie\" poutine was so rich and flavorful that I'm left wondering if it was just vegetable flavored meat gravy.  I normally wouldn't condone the use of poutine as a meal, but Smoke's is a must for occasional indulgence in high calorie comfort food."}
{"text":"Poutine competition is more fierce than ever and I don't think they are aware that average won't cut it in Montreal... Oh that's right... This chain's founder is from BC- so wouldn't know about that. Went twice. Friendly staff, good use of the compact location but average poutine. The more toppings you get the scarier it becomes. When was that pulled pork made? How much filler is in that wannabe Italian sausage? I guess just avoid the disgusting sausage and you'll be okay for this place. Just Plain bacon is your safest bet. Otherwise the poutine alone isn't worth going out of ur way."}
{"text":"Poutine I got was shit, I ordered a large, it had a small amount of sauce on the top but every fry underneath was dry as a bone."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and I can tell ya that the poutines here are 10X better when you're tanked after a long night.  Came here sober and thought to myself \"what the heck did I order last time, cuz i was in poutine heaven then...\".  

It's nice and quiet during the 8-10pm period but the place gets crazy after 1am.  I think my favorite was the pulled pork poutine.  Get the small for yourself or large if you plan to share; large is huuuuuuuuge, probably 3000+ calories but who cares!  

Just remember not to park outside after midnight or you will get towed.  Ask me how I know...

Good luck and eat safe!"}
{"text":"I remember the day I heard about this mythical \"all poutine\" joint that would be opening up on Adelaide, and how my long-stifled gravy urges made a bargain with my junk food conscience. Their menu was so unique - beyond the usual curds & grayveh, poutine with curry chicken?! With pulled pork?! - I knew I had to give this ship a test drive.

So there I was on opening day, standing in line in the cold, waiting for some fries to warm my belly. I ordered the poutine with chicken and peas (what?! I like peas!!) and here's the verdict: the fries are perfect - spiced just the right amount and crispy enough to maintain a crunch even under a pile 'o gravy. The cheese curds are worthy of picking off your leftovers even when you're too full to finish, but the gravy wasn't hot enough to melt them (boo!). I thought this might have been first day jitters, but on my second visit it was the same deal.

But here's the thing: Smoke's is open pretty late, so when you're a little tipsy and Lady Grease is calling your name, this is where the place really shines. I'm actually kind of wishing I was half drunk right now, so I could hit up Smoke's guilt free (when it comes to food, what happens at 3am stays at 3am). Who needs perfection after the party when you've got something warm, salty and oooooozy?! You know?

PS: The portion is gigantic, so if you're only a little hungry or have a small appetite, you should split with a homie. All the fancy topping versions are cool, but at the end of the day, I recommend going for the traditional - and BONUS - there are vegetarian versions including a vegetable gravy. Nice!"}
{"text":"So we're staying at the Hilton right next door to Smoke's... My friends and i just pulled in from driving from the states and we were starving so I did a quick yelp search and figured we would try it out. We headed on over and I ordered the \"hogtown\" at the meal size (medium). 
Man! The poutine was delicious, gravy, sausage, bacon, cheese & shrooms (mushrooms) blended together nicely with the fries. We brought some ketchup packets back but didn't even use them. Definitely heading there later tonight ."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, excellent portion size. The chipotle pulled pork poutine was to die for. Best poutine in Calgary by far"}
{"text":"Huge portions!! Absolutely filling. But you do need to realise after your 200th bite, you're still eating the same thing. It's best to share various flavours with friends to enlighten your tastebuds throughout your meal."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. 

Was with a friend studying at RU when we decided to hit up Smoke's. There was only 1 person working mid day and she didn't even come to serve us until we stood there for 5 minutes. It was like we were a bother to her and when we asked for the washroom key she slammed it on the counter. 

On a side note the washroom was disgusting and because of limited seating, we got our food to go. 

This store needs better staff."}
{"text":"its a true blasphemy to straight up disrespect this joint, whenever I'm hungry after the bar, this place is real good...never tried it sober but bet its sick

Update: went back today for lunch, the bacon poutine..awesome"}
{"text":"My first experience at any Smokes poutine..unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Although this location wasn't tasty for me, I hope other locations will be a better experience for me."}
{"text":"First of all, I am not a routine aficionado, but that being said, I dont think you really have to be to appreciate the simplicity of a dish which combines the greatness of French fries, cheese and gravy.  Smokes adds all kinds of weird additions to the simple recipe.  The outcome, in my opinion, is not noteworthy, barely edible.  I would have rather eaten my poutine at Harvey's over this.  And the people working here looked unhygienic.  Its not the hipster queen street look they got going, its the prisoner cafeteria.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"One of my worst experiences ever. Not only the poutine and the ham I got was not even eatable, there was a hair in the food and they even didnt get surprized. It was like its normal to them."}
{"text":"Whoever thought of putting chicken, bacon, onions, mushrooms and gravy on french fries is a freakin' genius!"}
{"text":"Great idea for a shop and the service is okay considering the volume of people that go through there on a Friday night. Way overrated in my opinion!  I would say that for what you get it isn't really worth it.

Very expensive and the food that I tasted was mediocre at best. Eleven bucks for fries with a couple toppings and a drink is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I can appreciate their attempt at creativity, but having lived in Québec for a big chunk of my life, this place just cannot compare to the real stuff. It's all about the squeeky/squishy texture of the cheese, good gravy and fries that stay crunchy even when it's swimming in gravy."}
{"text":"Some people love Poutine.

Some folk (that are obviously weird) hate Poutine!

If you're a member of the former and haven't been to Smoke's yet then you've obviously been living in a poutine-less pit for the past few years. Smoke's has the largest menu with what seems like 100s of different varieties. I had the Pulled Pork one and will definitely be going back.

The place is pumping when it reaches the end of a night out and who knows...you may even be able to hook up whilst tucking into those lovely cheese curds. Don't whatever you do think you'll be able to cosy up to your new found love (yes, I'm talking about the Poutine) in the seating area - the size won't allow it.

In summary...this is Toronto's best poutine."}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal accompanied by amazing service from Mike. I'm going to tell all my friends to come here. This is THE place!"}
{"text":"Service can be slow during lunch hour as sometimes there is only one person working. It's a nice looking place that's well designed for that \"fun, late night food\" feeling but I've unfortunately always left Smoke's disappointed. On their menu the list of toppings and combinations they have sound really good, but no matter how many of them I've tried they've always tasted bland. Case and point, recently got a poutine that had \"prime rib beef\" but it was all grey coloured, overcooked ground beef. I don't see any reason you would waste prime rib meat by cooking it that way. Their fries are so/so, never quite crispy enough on the outside, or soft enough on the inside, their curds and sauce lack a lot of taste. I also find their to-go boxes make sure all the gravy drowns out the fries at the bottom so they get really soggy, fast. At this point I think I'm done going back to this place and would encourage anyone who loves poutine to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The building occupies a chunk of real estate and for the longest time I thought this was the flagship restaurant.  I was so wrong, cause the actual shop space is miniscule. You got an edge counter for 5 and no stools to sit?!    what's all that space for? potatoes?

Anyways, I ordered reg sized veggie deluxe poutine. It came dressed with caramelized onions, mushrooms, peas, cheese curds and smothered in veggie gravy.. I liked it,  pretty good tasting combination and not overkill in the salt department."}
{"text":"This place is not one of my favs. 

Mainly for it's low grade of poutine and secondly the obnoxious clientele who frequent here.

This location serve a terrible poutine. Soggy half cooked fries and artificial flavoured gravy. If you don't ask to be light on the gravy you'll have a french fry stew. They are fast at taking your money though. 

Because it's located near the club district, they get a steady stream of drunk people trying to soak up the alcohol in their system. 

Last Fri night, friends ordered their poutines and I went to hunt for a table for us to sit at. I saw one girl passed out on a table, hands outstretched with her friends huddled around for support and just turning my head I saw another girl at the bar stools by the window with her friends huddled holding a paper takeout bag for her to puke into. So ghey go outside and save the disgust and smell for customers who just want to eat in peace. She did end up puking on the floor. And the next guy who sat at the bar stool when they left didn't even notice the mess on the floor underneath him."}
{"text":"The poutine originates from Quebec and is a simple dish consisting of three ingredients:  fries, cheese curds and brown gravy. 

This dish has grown in popularity over the years and one can find it offered at many restaurants including the big fast food chains. Smoke's is a stand-alone business franchise based on this very famous Canadian dish.

Since it's rather simple, it's critical to get every ingredient right. For me unfortunately I find their gravy a bit too salty,  a little bit too thick and uninspiring tastes like it's all artificial flavoring.

Fries were okay when fresh -- they were cut and had skin but they didn't taste that crisp. Cheese curds were fine though I have found no difference to any other cheese curd I've had before.

Smoke differs by offering a variety of types. Pulled pork is quite popular same with Montreal smoked meat.. when I passed by today they had  special Thanksgiving Poutine with Roasted Turkey Stuffing, Baby Green Peas and Cranberry Sauce. Not my thing but gotta say that's clever and original. :)

One comment on this Bloor St location the interior lights are hella bright!   Please dim them. It makes me not want to eat here cause I feel like I'm under a human french fry lamp!"}
{"text":"I tried this. Good location, but Overrated. Tastes like cardboard. Come on, man. Make it better.."}
{"text":"* Watch out for cashier \"accidentally\" ordering a more expensive poutine for you. 
* Not fast. My single veggie deluxe poutine took 17mins. Only 2 orders ahead of me and yes they seem to have waited equally long. 
* Low on gravy.lower than any other I've had and I've had many (various chipwagon's, McDonald's, restaurants etc.). I asked for a bit more gravy... They said that be $.75 on top of this $8.64 poutine!  Thats sad and greedy. 

I've had better experiences when it first opened but this time years later not so good. 
Maybe it's the different employees hopefully and not because of corporate policies...??

Anyway, not going back there anytime soon. To the chipwagon!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for poutine, who would have thought of all these toppings to go on top of fries? Delicious yes, healthy no, who cares? Exactly. Definitely would recommend this place for those venturing into the world that is poutine!"}
{"text":"It's a good poutine, the sauce is well made and the cheese squeaks. Italian poutine has a good meat sauce. Problem is, when you're done with all the surrounding goodness your stuck with average fries. In a lot of places in Quebec they use a softer kind of fries, which works great with poutine. The fries they have are too crispy which leaves a oily feel at the end."}
{"text":"Not as amazing as I thought. This place is super hyped but I just found my poutine so-so. I got the Veggie deluxe but want to try the nacho one next. The staff was friendly and the place looked clean."}
{"text":"Yeah, so this was so bad for you but I absolutely loved the gooeyness of the cheesecurds! My friends and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger poutine, but I think in the end I would've preferred the traditional one!

It's definitely a man's lunch - I mean, we didn't see another friendly female face at the joint during our time there (we = 4 ladies), not counting the ones who worked there.

I love gravy. I love fries. I love gravy on my fries! Cheese is cool! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"This location is definitely a small one (compared to the other locations), with only one long table top and perhaps 6 stools, but when one has a craving for poutine when most kitchens are closed for the night, this is not a bad choice. It's  definitely  a come and take out or eat very quickly  establishment.

Sure there are many other better poutine places, but being in my neighbourhood, this location is definitely a convenient one and the poutine isn't too bad.  Poutine that isn't too salty, has lots of cheese curds, flavourful gravy, plus crispy fries, what is there not to like?

They offer a variety of poutine in different sizes, but the traditional poutine in regular size just hits the spot when poutine craving hits the growling stomach."}
{"text":"They make a lot of creative poutines and it's pretty good. That's it. 

If you want anything else, like comfy seats, pleasing visuals, or weather-appropriate air conditioning settings- go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm a big poutine fan and I'm glad I finally tried this place out. The location is convenient for when I'm down on Queen St. West but it's very small - with seating for maybe 10 people. 

The day I went there was only 1 employee who would take a couple of orders, then run back the kitchen and make your poutines for you - so service was a bit slow. 

The poutines come in 2 sizes - small and regular. The small is plenty for a very hungry person, or 2 people to snack on. The large is just huge and I made the mistake of ordering this once and won't ever do that again! My favourite is the Country Style with chicken, crispy bacon, onion and mushrooms. 

This place is open really late a night so it makes a good spot to grab a bite after hitting the clubs or bars. The washrooms at this location are downstairs so it's not handicap accessible."}
{"text":"First of all in depends on the location and people cooking...
Went to Dundas west place twice, maybe i was hungry or somthn, but i loved it! 3 times after that they burned the fries beyond recognition, and its impossible to see the fries under all the cheese and stuff on top...After the first burned batch i tried to dig in to make sure fries weren't burned like last time, but they threw few fresh ones on top to make it look better, it was still burned on the bottom...
Will try another location..."}
{"text":"Gross. Tastes like mold. They don't clean their restaurant or replenish anything. Tables were dirty and no napkins. We were the only ones in there too."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced considering it is french fries. 
Good and Fast Service.
Wasn't so impressed - thought a bit bland.
Impressed by wide variety of types of poutine.
Not worth the money."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Smoke's location. Anywhere. Ever.

I went a few weeks after it opened. I was stoked, since I hit up Smoke's once a week and this one is closest to my house.

It has a large amount of seating compared to other locations in the city. Dundas and Jarvis offers no seats at all. Annex has a few stools. So if that's what you're after, head on in.

Having been a regular Smoke's customer for the past year and a half, I expected much more from this location. The staff could barely work the register. They were not knowledgeable about the menu whatsoever. OK, so it's a new location. I get it. But how hard is it to work a register and learn a menu? I've done it in one, maybe two, days multiple times.

There were two people who ordered before I got there. After I ordered, I waited twenty minutes and the people ahead of me got theirs about a minute before I did. Why, I'll never know. The guys at the Annex have far better turnaround time on a Friday at 2 a.m. when the place is rammed than these schmucks did on an idle Sunday night. I understand the fries need to be cooked, but come on. I could've gotten an entree at a sit-down restaurant in twenty minutes.

Best of all: If you know and love Smoke's, STAY FAR AWAY. They made my poutine WRONG. How is that even possible? Well, I didn't think it was until I visited this location. The standard Smoke's equation is fries, gravy, toppings. 75% of my container was fries. 20% was gravy. Only 5% was toppings. I ordered Country Style (chicken, peas, onions, mushrooms). All I could taste was gravy. It was literally drowning in it and the container was soggy at the bottom. They put the gravy ON TOP of the scant toppings, which made it worse. It was so disgusting that despite not eating anything all day, I couldn't eat it. If I wanted a sea of gravy, I'd make my own at home and drink it out of a cup. 

The Smoke's at the Annex loads their dishes up with toppings, so much so that you can barely close the container. I go out of my way to go there because I will NEVER return to this hell hole in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Smoke's location in the city. I've been to others that just don't cut it. Let me start off by saying that when I first tried Smoke's, I had never eaten a poutine in my life. The idea of gravy and fries and cheese touching and being chewed at the same time repulsed me.

Now it's something I eat once a week. I just can't get enough. There are so many different varieties, and the staff are happy to substitute ingredients for you if you don't see something you want.

Anyone who has a bone to pick with the staff should eat their words. Try walking in after a night out at the bar, when there are easily fifty or more people standing in line. Picture your morning TTC commute from hell, but with belligerent young people. One time I was there and a fight erupted. The staff handled the situation flawlessly - separated it (although not his job) and kicked the problem people out pronto. Then, as if nothing ever happened, the line kept moving. Even when it's busy, it's not a long wait for some artery-clogging goodness.

The guys remember my order since I get the same thing every time. One night I called from work (I was a server in North York at the time) and they saved me the last poutine they had just before close. They're always friendly, pay close attention to detail and bust their butts getting people in and out when it's a madhouse.

The portions are huge. I usually opt for an open container, since I'm an animal and eat it as I walk down Bloor. It's so full, I don't know if it would be possible to close it anywhere. You can get a regular, or wow it for $3 more. The menu and prices got revamped in March. At first, I was ticked, but I love Smoke's so much that I don't mind one bit. Unless I'm at a different location. *shudders* I've had some craptastic experiences elsewhere, but never at the one in the Annex. The correct formula is fries, a good amount of (but not too much) gravy, toppings. It's amazing that some people can screw this up.

I can't say enough good things about this place. I love these guys. They're hard workers, very personable and know how to serve up a mean poutine. I go out of my way to go to this location because I know that my experience will be the best possible."}
{"text":"It was definately not good for you but it sure was yummmy. Open late & a long line that moves fast= 2 thumbs up. Fries drenched in any topping you could imagine. We chose an array of cheeses with bacon and beef. The cheese didn't clump and was very stringy and flavorful.  (drool)"}
{"text":"I find Smoke's to be a better value than Poutini.  The box is noticeably larger, but the taste was actually better as well.  I personally try to stick to just classic poutines, and found this to be above the aforementioned one.

There are a lot of other flavours to still try though, but I'm unsure how they'll turn out."}
{"text":"Great not many choice on the menu but i can tell you for sure which ever you choose when you visit it will sure leave you asking for more. The staff are pleasant and very welcoming and the poutines are just great. Been more then 5 times and planning the next trip with some friends from the UK this summer!"}
{"text":"No matter where you try their poutine, food trucks, concerts or different locations, it always tastes the same, consistency is definitely their key. I've only tried their classic poutine but can't wait to try the nacho poutine. The reason why I gave this location 4 stars is for soo we service, other than that I was more than happy after eating poutine."}
{"text":"Very Good! Fast and easy! I got the medium sized bacon and chili! It was a lot of food. The small is perfect! I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Smoke's, I didn't like it very much. I thought I would give it another shot today, and I hated it! I snuck it into the theatres right across the street (and no, two minutes is not long enough to change the flavour of the food). It was so bad that I completely stopped eating it after two bites, and wished I had just gotten plain fries from the theatre instead! The person I was with hated theirs as well.

I can't tell you exactly what was wrong with it, it just tasted horrible. I would have rather had New York Fries than this new trendy place that specializes in poutine.

The man who was working there was really nice, so I guess that's a plus..."}
{"text":"Upped the price for no reason with no added quality or value. Yeah the poutine is good but $10 is just silly"}
{"text":"C'est une enseigne nationale qui s'est spécialisée dans ce mets supposé traditionnel du Québec. Le menu propose une grande variété de déclinaisons de ce plat fort simple : version cheeseburger, au poulet avec petits pois verts ...   Pour votre plaisir !

Janvier 2014. Mise à jour de mon évaluation : de 4 étoiles on passe à 2. La qualité semble avoir pris un coup, manque de sérieux ou préparation inadéquate ? Déçu !"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating poutine and I was quite pleased. I liked the option to add different toppings and there were three size portions too."}
{"text":"Very good poutine - lots of flavors and interesting combinations. 

Compared to the other obvious poutinerie, La Banquise, quantities were small for the price that was paid."}
{"text":"If you love poutine come here!

Smoke's has a huge selection of poutines, my favorite being hogtown. The atmosphere was great and so were the staff. This location is pretty tiny and doesn't have a lot of seating, so you may want to keep that in mind (but you can always eat your poutine outside)."}
{"text":"My first time having poutine.  I hear it's from Quebec and it's fries with cheese curds and brown sauce.  The one at Smoke's has the cheese curds with gravy, which I'm told is thicker than the brown sauce used in Quebec.  Anyway, we got take away so I can't say much about the service.  We picked the Country one (chicken, onions, mushrooms) and Pulled Pork.  The Country was a little salty and the Pulled Pork was a little sweet.  I have to say I preferred the Pulled Pork to the Country, but they were both pretty good for my first time having poutine."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love poutine right?  Well how about varieties of poutine.  Had the pulled pork with bacon and it was good.  Looking forward to trying the many other flavours."}
{"text":"Both times I've visited I've had the Veggie Deluxe. The large size is pretty large and the mushrooms and onions are a welcome addition. The sauce is also well-balanced and not too salty. The cheese curds are good as are the fries. I drenched mine in Sriracha sauce, which actually provides an interesting spin on poutine."}
{"text":"I love Smoke's Poutinerie but had a very bad experience at this location. There was only one guy managing everything- the cash counter and the kitchen.We ordered the veggie nacho poutine. The potato fries were undercooked and cold (i doubt if it was fried at all, it was like boiled). There was a layer of clear liquid on top, like water. Couldn't have the second bite, just threw it and walked out! Total waste!! Will never go back there again."}
{"text":"This is a poutine-lover's heaven.  With flavours ranging from the traditional (cheese curds and gravy) to the Quebecois (add shaved Montreal smoked meat, a dill pickle slice and mustard on the side), to the completely outlandish (think Philly cheese steak or nacho grande poutine), Smoke's is sure to have the flavour for what ails you."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine!

I have never been there during the day but at 2:00AM it's a crazy mess. The music is normally on high and it's packed with a bunch of people in their 20's. Normally this would sound like a place to avoid but it's a lot of fun. The staff works as fast as they can but even though they're under a lot of pressure they're very friendly. 

I wish this locations restaurant was bigger because it is very small but their food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was a great late night munchies place and I'm glad we got recommendations for it. On first look it seemed like the boxes were pretty small but once we got our orders, these boxes because at least over a pound of food! We got the Triple Pork, Philly Cheesesteak, and the Hogtown and my goodness there was so much food ... The meat was great, the bacon was generously sprinkled on and the curds were squeaky. Yum - I'm from out of town so this was a thrill for a person from a place that doesn't get much poutine."}
{"text":"Rough area. I keep an eye on my car as I'm waiting for my fries. Good poutine. So many toppings to choose from. I love the veggie one with peas, mushrooms, curds and veggie gravy. Fill up and then head over to Filmores for a show or just outside for some meth."}
{"text":"Gross. That's all I can say. I love poutine and was looking forward to trying this place for months. Finally, I had the opportunity and ordered the pulled pork poutine. It was just not good at all. Maybe I shouldn't have ordered a meat poutine....the meat didn't seem fresh...there was so much in the carton and no smaller serving option.....maybe not enough sauce? It was just a big, gross blob I didn't want to eat. Nothing in it seemed fresh at all. For a poutine specialty place, I just expected so much more! Even poutine at fast food places is better than this. I am just so mad I wasted almost $11 on crap. I am sticking to the poutine at NY Fries. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"+ Poutine! Taters!! Cheese!!! Graaaavy!!!! 
+ Chain of poutine stores in Toronto 
+ Gourmet options also available 

Smoke's Poutinerie is a chain of poutine shops in Toronto. It's quick, affordable, and it gives you an instant satisfaction with sodium and carbs - it's essentially Gregg's of Canada. 
As I entered the poutinerie in North Toronto, I was immediately greeted by the familiar fast food world of bright colour scheme and unnecessarily friendly shop assistants. Ok. This should be easy enough. Just pick your food, size and your choice of unhealthy fizzy drink. I think I can handle this. 
In fact, the menu suggested they have a lot of creative options. But as a newbie, I picked a regular poutine. I had to leave something for next time. At a quick glance, other options seemed to revolve around adding extra meat, cream or syrup in different shapes and forms. I can see myself eating poutine with added bacon or pulled pork. But poutine with French toast sticks (whatever they are, indeed) and maple syrup ('Oh Canada!' option) might be a bit much. 
Anyhow, my poutine was very nice. It consisted of firm cheese curd, crunchy French fries and hot gravy sauce. Cheese curd was closer to haloumi than mozzarella on the scale of firmness except, it wasn't smeared with concentrated salt as typical haloumi cheese you find at a supermarket in the UK. 
Much like kebab and chips after a night of drinking, poutine hits the most basic parts of your taste bud with the combination of sodium, fat and carbs. Of course it tastes good. It's designed to make you want more! Sure, it's not exactly fine dining. But it's good. I would come back to try more daring options.  After all, I feel eating poutine is mandatory while in Canada. I went to the one in North Toronto. But there are a bunch of them in downtown."}
{"text":"I didn't mind my vegetarian poutine that I ordered but the main issue I had was that it was way too salty. The fries also did not seem to be fresh, nor were they hot enough."}
{"text":"Wait. I love poutine, and I didn't even know it until I visited Smoke's Poutinerie.

I'm from Michigan, which is kind of close to being Canada, but not really. So when I visited my boyfriend's lovely home town of Toronto for the first time, he had to take me to get poutine.

We got the triple pork poutine (pulled pork + bacon + sausage) and it seriously just blew me away. I mean, I love french fries, I love cheese, I love gravy.... Why did it never occur to me I would love poutine?! The portion is quite large for CAD9--perfect to split between two people for a meal. The gravy was not too salty and the pulled pork was seriously just straight up awesome. The bacon probably could've been ab it crispier, but that's just a small nit.

Now every time I go back to Canada, I make it a point to get poutine from Smoke's Poutinerie. I even chose to eat here when we went to visit the Niagara Falls!

There's a lot of variety on the menu, which is awesome. I like how they're so creative with the options. A lot of poutine that I get in the States just give you fries with gravy and cheese. Another place I went to had pulled pork and other toppings, but was way too salty. Smoke's Poutinerie manages to balance all the flavors just right.

The restaurants themselves are very casual and friendly. The staff has always been stellar (but really, who in Canada isn't friendly?). Definitely recommend all my American friends to try out Smoke's Poutinerie, and yes, I'm okay being super American about how much I love this."}
{"text":"I ate Smoke's at another location (Adelaide, I think) 2 years ago and it was delicious. Piping hot with heaps of gravy and toppings. I was completely sober and I thought it was great.

I ate at this location today and it was awful. Got country style. It was served cold with what must have been 2 tbsp of gravy for the whole box of fries. Meager amount of mushrooms and onions. Cheese totally un-melted and barely warm. 

I should also say I started writing this review at 7PM, but I just woke up from a 5 hour stomach-ache food coma induced by eating the meal. I usually have a very strong stomach and I have no food allergies or sensitivities; nothing ever gives me a stomach ache, so this definitely makes me question the contents of the meal.

Long story short: find a better poutine place if you want a good poutine."}
{"text":"Went to get a take out poutine on wednesday night, ordered a Cochonnaille poutine which is suppose to have pulled pork, bacon and pepper sauce.  I was alone in there, the guy who took the order went to the kitchen to prepare the poutine, came back out and called out to me \"one cochonnaille\".... Took it home, and when I opened it, it was a plain basic poutine, without any meat, without pepper sauce.... But I still got charge the full price of 9.20$, instead of the 5.70 for a basic poutine.  
 
I could possibly understand making a mistake if I ordered it in the dinner rush, but no, I was ALONE in the place, the same guy took the order and made the poutine right away... How can you mess up like this... Specially, when you have just finished assembling the poutine, and are calling out 'One cochonnaille'.... You would think he would realized that he messed up then.

Call them when I got home and he says, 'sorry.... don't know how it happened, do you want to come back so I can fix it ?'  Yeah right, I am going to get back in my car, drive for 10 minutes, to get what I ordered.  I think they might be doing this on purpose to take out orders, because they can charge more and most people won't come back to get it right, and this way, more profit in their pockets
 
I email head office, and they never even bothered answering... Not a very good customer service!"}
{"text":"I used to work at a Smoke's and yeah, they treat their staff poorly; minimum wage, understaffed often, unpaid useless staff meetings...and the ultimate annoyance- terrible 80's metal on repeat is policy. This obviously makes for an unhappy employee, which leads to a poor product, plus stealing, lots of stealing. The extreme expansion of Smoke's is ironically their downfall in my opinion, with not enough focus on quality and consistency. Great drunk food, that's about it.

I'll skip the review and lay out some tips:
- the veggie gravy is more flavorful and less pure salt then the regular gravy
- ask for your fries extra crispy to avoid sogginess
- ask for the curds layered and you'll get more and they'll be better mixed in
- if you don't like your food, say so and the staff will do something, there's buttons on the register for exactly that, but don't do it rudely or during a rush."}
{"text":"Just got a Prime Beef Deluxe Poutine 10 minutes ago, cold gravy, the cheese didn't melt, saggy warm fries. I wonder what took the server (Juliana) so long to serve my poutine. I don't expect exceptional customer service from a fast food place but a thank you or a smile is expected with the food. Not worth my $10, I should have gone to somewhere else. 1 star for filling my stomach, I was starving. Never going back there ever again. To be honest, Hero Burgers have better poutine and service for half the price."}
{"text":"One of my first experiences of poutine. 

Ordered the hog town and it was tasty at first but it started to taste bland after a while.  There was a mixture of all kinds of pork like bacon and sausage.  Gravy was delicious (if it was on mash potatoes).  The toppings just didn't go well with the fries.  Really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when I get hungry at 2AM. This is the only location I've been to, so I don't know how the other ones compare. 

Usually, me and my friend would buy a burrito downstairs at Burrito Boyz and come up and get our poutine. There are more seats upstairs, and they don't seem to care if you're eating a burrito or poutine. My all time favourite is the Triple Pork - sausages, bacon and pulled pork. The cheese curds are awesome as well, remember to ask for extra! 

A large is good enough to share between two to three people, and you'll still leave feeling stuffed. This place gets pretty packed late night with drunken clubbers in the area, so if you want to avoid getting puked on or just want a quiet meal, come before midnight!"}
{"text":"Like the actress Imogen Poots, poutine is a beautiful thing wrapped in a horrible name. As my husband says, if they called it \"cheesy gravy fries,\" everyone would love it. As it stands, few people outside Canada have tried it. And that's a shame, because it's one of the best foods out there!

Thankfully, this American girl can now get her poutine fix close to home. Located next to the store made famous on \"Pawn Stars,\" this walk-up stand is a branch of the popular Canadian chain, and hopefully its tourist-filled location will help spread the Gospel of Poutine. 

The menu is simple and straightforward, with three sizes (snack, meal, and Wow!) and several topping options (including beef, chicken, and vegetarian items). My husband and I split an order of traditional poutine (brown gravy and cheese curds) and double pork (pulled pork and bacon). Although I had my doubts about adding toppings to the already-delicious traditional flavors, I was blown away by how good the double pork was. The sweet pulled pork and the salty bacon nicely complemented the gravy and cheese. Our meal size portions were HUGE -- big enough that I had leftovers. And the prices were reasonable: just under $20 for both orders.

Although I'm still full from lunch, I can't wait to return to Smoke's. I've already got my eye on the Philly cheeseteak and the Montréal. Vive la poutine!"}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff. I order the chicken fajita and the fries and chicken seem cold. A bit on the pricy side too."}
{"text":"Out of all of the poutine I've tried, Smoke's is my favorite. The regular size is filling, worth the price, and every bite is just as good as the last. The cheese curds are actually curds as opposed to melted cheesy-crap, like I've seen at so many places. They have a lot of variety, and even some more exotic dishes (i.e. butter chicken poutine). I have had better gravy, but I don't have any complaints about theirs. When friends recommended Smoke's - saying it was perfect - I was skeptical. I've been here a few times since, and they have never let me down."}
{"text":"I went back here another time recently...

The food was tasty and well, pretty much the same as the first time I went.

But...I forgot to mention the wonderful entertainment while dining.
Directly across the street you have a perfect view of the stripclub/hotel for your people watching pleasure.

It took us 15 minutes to eat.
In that time we saw a homeless man peeing on a mailbox and an illegal exchange of illicit substances...

Anyways, there is another location on Adelaide if you don't want to venture east of Dundas Square."}
{"text":"It was my first time having Poutine as I was visiting from the US, and this place did not disappoint. For those unaware, pountine is fries with gravy and cheese curds on top. If that didn't sound heart attack inducing enough, you can get other toppings on it. I ended up getting the pulled pork. I could only eat about half of it because it was so dense and filling. I think I could get three meals out of one serving. 

It was delicious, quick service, and would certainly have it again if they ever brought it to California."}
{"text":"It was alright. A bit disappointed. They had interesting flavors, like Korean poutine. That's what I tried, and it was overwhelmed with sauce. More sauce doesn't equal better... I also arrived when I was the only person there. I left a 15% tip when I ordered my food. I assumed they would bring my food to me. Nope. What the heck did I tip for? Probably good for the late night drunk crowd, since this place is open late, and they don't care about taste or service."}
{"text":"CLOSED?!? Drove there today when I heard one opened in Vegas (LOVED the one in Toronto - my 1st poutine!). I hope the owner didn't die or something, and they open back up. Looks like lots of gear/furniture inside, NO notice or sign, but all dark and closed. The pizza place next door and custard shop next to it were tight lipped when I asked about it?????"}
{"text":"Good presentation, good marketing and a trendy decor? Check check and check. Good poutine...? 

I'm a Montrealer who spent a year in Toronto, where Smoke's is -the- place to get pout. Quality high, and authentic. When I heard one had opened in Montreal, I encouraged a group of friends to check it out with me.

The end result? Really average poutine and half of us getting violent food poisoning.

Avoid."}
{"text":"I had the regular poutine and my sister got the butter chicken. Lets just say she threw hers away the butter chicken was awful. Was not authentic at all had a weird watered down flavor yuck. Mine was good but it was very basic nothing special. There are so many other spots in the city I suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Its honestly not that great. the staff look like they hate their life first of all. Second of all the potatoes are not cooked fully. they were raw and hard to bite into, the poutine and gravy mix were excellent but that was it. they have lots of types of poutines to choose from but it doesn't even make up for the bad potatoes."}
{"text":"So I realize the proliferation of \"gourmet\" poutine in Toronto is old news but since the dundas location of smokes is so close to my place I've decided it warranted a review. So I personally have tried 4 different varieties of poutine and while I like aspects of each one there has been an issue with each one. Let's start with good news, the base poutine is really good add some caramelized onions and your in heaven. The problem is that not all of their ingredients are of the same quality. I found the chicken they use as well as the italian sausage to be really dry and salty and just don't work with the poutine. These are pretty minor quips and they will make your poutine anyway you like pretty much so just skip the bad ingredients. So if your in the mood for some gut busting goodness Smoke's is probably a pretty good bet."}
{"text":"(Delivery) This was a really good change of pace for lunch.  Delivery was fast and the food was hot and delicious.  I ordered the \"Montreal Poutine (shaved Montreal smoked meat, pickle and mustard)\", the variety of flavors went very well together.  The smoked meat was corned beef.  I will definitely order from Smoke's Poutinerie again!"}
{"text":"i have been to this place a few times. 

You get a lot of poutine for a reasonable price. Ive been 2 time and each time i got the Nacho poutine. 

it is amazing..would definatly recomend this place if you want some delicious poutine.

service was also fast and friendly."}
{"text":"As I gazed upon this huge box of Chili Cheese Fries (the Meal size, $8.99 for all types on the wall menu) with extra curds ($2), I try to give myself more tummy room by giving myself a break to write this review.  Also, as I am eating by myself today, I'm going to furiously tap at my phone screen like somebody important or somethin'.  Here goes my free-form ramblings:

This spot by the door is drafty.
Why is it so cold mid-May? 
I blame global warming. 

Squeaky, squeaky, these curds.
These \"extra\" curds amounted to only maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons' worth. 
Eh, it feels like a lot in the tummy anyway. 

This stuff is super salty. 
Is it the bacon, or is it the fries? 

Man, so. Many. Fries. 

This gravy is liquidy.
I heard that's signature of poutine-authentic, good gravy.

Ha, somebody mistook the spicy Sriracha with ketchup.  What a price to pay. 

$8.99 isn't exactly cheap for one or two potatoes, but they're pretty generous with their toppings, so I can't complain.  Ugh, too many fries.  I give up."}
{"text":"I dropped by Smoke's on my lunch and tried the classic poutine. My food arrived fast and fresh, and was very hot which made the cheese curds (which were nice and squeaky) melt ever so slightly.

My problem with the poutine here is that the gravy is always a little watery and lacking in flavour. All I really tasted was the cheese and I would have loved a more substantial sauce.

A solid three stars for Smoke's, and it hit the spot despite the above."}
{"text":"The gravy was flavourless.  Not really worth the hype.  The floors were dirty.   I didn't enjoy it and would not recommend this place to anyone.  I had the Montreal and my spouse had the classic.  Not enough cheese, and no sour krauts."}
{"text":"Yep, it's another Smoke's Poutinerie.  What makes this one great is that it's a great backup in case you don't want to line up at Burrito Boyz directly below.

Service is fine, but could use more staffing as they usually have one person at the cash and another at the kitchen which is not enough for lunchtime.

I tried the Philly Cheesesteak poutine and they don't skimp on the ingredients here, even on the medium size portions.  I could easily skip dinner if I wanted to after eating one of these."}
{"text":"I tried their triple pulled pork poutine, and I must say, they are better then they used to be."}
{"text":"I came here at the recommendation of a friend who had lived in Toronto for a while. I've known what poutine was for the past few years and always said I would try it when I got to Quebec...well little did I know it is not just available in Quebec but all over Canada!

I've been eating french fries with gravy my whole life, so I was really looking forward to trying something that combined my favorite with some cheese curds.

It was not a very difficult place to find, it is a short walk from the CN tower and very close to the fire station.

I was surprised how empty the place was, but did not let it scare me off since I was told this is great poutine.

A man wearing a boat-captains hat took my order. This place had a very hipster vibe going on. I went with the traditional, and also ordered a bottle of cream soda(pop). It was ready in about 5 minutes.

I let the box stay shut for a while because I had read Poutine is best when the cheese curds melt a little. I then dug in. It was good. and it was a lot. The small portion was so huge it could have fed 2 people. So you definitely get a bang for your buck. The taste was good, the gravy was yummy and the cheese had a nice flavor.

This is however something I would not crave. I am glad I tried it, but it was nothing extraordinary to me. I could see really craving it while intoxicated though(I really crave carbs after a few drinks).

If you are in the area give it a try, you get a lot for your money :)"}
{"text":"Lost my poutine virginity here today, the pulled pork is to die for. The massive amounts of ketchup packets I grabbed became obsolete."}
{"text":"Have to bump up my rating a star, as this time I asked for \"about half the gravy you would normally put on\", and I was a satisfied customer.  I got a better taste of the very good fries, and enjoyed the dish much better.  The gravy seemed better this time too.  (My wife said she preferred my veggie gravy to her regular.)"}
{"text":"Tastes like salt. I go when I'm wasted and fixated on poutine."}
{"text":"I swung by around noon mid week and it was very busy with just one person taking and fulfilling orders. 

Lots of people (students) waiting and I can't believe one person was here to cover the front of house and back of house. 

Good Poutine but can't believe they stretch their staff like that!"}
{"text":"What trip to Canada would be complete without a trip to the Poutinerie?

French Fries slathered with gravy and cheese curds. Tip: Close the lid of the box (so classy, I know) for just a short while, the cheese curds start to melt and get even more wonderful. 

French Fries slather with gravy and cheese curds and topped with sweet-tangy BBQ pulled pork. O yes. That's right. Who would have thought that French Fries could be a vessel for pulled pork? Each mouthful makes you wonder what drunken festivities led to such a wonderful combination. 

You can even get the triple pork (though my cousin suggests that's too much pork). It doesn't just stop at pulled pork though. They also offer poutine piled with chicken, beef, and veggies. Of course, there's always classic too.

Glancing at the other reviews, I feel compelled to add that I wrote this review and ate the food totally sober. Also, I went at lunch time and there was a long line past the chalk boards to the door."}
{"text":"this place should not call itself a Poutinerie, the thing they sell as the name suggests is horrible: cheese-not squeaky, gravy-just plain bad, fries-the only thing thats okay.
Save ur money and go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"I was feeling experimental on my first visit to Smoke's and ordered the smoked meat poutine.  I didn't think the combination of two of my favourite foods would be so weird.  I think a regular poutine plus smoked meat would have been okay, but the addition of mustard added a weird taste to the gravy.  I was also hoping for this \"dill\" that is supposed to be included as per their menu, but my poutine came sans pickle.  Dave W.'s review tells me I was ripped off.

Second time around, I tried the nacho poutine, which was much better.  I love guacamole, which is included in this recipe.  It was a little messy due to the combination of ingredients, but the flavours seemed to blend together a little better compared to the smoked meat version.

The fries were a good thickness, the quantity of gravy was perfect (I didn't have to eat any dry fries) and the curds actually melted (I've had a poutine with cold curds before).  While I enjoyed my poutines at Smoke's, I have definitely had much better poutines elsewhere (mostly in Quebec).  

Bonus: I happened to go to Smoke's prior to the new shopping bag law and my take-out came in a biodegradable plastic bag."}
{"text":"We couldn't come all the way to Canada and not try Poutine. Poutine (/putin/; Quebec French: [putsn]) is a Quebecois dish originally made with French fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy.

Restaurant and Service:
Not the best or cleanest spot but if it definitely had the potential to be. All it would take is just someone taking the time to make sure the chairs and tables were organized. It didn't look like the people working here really cared about the location. Their service was a [*] experience. Now we were here at midnight but still... at least try. 

Food:
I ordered the Philip Cheese Steak Poutine and it was not bad. It was absolutely unhealthy for you but that's a given right. The meat tasted good and big portions. 

If you are craving a midnight snack and want to load up on carbs, come on by."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because this was an excellent introduction to poutine.

   ---   ---   ---

Maybe I have had poutine in my life before this, but if I did, it must not have been that memorable. So let's call this my first experience with poutine.

I knew I was going try some before my less than 24 hour experience in Toronto was done. I felt somewhat forced into choosing Smoke's, strictly due to convenience. The reviews were underwhelming, but it was conveniently located near Rogers Centre for my post Blue Jays game trek.

The verdict? Amazing Everything I would have hoped french fries piled high with cheese curds and gravy would be. I've thought about it ever since."}
{"text":"Had the traditional. The poutine, is amazing. Customer service was meh. There is no where to sit at this location."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! I love it...

I felt so bad after having this awesome cheesy goodness and had to walk it off :D 

I went in thinking its just fries and sauce but wow they have choices and they have vegetarian sauces as well. I had their Traditional Veggie Poutine which is Hand-Cut and Custom Seasoned Fries with Rich Brown Vegetable Gravy and beautifully melted Quebec Cheese Curds. 

The packaging was great its an awesome box not messy and easy to eat from and the store is pretty neat and cool.

I still have to go back to try their Veggie Nacho Poutine!"}
{"text":"Had the traditional, good stuff. Definitely appeals to the late-night crowd, was glad to have it, as I'd gotten in late!"}
{"text":"Okay, I rarely ever eat poutine let alone eat it in Canada. BUT I did for the first time in my life and I DO NOT REGRET IT. I had the pulled pork poutine and my sister enjoyed the regular. We got the normal size and it was huge!!!! So much food. Super super filling I was actually almost sad it was so filling because I was on my way to rock out at a concert all night. Anyway - it was hot and perfect. I could have gotten the regular kind and been so satisfied. It was literally explosions of goodness in my mouth. Plus the guy working was super cool and easy to talk to. The swaying inside the place is great - a decent amount of people could eat at once there. And it's a great location in my opinion! On a pretty main road with lots of stuff near by!

Super awesome plus - they give away dope stickers for free!"}
{"text":"Ran in to order a to-go \"Regular Poutine\" as a visitor to Canada.

Fries were freshly fried as I waited for the order to be made. But quite expensive for just fries with gravy and cheese? Over $6 for a small \"Snack size.\" Looks like they had a lot of elaborate variations which may have been tastier.

Also, just an odd interaction with the worker who wanted to hand me an open greasy and gravy-oozing container of poutine to carry out in the cold. Is that a thing?"}
{"text":"Ordered their bestseller bacon-pulled pork combo in large portion LOL two starving gals cant finish the whole thing! Almost perfect, if I haven't tried poutines served at Montreal. And if there weren't fruit flies flying around this mini diner!"}
{"text":"As a Yankee, I was never made aware of the beauty and awesome wonder that is poutine. Although I think it would be huge in the states!

My first trip to Smoke's Poutinerie started off on one of my first trips to Toronto after starting a new job (worked remote in Detroit and was in Toronto a few days every other week). When I first heard of poutine, I'll admit, I was a little grossed out but figured I'd give it a whirl. So a co-worker and walked over to Smoke's for my initiation. All I have to say is \"HOLY WOW! Why don't we have these in the states?!?!?\" Ya gotta love something made with fries, gravy, cheese curds, and three types of meat! Anything that'll give me the \"meat sweats\" is ok in my book!

A word of warning about their sizes, get the small size if it is just for you as the regular/large will put you into cardiac arrest or a food coma you might never recover from.

In the end, I love poutine and I love Smoke's Poutine not only for being the first, but also one of the best poutines I've ever had. Look forward to a trip every time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Huge volume of food with a ton of choices for toppings. Quick service. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there was no place to eat it. Pretty satisfied for a quick poutine craving fix."}
{"text":"When I visit my friend in Canada, there are two things I want to eat: ketchup chips and poutine. Hailing from Cincinnati, Ohio, where poutine is a rarity, I was ecstatic to pass this shop while browsing Toronto.

Smoke's is all pountine and only pountine. It goes much further than the traditional gravy and cheese curds over fries. There are 25 different kinds of poutine served up here, including varieties with beef, chicken and vegetarian. Overwhelmed with my selection, I asked the clerk what she recommended:  Nacho Veggie Poutine. Hand-cut fries topped with mushroom gravy, cheese curds, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, and jalepenos. 

It was beyond delicious and left me craving another variety. My friend had the traditional poutine, which I sampled. Of course, it was fantastic as well. I liked Smoke's so much, I made a list of what I'd like to try on my next visit to Toronto:

 - Curry Chicken
 - Pulled Pork
 - Montreal
 - Italian Deluxe
 - Prime Beef
 - Veggie Deluxe

If that's not overwhelming enough, I can also mix and match ingredients from the menu to create a custom poutine. Amazing! I wish Smoke's would venture down to The States, perhaps to Cincinnati. You'd be a success here, and I'd be your most frequent customer!

Cost per person: $6 - $10"}
{"text":"The good: We got free poutine!
The bad: The place was a littered in empty poutine boxes.
The ugly: There is nothing ugly about free poutine at 4am.

We stumbled into this place after a night at the bar and the guy behind the counter said people weren't picking up the poutine they'd ordered and paid for, so we could have ours for free!! We were soooo excited. That sort of lucky awesomeness doesn't happen too often.

The poutine was good with delicious fries covered in cheese curds, drenched in gravy and a perfect size for sharing. The gravy was only okay though, kind of tasted like Swiss Chalet Gravy. 

There were empty, or partly empty abandoned poutine containers all over the restaurant which was a little gross.

It's a good place to stop into after a night at the bar."}
{"text":"I was suprised to read all these bad reviews.  I am not Canadian, nor do I have a lot of poutine eating experience but a group of friends and I decided to stop here on our way out of Toronto and we all really liked it.  3 of us just got traditional poutine and someone got the vegetarian one all in the snack size, which was more than enough food."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of options on the menu. There's Rainbow Poutine, Montréal Poutine, etc. I had the traditional poutine, which is just the basic stuff with no additional toppings, but it was still delicious! I took an American friend here who was trying poutine for the first time & he said it was \"pretty good.\" :) 

The poutine comes in a take-out box & portions are generous. Seating, however, is very limited."}
{"text":"This Smoke's rules! Tony was super helpful, and all around such a great worker! This will be my go to smoke's now because of Tony, and the great food."}
{"text":"As a self-professed poutine lover, I've been on a lot of poutine crawls in Montreal and Quebec city, so I think I speak from a lot of experience and clogged arteries over the years.  When smokes first appeared on the Toronto scene years ago, I liked it due to it being the only alternative to poutine from Harvey's.  But as other poutine places emerged, the quality expectations grew while Smokes was...well left in the dust.  The classic Poutine is ok to hit the spot on a late drunken night, but I'm often left disappointed.  All the other abomination of poutines they have are horrible, I see them as poutine blasphemy."}
{"text":"As I am writing this review, I have already decided that I will be going here for lunch today, as a proud Canadian should in honour of Canada Day. This is one of my favourite places to go to fulfil my poutine cravings. I have tried a couple of their different poutines in the past and they were just okay. Now I just stick with the Triple Pork because it never fails to satisfy me. It really is the best poutine that they offer so don't waste your time on the others, unless you don't eat meat. Also squirt some sriracha over it and it's even better."}
{"text":"Sorry Smoke's lovers, I am unimpressed!

I LOVE poutine, but just can't get myself to enjoy it here. The gravy is...smokey? I guess that's an appropriate description. I think a top quality poutine should showcase the cheese curds, but at Smokes the cheese doesn't really melt all that well, aren't that flavourful,  and the gravy has a very overwhelming/dominant flavour. The cheese is almost squeaky...

Props for creativity - ie bacon poutine. I ate the bacon off the top...

They also get points for quick service, and hilarious people watching during the after-bar hours. The best is when one drunk person tries to fork-feed another drunk person. Poutine is best served...to oneself."}
{"text":"All kinds of poutine - just about anything you could want as a topping. Are you a minimalist? Just get the traditional, like I did. In hindsight, something with some more kick would have been nice, like bacon or something. I added some hot sauce and that did nicely. As for sizes, the large is huge (probably enough to share), so order wisely."}
{"text":"Oh, M. Goodness.

I love poutine. I could not turn down a recommendation from a colleague to check out Smoke's. And it did not disappoint.

I ordered the pulled pork poutine. Holy crud, delicious.

Super tasty pulled pork. Perfectly frenched fries. Comforting gravy. Damn fine curds.

I'm psyched!

I'm actually eating and posting this at the same time. SO. GOOD.

This definitely warming me up on a day when the high in Toronto was -3°C."}
{"text":"It's my first time in Canada, so of course I had to try poutine! 

I got the traditional, just because I wanted to try it without all the toppings first. The cheese curds are HUGE and there are plenty of them! I was a little overwhelmed at first. 

Traditional poutine is pretty basic, yet soooo good. We added a little vinegar to ours, which made it even better. The traditional size took us by surprise, as it was actually bigger than we expected. But it was so good we ate all of it! 

Definitely coming here again to try one with toppings. It was too good to just have once!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best poutine I've had in Toronto, so good! I had the Veggie Deluxe and am glad I changed my mind about ordering the large because even the small size was huge, I ended up having to save half for later. 

I think the only healthy thing about it were the green peas, but I'm sure my body forgives me since it tastes so good...

The staff were very nice and patient with me as I was having massive debit card troubles and they had to ring my order through 3 times before I could get it working but the girl at the counter was very sweet about it."}
{"text":"I'm not from the Great White North and I've only had a few Americanized versions of poutine- I wouldn't know if the version served here is legit or not. But I can tell you that it is good.

The snack-size traditional poutine is amply sized and priced ($6) for the name, and comes with fresh, skin-on fries topped with layers of fresh cheese curds and a splash of gravy. I do like that they layered the toppings so the bottom half of the order was not dry and boring. The fries were sauced just right so they were nicely soft but not soggy. Flavor in the gravy itself was lighter than expected but still savory and enjoyable.

Props for having vegetarian options available! I'd opt to stick to the namesake traditional poutine dish here over others, because the rest of the menu contains cheese-fry, chili-fry, and taco-themed concoctions that seem more on par with a bar or fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I normally get the traditional but today I felt adventurous so I tried the bacon cheeseburger poutine.  So disgusting.  The beef and bacon were very dry and did not taste good at all.  I kept crunching down on something..no idea what but I gave up and threw out 3/4 of my poutine."}
{"text":"After having heard all the hype about this place, finally decided to check it out on a wednesday evening (~6:30pm) as part of our on-going hunt for the best poutine in town. This place is truly a man's space - simple seating (only about 8 stools or so); grunge rock playing in the background; plain cardboard containers. clearly they save their frills for their poutine selection. It's a bit overwhelming at first sight. I ended up picking the Chili Poutine and my compadre a Double Meat Poutine (Bacon + Pulled Pork).

Definitely should have stuck with my tried & true method of asking for a 'most popular item' -- my reaction to the first bite of the Chili Poutine: ENH. it boggled my mind as to why the chili was lukewarm, barely melting the cheese...meaning the semi warm sauce and cold curds just lay limp over the fries, smothering them soft...definitely not the makings of the best poutine ever. components of the chili were pretty hearty so it mayyyybe had potential if it were anything better than lukewarm, but i didn't taste it. 1 star.

I tried sneaking as many bites of the Double Meat Poutine as I could while it lasted. This on the other hand was piping hot, cheese curds layered between fries for nice distribution, gravy laden, and had the pulled pork had a good amount of sweetness to balance things out. As others have commented, this may not have been the best pulled pork ever, but it indeed hit the spot. 3 stars.

Not gonna lie - I probably will eventually return again for its convenience and variety, but I know now to cross that Chili Poutine off the list."}
{"text":"After a night at out a friend of mine came with me to try this place out.  They have a ton of selection and different toppings try out but we went with the basic.

It was pretty good, but it's hard to mess up such a good thing, fries, cheese curd and gravy.....lots and lots of gravy!

I would have preferred NY Fries poutine but they just close too early!"}
{"text":"Dirty feed 101, do have gallons of salt and fatty fried food, don't have any vegetables or the like and do have vast amounts of said dirty feed for a relatively reasonable price. If you are looking for some solid dirty feed and some great people watching make your way to Smoke's anytime before 4 am nightly. However if you are looking for some gooey-melty-gravy filled-delectable poutine, you might want to try somewhere else. 

A solid poutine is a little like a solid building, they both rely heavily on the foundation. Where the \"solidity\" of a building escapes me, poutine is pretty standard, you've gotta commit and get the fries right. 
Being wishy washy on fry size and consistency is a sure fire way to fail. Either go thick and crunchy, or skinny mini. Smoke's fries are on the proverbial fence, being that they are droopy midsized and pretty much flavourless. They almost taste as though they are stale the moment they come from the fryer. This could be a combination of the state they are in before they hit the fryer, or the weird cardboard container they come in after. 

Beyond the obvious fail of the fries, the poutine itself never really melted, for some reason though the gravy was scalding it stayed in a very solid state til we were finished gorging. The gravy was pretty salty and I wonder if I might have had better luck with the nacho poutine. But I stuck with the veggie standard, and probably won't be back to try the other options any time soon. 

I do however appreciate that they cater to vegetarians, and thus I must bump up their star power. Other than that though I've really had better. 

Bottom line...I'm wondering how they came to franchise themselves so fully, were the fries better in the days of yore???"}
{"text":"Having had some premium poutines in Montreal, I'm glad to have Smoke's to be able to get my fix in the GTA.  Menu has a large selection and portion sizes are quite large.  I was probably among the first customers during the lunch hour so they weren't prepared to have their advertised Thanksgiving poutine although they told me it was sold out.  Perhaps the gimmick was so good they had preorders?  Regardless, I didn't mind trying something else on their plentiful menu.  Will definitely be coming back to satisfy cravings without the trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Smoke's poutinerie came recommended by various Canadians as a good place to go to have a traditional dish, so we went on my first night in Toronto. It was a mistake for a couple of reasons; one, we were not drunk and it was not one in the morning (when I imagine this place would shine), and two, I didn't feel so hot before I ate the fries/gravy/cheese curd/italian sausage brick so I definitely wasn't feeling too great by the time I ate half and gave up. I can see the appeal of the concept, but being born and raised in Southern California give me carne asada fries any day."}
{"text":"As this is actually my first try with true poutine I can not really give a true good or bad review of the food. I will say all the ingredients were fresh and hot and the service was very good. They have a lot of choices to jazz up your fries and I will return to try something different. As for the taste it was good but to me the gravy had a strange taste. I love wet fries so this could be just a taste difference. It is still worth trying them, so I would recommend."}
{"text":"All of the YUM! My boyfriend and I fell in love with poutine on a Canada vacation so on a recent work trip to Toronto I was so excited to stumble upon this place. This poutine is top notch! I had the pulled pork.. Delicious!!! Loooove that they have so many different options.. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Man..  Here me out right quick. 

This is a warning to all you non white brothers who got the random feeling of poutine in yer stomach.. Don't do it, smokes ain't worth the what'll come out at night.

Anyways this is my second time coming to smokes cuz again I had that feeling of raging hormones of fries needed to be had.  First experience was...  

Ya dis this time I walked in and shorty was a sweet heart (that's the only reason dis joint got a star) and helped me out. She ain't even enjoy the food and said the quality been going down hill since time. If you ever read this shorty them double pig tail hairstyle was mad cute ahah,  never seen a older girl brave enough to rock that but you did. It was bulking season otherwise maybe possibly there was a chance of singling and mingling

I got that nacho grande wit chicken pieces (bless her pretty white heart) and lemme break it down for you non white people.  If Godzilla ate some spicy chicken Curry with some jerk chicken with some milk with some goat cheese with some pineapple mushrooms with some laxatives... It still wouldn't be as bad looking and tasting as this.  

It's like I'm digging into liquid diarrhea and pushing myself to eat and lying to my friends that it tastes marvelous cuz I was stripid enough to spend 11 bucks on crap. 

I literally quit eating potatoes in general (not all because of this but half cuz of this). Srs (respect the srs tag fam) 

Save yer selves fam"}
{"text":"I love Smoke's Poutine but DO NOT visit this location!

Terrible customer service and they did not honour the coupon that was given out by Smoke's Headquarters. 

The poutine itself had hardly any curds compared to what I have gotten at other locations.

Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Ever not want to go to the bathroom for a few days? Well if colon clogging is your deal then poutine is the way to go, ESPECIALLY with the poutine concoctions this place is dolling out - good lord! 

Don't get me wrong, when it's 3AM and Kris U is well into the sauce there is no other place I can find faster than Smoke's. Maybe it's because they've got locations all over the city... maybe it's because you can smell it from a mile away... maybe it's that EVERYONE you pass on the street in TO at that time is holding a poutine.. BUT MAYBE, it's because not unlike the mindless zombies in Walking Dead I'm drawn towards the noise, and bright lights of this shop (and that the contents of some poutines may even look like zombie feed). 

None the less, Poutine has rapidly become out national dish (thank you Quebec + Ottawa) and at XX AM, this is what I almost always crave, and based on late night check-ins on Yelp, I seem to always land at this location. My go to is a standard 
poo-tine or the pulled pork and bacon.

No matter what my after bar poison of choice it really makes no difference the result is always the same, short term gain (aka no puking and alcohol properly absorbed) and long term pain (no pooping, flatulence, or any sort of colo-rectal movement for the better part of 3-4 days). 

It's good, not great, but always does the trick. I'd like to say, nay nay will I ever visit them again. But we all know those who say it are lying through their teeth. 

Until we meet again Smokes.... Until we meet again

EC Out!"}
{"text":"Its both amazing and horrible that I live so close to this place. 

The food is greasy, heavy, filling and will probably kill you, which is why I love it.

You probably wont be able to eat a regular on your own, you can actually share a box with three people and all three will be full. 

The selection is huge. 

If I could marry a restaurant... You know the rest."}
{"text":"With all the restaurants serving much higher quality poutine at lower prices, why would anyone order these crappy fast food poutine that lacks flavor and are overpriced? Fries are subpar and that is a huge problem because the fries are the foundation. The sauce and toppings are cheap, artificial, and way way way too salty. This place is basically MacDonald of poutine."}
{"text":"Breaking News Review - happening right now!

Oh lord, what have I done? I think I shot a man down, and that man being me. Why is it every time someone starts to talk about fries and gravy I blackout and go into eating autopilot only to regain consciousness with an empty box, gravy smeared face and belly full of cheese, gravy, fries and shame? WHY I ASK YOU WHY!

This afternoon co-workers and I began to discuss our favourite after bar delicacies, I mentioned Smokes and 3 people asked \"what is that?\".  Like a punch to the gut my Poutine Hulk began to develop and blacked out into gravy/cheesy darkness.

I have select memories of what occurred over the next hour, but I have flashes of memory like that of a dream (or nightmare). 

....We walked East on Adelaide from John street, and crossed to the north side and entered....

.... I recall laughter a the fact that we were actually doing this for lunch, and shock when somone ordered a large ahead of us, prompting us to order small size....

.....the walk back and subsequent consumption are all a blurr for me (likely due to the 40+C heat outside today).....

....coming too from my Poutine Rage I stared emptily into the waxen box, felt my stomach as if a tiny life form had begun to nest inside (sort of like aliens), and starred at a receipt which reminded me that this had happened at 12:17PM on June 20, and that all it cost me was $8.55 and a little bit of my soul.

Seriously, the poutine during the day is far superior to the rushed slop they pump out in the evenings, my recco is try it out on a Friday for lunch. I say Friday so you can safely head home once the food coma settles in. 

Yawwwwnnnnn, Ok folks, nap time .... Happy Poutine to ya...zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Seacrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Canada is famous for poutines. There are many places that serve poutines, but if you want a quick to go - smoke's poutierie is the place. Since it was Canada's thanksgiving week, I got the thanksgiving style and my friends got the Montreal style. they were both satisfying."}
{"text":"being originally from the ottawa area, i have been lucky to have at all times, a very close proximity to good poutine (and shawarma, for that matter)

now that i live in toronto, i've been scouring the city for good poutine, and groan when people tell me to go to smoke's. 

my problem with smoke's is that it really only caters to the \"i'm hammered and need grease in my belly\" clientele. and their attempts making some \"crazy\" combinations do not address the fact that their base poutine lacks - it lacks good fries. it lacks good gravy that is actually hot enough to melt the cheese. and most importantly, it lacks cheese curds from quebec.

sorry smokes.

i wouldve given you two stars, but i just heard a rumor that a new franchisee is opening one in ottawa. boo-urns."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service but huge demand for one person 11 45 am  they need a staff of two. It took me 15 minutes to wait because four people just ordered before me. If there was one more staff I would be satisfied. The girl behind the counter was patient and we'll mannered but over worked. Dealing with people is never easy."}
{"text":"Why does it say it closes at 3pm today? We just went there at 8pm and they're open late until 3am. There were lots of people inside. The service was quick and good. Had the chili cheese steak and it was yummy. Maybe the other reviewer went on an off day? Or when they just opened? Dunno, my experience was completely different."}
{"text":"As an American I don't get to have poutine as often as I want. So when I saw a place dedicated to the stuff, I had to try it. I was disappointed. As a place dedicated to Poutine, I feel like they should have mastered it. The fries weren't as good as I expected and the gravy lacked flavor and was watered down. A true Canadian pointed me in the right direction for Poutine (KFC) and i'm glad I tried it. Who knew!"}
{"text":"let them eat poutine

:Various:

No this is not the first time I'm trying Smoke's.  Smoke's and I go way back - since the first on Adelaide.

It's not the Quebecois poo-tin I love, it's the downright dirrtttty honkey-tonk, smack-ma-face kind.  I love that too.

They've taken the traditional ingredients to great poutine and added calorie crazed ridiculously good toppings like bacon.  I love bacon.  I love bacon so much I think Canada needs a new holiday - National Bacon Day so that friends and family can gather to eat bacon following a moment of silence to remember the pig.

Over the weekend, after a messy but classy night with my sister, we popped into the Smoke's on Bloor.  She had never tried it. 

It was busy in there - they called number 264 when we entered.  We were number 292.  But they were as speedy as could be and apologized for the wait.  I didn't mind the wait.  I forgot about it, right after he passed me my two boxes.

We shared the bacon poutine (shocker), and the chipotle pulled pork (a personal favourite).

I couldn't tear my sister away from the poutine.  She loved it.  

In the name of bacon.  A-men."}
{"text":"I would give it one star but it taste good so what can you do. A poutine is only as good as the gravy fries and cheese curds and in this case the gravy is lacking the rich brown taste that is common in the deli style of Montreal. I fine the gravy at Smokes Poutinerie has a strong lab type chemical taste. The topping selection here is good, lots of choices but if you are from Montreal, don't bother, it just doesn't measure up.  They are also very inconsistent, sometimes the fries are left over and cold, sometimes they don't put enough gravy. If your specialty is going to be an item like poutine, you should be consistent and the best of ingredients.  This place just simply don't measure up.  I know they are opening location all over the place, that to me is the MacDonald s generation effect. The price point makes it affordable and the MacDonald generation is use to chemical diet."}
{"text":"I've posted more positively about Smoke's previously, but a different location, and some time ago.
I don't know if they've changed something, or if I was less picky before, but the quality seems to have gone downhill.
Real, French-Canadian poutine is made with lovely brown gravy, thick enough to over the cheese curds, but thin enough to dribble between the fries and keep them hot.
When we went to Smoke's, the 'gravy' was gelatinous and goopy AND stayed at the top of the cheese and fries!
It also got cold fast.
The fries are good, the size and the texture satisfying, and served hot, as are the curds- very good!
Too bad about the sauce. You shouldn't be able to see though it!
We went as a family and the teenagers enjoyed it, but everyone over the age of 25 in our group agreed this was not authentic.
(A positive: the meat served on top was good quality.)
Smoke's has taken a traditional dish, delicious on its own when made correctly, and created many variations (as do other poutineries). However, the authenticity of the real poutine, with its lovely curds and gravy, is lost when you pile on strong-tasting and odd combinations of toppings (guacamole and sour cream!). I feel this would be fine on top of fries or corn chips, with chili or something, and calling it chili fries or nachos, but with poutine, you should be able to taste the simple loveliness of the three main ingredients.
I'll save my poutine cravings for when I'm in Quebec."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the poutine here! Given that it was the first time I had visited Smoke's, I ordered something slightly classic, a pulled pork poutine. Very good!Any French-Canadian will tell you that the fries must be hot (to melt the cheese), the cheese should be curds, and the gravy must be hot (again, to melt the cheese). Made fresh, this poutine was a lovely indulgence. And the pulled pork was tender, with a sweet savoury sauce, well-seasoned.
Those of us who know poutine know that this is a food best enjoyed right when made. Getting it delivered means the fries may be soggy because the steam inside the carton does not escape.
Enjoy your poutine on the bar stools here, or in a nearby park. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great poutine!!! I got the traditional, add steak. Out of the way location in a neighborhood that some may feel uncomfortable in, but don't!  Go, you won't be disappointed. Small location with no seating so either plan to stand and eat at their bar or walk and eat which is what we did.  Worth the visit in Toronto. For two poutines (traditional with steak and a double pork) and two waters it was $25.25 and we were FULL! My only issue was the fries needed salt and the salt shaker was not cooperating."}
{"text":"2 people can eat the regular size poutine. Try the bacon-chili-cheese one: simply delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a major poutine fanatic. Ever since I went to an A&W in Alberta, my love for cheese curds, fresh cut fries, and brown gravy has only grown. This place is amazing. 

Small and semi-hidden location but definitely packs a flavor punch. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone, including vegetarians! 

The employees are friendly and eager to please, and your poutine comes out relatively quick. 

Whether you are poutine obsessed like me, or have never even heard of it, check this place out. It would be amazing for any meal, and especially after a night downtown drinking. (Or the next morning, they have a hangover poutine...)"}
{"text":"Da es schon auf Englisch genug Beiträge für dieses Lokal gibt, schreib ich mal für alle Deutschsprachigen, die sich nach Toronto verirren...und das sollte jeder mal meiner Meinung nach! (For the English speaking: my review will be in German for all German speaking people coming to Toronto as everything has been said in the English reviews.)

Kanada-Urlaub war gebucht und überall hieß es, man soll auf jeden Fall Poutine probieren. Dies ist eine regionale Spezialität, die sich aber mittlerweile auch über die Grenzen der kanadischen Provinz verbreiten. Häufig wird dann Smoke's Poutinerie für Toronto-Besucher empfohlen. Um die Ecke unseres Gästehauses befand sich auch eine, also haben wir uns als Take Out an einem Abend Poutine mit zurück aufs Zimmer genommen. 

Poutine sind Pommes, die üblicherweise mit Bratensoße und Käse als Topping serviert werden, aber es gibt mittlerweile auch viele Abwandlungen, so auch bei Smoke's Poutinerie. Wir hatten großen Hunger und entschieden uns für 2 mittlere Portionen - es hätten auch locker 2 kleine grereicht. Von Kanadiern hörten wir zuvor schon, man solle maximal 1x pro Woche, eher seltener Poutine essen, weil sonst der Herzinfarkt sicher sei, und es stimmt. Zumindestens gefühlt. 

Der Laden, den ich hier kommentiere, war sehr klein und wirklich weniger zum vor Ort essen geeignet als für Take Out, so wie wir es gemacht haben. Der Service war sehr freundlich und hat uns als Poutine-Neulinge (bis auf die Portionsgröße) gut beraten. Das Essen war dann auch ruckzuck fertig und wir konnten es mitnehmen. Der Preis war angemessen für die Portion. Und schlussendlich hat es uns gut geschmeckt, auch wenn wir bei den letzten Bissen mit der Menge zu kämpfen hatten. 

Wir haben nur einmal in der Aprilwoche (2016) Poutine probiert, die wir in Toronto waren, daher kann ich nicht sagen, ob es Toronto's beste Poutine ist, aber es war sicherlich lecker und gut und empfehlenswert. Daher 4 Sterne."}
{"text":"i don't have a wealth of experience when it comes to poutine-eating but from the very few occasions that I've had it, this place is pretty gosh darn good! 
my friend and i treated ourselves after going to the gym. what better way to reward yourself after a hard work out than fries smothered in mushroom gravy, sauteed onions, mushrooms, peas & cheese curds (also known as the \"veggie deluxe\"). 
a bit on the salty side but after scarfing it down without breathing (i think holding your breath while eating is good for the stomach abs), my gym partner & i were thoroughly satisfied!"}
{"text":"My first Poutine in canada!! I got the bacon cheeseburger artery clogging beast, but what a tasty fucker this was.  This thing was just curds, fries,  grease meat, gravy piled high. If this thing didn't have the potential to kill you I would totally have one a day. 
PRO TIP: try it but get a small one unless you have magical unicorn diet pills"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good considering I am from LA and we don't have poutine... its very very hard to find! I can't really compare our sad excuse version of poutine that we make at home with WACK cheese to this place.

I really liked the variety and just the simplicity of this wonderfully Canadian dish! :)"}
{"text":"Growing up in Montreal, I have a weakness for poutine..... it's sooooooo good. Finally tried Smoke's after passing by this location many times on my way to Yuzu Sushi Bar (My absolute fav. restaurant by the way!). I tried the pulled pork poutine and really enjoyed it. The pulled pork was sweet and really added to the overall flavor of the poutine. Normally I'm a poutine purist - fries, gravy and curds only but figured it was time to shake things up a little.

I would have preferred a little more cheese. The fries were good and the gravy not bad. I would go again but definitely not as good as \"Montreal poutine\" in my opinion. The portion size is good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"So many poutine flavours to choose from it was hard to decide!! I ended up getting the meal size of the bacon cheeseburger poutine while my friend got the wow size of triple pork. Portion sizes are huge for the largest size, can be shared by two in my opinion! Very filling and lots of meat, while they also have veggie options. Will most likely come back to try other flavours of their poutine."}
{"text":"A poutine specific eatery is just what this city needs. This is real poutine that competes with Montreal style. The poutine options are too numerous to mention here. They also have very good hit digs to compliment your meal. This location is new and clean. Lots of seating too."}
{"text":"The veggie rainbow poutine was great! I definitely recommend it. My sister and I shared a meal size and that was more than enough. The poutine is very hearty, so it'd be a good meal for drinking. The service was also super friendly. I didn't have 30 cents but I was told \"it's okay,\" so when I bought another meal for someone else, I gave a hefty tip."}
{"text":"Right down my alley this eatery. Loved the loaded poutine. Will be ba.ck"}
{"text":"Our 1st try of poutine.  My BFF told me to try it because she likes poutine. Hubby and I entered into this small place with only about 6-7 seats at a counter. The guy behind the register was pretty quick with service until his help came in later. 
I got a snack size bacon poutine for $5.99. It was very filling but sat at the bottom of my stomach for hours.  Made me feel nauseous for a bit.  The sauce was overly salty like eating a month's worth of salt at one seating. The bacon was thin and crispy and also salty.  
Hubby tried the Philly cheese poutine. It tasted better and was less salty than mine. That flavor didn't come as a snack size and Hubby had to buy the Med size which was too much food for him.
We can say we tried poutine but don't plan to have it again. It was too salty, too much fat and too much carbs."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is open til 4am and serves poutine automatically gives it 2 stars. The third star is for the ease of ordering and how fast I went from door to poutine. But no additional star for the poutine itself because I was sadly disappointed!! 
I did not find it delicious enough - we tried an original poutine (which was just fine) and some sort of Mexican inspired one which was not delicious at all. BUT, I'm not sure where else to get poutine at 2:30 in the morning in the FiDi soooo... I'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"Poutine at this popular place is just alright, not the best not the worst. I don't like how salty their gravy is, I had much better gravy in pub joints where they use beef with the gravy. Much more natural than the super salty gravy smokes use."}
{"text":"Oh man... let's just start with the only emotion you have eating this stuff. AWESOME. I'm a Montrealer, and I've had poutine all over that city, this definitely has to be the best poutine in Toronto. The gravy is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me, but that's not to say it's bad, cause it's still tasty. 

This is a tiny little joint, with very limited seating, and when I walked in the line was almost out the door. I thought about leaving, but I'm glad I stuck it out. Despite the 8-10 people in front of me, I was in line for less than 10 minutes, cause this place moves fast! I had enough time in the lineup to debate which delicious sounding variation I would order. Yelp reviews led me to choose \"Country Home\" style, with chicken, onions, mushrooms and bacon. I ordered a small and with a bottle of pop it came to $10.06, which I thought was pretty reasonable. The small was still an abundant lunchtime meal, with tons of each additional ingredient. The chicken was NOT bland as so many chicken poutines tend to be, here it was seasoned with some sort of spice, that was hard to pinpoint with all the other fantastic flavours swirling around. The bacon was crispy and delicious, and the onions and mushrooms were fried up right to that point where they get extra delicious. I can only imagine that the bacon only poutine is equally as heavenly.

If you are anywhere visiting Toronto and find yourself in the entertainment district, hungry for lunch or wanting a late-night snack after the bar, this is the place to go. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First real poutine experience! It was mad greasy and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Oh smokes.
How I do love thee more than a summers day. 
Your fries are so crispy and right temperate.
Your gravy does not shake the curds away.....

tl,dr : Great place. True story."}
{"text":"OK, coming from the midwest we are known for our love of fried food, cheese, and gravy, so poutine is like a wet food dream come true!  I got the double pork with bacon and pulled pork, my BF got the philly cheesesteak with peppers, beef, and cheese sauce.  Each was utterly phenominal - spicey and sweet and salty and crunchy and savory in all the right ways.  I've been trying to gather backers so I can open up my own shop in Minneapolis.  If you want to join me, holla!"}
{"text":"Don't plan on dining in. It seems designed to ensure you won't.

Nice service. Refreshing to see personable people behind a restaurant counter.

Disappointing poutine. I think they are hiding so so fries and mediocre gravy under toppings that distract the tastebuds. 

Not worth the time it will take to work it off on the treadmill."}
{"text":"Good place for late night poutine. I recommend the nacho grande if you want something similar to sisig fries from Senor Sisig in SF.

Just beware that the food can tear up your stomach if it's your only meal for the day."}
{"text":"The staff are the rudest accusatory people you will ever meet.  Do not go here unless you feel like you deserve an unjustified morality lesson from the guy that cooks the fries. Never will I go there again."}
{"text":"Smoke's never disappoints. Amazing poutine as always. I got the nacho one and it was awesome!!! It was so good I forgot to take a pic for Yelp oops sorry"}
{"text":"Omg. Thank you for God for listening to my prayers!  As good as I remember it in Winnipeg...maybe better?  This is the best poutine I have had in a long time, I was concerned that it would disappoint....but it did not!  The best!!  Squeaky curds, fresh fries, and tasty brown gravy..,could not ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Stumbling upon Smoke's Poutinerie was serendipity. After feeling a bit ripped off at Origin's (despite solid food), I walked back through entertainment district still hungry for comfort food and noticed the Poutinerie- and I understand it is a Canadien treasure. The combination of the pulled pork, fries, and cheese curd unfied by the gravey was a mouthful of deliciousness, not to mention the incredible mouthfeel when the three different textures are intertwined.
Smoke's is marketed as a post clubbing, bar hopping hot spot, but for all those craving a local treat, keep this spot in mind and don't forget the Sriracha."}
{"text":"It was great! Don't know if it is the best because its my first time having it!  It was a little crazy in there because of the drunk clubbers! I went at 2am but it was so worth going before leaving Toronto!!!  Took a star off because of the vomit outside and in the building."}
{"text":"I was excited to FINALLY get some late night, post-drinks poutine the other night. I gotta say, I was disappointed. 
I ordered the original, regular ole' poutine, and my friend got the pulled pork poutine. While the pulled pork poutine was delicious!!, i wasn't too thrilled with the original. The gravy was too thin! I like a good thick gravy that sticks to the fries! Tres triste. The pulled pork one could get away with the runny gravy because the taste was so spectacular, all spicy and chipotle-like. Mmmm. 
But really, if you can't make the basic poutine right, then i can't give you more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Its poutine, so that is exactly what you are getting. My struggle is that the fries are pretty soggy and that just isnt my type of poutine, I like when the gravy and other bits are not so overwhelming as to still keep some crispiness in those fries. Is it good? Sure. Is it over the top fantastic? Definitely not.

If you want poutine and you are by smokes by all means try it just dont expect any more than that."}
{"text":"I am an American who does not have much experience with poutine, but it's become one of my favorite dishes. The Blind Pig is quite good and I've tried to make some of my own, but I wanted to try the real deal. I had been waiting for this place to open for months now, and it's finally open! Overall, I've been pretty satisfied. Rob, the owner, is super nice and the staff are knowledgable and enthusiastic about poutine. 

The fries are fantastic, and the curd is quite good as well. Some of the toppings are not great, I'm not particularly fond of the bacon. My biggest issue is that the traditional gravy is a little bland and could use some seasoning, although the mushroom gravy is delicious. For true Canadians who love poutine gravy, it's not quite there yet. But I love this place, and I've been back almost every week since it opened. 

STAFF: 8/10 
FRIES: 9/10 
CURD: 7/10 
GRAVY: 7/10
TOPPINGS: 5/10"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic poutine. You walk in to a very friendly staff, and a wide variety of options. Would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"My first poutine and we loved it!  Cheese curds were the best part, like stretchy and flavorful mozzarella.Tried a bunch of different flavors and liked them all. The ones with meat like philly cheesesteak and country style chicken had plenty of it, they didnt skimp!

Portions are pretty big, everything was fresh. Wish they had this in america!"}
{"text":"When i lived in my small home town much farther north from Toronto, i always drooled at the thought of going there and tasting the food that the BIG city has to offer.  I've moved here recently and to my excitement i can now finnaly try the food that I've only dreamt about. After catching a movie with my brother and his friend, my brother was considering calling it a night. But as a hungry man in downtown Toronto and i am surrounded by all the choices of food on a saturday night,  i said let's go find a place to eat. I opened up yelp for one of the first times and i search for nearby restaurants. As I'm scrolling through the different restaurants my brother says \"Scroll up! What's that poutine place?\" And i said \"I don't know! Let's go find out!\". We walked a block and a half from the scotia bank theatre to this little place above some stairs, noticing the sign for their place which i found neat. Walked in, went to the counter and was greeted with friendly smiles and the anticipation of finnaly  getting to fulfill my dream of trying some Toronto food. And what better food then something as Canadian as poutine! My brother orders and then i order a double pulled pork poutine..obviously I'm excited as I can be at that moment. In under 2 minutes i got my poutine and I'm sitting down just ready to devour this. And did i ever devour it! It was the best poutine i have ever eaten! No question! For any people looking for some poutine this place will not leave you disappointed. I'm looking forward for my next movie venture, because I'm most definitely going to follow it up by coming here again. I'd give it a 5 star if the pop that comes with it was a bit bigger, but that's negligible since I'm there for the poutine which is perfectly delicious."}
{"text":"Can someone help me here? 

Have I missed the point of Poutine completely?

I operate under the assumption that Poutine is supposed to be: French Fries covered in gravy and topped with cheese curds. Served on a plate, or some such horizontal vessel that allows the fries to maintain a relative amount of crispiness while being soaked just a wee bit with the gravy and the cheese curds that are nestled in the nooks and crannies between the fries. Thus maintaining optimal crispiness (otherwise, why are they even deep fried), and contrasting textures.

Am I wrong? Or do I just not \"get\" Poutine?

Or is Smoke's bastardizing what the world believes Poutine is?

While I love creative toppings, I beg one to consider not just the flavour but the texture of the Poutine. Dill pickles cut in strips are soggy and make the fries soggy. Smoked Meat is floppy and adds no texture. And the vertical box traps the steam inside and makes the fries even soggier, so that all I'm left with after many drinks at the bar, is a cardboard box stuffed with something that makes me wonder if I threw up my pre-bar dinner and am now going to eat it.

Two stars for flavour, if you can get past the idea of eating your own vomit. Cuz it's not really vomit, although it looks like it. And the staff are more than patient and friendly with all the drunkards.

Thankfully, booze was invented before Poutine."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I could seriously, not get enough. The last time I went, thank god, it was crap. I had ordered the veggie gravy which was kinda gelatinous and gross. Totally turned me off of the place. Which is great for my arteries."}
{"text":"I was there today with my family.  Food was good, but the place is not wheelchair accessible.  Party foul, Smoke's!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times over the years. I tend to think that the quality of the poutine has a lot to do with the fries, and the fries here are good! The menu is extensive with several vegetarian options. My favourite poutine is the triple pork, despite it being a heart attack in a box!! Not sure what the hygiene is like in this place, I found some cardboard in my poutine the last time I was there (I ate around it. Don't judge me!). Also, the place could do with some updating - the tables are old and wonky."}
{"text":"I give it two stars because at least they used curds of something. I'm not even sure it was real cheese.

The gravy was like glue. The fries were soggy. I'm sorry to all you people who love this place. Your the reason I tried it out. But this is not real poutine. Travel north to find out what real poutine is.

At least it wasn't terribly salty.

Also, a bit expensive... 6 bucks for a little pansy a$$ box of poutine!!! Thats ridiculous! Go downstairs and get a burrito from Burrito Boys instead for that price. At least the burrito will fill you up!"}
{"text":"Awful!! I could make a better poutine at home... $10 for unseasoned beef, snow peas and barely any fries with scattered chunks of cheese and a scoop of gravy, give me a break!! this place really puts the POO in poutine!"}
{"text":"Just arrived in Toronto, hungry and rumpled after another excruciating run-in with United Airways, I tucked in my shirttails and went down the Sheraton Centre Lobby bistro, BnB. I could not bring myself to have another $18 gourmet burger or chopped salad. Somewhere in the back of my mind, a single word emerged like a long lost memory \"poutine\". Fueled by 2 $10 Keith's IPA (tasty) I decided to strike out.

I took a quick, sweaty walk in the record heat and found myself at Smoke's Poutinerie. Tucked away on a nondescript street, Smokes has this weird 80's head banger lumberjack vibe. I liked it. Counter service, cooler of throw back fruity pops and a window into the kitchen where some young dudes were dunkin fries and spinning ladles. Felt good.

Staff was friendly (they are Canadian after all) and even asked if I was American. One had been to Florida, the other to Detroit.

I had the traditional frites with gravy and curds, topped with a scoop of chipotle pulled pork and a big side of sriracha and a cold black cherry pop. So THIS is what Poutine is all about. Yum! On the first fork, I told myself I would never finish it. A couple of minutes later, I was looking for more. Since they are open till 3 or 4 in the morning, I just might go get me some more later."}
{"text":"Smoke's offre la meilleure poutine de Montréal, selon mon humble avis. La qualité de leurs ingrédients est hallucinante et le service est très bon. Le concept de la boîte pour la poutine est excellent puisqu'il propose une solution de transport incomparable tout en concervant la saveur. La vingtaine de variété de poutines sauront plaire à tous."}
{"text":"I've given this place two tries, and I think what makes me not like it is the overpowering rosemary-ish flavour of the gravy.  I just don't like it.  I'm sorry, but I don't.  The last time it was also a bit congealed, which is not very appealing.  Also...could do with more curds.  And hotter gravy so that they actually melt.

I went out on a limb and tried the Nacho Grande version as well, which I thought would be the chili, guacamole, sour cream and salsa in place of gravy and curds, but it was in addition to gravy and curds.  A bit much I think.  

I always want to like this place, but there are just waaay better poutine places out there."}
{"text":"Passed by this place numerous of times, and finally stopped by after a  long night of pub drinking.  As you all can agree to, nothing is better than some greasy fries loaded with gravy and cheese after pub hopping.  So what did I think of it? We ordered 3 different kind - pull pork, sausage, traditional.  It was alright....a bit too salty for my taste.  The sausages were sliced into tiny pieces like bacon bits....why? Pull Pork had an interesting flavour to it. Overall experience - good enough but let's try to reduce the salt a bit."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad.

Although the myriad of options and add-ons sounded delicious, it was too much for me to absorb. There was no consistency or order in terms of their menu layout so I just felt overwhelmed with words and decided to go with the good ol' traditional poutine. 

It didn't take too long for me to receive my order, and for 7$ I can say I enjoyed it. I am no connoisseur, but one thing I do know is that cheese curds should have a lil' squeak to them, and these melted all over. Moreover, a really good gravy should have some umph to it and does not just taste like a salty brown sauce. Lastly, the packaging is different, you get a fold out box with your poutine in it, it's cool and different than most places that serve up styrofoam or tin boxes. My only issue with it is that perhaps the box may leak? But, mine didn't. Phew!

Like I said... not bad."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for my first experience with poutine!!

My friends and I were wandering around downtown Tdot in the cold precipitation of late 2011, trying to kill time before our dinner reservation. A native Toronto-an (?) led us to smoke's poutinerie, and mmm it was just what we needed.

We got the small regular poutine and the bbq poutine. Both were very good. Fries are a weak spot for me, and when you cover it in gravy and cheese curds... ahhhh. I have to say that the BBQ pork was well done, but at the end of the day, the regular was still my fav.

It's pretty small and crowded with nowhere to sit. We leaned over the countertop in our wet jackets and shoes. That would be my only complaint, especially after wandering around in the rain for such a long time."}
{"text":"I've been drooling over the thought of coming here to try their famous poutines and they didn't disappoint! It's practically a box of diabetes masked in oozing heavenly perfection. I regret nothing! Well worth money spent and customers service was lovely. Definitely will be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"Will walk any distance to get here at the end of a great night! (Literally I stumble in here way too often...)

My rules:
-Get a regular poutine, anything additional is overkill!
-Share the poutine. I always imagine myself devouring it like a champ (as I would back at Bubba's where my affection started...) but wake up to a smelly fridge with \"leftovers\" every time.
-Have patience! Have you ever worked at a place that serves drunk food? I haven't, but if I had to put up with all of us (yes, us) coming in at 2am in herds...I would probably be a tad miserable myself. So go easy on them and wait patiently, your box of cheese and gravy with fries will come out faster than you think so you can take it home to your bed and enjoy it with some Netflix, or you know...whatever else you're taking to bed that night..."}
{"text":"Out with the boys on a late night? Looking to satisfy that food itch in a reliable & savoury way? Get your butt to Smoke's Poutinerie. Before we begin, I have to admit that I'm a little ashamed of having not known about this place before a couple weeks ago, despite being a proud card carrying Canadian. Thankfully, I've seen the light and righted my wrongs.

The Smoke's on Adelaide is a small establishment with some pretty hip decor. There's a bunch of art featuring an unsettling number of copies of the face of a man who I can only assume is \"Mr. Smoke\". There's also a chalk board, because everyone likes to revisit chalk board drawing memories from their childhood. Like I said, the space is small so bring one or two friends and leave the whole fam at home.

Surprisingly, the poutine is very good. \"Why is that surprising for a place called a 'poutinerie'\" you may ask. Because with so many franchises, I thought that I'd be dealing with fast food quality food, but that genuinely wasn't the case. The fries, though nothing ground breaking, were light and not over seasoned, leaving room for the gravy, curds, and toppings to do the work. I got the Pulled Pork version, which has fries, gravy, curds, and chipotle pulled pork. What I really appreciated about this was that the gravy wasn't just the predictable savoury, but also tastefully sweet.

Whenever the diet allows for it next, I'm definitely coming back to try out some of their other options. Let me be clear though, this is not the best poutine you'll ever have, but it gets the job done very well."}
{"text":"I came here after Pilates @ Core Studio the other day. 
I know, i know. 
But if i didn't go to pilates, i wouldn't have been able to stuff myself with crazy food like this. 

I got the traditional poutine- fries with gravy, cheese curds and i drenched it with siracha chili which was on the counter. believe me, it made it even better

The portion is HUGE. 
And i got the 'small' order. 
Would have been perfect for 2 people...but for 1. Eeeeks. 

The fries were perfect, the gravy was great...the cheese curds...well, i've never had cheese curds before, so i wasn't sure what to think of it before...but it's like mozarella...but saltier?

OK so overall...the meal was VERY salty. 
I hate salads, but i was craving a salad after this...or maybe i just needed water. 

I liked it, but i really don't think i can stomach another poutine for like a month. eeeeks"}
{"text":"Small size turns into a medium so make sure your hungry hungry hungry! Quick fast food. You're not Canadian if you don't like this :p"}
{"text":"I've had different poutines on their menu - from the traditional to the chicken inferno, pulled pork, philly cheese steak... Smoke's just isn't as great as it is hyped up to be. 

Place is dingy - but the chain goes for the grungy look. 

Food is mediocre. Service is mediocre. The seating is horrible. 

Smoke's .. be it this location, which is the most convenient and the one I've visited the most, or any other locations - Smokes is a last resort."}
{"text":"So, we live in San Francisco. We took a trip to the East Coast, planning on NYC and Niagara. Then I thought, \"well we might as well stop in Toronto too, so I can get some poutine.\"  I asked 4 or 5 different people where to get the best poutine in town since I hadn't visited in a few years, and they all answered \"Smokes!\"

I'm not a fan of the non-traditional options (aka basically what we'd just call chili-cheese fries) and I don't need chunks of meat on my poutine, it's filling enough.  We opted for one large traditional. Two of us couldn't even finish it. Soft fries, thick gravy, and loaded with curds. It was heaven.

Plus the guys working the counter were really nice, and even took my US cash since the ATM next door was broken.

Have I had better poutine in Quebec? Yes. But this is the best poutine I've ever had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came not expecting a great poutine. Was just curious from the recommendations from people. 

Then I sat down to eat. 

The skies parted, the sun shined- oh my it was delicious. 

Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I went more out of feeling I had to try it because I had seen the stickers everywhere for so long. 
It was alright. You know, I wondered for a long time how a shop could sell ONLY poutine. But I see now how and why...that being said I don't see myself going back for a very long time, until a non-Canadian is visiting that I would like to give the poutine experience to. Then I'll go back. 

Worth trying once to see what poutine is like with different toppings (admittedly, we got a regular). Otherwise, I frankly don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff that always serves with a smile and super great poutine that truly does Canadian culture justice! 

If you like your potatoes \"crispy\", I would highly recommend the new line of \"smashed potatoes\" instead of fries because of the increased surface area of potato skin. The gravy is always pipping hot and savoury and the cheese curds melt beautifully in a stringy fashion that epitomizes how poutines should be! The portion sizes at Smoke's are huge and now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever been able to finish a medium sized poutine by myself. If you're a real Canadian, you've likely already had this before. If you're a passing tourist, I would highly recommend you go check this place out (or perhaps any of the other locations because this location doesn't accommodate any seats, just a standing ledge by the windows)!"}
{"text":"Great place when you're craving poutine. Endless options. We chose the chicken inferno because we didn't want the heavy bacon options. It was poutine with jalapeños, roasted red peppers and chicken with a touch of sirachia (sp?) sauce. It was delicious but certainly not healthy. A meal size is enough for two people. 

The actual place itself reeks of cooking grease so be prepared to take our order to go unless you want to eat it and smell like a greasy spoon kitchen."}
{"text":"Went there a while ago. Have to say that I am not a fan of poutine but I still gave it a try and wasn't too impressed. 
Had the pulled pork poutine and didn't like it too much. The poutine just didn't taste natural to me as if it had tons of chemicals in it. Not sure. It was all soggy and bla.....not my thing but it's just a personal opinion.

Won't go back."}
{"text":"Sure, the place tries a little hard, but just as Isaac J. put it, Smoke provides a basic poutine with the classical twists and maybe a little more - probably not worth it. Fine. 

To all the Quebecois out there visiting, you'll find at smoke the equivalent of a La Belle Pro poutine. Nothing too fancy, but always acceptable."}
{"text":"Smokes has been on my list to try for a while... It wasn't worth the wait. it wasn't particularly bad, but it certainly wasn't good either. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else if you are looking for amazing poutine. I will give them credit for being clean and having great imagination in their poutine creations. I can imagine after a late night drinking fest that this would be heaven on earth. I sampled the bacon, chicken inferno and traditional; I enjoyed the bacon the most out of the 3."}
{"text":"Probably not the best poutine I've had, it still beats any dedicated poutinery in Toronto.   For some reason I would much rather have poutine at a restaurant or even NY fries than some of the new poutineries that have been popping up with wild popularity.  
Better than Pouinis, Smoke's is a fair choice.  But not fabulous.  Avoid..or don't.. the drunk crowds.  I'm fairly sure the entire chains of burrito, poutine and falafel places make most of their profit off of nightlife in Toronto.  which says something about the quality of food because when you deee-RUNK.  everything tastes fine..."}
{"text":"well maybe I'm a bit biased because I just looooove poutine, but I love the variety of poutine this little place has.
as a vegetarian I rarely get to have anything except traditional poutine, but this place has deluxe veg poutine (with mushrooms, green peas and onion) and nacho veg poutine (with guacamole, jalapenos and sour cream). 
variety for carnivores is humongous and I don't remember all of them. 
and it's open until 4am during the weekend - which is awesome for after clubbing food stop. 
the only negetive side about the food is I felt like gravy was too salty and the cheese curds not as squicky.
not much seating is available inside so you end up socializing with lots of people outside munching on some awesomeness."}
{"text":"Price and portion are fantastic. I got the pulled pork poutine in the \"snack size\" which is a whole pint of starch, carbs and gravy. The gravy, cheese curds and fries were perfect, the pulled pork was a little too sweet for me. My coworker got the same size but instead of the pulled pork opted for bacon - which I'm tempted to get next time I go.

Staff: There was only one cashier when we went and she was also the cook.... understaffed? Then again when we went around 12:30PM on Saturday and there were no other customers around. I'm sure things pick up around the evening.

Place: Very plaid. Small but clean and organized"}
{"text":"They were handing out coupons for Smokes. But only in the tiny fine writing did it say only this one restaurant. I was so angry when I went into my local smokes and they were also confused and couldn't give me the deal. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"You can't fault the selection or the portions, but I wish their gravy were tastier.  That plus no a/c (at least when I was there last year) will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"I love the still that this place has. It pretty simple poutine and dogs and smokes does a great job at both. They offer a great traditional Canadian poutine"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to smokes gravy but it's lost its flavour and thickness. I got the hog town and the ingredients were pretty good but any good poutine needs good gravy, it's fundamental. Also the prices have seriously gone through the roof. For potatoes and shitty gravy its not worth $10.15. Sorry guys but you let me down..."}
{"text":"Omg super comfort food..if you like poutine you'll love it! Pulled pork and peas!!! The small is usually enough, note it has limited seating."}
{"text":"I agree with other MEH reviews. There's nothing special as it's just another one of those box of heated 'pre-cooked' meat, fries and other toppings mix together combo."}
{"text":"I've only had the triple pork and I found the flavours to be off putting.  It felt like regular hot dog meat boiled, cut up and tossed in with onions, some bacon and pulled pork.  Perhaps it was the bbq'sh sweet gravy that threw me off but it just didn't satisfy my poutine craving at all.  I don't think I finished it either.

Unfortunately, it didn't feel like there was a lot of thought on the ingredients except that they decided to use the same animal... I guess it should taste good right?

I love poutine specialty shops, and I'll be the first to admit I need to try their traditional in order to give a fair assessment, but I'm definitely not excited about it either."}
{"text":"I feel like... this place is really good, I just didn't get the best option for me. All of my friends love Smoke's Poutinerie so I know it's good, but I wasn't a huge fan of what I got. I got the Nacho Grande poutine and it was okay. I didn't really like the salsa they used, but the fries themselves were pretty good. I'm confident I would have liked it more if I got the regular poutine, so I'll give them 4 stars on behalf of my poutine-obsessed friends. The Nacho Grande poutine was 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good to know that Poutine is making its way into the US. Ordered the meal size traditional and I was so addicted to it. I wanted more and more. I also tried the Montreal and that was real tasty too. Can't wait for them to open closer to me, they also have a location in Hollywood area in la which I'll have to visit the next time I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Such bad poutine. I tried Smoke's Poutinerie in Kingston, and wasn't that impressed with it there. I gave it another shot (or maybe two) when I got back to Toronto only to confirm my dislike for their poutine.

You would think it's hard to mess up poutine. It's three ingredients. But somehow Smoke's is able to make poutines with soggy fries, goopy gravy, and not-fresh cheese curds.

Even my drunk self would say no to Smoke's. There are a lot of better options for poutine in the city. New York Fries, Poutini's, Mr. Tasty Fries (a food truck in front of Nathan Phillips Square). Or better yet, hop on a bus, train, or car and head to Montreal's La Banquise =)"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends and tried the cheeseburger poutine. It tasted just like a cheeseburger. I feel like they need more selections. Their flavours seem pretty basic (e.g. Philly Cheese Steak, etc.). I would come back here again though. And the guy who helped us gave us good suggestions."}
{"text":"Review edited and changed 8/12/17

Years ago this was my go to place in Toronto to get poutine, there was also the place on Bloor but they too have gone downhill. My guess is in order to deliver a consistent product they're getting all their stuff from a central warehouse and this always spells a drop in quality. It happened to Lick's, it happened to Tim Horton's and now it's happening to Smoke's.

The fries are still decent. They seem to be fresh cut and the cheese curds are refrigerated so they loose some of the \"squeek\" when you bite into them but they have lost what is possibly the most important part of the poutine which is the gravy.

Before you used to get a nice, hot, thick gravy that had been properly simmered and poured nicely over the fries so even those at the bottom got a little bit on them. What they have now is some gummy overly salted hot mess that stays on top of the fries and never gets more than halfway down the carton. 

I've complained about this before to the manager and directly to the website but nobody seems to care. The message I got from the manager is this is how they serve it and the message I got from the website was nothing. A year later and they haven't responded. 

They've also moved from the Pop Shoppe drinks to standard Coca-Cola. Probably cheaper for them but part of the appeal there was being able to have a Lime Rickey with it. Sorry Smoke's but you've lost a formerly loyal customer. 

Luckily for me there are other places downtown to get this. It just means I need to find them and try them."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to this location but the Dundas one was closed due to renovations. I ordered veggie nachos, and was excited since all my previous visits didn't leave me with any troubles at all. Every time I ordered, the food would be hot and would remain hot until the last bite. However, this time was different. When I received my order, I realized that the box was cold. When I opened the box, the fries and the cheese curds were also cold. If served hot, I'm sure it would have been good, but, since it was cold, it was just disgusting. What made this experience worse was that it was my sister's first time at any Smoke's and after having said good things about it, cold poutine is all she has to go by."}
{"text":"The night staff is really rude I went there twice and both times they would roll their eyes and start whispering as soon as I came to place an order. My friends tell me they feel that harsh behaviour too."}
{"text":"All around disappointment.

Main issues: Fries sauce and cheese were nothing to write home about. When that is what your whole menu is based upon you got a big problem IMO.  It was all pretty bland.

There was one thing that really made me want to go back and complain about. If I don't like the food then I just don't go back, that part is simple, but if I ask out right if the containers are fine for take out and get these flimsy paper take outs and wind up with gravy all over my things I am a little peed off, especially after spending so much on fries and gravy.

I don't think it will last long there."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking around for a spot to eat. When we came across this place. We both heard mixed reviews about the place, so we thought just to try it out for ourselves and see how we feel about it. 

Anyway as we got in, there wasn't much spaces to sit; it is a small restaurant. Since it was my first time here, I didn't even know what to get. And the cashier wasn't much help either. She didn't greet us when we walked in, just looked up. And she basically told us to let her know when we were ready. 

After looking through the options, and there are a lot of options to choose from. We decided to to try Chili Chicken and Chicken Fajita. Chili Chicken comes with grilled chicken, chili, and cheese sauce. For the Chicken Fajita comes grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, onions, salsa and sour cream. 

After tasting the Chicken Fajita, I was so over it. It did not taste good at all. I have had better poutine than this. I don't know if it was the way the girl made it or just in general it was a bad choice. But on the other hand, the Chili Chicken actually tasted really good. 

As for the portions, we got the meal size and it was way too much for us to finish. Since mine wasn't that good, I ate how much I could and decided to throw the rest of it out. 

When you get a chance to visit try the Chili Chicken, it was actually the best one out of the two."}
{"text":"Great poutines made from here. The staff is friendly and answer your questions.  I wish they had bottle coke on top of cans. The WOW size is indeed wow"}
{"text":"This place was the bombdiggity. As an American, I had always wanted to try REAL good poutine. I had food truck poutine previously and wasn't impressed, but Smoke's blew me away.

Cheese curds. Ah, never have I experienced such GLORIOUS cheese curds. Sooo soft and warm and gooey and delicious. My bf and I ordered the steak peppercorn (which was alright) but if I had the lucky chance to go back here, I'd go for the bacon cheeseburger. MM MM MM. 

The name is on the tip of my tongue, but my friends also got this poutine with dumpling-like things inside? That was amazing as well.

Until a Canadian native shows me a better poutine place, Smoke's will be on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Poutine = Canada's version of California's version of Carne Asada Fries

Pretty good if you like to have clogs arteries and don't mind removing a few years off your life.

I had the Philly Cheesesteak Poutine here and they let you order in either a small or regular size.  I got the regular and finished it all in one sitting, but I wish I got the small, because these babies got tons of carbs in them.

I'll give one of Canada's delicacies on a 4 stars rounded up from 3.5 - Probably would've tasted with some ice cold beer to wash it down with."}
{"text":"Poutine is a comfort food and also a \"simple\" dish. I'd say that you can put anything on fries and it'll taste good. I've never had a poutine that tastes bad. But I have tried some that are better than others. Smoke's Poutine is the best poutine I've had simply because they are the only ones that offer a wide range of toppings on your poutine. That and they don't put too much salt. I don't really understand what \"real cheese curds\" are. To me, cheese is just cheese. As long as it's a solid chunk of cheese, I'm happy. I guess \"real\" is to distinguish it from those shredded cheese shards? I don't know what fake cheese is. 

Smoke's poutine is more expensive than other places but that's understandable since they are a franchise with significant marketing. A large poutine with \"stuff\" comes out to be about $12.50 included taxes. But on the bright side, it's pretty massive and can feed 2 people. 

My suggestion is that if you just want plain poutine (cheese + gravy on fries), go to any other place that's not also a burger place. That food truck outside of new city hall comes to mind. I don't recommend places like burger king because they tend to salt the fries too much. But if you want a gourmet poutine, Smoke's is the place to go. 

I'd recommend Smoke's Poutine solely because poutine is a national food. If a foreign friend asks me for Canadian food, I'm going to point them to Smoke's Poutine. However, I'll be responsible and caution that it's really unhealthy and explain that it's just fries + cheese + gravy. It'll taste good no matter where you get it."}
{"text":"Never tried poutine at Smoke's before and doubt I will again. Will limit my poutine indulgences to my periodic visits to la belle province. (Quebec, not the chain)
Back to Smoke's. 3 strikes. The gravy was thin and watery, the cheese curds were in short supply and the fries were terribly undercooked, almost raw. I think the folks at Smoke's that evening had absolutely no idea what they were doing. The poutine ended up in the trash after a couple of bites. Would have given zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"My reaction after biting into the Chicken Inferno Pountine: MEH. 

Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but it was pretty mediocre to me. The fries were standard as well as the gravy & cheese curds. I would've been happier with the meal if I had just gone with that. The quality of the chicken was just poor. It appeared to be pre-cooked cold chicken that is just thrown on the poutine and heated up. I even bit into a piece of cold chicken. Also...I'm a sriracha lover, but it was just too much to be used as a sauce. I also would've enjoyed fresh jalapenos instead of pickled ones to add a bit of freshness/texture. 

I ended up just eating the cheese curds and a few pieces of fries after a few bites of the poutine mix as a whole. I'm sure some of their other options may be better, but I'm not too sure if I'm willing to try it out."}
{"text":"Headed to Smoke's Poutinerie after having boozed and dances the night away down the street at Bar 244.  It was not too crowded but had a few occupied tables.

We ordered the traditional and pulled pork poutines.  The pulled pork is a chipotle pulled pork and was very tender with a hint of sweetness to it.  Both poutines were topped with a generous amount of gravy and cheese curds.

2 stars deducted because the service was slow, a bottle of water costs $1.70 and the fries were just meh. Personally I prefer the poutine at Poutini Poutine House."}
{"text":"Smoke's makes a valiant attempt at bringing poutine into Toronto with nostalgic canadiana flair, but ultimately ends up flat. Props to the relatively nice eating area, the pop shope beverages and the authentic eastern townships cheese curds. But the fries are not right, too thin should be more fluffy and greasy and the gravy needs some serious work as it falls on the bland ho-hum area."}
{"text":"Small location. My date and I walked in for a snack while we waited for our table to open up at a restaurant. We had never ordered snack size before and did not know that it would only get one topping. We got guac as our topping. The wait was long (which is what I've come to expect from my experiences at other locations).

The fries in our poutine were okay. They seemed like they had been sitting for awhile and had that wrinkly look to them. Some of the cheese curds were covered in the hot gravy and hadn't melted. The gravy was good. The guac I wouldn't get again. It was cold and while the combination grew on me eventually, it didn't seem to work in the beginning (the cold guac and hot gravy).

I believe this place would see a lot of customers as they leave the nearby bars and clubs so I wonder why there's such few seating options. Regardless, the service and food seems to keep with the reputation and standards of the other locations I frequent."}
{"text":"Had Smoke's in Vancouver two summers ago and when I heard they were coming to LV, I made a date with cheese curds. Showed up the week they opened and they weren't too busy. Got the traditional poutine and while it was good, it wasn't great. Fries weren't cooked enough and it was a little light on cheese curds for $6.99.  Well, came back a week later or the Smoked Peppercorn and it made up for everything. Perfect fries, excellent Montreal smoked meats, spicy peppercorn gravy and plenty of curds."}
{"text":"Went to Smokes Poutinerie on a whim thanks to a recommendation for restaurants from Siri and it was pretty good. Service was super efficient, place looked nice enough and the bathrooms were even surprisingly clean.

Now regarding the food itself, I got the Italian poutine which I really didn't like as much vs what some of the other people I went with tried. While I do appreciate the generous amount of cheese curds and gravy, the ground beef in that specific blend doesn't really mix well in my opinion. While I would suggest you avoid that specific flavour, you can't go wrong trying some of the other poutine combinations they have here. The food is good, the place is nice and service is quick. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I don't really know how a place that claims to be a Poutinerie can't even make a proper basic poutine.  

Poutine's genius is in its ultimate simplicity.  Gravy, cheese curds and fries, this is all that you need to make a good poutine,  I know that Smoke's has tried to up the ante and has provided a number of unique iterations to classic poutine, but this is all just noise when it can't even get it's namesake done right!  

Just as one should judge a burger place on the quality of meat and not on superflous toppings, we should also judge a poutine place on...well poutine, and the poutine here is awful.

I spent 21$ on two poutines with extra cheese curds, the extra curds cost 2$ per order and you barely get any!.  I'm not sure if they would have even put cheese curds in if I hadn't opted for \"extra.\"  The fries barely had gravy and it seemed as if they had been sitting for quite some time.  I will not be back.  21$ for two orders of fries is a travesty."}
{"text":"The idea of loading fries with a bunch of different meats, toppings, gravy and cheese curds is a cool concept.

But... I found the taste of it all together to be...just okay. 
I had the Philly cheesesteak fries and it all just tasted bland, especially the gravy. I found the fries to be under seasoned as well. 

The fry to topping-gravy-cheese ratio is also completely off. You definitely get A LOT of fries. 

It's pretty pricey too!
Definitely a touristy kind of place."}
{"text":"Not ready for primetime :(

Stopped by \"Smokes\" at 1am on a Saturday. The Clubs hadn't let out yet, so the place was quiet (just me). 

After placing my order (basic Poutine), I watched the next 5 Customers receive 'exotic' orders ahead of me. After 20 minutes I gave up, respectfully I asked for and received a refund. $10 for French fries was probably excessive anyway!

The place is in disarray. Yelpers should skip it (lots of other options on College) until \"Smokes\" gets it right."}
{"text":"Just a FYI. According to DineSafe Toronto, this establishment received only a yellow \"conditional\" pass on the last inspection which was Feb. 1st 2012. They had 2 \"significant\" issues."}
{"text":"I walked in and asked about the gravy.  \"Is it vegan?\"  The woman behind the counter wasn't sure.  She kindly offered to show me the ingredients on the bag of powder they use to make the gravy, and sure enough, there were modified milk ingredients in that ol' bag.  However, she was nothing but polite and gracious about this certainly unexpected barrage of questions from a vegan detective.

I ordered fries, plain, to go.  It came out to a little under $5.  There were more fries than I could eat.  I ate a few and they were crisp and fresh and good.  Pretty well seasoned, but not too much.  I got the chance to dig into them about a half hour later; I was disappointed to find that the fries had already become pretty soggy.  While in a poutine that might be acceptable, I was a little bummed out about it.  

I'm Quebecois and cheap as hell so I ate them anyway of course.  I long for a day where an establishment will cease to use modified milk ingredients in peppercorn gravy powder.  Please, I beg of you - do this one thing.  Then take my money and make me fat.

Anyway.  Not bad.  Staff are nice."}
{"text":"Their poutine is so good!! I admit, I was skeptical because they're a chain, and sometimes autheticity is lost in chain restaurants. But their gravies are delicious (both the original and mushroom vegetarian - in fact, I think I prefer the vegetarian!), their curds are huge, squeeky and generously portioned, and the toppings have all been great! I've tried the chili cheese, original, pulled pork, nacho, and probably a few more and have never been disappointed. I bought a few for friends visitng the area, and they devoured every last bite. Now, Smoke's is always a stop when I'm visiting family in Toronto! Wish we had one in San Diego!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I can honestly say that the poutine is mediocre. They use the squeaky cheese curds which is a plus but the gravy is flavourless. And I also want to mention that although the portion sizes look small, the poutines are quite filling!"}
{"text":"I mean, come on. No night out is complete without a good poutine to wash everything down. I've only eaten at Smoke's but feel like I have an addiction to it. The first time I had Smoke's was sometime in the fall of last year, and I didn't have my second visit until about a month ago. That didn't stop me from talking almost non-stop about Smoke's after that first visit, though. It was like love at first squeaky cheese bite. I love the vegetarian option with green peas, mushrooms and onions. So yummy. I literally think about getting drunk just so I can go order myself a Smoke's and eat this stuff. Seriously so delicious."}
{"text":"* Fun, funny guys working late nights
* Good poutines, would come back. 

I got the double pork with mushrooms. Previously i've only had poutine in new york city and maine. I can now see the appeal in these. I've been told canadians who move to the states will buy mcdonald's fries, kfc gravy, and supermarket cheese to make their own. Guys in the back suggested double pork/triple pork or bacon w mushrooms. I got the double pork with mushrooms, and they were quite tasty. Just normal sized, but i think that's enough for 2-3 people to share as a late night snack. They have so many damn flavors i'd definitely come back for late night grabbing."}
{"text":"When it comes down to Poutine, I'm a traditionalist. I like it plain.
Squeaky cheese curds, hot brown gravy, good fries and that's it. I like mine with the curds slightly melted so the hot gravy is very important. I also like my gravy to be beef based more so than chicken gravy. Just a preference.

So what did I think of the traditional poutine at Smokes? It was alright.
It wasn't as flavourful as I expected to be. I wanted rich gravy and a lot of cheese curds, both took a leave of absence.

I also tried the Indian inspired poutine, forgot the name of that one. It was alright too, just the traditional with a hint of curry. I've had better butter chicken poutine.

Overall, Smokes is a good place for a late night snack/meal after a long exhausting night. The variety is there and it's filling. Although some can get a bit pricey, choices are what keeps em' coming back for more. Last, don't lean on the chalk board wall, it's hard to get it off your clothes... Fail."}
{"text":"The bacon cheese poutine was quite good, no place to seat though and a really poor service from a guy that clearly didn't want us there"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm no poutine expert (as I an out-of-towner who fares from a cheese-curd-deprived-land). But this was ten million calorie goodness in a box. 

I got the Hogtown Poutine (bacon, sausage, mushrooms, grilled onions, plus all the usual poutine deliciousness). I found the consistency of the sausage a bit strange, but everything else was good. All-in-all, a tasty (and relatively cheap) dining experience."}
{"text":"I know they opened their first US location in Berkeley, and I had it bookmarked. Why not try Smoke's where it was founded though, in Toronto? So on my last day, I decided to try it out. I had the Korean poutine. Besides gravy and cheese curds, it also came with flat-iron steak, sambal (hot sauce), Korean BBQ sauce, and green onions. The first few bites were good, but after a few more I was done. It was too heavy."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about poutine for a long, long time, yet somehow I've never been able to get my grubby little hands on some.

That all changed when I visited Toronto this past weekend; one of my imperatives was that I simply had to try it.

On a recommendation from a friend, we hit up Smoke's, and boy oh boy what a recommendation it was. 

Now, I would have given this five stars, except I have no qualification to say \"This is as good as it gets\". Being my first and only poutine, I can't rightly say that yet. I want to, but it wouldn't be fair.

Still, this is incredible food. The fries were appropriately cooked, the gravy was delicious but not overpowering, and the cheese curds were flavorful. 

I opted for the \"Mama's\"-style, which also had peas and chicken. The chicken was moist and they were very generous with the portioning. My girlfriend got the curry chicken; traditionalists will of course cry foul, but it was tasty. 

Poutine is something that I can't imagine anybody not liking. It's not exactly healthy, but then most things this delicious and comforting rarely are. If you're in the mood for poutine, and you're lucky enough to be near a Smoke's, I highly recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, free stickers, nice employees. I got the Double Pork (bacon and pulled pork) and I'm really happy with it. It's not the healthiest place to eat, but as far as poutine goes, Smoke's is one of the tastiest."}
{"text":"Poutine is ridiculous....I had the cheeseburger meal size and still didn't finish it...my girlfriend had the Philly meal size and didn't even come close....we even had the munchies when we arrived...they serve it in to go containers for a reason...it's a must try especially after a night on freemont!!!!!"}
{"text":"Brutal.. Person working was by herself handling cash with her bare hands, then grabbing raw fries... Serious Health inspection needed. 
Fries tasted terrible, cheese was minuscule.. Just disgusting... These franchisees need to pull head out of ass or the \"brand\" this company is seeking will go into toilet."}
{"text":"I flew into Toronto and had Poutine on the the brain. Called up a friend and he said let's head to Smoke's. When I got there and looked at the menu I was overwhelmed. Do I get the bacon or the mushroom? or do I remain a purist? I decided to remain pure...who needs all that other junk. Poutine is awesome and a star on it's own.

Smoke's is a cute little place. It's functional with a few stools and an ordering countering. I decided to remain a purist and got the regular style poutine. I loved that the french fries were fresh cut, the gravy was divine and the cheese curds were the perfect size with right amount of squeak. OMG! I was in heaven! 
If I ever make it back to Canada my first stop will be at Smoke's for some of that awesome poutine."}
{"text":"Meh. Not impressed. This is based on the curry chicken poutine. Chicken was luke warm and super dry. Not to mention no curry flavor. The poutine itself was average. The fries weren't even that good."}
{"text":"Very good. Met all the expectations I had. It was a solid poutine with salty gravy, hardy cut fries, and melty stringy cheese curds. I got the chicken inferno. It was very good and had just the right amount of heat so that it didn't mask the poutine flavor. Definitely want to come back and try them all !!"}
{"text":"I came here because of my Canadian roots. This place is for sure a chain and I first tried it in Toronto. If you plan on getting poutine, you should consider consuming about 5 minutes after preparation. This will give it adequate time for the cheese curds to melt.

The poutinerie is authentic to the ones in Canada. They have all of the classics, including country gravy and cheeseburger. The staff is very helpful when answering questions and are willing to go the extra mile to ensure your poutine experience is awesome. We sat outside and the staff checked on us a few times, even though they were prepping to close. 

Out of all of the poutines I've tried at Smoke's, I feel like nothing beats the traditional poutine. The cheeseburger poutine was peculiarly similar to Sonic's chili cheese cony. My last comment is that this food did not quite provide a good bang for the buck. You can get Jones soda and they've got a new flavor each month!

I'll be back in the future for a drunken snack, when I don't quite care about value or quality and I am just looking for a cool atmosphere to sober up."}
{"text":"So here goes the story...

I had a 10-hour layover in Toronto but didn't check places to go beforehand. So once I landed, I asked a friend's Canadian friend online for poutine recommendations in Toronto and this place was the one that he suggested. 

I walked in, the place looked like another fast food place. I considered finding another place to go but I didn't have internet access to check yelp for other options. So I decided to give it a try and asked the girl behind the counter for some recommendations. Their menu is huge and full of things that are far from the traditional poutine. I could see why people would come here- lots of options, including good vegetarian options. I wanted to be close to the traditional but also wanted some meat. She recommended getting one with bacon and pulled pork (double pork- yes!!!). 

Poutine came in a take-away box. It was a good size. Lots of meat on top. The taste was OK but not great. I think the gravy ended up mixing with the sauce on the pulled pork and tasted a bit sweet, so I wasn't a fan of that part. Cheese curds were more rubbery than I had before. Because the container was deep, more than half of the fries were swimming in gravy and they ended up being soggy- also not good!!

This was definitely not the poutine experience I was hoping for. I wish I had done my homework and looked for several options beforehand. This could definitely be a place to visit when you are drunk at 2 a.m. in the morning but it wasn't what I wanted to have on my first trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Food is a serious problem for the homesick Montreal exile.

Although our hometown hosts Michelin-rated establishments , that's not what hits the reptile brain. No, it's the holy trinity: bagels, smoked meat, and poutine. Fifteen years ago, the Canadien errant would just have been out of luck. Fed-Ex and good friends back home could satisfy the bagel and smoked meat cravings, but  poutine needs to be hot and fresh, and the few Toronto establishments that attempted it submitted attempts so inadequate that the ex-Montrealer knew better than to bother.

That's changed now that poutine has inexplicably become a Toronto trend - but Montreal purists should beware. Toronto poutine may be a worthy dish on its own merits, but it probably won't  satisfy yearnings for La Belle Provence. 

Smoke's poutinerie is a case in point.  It offers many variations on the classic dish - chicken, pulled pork, guacamole. Their fries are very good: made of Yukon gold potatoes, soaked overnight, cooked so they're crisp but not greasy. They use real, fresh  cheese curds from Quebec. The gravy is carefully-balanced, home-made, and  tastes of fresh herbs and real meat stock. If you had never had a Quebec poutine before, you would probably deem this significantly better than what's on offer at Lafleur's. Objectively, it is. But if you're a homesick Montrealer, it just isn't quite right.

The curds are fresh, but they're too small, and there should be more of them (ideally, a forkful of poutine should be a glutinous mass you can barely lift out of its grease-soaked container.) But the real problem is the gravy. It's good gravy. I would love it on turkey or a hot chicken sandwich. It just isn't quite right. I don't know what makes real poutine gravy taste as it does - probably some horrible combination of unhealthy chemicals and a life-threatening amount of fat and salt. Smokes's isn't it.

Oddly, the most authentic poutine I've had in Toronto is at Stampede Bison Grill in Parkdale, which uses vegetarian (!)  gravy. Smoke's makes a good poutine, has friendly staff, offers good value, and is perfect for the bar-goer who needs a good concoction of carbs, grease, and salt to soak up the evening's alcohol. It just won't satisfy the Montrealer fixated on home."}
{"text":"Awful place. I was verbally and physically assaulted by one of their staff members recently. This young girl working the establishment went completely nuts and started screaming at us out of nowhere, followed us out onto the street shoving us and screaming, we had to call the police.

I'd been coming here a long time despite the disgusting excuse for poutine that they serve because it's still, by a very sad definition, poutine, but no more. Get your people in order."}
{"text":"Great poutines! There's so many choices and options! Three types of gravy for each style of poutine, your choice!

They have the traditional (which is exactly what the poutine is all about), then Philly cheese steak poutine to a fajita poutine, chicken chilli to bacon cheeseburger!! Seriously great options. 

Hanna looked after my buddy and I and made our visit the best!! Special shout out to her for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"So the poutine is pretty good... but it would be nice if i could actually get in to buy the poutine...  hours posted say it's open until 11 and been twice where the doors are locked at 10, change your sign, or stay open"}
{"text":"Even as I write this, I think I'm barfing a little in my mouth.

Everyone goes through those moments in their lives where sometimes you think you're crazy.  The proliferation of Smoke's outlets has caused my own personal, \"WTF, what the Hell is wrong with everyone?!\" state.

Have people forgotten what good French fries taste like?  Do people not know that gravy shouldn't be sweet or glossy and transparent looking?  I mean, I could understand people not being familiar with the fact that one of the things that signifies great poutine is cheese curds that \"squeak\", but come on, seriously, Smoke's???

So, I have tried multiple locations, just to make sure it's not just this one, and sure enough, they are ALL this bad.  [holds mouth closed;  cheeks expanding]

Where do I begin?

The fries - soggy, too starchy, not seasoned separately - really, how hard is it to make good fries?

The toppings - uninspired, of poor quality (bacon is simply gross), no squeak to the cheese curds

The gravy - what can I say other than \"ew\"?  You don't make gravy with corn starch, which is obviously what they use as a thickener, and the fact that it's the colour it is should be a red (or light brown diarrhea-ey) flag to anyone who comes here.  Gravy made from real beef stock should be dark and rich, gravy from chicken or vegetable stock should be light brown, but NOT TRANSLUCENT like this slime is.

People need to stop eating at this chain so that better places can take their spots.  Trek westward to Poutini's House of Poutine if you want better, or even walk over to the nearest KFC, Harvey's or Burger King, for that matter!

[full on barfing]"}
{"text":"This is such a fantastic franchise. I ordered the 3 pork poutine. The container was jam packed with a mountain of fries, curds, bacon, pulled pork and Italian sausage. For $7.99, this is one hell of a deal. Quality ingredients, quantity and it taste amazing. Rich gravy, cheese that squeaked, tangy pulled pork, spicy sausage, and that bacon... it wasn't that mostly fat type, but all meat. Service is stellar and the actual store is pretty cool. Calgary needed a great poutine place and it looks like Smoke's is going to fill that need."}
{"text":"The poutine is fine but this location is run down and dirty with unfriendly unmotivated staff.  I was the only customer in the restaurant this afternoon and there was a fly in the malt vinegar.  I asked if there was another bottle of vinegar and the girl behind the counter simply threw the bottle away and said 'we don't have white vinegar,' not acknowledging the FLY in the vinegar.  Would not dine here again as concerned about cleanliness."}
{"text":"ive had smokes poutine at a diwntown location and it wasnt that good. not sure why but the pouyltine ended up bland.  however this location was amazing.  maybe its the staff that was making it.  i got the veggie poutine and it was actually amazing to my surprise.  great food to go with drinks on a night out.  also had leftovers the next day and it wasbt bad.  pretty straight forward transactional service.  not bad.  quick eats.and satisfied:)"}
{"text":"Really good poutine for downtown.  I got the traditional around $6 not bad for the amount you get.  I will  stop by again for sure."}
{"text":"We couldn't leave Canada without eating poutine and stumbled upon Smoke's after walking around Toronto.  The boyfriend and I opted for the nacho libre and the Philly cheesesteak poutines, both in the meal size.

The cashier was friendly and the poutine was done within minutes.  We dined in and the poutine that we ordered was good, but nothing really \"mindblowing.\"  I did like the cheese curds (you can only get that type of cheese in Canada) and the gravy was tasty.  The toppings were a little bit too generous because it took away from the taste of the actual poutine.  I had a feeling that I should've gotten the traditional but decided to be adventurous."}
{"text":"you will feel really fat and heavy after eating this.

The fries are not really good, it's soft, no texture, the cheese is not squeaky or melty. the gravy is ok but not enough. it's just a big huge pile of grease. I know, what was I expecting? it's a poutine after all. It's just not a good poutine! I'd rather get a poutine from KFC... this place is overpriced also."}
{"text":"My first poutine in Toronto and it compared very poorly with La Banquise in Montreal.
I asked for a recommendation and the pulled pork poutine was suggested.  That's what I ordered.
First off the fries weren't fresh cut.  If the basis of your specialty are fries, why use frozen.  The fries also seemed underdone.  
They weren't busy.  There were only two of us there and I was the only one there when I arrived.
Secondly, the pulled pork seemed to have been sitting around for quite a while.  50 % of the pork was dry and tough.  It also seemed overly salty.
Now I know barbecue dishes can be salty.  I eat a lot of barbecue here in Toronto.  But it just seemed to be the leftovers.  
It was 8:45 when I ordered so maybe an excuse was that it was the end of the day.  But you know, I was really looking forward to this.
I don't think I'll go back.  I'll even go so far as to say that I will avoid this mini chain.
Colour me let down."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't like poutine?  I don't know... French fries, cheese curd and gravy.  That is the basic.  Then add the toppings listed on the menu.  So the bacon cheeseburger poutine is fries, curd, gravy, cheese, hamburger and bacon.  Puke.

It was very very heavy.  I won't take a star away for the fact that I am not their target market, but just go there knowing that.  

I did take away one star because it was very grimy, the bathroom was sick, and if you have a stroller good luck - there are a set of death stairs with a door at the top...it was a miracle we made it."}
{"text":"Got a few recommendations from the staff working at the CN Tower to visit, so I stopped by with my friend on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Basically poutine is fries, gravy, cheese curd and whatever meat you desire on top. 

The cashier was super chill and made small conversations with us before we ordered. I got the hogtown which includes sausage and bacon while my friend got the chili cheese with bacon and OMG they were SO bomb. The portions are huge and the carry out box seemed like it weighed 2 pounds. Definitely ordered more than we could finish, so if they let, get the snack size! I felt like I was going to have a heart attack 20 minutes into eating my meal, and I couldn't even finish half of it! 

Smoke's is open lateeee, perfect for drunchies!!

If you're ever in Canada, try poutine!!!"}
{"text":"My assessment of this Stand-up Counter Dining Poutine experience is actually a positive one.  My prior Smoke's experience at the sit-down at the Adelaide location was less spectacular.  It all had to do with the selection fo Poutine IMHO.

Back when I was younger, I thought Harvey's Poutine was very good and the most common place to enjoy it for the everyday John or Jane and probably still is since it's easier to spot a Harvey's than a Smoke's.  

Back when I was young, I went to Smoke's while it was new and thought WOW.  Novelty Poutine with so many choices.  Why not choose Pulled Pork or Prime Beef.  That experience kept me away from Poutine for awhile.

This time around while giving an American Friend a taste of Poutine, we chose Traditional Poutine($5.49) to share and it was delicious with a savoury Gravy that comes HOT with good consistency which melted most of the Cheese Curds.  We could barely hold myself back to share with my Friend.  Sometimes, simpler is better.

Some Cheese Curds didn't melt at the bottom but that's because there was just a whole plate-load of those Curds almost as much as there is Fries.  Who would complain about excessive Curds?  The standing counter overlooking the Trash Containers outside the window gave another element of Poutine being a peasant food rather than Business Formal."}
{"text":"I LOVE POUTINE. Was so excited to find a poutinerie while on a work trip in Toronto.

I had traditional poutine because I just had lunch and didn't want anything too crazy. Boy was it yummy. The gravy perfectly complemented the fries and cheesy delicious curds.

Wish we had these in the States so I could come back and try every flavor!"}
{"text":"A lot of hype for soggy fries...I don't get it...

Apparently not so sanitary conditions as well...City of Toronto gave them a conditional pass...yep, thats a yellow folks!"}
{"text":"Worst Poutine I've ever had!

This place is terrible; I will even go as far to say A&W makes a better Poutine!

I came here with my sister on a trip up to Calgary and was so looking forward to an authentic Montreal Poutine. Instead what I found was a crummy franchise hell flavorless mess. 

There was little cheese, the fries were only partially cooked (raw potato parts), and the Montreal smoked meat disappointing. I'm not so sure I believe it's even from Montreal. I've had Montreal smoked meat. 

What's more service was terrible; 8pm on a Friday night (they are open till 11pm) and all the chairs were put away so the only place to sit was a small counter near the door where the -16C draft would blow in freezing everyone inside this seating area. 

Lastly seeing all the stupid social media posters and over the top marketing was disheartening. This place  spends all their money on ad agencies rather than on quality ingredients and proper staff training. 

Don't go here. Save your money!"}
{"text":"The scene wasn't pretty.  I rolled out of bed one hungover morning (ok, early afternoon) and seeing the cupboards empty, I decided to get dressed and further pollute the system with something awful.  Cue Smoke's Poutinerie.  
  Hailing from an awfully small northern town, I'm familiar with the cuisine of our fair sister province.  I even pronounce it properly, if that adds to any cred.  So, I deem myself a fair judge of a good poutine.  This, unfortunately, did not add up to expectation.  Maybe if the visit went down the night before, this would be a four star report.  But, alas, Smoke's, your poutine did not hit the mark.  
  My first visit with this line up was sometime ago, while, after a long day of hustling art in Trinity Bellwoods park one fall,  I spotted their chip truck parked not far from my tent.   On this occasion, my needs were only just met.  This second visit, I can hardly say the same.  After hobbling home, I landed, fork in hand, ready to dig into some dirty poutine, ripe with pulled pork, a fine sampling of cheese curd, and gravy.  And so I did.  Amongst my digging about, I was hoping to find the sort of poutine I've been missing since having moved here to Toronto.  I hit the bottom corner of the carton, dissappointed.  The potatoes were a little undercooked, the gravy, a little bland, and the whole ordeal, a little underwhelming.  
  I tossed it out.  
  And, then I had a nap.  
  Not exactly an ideal afternoon, however, there is always next time.  
  I don't think I'll be back.  
  And, so?  The hunt continues. .."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for poutine in the GTA

My buddy brought me down and had me try the pulled pork poutine which was quite good. 

I am not a huge pork guy but still polished off the box of poutine

The quality is much better than the few other places I have tried in the GTA and while it is not as good as some MTL spots it is definitely one of the best in all of the GTA

Update: Tried the regular poutine and it does actually rival some MTL poutines. Menu is outstanding I just wish I had a location closer to my house so I could try more combos without having to drive downtown"}
{"text":"This chain-style fast food poutine spot that serves different kinds of specialty poutine was just okay. I went to order the bacon cheeseburger poutine in the smallest size and was told it only comes in the medium size. Okay...that seemed weird to me but I went with it. The menu didn't indicate anything about certain types of poutine only being available in certain sizes. The guy at the register wasn't too friendly or helpful. The poutine itself was good, it had a lot of ground beef and bacon, but it came with regular (watery) gravy rather than the listed cheese sauce. It was hot and everything seemed fresh. I would definitely try a different place next time. To be honest, I've had versions of this non traditional poutine in Michigan that are much better. It's also overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Definitely one of those foods you regret in the morning but feels so good to chow down after hitting up thee 'ol boozeroony at 2 am. The poutine is much better than most other establishments, if a pig in a box is what you want, that's what you'll get there. Pretty fresh, not too salty, tons of options. And always an interesting experience meeting some of the characters of the night."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying poutine so I don't have much to compare it to but I really liked what I got.  But then again, how can anyone mess up cheese, gravy and fries?! 

I shared the Bacon Poutine and the Pulled Pork Poutine with the boyfriend and I ended up liking the Pulled Pork Poutine more because it was juicier and had more flavor. But overall, both were pretty good and I didn't feel like I needed to use ketchup at all.  The portions are HUGE and very well priced. I definitely had to walk a lot afterwards because I had extreme food coma and I also needed to redeem myself from what I just did to my body. Service was good and very quick.  There are many choices to choose from (pork, chicken, beef, vegetarian and etc.)  I would definitely come back! Wish they had a place like this in the US!"}
{"text":"Not your typical poutine. They try to get a little too creative sometimes and don't have the goods in the gravy department. It is a good spot to go get some more interesting fair food type poutine (like the meat loaded ones which are actually really good)."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm missing something. Just got in from NY and saw this as I was riding on the streetcar, gravy, cheese and fries some of my favorite things--of course it would be my first stop!

Bathroom is downstairs and clean, limited seating but empty when I came at 12:30 on a Thursday afternoon.

Service was cool, helpful, friendly and prompt.

Now to what you have been waiting for, the poutine! It was meh. My impression from someone who has only had this dish once before is that the fries weren't quite done, they tasted really potatoey, if that's possible. Thought they could have been cooked a little longer. I opted to get the pulled pork on my fries and I doctored up after first tasting with salt, pepper and vinegar...it probably didn't need the salt but I thought I would try.

Would I try poutine again--heck yea, from this place?--not too sure. Underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I'm so pumped that Smoke's Poutinerie has come to Calgary after having such successful franchises across the Country. I'm mostly super excited because I live right near by this unique location; I haven't seen anything in this spot since I moved to the area 7 years ago! (It's tucked in behind where Tilted Grill used to be)

I've only had the chance to try a couple of the dishes, but the menu looks pretty good and both of the things I've tried have been really yummy and filling (Chicken Peppercorn and Mama's Poutine). 

The shop is cute, the hours are great and the price is right. The staff are also super nice, almost hilarious in their chill cool dude style - all of them are cute shaggy customer service pros and those are my kind of people.

I'm still a fan of The Big Cheese Poutinerie, which is like a 5 minute walk from here, and I hear through the grapevine they've been competitors across the nation. I personally have nothing but love for both of them, so check it out!"}
{"text":"I love poutines! Obsessed and to have a store dedicated to them, works for me:) 

They place is not only great for carnivores but vegetarians too. The aroma of the place gets you even more hungry for your order haha. 

Tons of diff styles of poutine, a good few for vegetarians too and they usually add any extra topping if you want. I ordered the Nacho one. It was so good! It had salsa, sour cream, guacamole, jalepenos and a mushroom based gravy. 

The boxes come in 2 sizes, I believe the smaller one is $7/8 and the larger one is $11-12. The smaller box is filling enough, unless your sharing or really starved, then opt for the larger box."}

He then apologized and charged us for a different item. Yet again. We corrected him yet again and my girlfriend had to go as far as showing him on his menu what we were ordering.

We were so disappointed by the purchase that we decided to go eat the fries in front of the cb2 across the street instead of eating the food at the smokes poutinerie."}
{"text":"My second time having poutine. I was craving it ever since the first time I had it, in Montreal (which is where, I believe, it originated). Being from the States, I was slightly disappointed to find that very few places in Toronto served this characteristic Canadian dish and I had to walk quite far to find it. But was worth the effort.

After being introduced to the menu by the friendly clerk, I decided in just a tradition poutine, without any extras. Just gravy and curds on top of french fries. It was everything I could have hoped for. 

HOWEVER!! The dude never asked me what size I wanted, and gave me a huge portion! Being that I only intended this as a snack before my arranged dinner later in the evening, I was a little pissed off. Plus, it cost more for the larger one, of course. 

Otherwise, there was a large chalkboard in the small, fast-food style establishment, creating potential for fun (or vandalism?) if you go with a group of friends. 

Anyway, l just be sure you specify what size you want, and then bask in poutinous glory (hey, if the restaurant owner can make up a word, why can't I?)"}
{"text":"I've looked far and wide for a poutine place in the States that can compare to what Smoke's puts out and sadly I've yet to find one. I'm sure Quebecians will judge Smoke's more harshly as they should, but for a poutine deprived soul such as me, Smoke's is a godsend. 

I think the biggest weakness in American poutine would be the cheese curds. There's really no substitute for those soft and gooey curds. The Chicken peppercorn was what I ordered and for the life of me there's not a thing I'd change about it. Word to the wise though, eat as much as you can fresh. Leftover poutine should only be a last resort drunk food."}
{"text":"meh, i tend to go to burrito boys downstairs. so i thought hey let's try this. 

wasn't amazing like i expected. good but not amazing, i like my cheese curds more melted. a small is good for sharing between two people. i only tried the original."}
{"text":"For a poutine, this is REALLY good!
I'm not a fan of fries/fast food but I HAD to try this, especially after all the hype and the increasing pressure from my friend. 
Yeah, a Canadian that doesn't enjoy poutine? Who am I?

I came here after I left my name down at snakes and lattes and I was surprised at what a small store this was.. I would've expected it to be huge because I would imagine it would get super stuffy and claustrophobic in there. 
The girl was very smiley and friendly even when I took awhile because I don't know the menu well. 
I had a snack size pulled pork poutine and the pork was delicious! I don't like pork (yeah sorry for the pickiness, don't have dinner with me) but it was amazingly flavoured, thorough taste throughout and it pretty much melted in my mouth. Loved it. 
The cheese is chunky - some may be a fan of that, but I'd prefer melted down cheese. Not complaining that much though because it's not that big of a deal. 
Snack size was enough to fill me up even though the price is pretty steep for what you get. 
The tables were kind of sticky and seating was uncomfortable. Good thing many people weren't eating there. 

Not bad though, not sure if I'd go back but those are for personal taste reasons, not because the restaurant is bad!"}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe. Everything is so upbeat here, the red and black walls, cool rock music playing, so all in all a good ambience.

So, coming to the food. I had the regular poutine with veg gravy. The fries were good but the gravy was of a very thin consistency and it lacked flavour. I was disappointed but I thought of giving it an another go. So, I came back a week later.

I ordered the veggie deluxe poutine which comes with the caramelized onions, mushrooms and peas and veggie gravy and cheese curds, obviously. Once again the gravy was too watery. It was like a soup or broth rather than a gravy.

Will find it hard to come back."}

{"text":"FACT:  Poutine is one of Canada's national food groups.
FACT: I am Canadian.
FACT: I hate Poutine.

But I do love fries, and I love things on my fries.
So in a late night Doctor says \"you can't eat after midnight\" walk around Downtown T(dot)O (dot) to find something to fill me up I stumble into a Poutine place.

Why on earth would i do that? For fries and stuff on my fries of course!

The fries at Smoke's are golden yellow fluffy on the inside and the perfect crunch on the outside. In the world of 'fast food' fries they come close to perfection. So I don't know why people want to muck them all up and put gross gravy all over them.  But I guess that's how we Canadians are, and judging on how many people ahead of me asked for extra gravy I'm going to just assume if you are into that sorta thing Smoke's Poutinerie gravy might be pretty tasty.

All is not lost though my yelping friends. Because here they pretty much put anything and everything on, or should I say in, Poutine.

I ordered a small which made me miss the USA because it was the size of my face.  I asked for the pulled pork (which totally hit the spot) and added peas.....and cheese curds of course!

\"no gravy please\"

\"no gravy?\"

\"no thank you\"

\"we have veggie gravy you know\"

\"no thank you, no gravy\"

I paid with a Canadian bank card as to say 'it's ok I'm still Canadian.'

The staff was friendly and the place was full...... I left with my big box of fries, pork, cheese, and peas, and walked back to my hotel happy to dig in.....and well I can't complain. It was some cheap, good, solid, stick to my  arteries, fill up my belly, late night dinner."}
{"text":"I've gotten poutine here a few times and I've only ever come here out of desperation as I wanted to a) satisfy my poutine craving as there were no other poutineries nearby and/or b) needed something to counter all of the drinks that I've had at some nearby bar. The poutines as a whole were just gravy covering melting cheese curds and stale fries. That was really it. I once ordered a vegetarian poutine expecting to get peas with them (as shown in the menu) but they were not there..."}
{"text":"There is nothing like a good poutine with classic ingredients, my favourite part has always been the cheese curds. Even tho this place is considered a fast food place, the poutine is very good. 

I always get the same thing when I come here, the large classic poutine. There are a few other choices but the text of a good poutine is not how well you can make it different but how well you can keep to the classic recipe. Because it may seem easy to make a good poutine but it should not be. I like that the fries are hand cut here and that there is care that goes into the gravy. 

I have been here many times and have always enjoyed the poutine I de finely see my self coming back several times."}
{"text":"I have been to many of these locations all over the GTA. I recently just visited this location as they have remodelled and are under new management. 

While I am an avid fan of the traditional poutine, Smoke's has open me to the various ingredients. Among my favorite is the Hangover, Nacho Grande, Chili Cheese Bacon, and Bacon! What a wonderful idea to add other great ingredients to a poutine.

The staff is very friendly, the service is fast, and the new restaurant looks great. The decor and music is so appropriate as it made me like the place more.  I recommend this location highly."}
{"text":"It's a sad day when you've experienced better poutine in Boston, MA than in Canada, but that's what happened here. My bff and I rolled up on a Friday night after driving from Buffalo over to Toronto. She had never tried poutine since she's a vegetarian so I had looked through Yelp for a veggie poutine and landed here. Meh is pretty accurate as the poutine was nothing to write home about. Tasted pretty bland and the fries were bad in a \"these have been sitting a while\" kind of way."}
{"text":"How can you not love fries, cheese and gravy? Smoke's Poutinerie goes just a bit further by adding a bunch of other yummy ingredients into the poutine, and makes it that much better. 

I would have to say, I always have to share it with another person because one person alone just cannot put that much calories into their mouth. There are also so many different varieties that I am always tempted to go back to try that one that I didn't get last time. Been here many times and still haven't finish trying the ones I have on my \"to try\" list. 

I would have to say, my favorite so far is the Nacho Grande. 

A suggestion to the restaurant: please post up some nutritional value information in your restaurant or on your website! I know it's not exactly very healthy food, but I just want to know how bad it is!"}
{"text":"Smoke's never fails to make me feel so disgusted after a meal...and I can't help but enjoy it.  

Their portion size is huge.  The gravy and toppings are piled on to the brim.  The price is reasonable enough for you to drop the money on a box of sodium, calories, and regret.  

This place is NOT the place to go if you're dreaming of the perfect Canadian poutine.  This IS the place to go to if you're a disgusting human being like me with a vacuum for a mouth, an insatiable appetite, and a case of self loathing."}
{"text":"So gross. I couldn't eat much of it. 

I honestly think this place has ruined poutine for me."}
{"text":"I really hope they add poutine to the Canadian national anthem, because I'd pledge allegiance to it every day. 

Pretty much the country's greatest export, next to Wayne Gretzky and Degrassi. Smoke's will set the bar high, with a wide variety of menu options, and a ton of locations throughout The Six!"}
{"text":"Smoke's es uno de los restaurantes de poutine más reconocidos en Canadá. Vale la pena visitarlo todas las veces que puedan (y les permita el hígado). 

Tienen una amplísima variedad de estilos de poutine: cerdo, panceta, pollo, salchicha y hasta opciones para vegetarianos. Si tienen dudas en cuanto a los tamaños, siempre pregunten o hagan que les muestren la porción. Como regla general, las porciones son más grandes de lo que parecen. Los precios están bastante razonables, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta esto último (alrededor de 8 CAD). Mi poutine preferido es el de panceta. :)

No me gustó la atención que recibí, al menos en este local en Adelaide ST. El personal era lento y no muy amable. Además, no tenían muchas ganas de explicar nada que les preguntabas. 

No se olviden de pedir unos stickers de recuerdo cuando se vayan."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. Although, the poutine is good but for a restaurant which has built its back bone on poitine, needs to be a bit better.  The onions were completely burns (pepto bismol here I come). I'd say their poutine is on par with BK aside from variety of toppings. Enjoy"}
{"text":"The fries were great, no complaints there.  And the curds  tasted good and had the right texture.

But most importantly, the gravy.  Unfortunately, it is terrible.  How can you be a self-proclaimed poutinerie and have such crappy gravy?  It reminded me of the cornstarched, bland mess that you'd find at Harvey's.  It is supposed to be a deep, dark, beefy gravy -- not a slimy, bland thing you'd find at St. Hubert's in 1985."}
{"text":"I hate this place. I hate smokes. 

I live 3 minutes down the street. Sometimes when it's 1am and nothing else is open I debate about going to bed hungry or going out to smokes and hating myself later.

The location is always not well kept. Majority of Smoke's locations I know all have that grimy look from not being cleaned thoroughly.

Their gravy must be thickened with cornstarch because sometimes I get slimy clumps of it in my gravy. 

Their toppings are really subpar and overall not great (sometimes the carmelized onions taste off). The fries are really okay but in the end, it's just not worth the money.

I'd rather take out cash and take the streetcar down to poutini's where I know my food is not going to end up in the bin."}
{"text":"After hearing about this franchise for years, excited it was coming to calgary as well. I met the owners 1 month before the opening and great promise was to be had.  I stopped by and tried the regular poutine dish.  Couple of kids were running the place, owners(a couple in their 50's) no where to be seen.  Fries were soggy, cheese tasted off, I'll never be back.   People need to understand that they need to be there 24/7 working their hardest to maintain quality."}
{"text":"I've been going here off and on for a few years now. 

At first it was fun, the poutines were interesting and the quality was all right.

But over the years as they have added a ton of different poutines to their menu the quality has been gradually declining. I decided to stop in today because I had veggie nacho poutine on the brain and I was sorely disappointed.

Veggie Nacho is regular poutine with salsa, jalepenos, guac and sour cream. While the toppings are normally pretty generous I was sad to find that while my poutine had some jalepenos, there was only a small amount of salsa, maybe half a teaspoon of guac (seriously there was guac on two fries) and even less sour cream. In that moment I secretly congratulated myself on not getting the veggie rainbow as I can only imagine how sad that would have looked with only the tiniest little squirts of each sauce.

But the poutine itself was lacking as well. The fries were greasy and limp, the cheese curds were really cold and never really melted. 

Honestly, I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"This Smoke's has finaaaaally opened! 
Tis a cozy place with a few stools for people watching up front and some seating inside. 

Fast and friendly service + pipin' hot and delicious poutine - what's not to love? 
Oh, keep your receipt 'cus they call you up by that #. 

Also: right beside the College&Shaw library (study sesh?), close to College Square (with Metro/Shoppers/Timmy's), and The Mod Club.

Recommendation: Bacon, Hogtown

NOTE: Only accepts DEBIT or CASH."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you dont know what this type of food is, it's french fries with cheese and gravy and then a ton of different toppings to your taste. 

I got the Hog Town which comes with sausage, bacon, onion and mushrooms. Crazy good. I wanted more but I was stuffed. Will definitely be back soon to try some other options."}
{"text":"This is a Toronto based restaurant... for poutine... with a location in Montreal. I'm trying hard to be polite here. I didn't know this fact until I started this review but it explains a lot and didn't change my view at all. 

First of all there's just something odd about the taste, the gravy, ehhhh... Secondly and most importantly the fries sucked. I think it's the type of potato they use, not sure. At first I thought the cardboard box was cute, but the novelty soon wore off. Looks like someone took a tight dump in a small box!

I wish them good luck in Red Dear, Regina, and Moncton, but I just don't see a long future for them in Mtl. That rent can't be cheap.  

Other things I don't want from Toronto in a Montreal restaurant:
-Smoke meat
-Bagels
-Steamed hotdogs
-Subs"}
{"text":"The poutines I really well-made. I ordered the nacho poutine a few times, and it's always tasted really good. The service is friendly, but the prices are extremely overpriced; I mean, it's a few potatoes with gravy and cheese, they don't need to charge an arm and a leg. With the prices they charge they make it seem like they're a five-star restaurant but really it's just another fast food place that has really good poutine that is overpriced.

This is one of those places where you come to grab a quick bite to eat, but it's not a place where you would bring the family out or someone out on a date."}
{"text":"The snack size traditional poutine met my expectations. The cheese curds were nice and squeaky, the gravy not too salty, and the fries nice and crispy. I would certainly order it in again if I were in the area.

Unfortunately, the mega size veggie deluxe was a clunker. They didn't include enough cheese curds and the caramelized onions had an odd flavour."}
{"text":"Fries with gravy and cheese curds are delicious! I'm so happy we stopped in here and tried this special cold weather delight. Of course, we tried original but I see they have a vege version and a meato version and some interesting curry version as well. How fun!

This is a once and a while treat."}
{"text":"BACON. CHEESE. BURGER. FRIES.

Mash these things together and that's what I had. Well with Poutine (is that what the gravy part is called?) I really want one of these greasy spoon places in the bay area, because I'd be there a lot.

What can I say though? Poutine is amazing...when it's fresh. Don't eat cold poutine, it's disgusting. Just like how you feel after you scarf down half of a regular in 3 minutes.

This place does get the -1 for the tweens and 80's feel."}
{"text":"Ehh not a huge fan.. one of my clients gassed me up to try poutine when they found out I was visiting Toronto.. poutine wasn't bad but definitely overrated.. maybe next time I'll try one of their creative ones instead of the traditional"}
{"text":"First time I tried poutine and it was ohhhhh soooooo gooood! We went with the recommendation of getting the Bacon Cheeseburger Poutine. We added the shrooms and onions. A 'meal' size was big enough for two people. Usually I'm not much into fries or pork but loved it so much I barely rearranged myself from licking the container ;) lol"}
{"text":"Dragged my friend to this place one day after school excited to grab a poutine with her. Having google'd smoke's poutinerie all week and seeing pictures of everyone elses red plaid boxes I was certain i was in for something great. I got the Regular poutine with bacon on it and rubbed my hands in excitement. 

Once our poutines were ready we immediately dug in and I could not have been anymore disappointed. I think it had to do with the potatoes used. They were dry, still had bits of the skin on them and just tasted really bland. I can't put my finger on what was so bad about it but I am almost certain that it was the fries itself. The bacon was pretty salty but even that I could tolerate. I love poutine and usually finish mine but this one we could not get passed and ended up throwing over 3/4 of our not cheap poutine away. 

I have had better poutine at Hero Burger than this place..."}
{"text":"Wow, such a great place for Poutine.  During my visit, I definitely indulged in as much Poutine as possible and the options at this place were fantastic...something for everyone.  I had the Steak Stroganoff Poutine with tender and tasty steak pieces, caramelized onions, mushrooms and that popular cream sauce - it was very rich and totally satisfied my curiosity for interesting Poutine.  I ordered the large option when I really should have gone for the regular/medium size since the larger option is really meant for two people.

So good!"}
{"text":"I am a poutine pirate and try to have poutine every place that I can. Poutine from smoke's is pretty close to the top of my list. 

In a twist they have loads of different types of toppings...veggie, veggie delux (peas, mushrooms, onions), bacon...LOADS.

My personal favourite is veggie gravy and peas. I'm not a vegetarian but I love this poutine. add some ketchup and you got it made. Price is ok, and the staff are always super lovely....plus they have their own bags of potatoes branded smokes! I want my own brand of potatoes.

Go on Smokes! If you haven't tried it yet, get on it!"}
{"text":"All I ordered was basic poutine, but as an American, this was really good stuff!!  Prior impressions of poutine is it's just plan WEIRD.  However, this was incredibly tasty.  Even if that means it's average poutine (which I doubt), then poutine is pretty good!

The large is definitely a sharing size.  We got the classic poutine -- fries, gravy, and cheese curds.  No the cheese curds were not squeaky...but again, was I expecting that?  No. 

There is no seating, and that's bothersome, but we stood at the bar and watched the neighborhood...which is supposedly on the rise again?  That would be cool.

If you are visiting Canada, make sure you try poutine at some point, and this restaurant is a great place to do it!"}
{"text":"J'adore poutine, and now I love Smokes Poutinerie! One of my favorite memories of Montreal was the poutine and I was there last October and ate my share, thinking I will not have real poutine for a long time. My dreams were answered, upon my return I was told we have a poutinerie in Las Vegas!

We arrived at 11 pm on Friday night, it is always nice to have a late night snack that satisfies the late night out and one that will not charge the price of a kidney! I have raved about poutine and my friend Heidi was dying to try it, so here it goes.

If it is your first time to try poutine I suggest getting the fries gravy and cheese and smoked meat. This is the basic one but it will give one a fair assessment of what it is about. Trust me you cannot go wrong with any combo but it is so good on its own!

I was sad because while I was in Montreal I had stomach issues and realized that flour was in the poutine gravy so tonight I was a spectator to avoid a stomach flare up. I mentioned it to the girl at the counter and she told me the Poivre gravy is GLUTEN FREE! The Gods were looking down upon me, so I ordered a bowl too! I ordered the basic and I was in poutine heaven, it is so good! My friend loved her bowl too!

The parking, yes the lot is small, for late night grubbing the lot was empty so we were in luck. I can see where one may have to plan for this outing, but remember it is the Strrip and I do not expect hotel/valet parking.

This is a takeaway establishment so eating in the elements of Las Vegas could be an issue. It was 42 degrees and to be honest I was not looking forward to eating fast in the cold. Just as I had the thought the counter girl suggested we go to the BBQ place next door,  they will not mind if we ate in there. This is the perfect solution, they serve beer, and trust me it is another pairing that will make one happy!

As Julia Child's would say, Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"this was tasty but also my first time having poutine.

The fries were soggy and the gravy looked boxed and kind of nasty but I figured it was one of those local things. Upon reading the reviews of those far more knowledgeable than a regular American, my opinion may be off.

I would say the service was kind of ehh, it looked like it should have been faster than it was.

I only had two bites because I felt like I was going to throw up if I had more than that (we had also been eating all day long).

Upon reflecting, I would probably go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I adore Poutine, and a vegetarian gravy to me is like sugar-free cookies to a diabetic.

I met my enabler a year ago and I thought I loved it on the first encounter, then the second visit reminded me why I didn't return for more than a few months thereafter.

The gravy is overwhelmingly salty. I think I may have a little bit of a sensitive tongue but it's as though the gravy was drowned in salt, and prepared for none other than the extremely hungover drunkard from down the street. 

I also tried the veggie deluxe, hoping that the other veggies would dilute some of the salt. Didn't work.

 I wonder if they'd take some request on that gravy, or make a container just for those who still have all their tastebuds in working order."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. I had the philly cheese one. Tasted quite bland but my friends seemed to love what they got (vegan and hog one). Definitely something worth getting after some drinks."}
{"text":"This was pretty much pomme frites meets five guys and made a happy baby. Was overwhelmed with choices as a newbie to canada but have to say this poutine was the most comforting, gravy was so tasty, curds a bit rubbery but the combination of these three winner ingredients worked and glad that this place is dedicated to just poutine."}
{"text":"This Smoke's is in a prime location on Queens street.
It is a very small location, but does have a few seats for eating in and bathrooms in the basement.

Smoke's poutine flavour is the same at all of the restaurants however I believe the girl who served us gave us more than she was supposed to because it tasted even more delicious.
She was very nice and chatty and was the only person working that day it seemed as she did everything there.

Overall this visit was good, food was good, service was good. A ok in my books

4/5"}
{"text":"I went to Smoke's on a recommendation from a poutine-loving friend of mine.
I like poutine, but I don't usually consider it my go-to eating out food.

I was very impressed with the Poutine I got at smoke's.
For $8 I got a HUGE serving of Chicken Fajita Poutine.
It was delicious! so Many flavors, no ketchup needed lol

I love that there are so many options you can have in your poutine, such as chili, chicken, veggies, bacon cheeseburger, and the list goes on.

If you are a poutine lover, check out smoke's!
I've even seen them at food shows in food trucks so keep an eye out for the smiley face logo."}
{"text":"Oh man, as a native Montrealer, boy do I ever miss a good poutine with lots of choices (La Banquise!). Smoke's Poutinerie is a pretty good substitute - especially the morning after to nurse a hangover! We got some take-out poutines - I had the large bacon poutine - let me tell you that this is massive. I am usually pretty good at devouring poutines, but I could only finish about half of this one. It comes in a container that is probably 8\"Lx5\"Wx4\"H, and about 3/4 of the container was the traditional poutine, and then the last quarter on top was all covered in delicious crispy bacon. It made it on the salty side but you just have to get a bite of fries along with the bite of bacon and you'll be fine. I liked the fries, and the gravy is a lighter one, possibly chicken-based, which I like. Real curds are a must and while this place does use them, they were almost all completely melted by the time we got the poutines home, so I didn't really get any of that squeaky cheesiness that I love. Overall, awesome (for Toronto)!!"}
{"text":"So basically if you are looking for a fix on a poutine craving, Smoke's will do it for you. It is a fast food joint. The gravy is nice and smoking hot so the cheese curds melt pretty well. Fries are fairly chunky and filling. I do wish the gravy had a bit more of a cajun kick to it.

Price...I would say a bit on the pricey side, but it is a filling meal, but it's downtown toronto, $10 for lunch is expected. I had the hogtown poutine. Service was standard, nothing amazing. Size...could be a bit better, but I think the Poutine itself couldve used more better quality ingredients (sausage... i am looking at you)

Don't go in expecting the best poutine of your life, but if you have an omnomnom or poutine craving, then this should hit the spot and be worth visiting. Especailly because Smokes is open extremely late, which is a mega plus. Hence why I wish i could give them a 3.5. I do like the Pop soda drinks they have. I can guzzle them down so easily if they didnt burn holes in my wallet."}
{"text":"Having never tried real poutine from QC, I can't call myself a expert. However, I will say that Smoke's is only ok. The fries are decent and the topings can be interesting but in my opinion, the gravy is too runny. I don't know about others, but I like my gravy to have some heft. At Smoke's, I feel as if I'm just having fries with soup."}
{"text":"First time visit to a Smoke's location on a cold February night at 10:30 pm.  The place is clean, quiet and, bright. The sole employee was quick, cordial and very professional.  I tried a pulled pork chipotle and I like it.  Tasty, filling, hot and fresh.  I will go again."}
{"text":"I had the Pulled Pork Poutine with no extras (no bacon, etc). A true Canadian classic. I would recommend not adding anything extra to it, although I threw in some extra pepper that's all. The meal size is good for 2 (or 1 really hungry big ass guy). And it costs just $8.99. 

I give them 5 stars because I got just what I expected. Plus the lady was very nice."}
{"text":"Good price for portion - a normal size will fill you pretty well because it's really heavy (potatoes, cheese, fat, etc.).  I got the double pork (pulled pork + bacon) and it was excellent.  Not something I could eat regularly though... I don't want to know how bad it is for you."}
{"text":"ever since we visited canada and tried poutine (fries topped with gravy and cheese curds), we've been obsessed. it's really difficult to find poutine in the US and smoke's is an increasing in popularity chain. located in a new complex that's clean (including bathrooms), parking lot and outdoor seating (although not good for groups of greater than 4). friendly service (had the owner take care of us on a friday night around 11P), fries cooked up fresh and nice selection of poutines. we ordered the chicken fajita regular size, which was hefty but a tad pricey at $11. we liked that they let us substitute guacamole for sour cream but only a small bit was provided and it wasn't very flavorful at all. the gravy is a bit salty, especially towards the end but the cheese curds were awesome. 4 stars for the uniqueness of being a poutinerie but 3 stars for overall value"}
{"text":"Place smells like burnt oil, unseasoned beef, greasy onions and a ridiculously small portion for 10$. Bland. Not going back there again. Burrito boy below is cheaper, fresher and tastier."}
{"text":"My first take-out of 2014 and gotta say - Not Great.

I started eating a Smoke's when I stumbled upon the Queen street location 3 years ago when out for a walk. I HAD to have the Pulled Pork.

So its been my 'Litmus Test' to always have the Pulled Pork when I try other Smoke's locations. Queen street once. Annex location twice.

Tonight was my 5th time at the College street location and for the 3rd time I was displeased. So now I'm done with this location.

I'm not sure what's happened but this location is all over the map with inconsistency. Tonight the Hipstery bearded dude was on again. The last time he was there by himself I also didn't like the box. 

So is it just \"his cook\" that's the culprit...?

I will not go back even though they are 1 and 1/2 blocks from my house.

I decided to get the Pulled Pork with some Peas tonight. just to brighten up the brown. Tonight's box contained: Very, very little Pulled Pork, which was sadly very dry as well. Hardly any 'squeaky' cheese. The Fries were a ball of mush. Yet oddly, not a lot of gravy. Two tablespoons of Peas. The whole order was tasteless.

How you can mess up fries is beyond me. 

I think it's a timing thing. Know when to add the Gravy so the fries still have some crunch. Know how and when to add the cheese so some melts but not all. Know when to add the Toppings and of course how much. 

After getting food poisoning from another neighborhood joint on December 6th. I was shy about getting another takeout. But I thought \"It's potatoes. What could go wrong..?\" Well nothing went right tonight.

After a hard day of us cleaning the house from top to bottom and packing up all the Xmas ornaments, taking down tree we earned our Carbs.

But sadly, this Smoke's Poutinerie didn't earn my return business. 
Happy New Year Hipsters. Or not..."}
{"text":"Major disappointment..
Took the kids; tried 3 different types of poutine.
Result ranged from awful to mediocre.
Appears popular, I don't get it.  Incredibly unhealthy, if I'm gonna eat 'incredibly unhealthy', I want it to at least taste 'good'.
Avoid."}
{"text":"The portions here are crazy large.  I ordered the Nacho Grande (that may have been a contributing factor).  The regular size was pretty big, I was unable to finish it (for the record).  It's great because they do everything when you order.  When I visited, the guy behind the counter was a one-man show, he took the order, he made the order, he passed to himself, then passed it to me.   It was pretty amusing.

The food itself is pretty good.  The guacamole was squished out of a massive bag, which is not my fave way to see guac served, but overall it was good."}
{"text":"Poo-teen! I really enjoyed the different poutines that I tried here, including the pulled pork (my fav), beef stroganoff, and the butter chicken (a special). There are a variety of options on the menu, including vegetarian poutines, so take your time to browse the menu and check their special. The fries are the perfect size, not too skinny and not too thick, the gravy is thin but delicious, and the cheese curds are squeaky, eraser-like, salty bites. It sounds weird but the cheese curds were what I enjoyed the most about poutine. Some of the ingredients could have been chopped smaller, i.e. the pickles in the beef stroganoff and the green onion in the butter chicken. Unless you are starving, I suggest sharing a box with another person. You can also up the size of it as well.

Smoke's Poutinerie is open late so you may overhear some amusing drunk conversations."}
{"text":"Yesterday's ROTD brought me here. Till I read some of the reviews, I had no idea what \"poutine\" was. I googled it and found out it's a very popular Canadian (French) dish. In Canada, even McDonald's and KFC have this on their menu!? As a foodie (more like a food addict), it's my shame not knowing what \"poutine\" was. I had to try this place out.

I got Veggie Deluxe and traditional. I liked Veggie one better. Absolutely delicious. Packed with flavor. On top of the fries, lots of cheese, onions, mushrooms and green peas in the special gravy. Served very hot! The best loaded french fries I've ever had in my life!

I'm not a fan of the neighborhood. (I believe this is the neighborhood I got mugged when I was a Japanese high school student visiting Vegas. Looooong time ago.) If you are a girl, do not walk to here from the strip at night. Especially if you are from different country, do not walk to here without English spoken male. 

Oops, it's time for me to do two hour jog on the treadmill. (approximately 1,500 calories but it was worth it.)"}
{"text":"Every time I get a poutine here there's something off about it... it's like the fries are old or something, or just dryyyy.... I wouldn't say this is the best I've had in the city. I would recommend getting something with at least a vegetable because the 3 pork or the Montreal ones are just too dry all together. 

So many choices though, and I can never settle... walk out of there wishing I had tried something else pretty much every time.

Other than that, i find the quality is consistent and the cheese is melted preeetty nicely all over the place. I would definitely come here after a drunken night, but wouldn't track across town just to grab a poutine.

PS Abbas."}
{"text":"I'm about half way through a regular AKA gargantuan box of pulled pork topped poutine.  Though it's quite tangy, crunchy and replete with curds, I should have gotten a small (AKA something regular).

Other than my own gluttonous tendencies,  i have not too much about which to complain.  

(cut to many weeks later after having not finished this review and now im finishing it...)

so ive had two flavours, as it were, at the smokes, and the second one was the chicken with mushrooms or something like that, and i was not as impressed.  i cannot quite place it, but for some reason i felt like i was eating severely processed chicken, and there were  just a paltry few pieces of it.  ive had better spam sandwiches. (by rights i suppose i shouldnt be complaining about processed chicken after trying to trump it with spam but...).

anyhow, im sure most would agree that for a fun change on poutine this is a solid place.  i suppose once a section is created in the NOW for Poutine Places, we might be able to revise our reviews with a finer toothed comb but until then

stop smoking drugs and start smoking poutine."}
{"text":"A staple and must for any visit to Toronto.  Have been here numerous times and have never left disappointed.

The Peppercorn Steak Poutine is amazing and by far my favorite of them all.  The classic poutine is awesome but if you go here you must go all in.  The Smoked Meat is a good choice, the chili cheese is great, really you cant go wrong.  Best Gravy in Canada, awesome fries, perfect portions.

If they would add Dr Pepper I may never leave"}
{"text":"Hmm, they have some great ideas on mixing it up with the poutines, but I'm not sure they captured the flavors as well as they wanted. 

I ordered the Mac Daddy, and at first bite it tasted like a big mac but after that it was bleh.

I've had better in Montreal."}
{"text":"And I thought the US hand cornered the market on unhealthy food that will kill you early. Not completely. Smoke's is death in a cardboard box, but oh what a sweet death it is. Thank the Universe I don't have one of these in Las Vegas or I would be fatter than I already am. Order something with bacon. I had the bacon bacon with extra bacon and some bacon on the side. I just ordered the bacon one and they provided the whole pig. As good as that was, the bacon cheeseburger is near orgasmic. 

Do yourself a favor and eat at Smoke's. Then call the suicide hotline so as they can talk you down from killing yourself for eating something so good which you know can only be that good if it is immoral and a crime against nature."}
{"text":"I have to go to Smoke's almost every time I'm in Toronto. I had a poutine craving and luckily there was a location walking distance from my Airbnb. I got the BBQ pork poutine and was in heaven. Cheesy, cheesy, melty cheese curd pork heaven. Ask for a side of sour cream with this one. Trust me. 
P.s. It also tends to keep to-go. At least for shorter distances. 
P.P.S. I've tried a lot of options there and haven't found a bad one yet. Next on my list is the thanksgiving poutine. That might be tonig"}
{"text":"Got the large butter chicken poutine for my two friends and I. Was a good filler before going out to drinks after. Poutines are a must try! The group in front of us dropped their large poutine and the chef gave them another one free of charge. It's located in a convenient location downtown so if you are a tourist planning on visiting Toronto to try some poutine, I would recommend this place. I'm not poutine expert but it was great :)"}
{"text":"First ever time tasting poutine & loved it here. Hamas had us covered w/ just the right flavor suggestions & prepared it just how we asked. Love the Montreal cured meat plus the pulled pork! Good stuff here!!"}
{"text":"This review is one star simply because it was not open when we went to pick up the order. I ordered through the Yelp app, and received a confirmation that the order would be completed in 10-35 mins. We went to the location about 20 minutes later and found it was closed. Moreover, the parking attendants yelled at my dad for picking us up in an \"Uber or Lyft,\" when it was just our rental car.

Overall a disappointing experience. But if you're looking for Poutine, check out Bruxie in The Park between New York New York and the Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"First time trying poutine from here because I heard such good things, bought the snack size traditional and honestly best poutine I've ever had and I've been to a lot of places, New York Fries, Pizza Pizza, Taco Bell, etc but never had poutine this good! :D 

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try this Canadian dish, and I'm definitely going back myself! :)"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to eat here for the last few months after reading all of the amazing reviews on yelp.  Well, i finally got my wish recently.  I ordered the pulled pork poutine, and it was nothing special.  The fries were dry (i prefer St. Louis/KFC fries), the gravy was alriiight, the pulled pork was.. meh, but the cheese curds were amazing!  The poutine didn't taste as well as it did the morning after because the cheese curds would not melt until i microwaved my leftovers.  Take into account, i was drunk when eating the poutine and i still thought it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Smoke's is simply the best poutine that you can get without going to a specialized restaurant in Quebec such as La Banquise.

Smoke's has a wide array of toppings that you can choose to put on your poutine, and nearly all of them are unique and go extremely well with your fries, gravy, and cheese.  For around $10 you can get their large sized poutine, which is a very large portion and might even be enough for two smaller eaters to split.  The taste of the fries themselves is already fatastic and the toppings just add even more to be enjoyed.  A really great poutine, especially considering it is a chain."}
{"text":"On a recent family trip to Toronto, I visited Smoke's Poutinerie on the recommendation from a friend who has family in Toronto. While out with 11 of my other cousins (and no, that wasn't all the cousins in my family!!), we stopped in. Just as most things I've noticed in Toronto, it's a small place, with less than 15 chairs. Needless to say we took up all the space! With having that many people, one advantage is that we all ordered different things so that we could all taste as many dishes as we wanted :) For those who aren't familiar with poutine, it's a typical comfort food in Canada.....fresh cut fries, cheese curds, and beef gravy. We had a few varieties:

Traditional: just as the typical poutine, it has Smoke's signature gravy and Quebec cheese curds. I'm not a huge gravy fan, so I was more appreciative of the varieties that Smoke's had to offer. With that being said, the gravy was pretty light and very flavorful! When I think of gravy, I think of thick Thanksgiving gravy that you pour over turkey. This one was more of a lighter sauce that was over all the fries. My only gripe is that the cheese that was used didn't melt quite as much as I would have liked. I'm not sure if it's typical of Quebec style cheese-curds, but I didn't get the stringy consistency I like with cheese curds found in the midwest :) 

Double Pork: Now although still with the traditional gravy and cheese curds, this was more my style with the addition of chipotle pulled pork and double smoked bacon. The bacon wasn't crispy like I'm used to, so the texture of the entire meal was generally soft.  The flavor, however was awesome! The flavors of the pulled pork and the bacon were easily identified, but together made a great meal!

Chef Special - BBQ Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese: Now we're getting to some interesting combinations! This looked like it was specific to the Queen location. They took the chipotle pulled pork, added a mac and cheese that was more like a Hamburger-Helper type mac and cheese than your typical cheesy mac and cheese, but non-the-less it was delish! The addition of the pasta didn't do much other than add extra texture, which is sometimes needed with a generally soft dish. Overall flavor though was just as good as the previous!

Butter Chicken -  Being this was my first time here, I'm not positive, but I believe this is a special this month at all the Smoke's Poutineries. If you're an indian food lover, than this is the poutine for you :) Butter chicken is (apparently!) a typical Indian dish. I tend to stay with my curries, so I'm not super versed in the variety of indian cuisine :) I don't believe this one had gravy, but the butter chicken sauce. It definitely had an indian flavor, but it was not spicy. It had a strong \"spice\" taste, which was great, but it was not hot-spicy. My only complaint is that I couldn't tell the difference between the cheese curds and the chicken, so I couldn't even tell you if there was chicken in it! However, the flavor again was fantastic :)

Overall, some great local comfort food!"}
{"text":"I came to Smoke's on a Monday at lunch time. I work nearby so the walk is not bad.

I ordered the Bacon Poutine and was surprised when it came out almost immediately after I paid. Somehow, I received my order before the lady who was there before me. Food came out quickly, so how could I complain?

Well, for some reason, the poutine was not as hot as I'd liked it to be. Maybe they accidentally made a Bacon Poutine and I ended up getting served. Maybe the gravy was sitting around for too long. This was probably just a one-off experience, but I finished it anyway.

I'd come back, but hopefully it will be better next time. I absolutely love poutine and it would be a shame if every experience is like this."}
{"text":"For what it's worth I am going to give them 1 star because they are successful in capturing the right audience with their long hours. Late at night...say around 2am and you're too drunk to comprehend what is food, Smokes is your go-to joint. Well because you've had Mickey D's for the past 5 nights in a row and nothing else is open besides Chinatown and you don't want to risk getting shot there.

This poutine is loud, rambunctious, oily, greasy and heavy. You are sure to get that left over grease taste of that frying oil gone bad and fries soggy beyond comprehension. Lots of mediocre cheese, meats and a few sprinkles of greens. Of course all this smothered in a sorry excuse of a gravy but of course to the masses--more is more and more is better than better.

In other words, if you want a delicious poutine then take a pass but if you're way too drunk and still reading this (probably not drunk enough?) then dive in. In here quantity obviously outweighs quality."}
{"text":"A little overrated but it's good for a quick snack.  
The veggie poutine is a safe choice."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when I have those late night cravings. I am pretty simple with my poutine and always get the \"traditional\" order. The cheese curds are generous and amount you get makes you pretty full. I tend to order the snack size. The staff here are great and I am always happy with the service. Definitely no complaints here :)"}
{"text":"So after the first visit of smokes poutinerie, sober by the way, I've finally come to see why everyone comes here after the bar. 

I ordered the small pulled pork poutine and had samples of the regular and Montreal poutines. First recommendation, order a small, I personally eat a lot but a giant amount of potatoes and cheese isn't really that easy to finish. 

The pulled pork was quite a surprise. Personally I wasn't expecting it to be so sweet. Kinda turned me off of it and I didn't really enjoy it. The original poutine is MUCH better. The best thing about it is that the gravy isn't all too salty as other places can be. Other than that my only other complaint is that the cheese curds did not melt at all. That's kinda foreign to me as a poutine. 

Final thought, I think the other flavours are gimmicky (the montreal poutine consisted of deli slices, mustard and pickles). Stick to the regular poutine."}
{"text":"I have never been greeted with such negativity.  I came in on a Thursday night and asked what was good and I was told they had no idea, well okay i can handle that, but I then asked the cook what was good and he told me he hated the food there and recommended me to go Burrito Boyz up the street.... Like WTF??? I then said i wouldn't order anything then and his response i was given was \"good, less work for me\". Honestly, if you hate your job that much QUIT, don't go around bringing everyone else around you down to your miserable existence.  I was beyond disgusted with the level of customer service i received and I do not plan on ever stepping foot in this location again. I would not doubt that the cook has spit in your food."}
{"text":"Four stars for taste, price, and selections, but 1 star for the restaurant ambiance and seating.  I'm new to the poutine scene, but this Smoke's was a perfect introduction!"}
{"text":"The first time I had something from a Smoke's Poutinerie was this dingy looking joint in Ottawa, and I decided that would be the last time I got anything from here. It was because the atmosphere inside was rather dim and depressing and it didn't look like any customer would feel happy to there and eat their order. The different takes on the basic poutine looked good but I just never felt like I want to be inside.
But recently I started craving for some Poutine in the city and when I searched up for poutine joints in my area, of course Smoke's came up and after reading the positive review on Yelp for the Yonge and Eglinton location, I went to get some take-out from there last Sunday.
The inside of this location looks better and the Hogtown Poutine and the Country Style Chicken Poutine did the trick to satisfy my craving for that delicious concotion of fries, cheese curds and warm peppery gravy. 
I had a happy dinner that evening and will come back here when I feel another craving for some comforting poutine :-)"}
{"text":"Now that I'm no longer feeling unhappy because of the bloat, I can write an unbiased review. The place is located in a sketchy area and was near empty when the boyfriend and I came in for two wow sizes each (don't do this to yourself btw) sometime late in the afternoon; it's small and there aren't any seats which is fine but there's a counter for you to stand and eat at. I suggest you take out your meal to enjoy elsewhere. We got the bacon cheeseburger and veggie deluxe, the mushrooms in the veggie one started tasting rubbery after a few bites but that might have been the wow size speaking.. both delicious nonetheless. A lady working there gave us both some sunglasses to rep as propaganda which was a nice touch  This place is a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Is this a joke? For $10 there's a tiny bit of fries covered in meat which I had difficulty locating or discerning.  Fries make a good poutine and these fries were the most basic fries I have ever had, no different from frozen prepackaged fries.  The gravy was too salty and the cheese curds left much to be desired.   Should have just stayed home and poured cheeze wiz over cold mccain fries."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try smokes after hearing from a friend it was good however it was very disappointing I got the nacho grande and the classic. The classic had no flavor at all and the cheese curds were Huge and barely even melted I barely ate any of it. The nacho grande was a little better because it had more flavor but it was purely average. My stomach also has been hurting me all day and I'm sure it's from smokes . This is coming from someone who eats Taco Bell and never gets sick. The ideas are cool by they are executed poorly and also over priced."}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple chances for after-hours grub, and it's so hit-and-miss that it's not really worth the risk anymore.

When it's on point it's decent -- the butter chicken poutine is quite good (which they don't make anymore), but usually they fall short with odd-tasting concoctions. Most recent experience was cold fries and even colder cheese curds. I struggled to finish my order.

Not worth the gamble anymore."}
{"text":"Tried it as a hungry night snack and would have to say it's okay. We had much better. Surprisingly Bramptons only Poutine shop called Fresh is the best I've had in the GTA so far. Smokes fine if you want to grab a quick bite but a bit too bland for me, not enough taste. I think it's the Gravy, they need better gravy."}
{"text":"To make perfect poutine you need freshest possible cheese curds(one that squeaks when you bite into it), dark thick gravy and  fries with potato skin attached.  Cheese curds  was not squeaky.  Gravy was light  colored and thin (I tasted a lot of MSG).  Fries  looked perfect but didn't taste that good.  But I gave them 4 stars because it's the closest real thing compare to Quebec, Canada poutine(home of poutine)  Nothing beats that fresh  squeaky  cheese curds from Quebec. This place uses Wisconsin  cheese curds."}
{"text":"We were visiting for the weekend and were recommend Smoke's Poutinerie as the spot to go for poutine. We didn't really get to try a lot, but it seemed pretty decent. Chili Cheese Bacon seems to be a popular flavor. They were open pretty late at night so it was convenient.

Veggie Deluxe - Sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, baby green peas. The poutine itself was okay, but not great."}
{"text":"This review is not for food but service and decor.  Got a teambuy voucher and had to pick it up yesterday as it was the last day.

This place is albeit on the sketchy part of Queen St, it seems like after 2pm it gets dodgy and sometimes scary.  Maybe it's the smell of weed or whatever, street people with their large dogs, or drunken people this place scares me.  Keep in mind that I am also scared of my own shadow.

Onto the restaurant, it's very small and narrow.  Only one person working there and the guy was grabbing a large pan of fries from near the ground and pouring them somewhere.  Maybe they were to be thrown out?  I acknowledged him but he ignored me.

After being made to wait two minutes he came down and I gave him my voucher.  No communication from him whatsoever.  

Place is dingy, it's a hole in the wall in every sense.

I'll use my giftcard elsewhere thanks"}
{"text":"OH EM GEE! This place is just awesome, quite possibly one of, or maybe the best poutine place in the city...Atleast from all the poutines I've had in Toronto. Like Bacon? Or maybe you fancy pulled pork, well go figure you can have it on your POUTINE!! Its pure madness, but I love it. If you get a chance check out this place and any of their many locations across the city."}
{"text":"When in Canada do as the Canadians do...

Ordered a medium poutine country style (bacon, peas, onions, mushrooms) and Boyfriend ordered the chipotle style. Huge tasty portions!

No place to sit and eat though which was disappointing to my traveling legs."}
{"text":"Quality poutine, went with the traditional but lots of crazy ones you can get."}
{"text":"being a 2 minute walk from my house makes this super dangerous. when I die I want to be buried in poutine."}
{"text":"It's a Smoke's. You know what you're getting - a pretty solid, but not exceptional, poutine, with a lot more customizability than is offered at most poutineries. If you're drunk and really want eggs and avocado with your poutine they can make that happen here. 

However, this Smoke's poutinerie is levels ahead of all the other Smoke's ive tried in Toronto. The simple reason for this is that the people working here are ALWAYS so friendly and affable and just overall makes the experience above and beyond what you expect."}
{"text":"Smoke's Poutinerie is a Canadian staple and deserves nothing less then 5 stars. This has been one of my favourite cheat spots in the city (all locations) when I'm in the mood for the fast and good quality poutine. I was a friend from the states around Toronto and when they said they wanted to give poutine a try, I knew exactly where I was going to take them. The Dundas Street E location is a little off the path of downtown of the \"fun\" areas, but it was pretty close to the hotel my friends and I were staying at so it worked out perfectly. The shop itself isn't very large (but it really doesn't need to be) but does offer a good number of seats, a friendly staff, and the same number of options as every other Smoke's location. Saturday was about the showing him the classic so I also went with that. As usual the poutine was top notch, hot, and absolutely delicious. I'll never get bored of this place and it will always be a personal favourite of mine."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest! I've been a frequent Smoke's customer for roughly 8 years now and I still looking forward to eating it every chance I get (I swear I don't actually eat here that often). I stopped into this location Saturday afternoon so my friend from Connecticut could get a poutine fix. The place was empty when we walked in and we ordered and had our food in under ten minutes. Similar to every other experience I have had here the poutine was hot and actually seemed to have more curds in it then usual, which made for a very happy Steven. Overall, this is pretty similar to every other Smoke's location and the perfect place to stop and get s quick, well priced poutine fix."}
{"text":"Poutine is amazing, and this place gets creative with the options. I had the \"philly\" cheese steak poutine and it was awesome. Fries I guess could be a bit crispier but oh well. They need to expand to NYC or something because otherwise I'm going to have to move to Toronto. Kinda of wish they had beer, but I think that's a Canada/Toronto thing. Come here and order everything, one by one."}
{"text":"i have lived in Canada for almost 7years and this is the first time I try poutone from a franchise. The place offers you to have regular frenchfries, traditional poutine and sepialty. really good options price are decent"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. Best poutine you can get. Highly recommended.  Thank you. :3"}
{"text":"It's an OK place and they gave me the wrong order. I ordered the chicken inferno but got the butter chicken poutine instead. Since it was to-go I didn't realize till I got home."}
{"text":"As an American, wanted to check out this place because I wanted to get a taste of Canadian delicacies. I came in to an empty restaurant and two people behind the counter. They were quite nice and took my orders without any trouble. The place was clean and the bathroom was clean as well. I ordered two traditional poutines. Gotta say that they were hot, gooey, and delicious. Never had anything like it. For the price and all, I'd say it's worth the shot. No negatives here."}
{"text":"If only all fast food resembled the lovely cardboard boxes at Smoke's Poutinerie, we'd feel a wee bit different about this degenerate category of consumption. Though the calories and fat are still present, there's just something more attractive about the packaging and contents of this type of quick meal than a paper-wrapped burger or a bucket of greasy chicken.

A small portion will more than fill you up, packed to the brim with well-cooked fries, loads of gravy and cheese curds. I don't know why we are slacking on the poutine in the US, but someone needs to get on this and open up a poutinerie in the states. Or maybe not...as I would just end up eating here the whole time, adding to my ever-expanding waistline."}
{"text":"Not the prettiest looking but definitely tasty. Fast and clean service definitely a plus. In and out parking, not too bad for las vegas blvd. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fries get soggy very fast and is not pleasant to eat after a while. It's not crispy like other fries I've had. Cook was very accommodating. I got the philly steak pouting but with all the extra toppings on the side. Wanted to see if it would be less soggy but that didn't help. Poutines are ok it if I'm going to spend that much on a poutine I'd rather get it at an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst one I've been to. Stingy with ingredients. Don't call it poutine, it's some fries with a bit of gravy and a few cheese curds."}
{"text":"Cool little corner spot in an otherwise less destination worthy neighborhood (I should know....I used to live there!), Smokes showed up and many a drunk customer followed. Situated directly across from the fine establishment of Filmore's, this particular edition of Smokes stays open late, I believe 2am is the earliest it closes. It's standard fare, they do have a ton of different kinds of poutine but none as good as the real deal. Still, for what's available in Toronto it's not bad. I kind of want one right now, actually....I'll see you later"}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. Seriously the worst poutine I've ever had. Toronto should honestly be ashamed of itself for trying to make poutine in the first place. They just don't know how. 

First off, the girl at the counter was awesome. She was nice. Polite, gave me time to peruse the menu and make my choice. The problem wasn't with her. The problem was that the fries were dry, overcooked and old. The oil was at a temperature that was too high and was burnt or needed changing and you could taste it in the fries, and those two things ruined the poutine. I'd asked for easy on the gravy so there wasn't even that to save the meal (which I admit was my doing, but I wasn't anticipating the other problems).

$15 for all that and I threw half of it out. 

(Note: I'd been to this location before and the poutine was better, but still not that good. Ditto for all other Smoke's I've been to).

Not worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Ok this place I had high hopes for. This particular location is in a bit of a sketchy like section of town. Walk in no seats, only standing counter. In the time of ordering about 5 people had come in and asked to use the bathroom and were told to get out as this was for paying customers only. That sorta vibe. Food came, I got the jalapeno poutine option. Jalapenos were great, the fries were ok. The gravy and cheese were also just meh. Nothing wowing but definitely satisfying given that it was cold. Definitely a place to stop by for after a bar."}
{"text":"I like this poutine. 

As a long time poutine lover, I only cheat my vegetarian ways for poutine. Smoke's caters to my kind by offering a veggie gravy, so I never have to be a cheater. 

My friends that knock me for being a veg tried it and said the veggie gravy is better than the traditional. Take that meat eaters!

In conclusion, yes, I like Smoke's."}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall outlet serves variations of poutine.... For those unsure of what poutine is, think \"french fry stew\".  After a 90 minute flight into Toronto, we were starving and stopped in.  Only disappointment was there was no place to sit down - just a counter, so you should take out here.  But overall, the portion of my bacon cheeseburger poutine was more than suitable, even for a hungry traveler.  And the young woman behind the counter at the time, Monday 3/26 at 2:30 pm, was extremely courteous and helpful for two arriving visitors to Toronto."}
{"text":"I don't know if I have ever given a 5 star review before, but I just left this joint and I miss it already!  The Pawn Plaza is a colorful and fun spot next to LV's famous Pawn Stars shop on Las Vegas Boulevard.  I happened to be in the area and decided to be spontaneous and pop in and see what this \"Poutine\" thing is all about.  And WOW...I am so happy I did!  Ordered the traditional so I could experience how it all started at Smoke's and practically licked the inside of the container when I was done with the fries and curds.  It was that good.  And decadent!  Spotless restaurant, great staff and the best gravy this side of the Mississippi.  Can't wait to go back and try some of their more adventurous menu items.  Welcome to Vegas, Smoke's!  Where the heck have you been all of our lives!??!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place and just had to try it - wow! Talk about yummy comfort food. I had the rainbow veggie poutine which had gravy, cheese curds, sour cream, cheese, guacamole and siracha. Omg, it was so unusual and delicious!  Really great veggie gravy, too. My husband is from Philly and of course had to try the Philly cheesesteak poutine and loved it. I have to say, this place has such a good vibe.  It's so comfortable here,  I feel like it's always been here. The staff is great & everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"When planning our trip to Toronto, I told Brad that I want to try some real, authentic Poutine. I guess we should have done some homework and not just walk in to a place that advertised Poutine like we did.

We came here on Saturday at 12:30 pm ish.

I thought the service was awful. We asked the cashier what we should get if we just want fries, gravy, and cheese curds. I guess that was a stupid question because he looked at us like it was. The menu was very confusing.

I thought it was very overpriced. We got poutine and a bottle of water for $10. It took about 7 minutes for the food to come out.

I was disappointed with the food. The fries clearly weren't fresh. Almost like they just fry all their fries in the morning and just serve them all day.

The gravy was unseasoned an bland.

It's very sad when I've had better poutine in Buffalo, NY than in Toronto."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0 if I could, first they forgot about my order, then they gave us a poutine that was soggy, this was the third time I came here and it was the same way every time. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"After hearing my little sister rave about this place I had to come and check it out myself. Came in and scrolled thru the menu until I found what I wanted. The girl working there was really nice and patient. I ordered the meal size double pork poutine which is basically half bacon and half pulled pork. 

Moving on the actual poutine itself. I was disappointed that the gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese curds but the fries were fresh and piping hot. The meat that went on top was superb. Bacon was nice and crispy. The pulled pork was amazing, the sauce was nice and tangy, the meat was soft and melt in your mouth. The gravy wasn't overwhelming salty unlike most fast food places that offer poutine. Didn't like that it became a thick blob of gravy jelly when I got to the bottom. Either way I had a good experience and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Having eaten at many famous poutine shops in Montreal and the original Smoke's in Toronto, I decided to give some business to the newly opened Vegas version. Definitely a solid poutine, but it's still, as my grandma says, \"not the real.\" They're using Wisconsin cheese curds which were good, but just weren't the authentic experience I was hoping for. The guys that work at Smoke's are nice enough, and we had a long chat about Montreal poutine and the ingredients, so I bumped them up to a 4* experience. But at $8 plus tax for a \"meal\" size portion of traditional poutine, it seemed a little pricey compared to what I usually get in Montreal. Of course, we're in Vegas and not Montreal, so give this place a go if you've never had poutine. Probably the best you'll get outside of Ontario."}
{"text":"Small location, me and two friends came in at around 6:30ish, only one girl working both the cashier and meal prep. She was on her phone and listening to music when we came in. Guess that's a given when the place is practically deserted. Was quick to take our orders and prep it, although a bit skeptical if she thoroughly washed her hands before prepping oh well, I didn't get sick so that's the good part. I ordered the Korean poutine, it came with tender slabs of braised beef, sprinkling of scallions and a beautiful dollop of what I believe was the store's version of gochujang. Of course you have your traditional fries, cheese curds and beefy gravy as well. The first few bites were delicious until the gochujang kicked in. One of my friends also ordered it and she was straight out dying from how spicy it was, I found it quite bareable until I completely finished it. Overall pretty good, might come back."}
{"text":"Yum! I tried the pulled pork poutine when I went there. Was good. Great that they are open late as well."}
{"text":"New location right near my house! YEAH for me!!!

This was my first time trying Smoke's and after so many people talking good things about their original location, this was an immediate stop when I realized they had opened on Dundas.  

I ordered the regular Prime Beef.  First off I found the regular size to be waaaay too much.  You can easily share the regular size with another person.  The flavours were well mixed though there could have been a little more onion.  

Their pickup counter is quick though they clearly have some new staff that they are getting up to speed.  The staff are friendly too.

Also, how can you complain when there are free stickers for the taking!"}
{"text":"I like poutine. A lot. I lived on it in high school. 

Smoke's is good. I kinda hate the regular gravy. I always order veg gravy, I think it tastes way better. I do love all the toppings, it helps turn poutine into a legit meal.

I don't think it would be worth it to just get a regular poutine, with regular gravy, from Smoke's. There are much better poutine options if you're looking for simplicity."}
{"text":"Great great great. Comfort food to the max. The regular poutine is yummy and we really liked the Montreal... and there was a pot pie type one that I have pretty much not stopped talking about since I tried it. 

10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"It's poutine.  Maybe it's because I'm from the west coast, but I have a difficult time distinguishing 'good' and 'bad' poutine.  Hell - I like Costco poutine a lot (... dem crispy fries... drool...)  and I pretty much only eat poutine after I've been drinking or recovering from a night of drinking and I'm just looking for a greasy fix.

Smoke's is really in the middle of range for me.  I guess the curds, gravy and fries seem fine?  I dunno.

But the interesting thing is the choice of toppings -- I grabbed the triple pork -- which is bacon, sausage and pulled pork.  You can bet that I love porcine.  If you're drunk/hungover -- this is a gift from the heavens.  Eating this semi-sober... it was alright.

Also, do not let the box sizes fool you.  I opted for the large size since the boxes looked deceptively small and I'm just a big eater.  However, they mound up the poutine to the point where the staff needs to ask if takeout customers need the box closed for them.

My advice - do not get drunk and stumble in here demanding the large.  You'll hate yourself in the morning."}
{"text":"Hockey family and poutine lovers when in the true north always get some poutine and timmys. This place is great. Plenty of cheese curds, gravy was great, fries well seasoned. So go over and get some. They Should open a poutine cart on the strip. It's what helps after too many cocktails up north and just tastes damn good.  So glad we found it. People/workers are friendly and will help those not on the know about poutine lose their gravy deliciousness virginity."}
{"text":"Smokes has really good poutine! The portions are quite large for $8 you can get the regular size. I would recommend going here for dinner instead of lunch unless you love falling asleep at work. I love how they have seasonal poutines like the Thanksgiving poutine or Breakfast Poutine! Their gravy is vegetarian! So it's a great place if you love Poutine and are Vegetarian! I usually order the Veggie Delixe with jalapeños and guacamole!! It's delish!!"}
{"text":"@poutinerie #POUTINEFORTHEPEOPLE #POUTINE #YELPTO 

Why on earth have people declared that Smoke's is just the best poutine ever? So many good reviews, I just don't get it. The rave for this un-finishable to the point nauseating amounts of soggy-ass fries (not 1 single crispy fry), weird tasting cheese curds, and a translucent non-beef tasting gravy. I really don't get the hype that surrounds Smoke's making them an international chain in just 7 years. 

Ever so often, I see a Smoke's location and I want to give it a shot. This is how I pretty much came about the Queen location - convenient, close to my work place and an immediate go-to for my sudden poutine craving. I have almost regretted this choice after the first few bites every time before.... and this time was no different. 

I paid $10+ for a meal sized poutine with a cheeseburger topping. After few nauseating bites, I threw the entire thing out. The only thing that was kind of, sort of, redeeming about this experience was the cashier/cook. He was super friendly and helped me pick out my poutine from all the different options."}
{"text":"First visit the guy at the counter very patient and very helpful. 
We ordered the meal size bacon cheeseburger and a nacho grande enough to share between several people. It was very good my biggest complaint like others said is it is pricey"}
{"text":"HOLY SMOKES!  Yep, I went there.  What a great combination.  I had this from a pub when I first got into Toronto and this blows it away by far.  The fries were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and the gravy - forget it.  It was delicious.  

On top of that I had some of the best, and I mean best pulled pork I have ever had - mixed with some bacon.  I think this is probably one of the best dishes I have ever regretted eating! 

If I am ever in Toronto again, I will certainly be visiting this location again, otherwise I will have to open my own location in Chicago - this stuff is great."}
{"text":"Cool place to try different kinds of Poutine, especially if you're visiting Canada. The gravy was very very salty though, I don't think I would come here again."}
{"text":"Was not very pleased with this place. First off, it's hecka expensive for poutine. Imean poutine is just fries, some cheese, some gravy, and a bit of meat. It's easy to make at a cheap cost. Yet for some reason this place charges so much for it and it doesn't even taste that good. 

I came here a while ago and got the philly cheesesteak poutine which wasn't bad but recently I returned and tried their steak fajita poutine and I thought it was terrible. It tasted like cheap meat and taco bell salsa with some cheese on fries.

Also, I asked for a water cup since poutine is generally salty and you need something to wash it down. They told me that they didn't have any water and insisted that I buy one of their bottled drinks instead. srsly.

Pretty disappointed with this place not gonna lie."}
{"text":"Must say that YouTube is the reason I found this place! I've been on the prowl for a legit Poutinerie and found no luck. But I overheard a Canadian Youtuber talk about this chain's location in LA so I figured that I might as well bookmark it on Yelp JUST to find out they have a location downtown! YAY! 

They're located in the same plaza as the location of the Pawn Stars Shop! The cashier at Smoke's shared with us that it's free to park in the shared lot so just be careful of parking attendants trying to sell or hook you into some funny business, lol. 

As soon as you walk in you'll notice the huge menu! They have a huge variety of Poutine with different toppings available. Including vegetarian options! You can get your Poutine in three different sizes: the snack, meal, and wow! I got the meal size and it definitely is more than enough to share between two people! 

I went with the Traditional Poutine and WOW was it savory! The cheese curds and gravy were great. They were flavorful but not TOO salty! The fries were freshly made so they were crispy and hot. 

Everything was decently priced, service was good, the spot was clean. No worries nor complaints. Definitely will be back whenever I need a Poutine fix. 

Plus, you get a free sticker ^____^"}
{"text":"The poutine in itself is good, however, my rating falls due to the lack of thought when it comes to their mish mash of other dishes. The pulled pork really lacks taste, bacon is cold and dry, i mean why offer these other dishes if they don't actually enhance the dish."}
{"text":"Actually went out of our way to try this place, ordered a traditional poutine, cause we thought that's the classic, so it should the house special. Anyway it came out really fast which was nice, but it definitely didn't have enough cheese, it was mostly gravy. We also ordered a pop which was SUPER flat, which is really weird because it came from the bottle. However even though the food wasn't great the staff was very friendly, which helped make the experience a bit better for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during our visit in Niagra. Very greasy, salty, yet tasty. Would recommend getting the small size & not the large size. Shared it with 10 people and we still didn't finish it! Pretty pricey also, $16 dollars. Next time I'm just going for the traditional poutine bs going all crazy with the other ingredients. I had the cheeseburger bacon poutine."}
{"text":"What a quintessential Canadian experience this place is. It's good for vegetarians as well as adventurous meat eaters with many interesting options on the menu. I chose the vege deluxe, with mushrooms and peas. There are three other vege choices too. Just the regular serving is hearty and I couldn't finish it all. Very yummy, definitely comfort food. Lets just say, it's not for the calorie conscious. I am pleased my cab driver insisted I come."}
{"text":"Smoke's Poutinerie, une nouvelle découverte pour manger une poutine! J' y suis allée avec plusieurs amis et il y a un vaste choix, y en a pour tous les goûts! Je prends toujours la traditionnelle, c'était bon mais pour moi, ce n'est pas la meilleure poutine que j'ai mangé à Montréal et ça manquait un peu de fromage vers la fin!

Le décor est sympathique, et l'endroit est assez propre pour un fast food! 

Par contre, le service fut assez médiocre ce soir là, la serveuse était  nonchalante, pas un petit sourire, rien! 

Bref, si je suis dans le coin et qu'une envie de poutine me vient, j'y repasserai sûrement! Surtout qu' ils sont ouverts jusque 4h du mat' le vendredi et samedi, donc après une bonne soirée, une poutine ça passe toujours bien!"}
{"text":"So many options dealing with just potatoes. And thats the beauty of this place. Instead of just fries, gravy and cheese. Smoke's Poutinerie really shows you A to Z of poutines.

There are so many toppings and types of what you can order and they really work out well despite how they sound when you read it off the menu.

They for sure are not cheap with the cheese curds and gravy. They just go all out. Fries are perfectly done but cannot guarantee as they are drenched in the sauce (which makes it perfect). Tastes heavenily when you are in the mood to raise your blood pressure like Homer Simpson's."}
{"text":"Got the beef, mushroom, caramelized onion poutine and was really impressed! regular poutine can get a little boring, so this place is awesome cuz it has so much variety!

I wanna come back and try all their other ones."}
{"text":"After nearly four months, I think I finally got over my poutine overload during Nelson Q's awesome UYE. [Disclaimer: I was motivated today by a free promo open to all social media followers of this business.]

Smoke's Poutinerie is a chain that originated in Canada (to hardly anyone's surprise) and has a number of outposts in its southerly neighbor. One of the more recently added locations is nestled in the corner of the first floor of Pawn Plaza, a small and colorful set of shops near the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (made famous by the TV show Pawn Stars) and owned by Rick Harrison of said pawn shop.

The first time that I tried this eatery (or any sort of poutine, for that matter) was in a very difficult scenario - namely, an amateur team eating competition. It was a race, so we had precious little time to wolf down the fries, gravy, and cheese curds. I knew I'd have to wait until a future opportunity for a real shot at experiencing this Canadian creation, and I found a great chance when I learned of their free poutine offer.

After mentioning/showing their Facebook post and whipping out my Nevada ID (free upgrade from snack size to meal size), it was a few short minutes until my piping hot food was ready. I slowly started to eat the poutine, and I was quickly glad that they'd offered the bacon as a topping. The flavor of their poutine gets a bit boring otherwise, as does the texture of their soft, thick-cut fries (think Five Guys, not steakhouse). The gravy doesn't do much for me, but the cheese was very nice.

But that bacon was boss. It held the whole thing together. When I ran out of bacon near the end of the box (which indeed is a meal-size portion), I had to douse the soggy remnants in ketchup and a light squeeze of sriracha sauce just to get through the end. It's a chore if you don't add toppings, so trust me when I suggest ponying up for the specialty poutines (such as delightful bacon poutine).

I'm not sure if Smoke's Poutinerie delivers a great traditional poutine, but it can put forth a delicious meal nonetheless. It's something I'll have to keep in my mental map, and it's worth your while if you're a fan of starchy, fatty goodness."}
{"text":"After hearing through the grapevine that this place offered vegan poutine I was a little disappointed to discover that they don't.  However, they do offer veg mushroom-based gravy with bits of mushroom in it.  Yum!  The veg gravy is extremely tasty and unlike most mushroom gravy, it isn't too salty.  Unfortunately, they don't have any soy cheese but that would have been too good to be true, know what I mean?

The menu, which I think changes often, is interesting, but on the pricey side.

And no, it's no Belle De Provence."}
{"text":"The whole poutine concept is great!  Who doesn't like french fries smothered with gravy and their favorite toppings?!?  It's literally a meal in itself and a perfect ending to a drunken night on town.  

After debating over several poutineries, Smoke's won us over as it was the most recommended spot by Toronto locals.  Although we were full beyond full from our last meal just 30 minutes before, we had to stop by for our first Smoke's experience!!  Good thing we did cuz the place definitely did not disappoint.  Service was awesome, we chatted with the cashier and she gave us recommendations for things to do in the Toronto area.  Just a warning though - there's no seating (aside for a bar counter) at this location and the neighborhood is pretty sketch.  I'm no expert when it comes to Toronto, but I can definitely spot a not so safe neighborhood when I see one.  We didn't have any problems since we came during the day, just a few people asking us for money while we were waiting for our food outside but overall, nothing too crazy.  However, given that this location does stay open late, the owners should consider providing more seating.  In the meantime, if you plan on coming here at night, just be careful.  

Menu is quite extensive and we had a hard time deciding.  Between the 5 of us, we shared the Triple Pork and the Steak Peppercorn.  Both were yummy and they def. weren't shady with the toppings, it was piled up high in each order.  My only gripe was the steak one was a bit too salty, I had to chug extra water to wash it down.   Being the rookies that we were, we didn't order the fries extra crispy which made the fries soggy fast. :(  The first couple of bites were delicious, but once the fries started getting soggy, it was much harder to finish.  

It's a place I'd visit again if I'm in the area, but I don't think it won me over enough to hunt down a location the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I don't care if it's fast-food poutine or not, Smoke's has never disappointed. On the most recent night I visited--extremely late on a Sunday--there was just one poor girl both taking bad making orders. The line filled up behind me really quickly with the post-Bestival crowd so I have no idea how that arrangement worked for the rest of the night fared. 

This time I wanted to try something different so I went with Montreal Smoked Meat. It completely hit the spot! Small size was perfect for two, plenty of meat and the fries were hot and fresh. 

 The Toronto version may not be \"authentic\", but sometimes a regular, drunk-food combo of fries, meat and gravy is exactly what you're looking for."}
{"text":"First stop in Toronto. Great service, choice of meat or veggie gravy. We got to taste both but i preferred the meat one. I had the nacho poutine with meat gravy, which had guacamole, sour cream, salsa and jalapeno. It was amazing!!!!
The only down side is the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My favourite poutine place in the city -- not including all the over-the-top, pretentious, and at times snobby, twists on poutine that you find here and there.

I am a bit of a purist. I like my poutine unadulterated with too many extra toppings. Often, I spring just for a traditional, and I find it very satisfying. The fries are just right. The gravy, although a bit sweeter than other places, is much to my liking. And the curds are simply awesome. I think they've improved on the curds since their inception -- they were not squeaky at first. Top it all off with something cold from the Pop Shoppe to wash it all down, and you've got a winner of a meal! 

I just wish they had a bit more seating..."}
{"text":"I like Smoke's, it's one of my favourite poutine places. But after visiting this location on a few occasions, I've come to realize that I'm really just a fan of the Adelaide location.

I don't know what the issue is here since they should be using the same recipe and ingredients. The few times I've been here, I've found the fries to be super dry and rather overcooked. Makes the whole thing much less palatable."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! You can't go wrong with the traditional, but I definitely recommend \"wowing it\" (add mushrooms and caramelized onions)."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure what to make of Smoke's Poutinerie. This was my first taste of poutine of any sort so I don't have much to judge it by.

I came here the other day to pick up lunch for myself and some co-workers. Our order consisted of three meal sized poutines. One bacon poutine for my boss, one traditional for a co-worker and one country style for me. On the website I saw a perogy poutine which is what I really wanted but it isn't available at this location. It took kind of a long time to get my order as there were a few people ahead of me when I got there. I was told they cut and fry the potatoes fresh to order so it could take while. They weren't lying. Our meals took a long time but sure were steaming hot when I got them. I only wish I wasn't waiting for one more meal for a friend who went with me. My food started to cool by the time got back to the office.

Regardless of the cooling, our poutine was still pretty hot when I delivered lunch. Hot enough that the cheese curds were still gooey. The first bites of the fries with gravy and cheese were amazing. Plus I had all this other goodness on mine. Bacon, chicken, peas, mushrooms and grilled onions. It was a huge meal and I wasn't able to eat it all in one sitting. Neither was my boss. We were both pretty full about half way through. We were also very thirsty. It turns out this poutine stuff is very salty. Salty fries. Salty gravy. Salty bacon. Mildly salty cheese curds. It was just too much. I kind of wish I had ordered just a snack size traditional poutine. Although, my co-worker who ordered the tradtional said she was a little disappointed. And she is from Canada where this snack is from. To be fair though, she said she was usually disappointed with the poutine in Canada too. The concept, I think, is better than the product itself.

Some final notes to put a cap on this review, parking is aweful at this plaza. Its a small lot and a busy area. Get there early and prepare to wait.  Expect to eat outside. Some of the places here, including but not limited to Smoke's Poutinerie, do not have any seating. Do not go by the menu you see online. Not all poutines are available here and the prices show about a dollar lower than what this one charges. Get a drink. You're gonna need it."}
{"text":"Honestly, Smoke's used to be good. But they've gotten lazy. I just had a poutine there that barely had any toppings, and the cheese didn't melt at all. There were probably 10 cheese curds on my whole poutine - it barely even counted as poutine. I used to love this place. Now I'm not even sure if I'll come back here in the future. Disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Ran down for a quick bite with my husband.  Ordered smoked meat peppercorn WOW size, $14 with tax.  Meat was nothing like for example Schwartz's smoked meats in Montreal.  Gravy was soooo salty.  I am certain my BP went up 50 points.  Otherwise, tasty  but in my opinion overpriced."}
{"text":"Can't WAIT until Poutineville, from Quebec, opens up in Toronto and can, hopefully, put these barns out of business ! Poutinerie are similar to Pizza Huts all over Ontario...... they're all BAD !! You couldn't get me to eat at Smokes if you had a gun to my head !  Unfortunately, YELP won't let me rate Smokes without a rating so I'll give you my REAL opinion....0 out of 5."}
{"text":"Although locations are popping up all the time now, Smoke's Poutine is a must-see (or eat) Toronto experience in my books.

- It's poutine, and it is delicious.

- They will make anything into a poutine. There are enough flavours to keep you busy across multiple visits, and give you something new if you're already somewhat of a poutine veteran.

- The standard size will be enough for most people, but don't feel guilty ordering the large. Sometimes a large is what you need!

- The Toronto locations (the King Street location especially) are conveniently located around a number of bars, and they're open late on the weekends. Perfect for staggering into with your friends after a night on the town."}
{"text":"I eat here about 2-3 times per month (healthy I know) and am usually satisfied. The only complaint I've had over my visits is that one of the employees was inconsiderate and rude. There are a lot of friendly employees however that somehow manage to smile while working in the scortching kitchen. That's something else; the Adelaide location is poorly ventilated so the dining rooms is unpleasant to eat in during the warmer months. Personally, I'd avoid anything on the menu that contains chili. It just ruins the poutine in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always get the double pork. It's good but the gravy on the fries gets gelatinized and disgusting by the time you get to the bottom of the container. Luckily they cram in enough food that I'm always full by that point anyway. Every time I've been here the same girl has been working (no idea what her name is but she's kind of short with brown hair) and she's always really friendly, which I appreciate. 

Bottom line, the food is decent and fairly inexpensive but it's nothing special. That being said, I'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Poutine is a Canadian staple, and Smoke's is a poutine staple in Toronto. Who doesn't love fries and cheese curds drenched with gravy?

I've been here a few times and ordered a few different things. My favourite remains to be the slaughterhouse, but I think it's a seasonal item. In general, flavour is great--rich and not extremely salty. Toppings are okay--a fair amount. I docked off two stars because of 1) the price and 2) the cheese curds. Let's talk cheese curds first: they don't completely melt. I think actual problem is that the gravy isn't hot enough. I get a little more disappointed every time I open the box. Second: pricing. My recent experiences of Smoke's consistently include a split second of \"did I just overpay for that\" when I receive my order. Regardless, Smoke's is great for the occasional cheat day."}
{"text":"I Love poutine every now and then....but as of lately I seem to enjoy it all the time. Which is not good...but it's so yummy, how can you say no?!  

Especially here, the poutine here is delicious. Iv heard its the closest to the authentic Montreal poutine, in which I haven't tried a real poutine from Montreal as of yet so I can't judge. 

The portions are huge, very huge. They basically give it to you in a small box that you can't eat by yourself. I ended getting the Montreal poutine which consists of Pulled pork, Pickles and Mustard. Which sounds odd to combine but I love all the three toppings so why not add it all together right?

 Wrong, so wrong. The pickle adds an odd taste when you combine with the pulled pork. Leaving the poutine with a sour taste, I couldn't believe how can I mess up my own poutine!!! I was heart broken!  I ended up not eating mine and started to eat my brother's double bacon cheeseburger poutine...now that's good!! Just to let you know,  the location is really small so everybodys squished! Also last time I came here the washroom was out of service, isn't that a hazard??? Hopefully they've fixed that, or else it would be a damn shame especially since everybodys eating poutine right!!! Lol

 Next time I come back here I'll just get a regular poutine and just take my sweet time to savor the natural flavour of the poutine."}
{"text":"4 Stars from the poutine lover!!! Oh and I mean love! I may not be from Quebec but every now and then I like trying everybody's version of the amazing dish called \"Poutine\". 

From what Iv heard, this is probably as close as to Quebec style of poutine you're gonna get. They do after all use real Quebec cheese curds. The gravy is so rich its almost too good to be true. I blame my friend for introducing me to Smoke's last year...why???? Breaking my diet is not something I wanted to do...it just sort of happened?? 

Ohh but it was well worth it. Large Nacho Grande(hold the jalapeños) & large bacon cheeseburger poutines were ordered at the same time. Mine was the Nacho. I maybe ate a quarter of it and just couldn't do it anymore....it was HUGEE! 
Omg what was i doing, why did I order large?? I was thinking Cardiac arrest soon? Nopeee I just went home & put the rest in my fridge so someone else could eat it the next day. 

One thing I can't understand is why oh why the cheese curds don't melt?? Mind you the box is always so hot. That is mind bottling to me. 

Next time though, I'm just going to try the traditional poutine, small this time! I found the bacon cheeseburger was too much for me it actually took away the natural poutine flavor. I still love you Smoke's!"}
{"text":"Had the Veggie gravy poutine - disappointed that there was very limited Cheese Kurds."}
{"text":"Tried the pull pork poutine here, and it was okay. The meat tasted like one of those prepackaged pulled pork you get from the grocery store. The cheese curds were good, and the gravy was nice. The fries were oddly a little cold, with some warm spots, so that made the experience a little dull. In the inside it was dark, but it looked clean. If you're ever in canada I would take a look at another poutine shop, but if you're tired of having traditional poutine and want to try an \"american\" take on poutine with pulled pork of philly cheese steak, this place isnt bad."}
{"text":"These guys specialized only in Poutine. I went with four coworkers and ordered five different styles. If you didn't know what a poutine is... It's just fries.  It is generally slavered with gravy and cheese. Canadian Yelpers...please don't judge this U.S. of A. review!

You can dress your poutine with various toppings. The tastiest was the pull pork and the double pork, which was pull pork with bacon! We definitely \"porked\" out! I would also recommend the chicken curry!

Each poutine was $5.99 for most and couple dollar more for a bigger box!

Cash or Canadian ATM only!"}
{"text":"The guy there was super friendly, didn't catch his name but he definitely made the experience even better. 

I shared a LARGE Bacon Cheeseburger Poutine with a friend, we added mushrooms and it tasted super good! Perfect for sharing! The SMALL is good enough for one person if not two people.

Definitely not a place I would go back to on a regular basis due to the unhealthy factor but its nice to indulge once in awhile. Worth checking out with a friend because seriously the SMALL poutine is good enough."}
{"text":"I came into Smoke's at around 2am after a day of hardcore vacation drinking and needless to say, this was definitely worth the walk from the hotel! 

There's just no better drunk food than poutine, especially when it comes with toppings like pierogies and butter chicken!

Canada is a blessing for creating poutine, and next time I'm in town, Smoke's will definitely be my go-to, late night spot."}
{"text":"Is poutine the equivalent of post hangover food in Canada? Because I can't imagine anything better to eat after a night of drinking. The traditional poutine includes fries, cheese curds and gravy. Smoke's Poutinerie has the traditional option and also specialty options that include everything from bacon, chicken, beef, steak, eggs, mexican style, vegetarian style, etc. We were told their most popular one is double pork (bacon, pulled pork). 
The sizes range from snack, meal size, wow size (example box sizes to the left of the cash register). The snack size can only be done with a traditional or traditional + one topping. The specialty poutines can only be ordered in meal or wow size. 

We ordered the pulled pork and were 100% happy with our decision. The pulled pork was flavored well, sweet and a perfect match to the poutine. The fries were thicker than skinny fries, thinner than wedges. We asked for light cheese curds and they graciously put them on the side for us (I'm not big on cheese, yet I think I would have been ok with the regular amount of cheese) and the gravy was heavy enough that no fries were dry, yet no fries were over drenched either. Good job guys! 

Smoke's Poutinerie is in the Pawn Plaza shopping center (A mini container park?) which is connected to the Pawn Shop shown on the famous TV show. There is seating only outdoors and not very many for the number of restaurants in the Pawn Plaza center. There is plenty of FREE parking on both sides of the Pawn shop! 

I personally would not be able to eat Poutine as a meal and would consider it more of a snack. My friend and I shared the meal size together and it was perfect for us. Sit outside and people watch the tourists, get some dessert next door and check out the famous pawn shop. Easy, free, convenient parking and lots to check out in the area- seems like a great date night! Just don't tell your girlfriend you got the date night idea from me! ;)"}
{"text":"I must have a weird taste bud cause I don't get the hype about poutine. Or maybe it was just this place. It was my first time trying poutine and I went with the traditional with no topping. I got the snack size for $4.99 ($5.65 after the 2 taxes) in case I didn't like it, which end up being more than enough. It was okay. Not enough cheese which was disappointing. Not sure in taste, but the concept is very similar to New Jersey's disco fries. Now when I get back home, I'll get some disco fries to compare. The location itself is sketchy. I wouldn't want to be there at 2am for poutine. It's not a dine-in type of place. There's a small shelf against the window where you can stand and eat. The service was good. The guy at the register was friendly."}
{"text":"French fries. Gravy. Cheese.

How can that be bad? 

Every time I am in Toronto I have to stop by and get some poutine. It is just crazy delicious and a true Canadian treat. 

This place is great because they have a large menu from your classic poutine to enhanced poutine with delicious meats, chilis, and gravies.

I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"my first (and thus far only) go at poutine! I got a yummy vegetarian version, improved by sriracha. I know the next time I'm drunk, I'll be craving this stuff--unfortunately I'll no longer be in Canada! Poutine may not photograph well, but it tastes good :) I'll order extra curds next time"}
{"text":"Presiding over a street corner on the outskirts of downtown, Smoke's Poutinerie churns out a smorgasbord of Canada's national treasure to its never-ending flow of fans.

The Triple Pork Poutine, which is more jam packed with fillings than any Monday morning train, features saucy and tender pulled pork, intensely seasoned and moderately crispy bacon, and an abundance of carrot-top coins of juicy sausage. The slightly soggy fries struggle to maintain crispiness beneath the mounds of meat, salty puddles of gravy, and cheese curd curls, but the teeming meat to potato ratio is unassailable.

With only a small, window-facing counter available for dining in and the door opening intermittently to allow a fresh breeze penetrate the oily air inside, veteran customers with admirable self-control take orders to go, while the starving huddle with elbows touching like hyenas gathered at a scavanged find and dive right in."}
{"text":"Another Smoke's!  I think someday I'll have to get a regular poutine, but I've enjoyed their various specialties over the years.  

Got the Mac Daddy the last time I was in.  It was going okay until the server put a last layer of some green stuff on it, and I'm not sure what that was. The meal was filling, at the very least, and I'm still alive two days later, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I eat poutine, if I can control myself, four times a year.  Once per season.  I will happily give Smoke's half of my annual poutine intake.  

It's a gimmick, I'll admit, putting a variety of stuff on top of poutine.  God, it's not another \"thing\", is it?  Friggin hipsters. 

But the poutine is tasty.  Now, admittedly, I keep getting flavoured kinds, so I can't tell much about the gravy or the squeakiness of the curds.  But I'm not a jerk from Quebec, so I don't like to complain about how \"you can't get a good poutine in Hontario, calice tabernak\".  I will say that the pulled pork is nice and sweet, and the nacho poutine is a nice combination (although possibly excessive).  

A small will do a normal human being just fine, and the variety is great.  Go, get something there.  

Just don't take any friends in wheelchairs.  It's tiny, and it's up a flight of stairs."}
{"text":"Thus establishment has a nice seating that allows you to enjoy the various poutines while watching the people walk by looking at you enjoying your poutine. I recommend coming here to enjoy something different from burgers and expensive steaks once in a while."}
{"text":"After a late night of partying a group of us swarmed Smoke's at 3 am. It was very busy but the staff managed to serve out all the orders in a short amount of time.

My friend and I decided to share a large Hogtown which almost came up to $10. Hogtown was yummy! The fries are topped off with the usual ingredients for a poutine, mushrooms, sausage, and bacon. I would suggest to order the regular size because we definitely did not finish the large poutine. Looks like my friend had a soggy poutine for breakfast.

What worries me is that Smoke's only got a conditional pass when they got inspected by the City of Toronto.

Smoke's poutines should be savoured once in a while because it's sooo bad for your arteries."}
{"text":"This is was my first poutine experience. This whole food concept was an unknown to me before seeing it on Yelp. When I decided on Rick's Pawn Plaza as the location of my food crawl I knew that I needed to give this place a try.

Since this was my first time I decided on the snack size of The Traditional. I wanted to get a taste for the traditional to see what it was all about before venturing into other options. The fries tasted homemade and had a nice crisp to hold up to the brown gravy. The cheese curds were the perfect size so that the cheese to fry ratio wasn't overwhelming.

It was fun to try a new food item. I'd definitely like to try some other combinations next time since they offer so many options."}
{"text":"Decent poutine, expected to be blown away for the price but it was just good."}
{"text":"This should be a zero star review. This place is a scam. The sauce is always disgusting. The fries are always soggy and taste like old oil. Judging by other commenters here, I can see that I'm not the only one who thinks that Smoke's should just go out of business. Stop calling your gross mixture a poutine."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was delicious. I got the Thanksgiving poutine with vegetarian gravy (because it's far superior than their regular gravy)."}
{"text":"Not great. Kind of satisfying.  Fast food place without the fast food prices.  The potatoes are hard, softened by a brown starch thickened sauce.  The chili cheese was not impressive.  The flavors were weak."}
{"text":"I have eaten enough fries gravy and cheese to know what I like and I did not like my Poutine, nor, however, did I particularly dislike it either.  The fries were good (I like thin and well cooked), but the cheese (Not squeaky) and gravy (bland!) were forgettable.

I ordered the putine Montreal style, which meant it came with a mound of Smoke meat and a dill pickle.  The meat and pickle were tasty, but after eating it, I wasn't sure what the point was to adding it to the poutine.  It didn't \"enhance\" my enjoyment, it just made me want a good smoke meat sandwich! 

Any way,  it's good to have an alternative to Burrito Boyz, but I doubt I'd be lining up at Smoke's again any time soon."}
{"text":"As many Yelpers who follow my reviews know, I have a thing for poutine. It is one of those perfect drunk/junk foods: starchy, greasy, fatty, delicious.

I've been wanting to try Smokes ever since I heard that they existed, and one happened to be in walking distance of the HHOF, so I suggested it to Lee, and off we went.

Now, I am of course still a Dumb American and I haven't even had \"real\" (Montreal) poutine yet. So you'll have to take my review of this sort of thing with a grain of salt.

This place is in a walkup above a Burrito Boyz, so if you're hungry, you are going to be faced with a dilemma. This was no problem for me, but it might be for you. 

Anyway, once you head inside and brave the angry door (it liked to randomly slam whenever someone entered or exited) you are faced with what I like to refer to as The Tyranny of Choice.

What kind of poutine do you want to get? You can get traditional (what Lee got) or select from a ton of different choices, ranging from Philly Cheesesteak to simple bacon (what I got) or pulled pork, or vegetarian. . .. or or or or or or 

You see what I mean, right? You could go weekly and probably never have the same poutine twice in a year.

And it is excellent. Fries and good gravy and squeaky cheese. 

This place gets points off for the cashier bailing on us as soon as we put in our order and not giving me my water, leaving me dying, and also for having rolled up floor mats stored on one of the benches, making it somewhat difficult to get a good seat.

All around delicious though, and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I tried the bacon cheese burger poutine suggested by the staff. Never thought this combination would come together, I was surprise it is really good. Bacon was crispy, 'Burgers and cheese' give enough texture and taste, it was loaded with enough hot gravy and cheesebud from top to bottom. After trying this you don't want to have fries any where else."}
{"text":"Great new location for late night munchies after dancing/concert-going! Although the long list of options (including nacho, cheeseburger, pulled pork and others) is tempting, I still keep coming back to \"The Traditional\". It's $7 for a large and that's enough for 2-3 hungry peeps. I wish there were more cheese curds, but otherwise the poutine here is pretty satisfying! It gets crowded, but the line moves fast and efficiently. They will take your order then give you a number. Seating is limited, but in the summer, it gets pretty hot in there anyways, so my friends and I would usually just take it to go. There is also a huge blackboard on one of the walls, so you can doodle while you wait for your number to be called."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I witnessed an employee assault a customer by throwing hot gravy at him and his wife's head. There are pictures to prove it. He was middle eastern thin with scruffy facial hair. Hopefully he has since been fired and charged. Will never return here again 
Not only did the employee assault his customer but he ran outside to continue to physically assault them in front of their baby. I've never seen anything so classless in my life. Onceagain there are pictures to prove this."}
{"text":"I take back everything bad I ever said about Smokes. 

I know I said that I didn't care for it at first, but I realized I was missing the crucial ingredient - drunk.

Holy mother of gravy - add blackout drunk and you are shoving hot burning magic cheese omg delicousness down your throat. Who cares if anyone sees you - you can basically be a ravenous dog when you attack your poutine because let's be real - if someone you know is actually going to be at Smokes at 2am on a Friday night, their chin is going to be covered in gravy too.

COWD: Come only when drunk"}
{"text":"Pretty tiny Smoke's - not as nice as the one near Queen. We ordered our poutine and there was barely any gravy on it, and maybe four cheese curds. Tsk tsk tsk.

Service and quality are very hit and miss at this particular location, and there isn't a lot of room to sit. This Smoke's definitely tends to be cleaner than the one near Queen, and the clientele is a definitely more tame."}
{"text":"This was my first Smoke's experience!!  And boyyyyy was I satisfied!  Just a warning - it's in a really sketchy neighborhood.  Our hotel guy even tried to warn us, haha.

The service was fine, but I really hated how there wasn't any seating available.  Just a bar/counter top, and we had to stand.  meh.

We ordered:
- Beef peppercorn: would not order again.  It was just really salty.
- Bacon: bacon & fries are my 2 faaaaaavorite things to eat in this WORLD (...okay, and chicken wings, too).  Combine them, and it's a party in your mouth!

Why only 3 stars? The portions here are smaller than other locations."}
{"text":"Things you need to know about me:

1. I used to live in San Diego.
2. The BEST DRUNK FOOD EEEEEEVERRRRRRR in SD happens to be carne asade/pollo asado fries.  At least in my humble opinion.
3. In fact, all I ever want to eat when I'm drunk is pollo asado fries.
4. My top 3 guilty pleasure foods: chicken wings, fries, bacon.

Anyways, so I'm in Toronto.  And when in Canada, do as the Canadians do (eh)!!  And so when I had decided that Smoke's was the Canadian version of my beloved pollo asado fries, I knew I had to go back.

After what I thought was a satisfying experience at Smoke's on Dundas, I whined/guilted/cried/begged/whatever-you-wanna-call-it my boyfriend into taking me back to Smoke's after I had some alcohol in my system.  The hotel guy recommended we come to Adelaide.  So off we went!

And the food was good.  So much better than Dundas.  We ordered a \"regular\" double pork poutine.  The serving size was HUGE..honestly, almost 150% the size of the Dundas location.  The gravy was salty (later on, I realized it's bc it was the peppercorn gravy), but you honestly cannot go wrong with bacon & french fries.  Service was friendly, food came out quickly, etc.  I am so satisfied.  Thank you, Smoke's, for existing."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we arrived to Toronto late. This was our first meal in Canada and we loved it. The worker was very helpful in explaining all of the different types and answering our questions. The double pork and cheeseburger poutines were our favorite. Wish I could have gone back before we left. It was great!"}
{"text":"The array of toppings these guys offer on poutine seems to me to border on sacrilege . Maybe im old and in the way but some of the items seem excessive and a little 'I can eat way more shit than you can fellow frat brother.
Or like I say maybe im just old, stuck in my ways and irrelevant. 
So I ordered the snack side straight up poutine as my wife said she didn't want poutine for breakfast. meh meh meh . 
It was $5.00 . Contained plenty of everything. I mixed it and the gravy and cheese curds melted nicely over the hot fries. Very good fries as well. The gravy was perfect and the cheese curds were squeaky. 
The staff were good. Not overly friendly but probably commensurate with their wages and lack of tips. 
My only complaint was the shitty 80s rock they had cranking in the place. Like the worst of the 80's  ,but to each their own .
Yeah, you should go!"}
{"text":"Now I have always been a fan of Poutine and this place is by far the elite in Poutine perfection!! A real comfort food for me and Smoke's does it best.

I really enjoy the variety of options available, this warm and hearty meal in a box super fast. Great service every time I went with friendly and knowledgable staff.
 I am not super thrilled with the parking situation but the food more then makes up for it.
For any poutine lover I would say Smoke's All the way!!!"}
{"text":"After all the recommendations I was getting, me and a coworker decided to try this place out. This is a place you would walk/subway to, there's not a lot of street parking.

As the name implies, it is pure poutine. Even their \"Nachos\" are actually just mixed sauces put on fries to make it have that Nacho-y taste. We got the Nacho poutine, and it was extremely large and filling. It was pretty good, just very thick and made us feel oily/fat afterwards, which is expected of poutine I guess. The service is pretty good, our poutine came within 7 min. 

The place is quite popular, and fills up quickly due to low numbers of seating. It is fairly clean, although there are people that litter outside the door sometimes."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times and have wanted to try it, but never felt like a sit-down meal of just poutine but when I finally tried it, I was hooked!
Yes, the place is really small and you have to take your poutine to-go but even when you get home it's still good!  So, let's start with the fries: they are top-notch!  The fries are the foundation of the poutine and they have it perfect... like New York Fries!  Their cheese curds could be a little but more melted, but I think that's what happens when you have to bring it home first and the gravy is just great (not too salty).

I've tried the pulled-pork, which gives it a nice sweet and tangy taste.  There's also the double pork, which is pulled pork and bacon; and the triple pork, which is pulled pork, bacon and sausage.  I've tried the peppercorn beef, and beef with onions and mushroom - they were good too.

I agree with the people who say that the meat doesn't really add to the poutine... it's just there.  But, hey the meat is good and when it comes down to it, they've got their basic poutine down and if they want to add extra stuff to it, that's cool... you don't have to order it!  I think I may just get the regular poutine next time.  

(Just as a side note: all their poutines come with the fries, gravy, cheese and everything else is added on top of that)."}
{"text":"The poutine here is pretty good. I'm not a poutine expert, but I've had a poutine a couple of times in Montreal and in Boston, and I thought that this Toronto poutine was similar in quality. There are a lot of choices on the menu, including chicken, pork, beef, steak, and vegetarian. I opted for the triple pork (pulled pork, bacon, and sausage) in the \"meal size\" ($8.99). I was satisfied with my order - a generous portion of fries covered in thick, savory gravy and cheese curds, with a gigantic portion of the three different types of meats on top. I definitely think you get more meat if you order the triple pork as opposed to the double pork or pulled pork only. The bacon was salty and slightly sweet with a maple glaze, the pulled pork was smoky, and the sausage was well-seasoned. Overall, the poutine was delicious for the first couple of bites but in the end became too rich and fatty to finish. I definitely recommend not ordering anything larger than the meal size - I split the meal size with my friend and that was enough for the both of us. My other friend ordered the wow size and he ended up leaving 2/3 of it unfinished."}
{"text":"Soooo bad for you (obviously, because it's poutine!), but oh so good! The place itself is obviously nothing fance, but if you just want a yum poutine, go! Smoke's will not disappoint! Triple pork poutine is simply amazing! Note: Their large size is super large, I shared it with a friend and we barely finished it!"}
{"text":"When in Canada, try the Poutine, right?!   This place came highly recommended and I am happy to report that they did live up to the hype.  However, I have not had much experience with Poutine.

We ordered what appeared to be the kings of Poutine.  It included the basic Poutine, but was topped with pulled pork, bacon, and sausage.  Every bite was chalk full of flavor.  I only wished the fries were crispier.  Other then that, it was the best Poutine I have experience.

The restaurant serves a huge selection of Poutine, everything from the classic to the most indulgent version.  Very casual setting, fast food setup."}
{"text":"Perfect place to get your poutine fix, especially if you've been out of Canada for a long time."}
{"text":"WOW! First time trying this spot and it's absolutely amazing. The servings are huge and even myself, a huge eater, can barely get through the regular size. Definitely a must-have spot! I also love that they offer Jones Soda, as opposed to your typical Coke or Pepsi brands."}
{"text":"When in Canada you must get poutine. From my experience Smoke's has locations everywhere and their poutine is solid. They have interesting combinations available and I like that they have a few different sizes. At this location I tried their Pierogi Poutine and KBBQ Poutine. 

The Pierogi Poutine was great. It was a traditional poutine with pierogis, sour cream, and bacon. I'm no authority on Polish food so I can't say if the pieorgies was authentic, but it tasted very good. Just the right amount of sour cream was spread on top and it was nicely distributed among the fries/pierogies. The bacon was good and crispy. The fries were nice and tasted fresh. The gravy was flavorful and not too thick. The cheese curds are probably my favorite part of poutine. The dish was served hot so the cheese was getting nice and melty all over. I'd certainly order this again. 

The KBBQ Poutine was awesome as well. The beef was flavorful and sliced very thinly and the perfect size for a forkful to the mouth. The kimchi flavor wasn't overpowering but it added some punch to the dish. There were also some peppers for a little heat. Overall the dish was very good. 

I've never been disappointed by Smoke's, I just wish their prices were a little lower. I also wish poutine was more readily available in Jersey."}
{"text":"How often is the oil changed? I would have asked if you ever answer the phone or allow messages to be left. My friend brought me lunch. It is the original poutine and it was DISGUSTING. Oil needs changing badly. Nobody answers the phone and conveniently there isn't a voicemail option."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of poutine growing up, had the occasionally \"deluxe\" variants in middle school and NY Fries with sour cream etc. But I have to give it to Smoke's for offering a wide range of combinations and toppings that go together with good old fries, curds, and gravy. 

For the most part all the locations provide similar results in terms of food quality. I usually end up going to the Dundas location. 

The medium should be good for 1 or 2 people depending on your eating habits. The large, being $4 more, fills you up... trust me. 

Cant really say which variant is the best its highly subjective. Everyone has different tastes. Personally I go for the Chicken Fajita Poutine and Rainbow Poutine. That first bite is all it takes. My friends tried the other variants such as pork and beef and said the same thing. Would highly recommend eating right away, once packed can get soggy quickly.  

Overall I like the concept and the food. Only reason 4/5 is due to inconsistency in terms of portions sometimes from location to location / even at the same location different days. Despite that for good poutine have to recommend Smokes. 

Open till 4:00am :-)"}
{"text":"The veggie poutine is where it's at! Their veggie gravy trumps the beef gravy any day. Too much bay leaf in the beef, veggie gravy is wayyyy better in flavour. 

I stand by this choice as a serious carnivore."}
{"text":"Stick with the traditional poutine; the beef peppercorn is not worth the additional $2, and the smoked meat is but a pale simulacrum of what you can get in Montreal. Not a great place to go for dinner, since there isn't anything but poutine orgasm on the menu, but probably a great place to stop by during a pub crawl. Minus one star for not having anything to drink except for bottled water & soda -- what kind of place doesn't serve tap water?"}
{"text":"OMG so good!!! Once again I went there for poutine week and it was super yummy! THe service was great too. Because their online menu was the one based in Toronto, some of the poutines were not available at the one here but the chef was nice enough to come see and ask me what was in the poutine and he would make it for me... Super tasky. I enjoyed it quite a bit!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just because I love poutine...no wait, there are tons of poutine joints around town, and hands down Smoke's Poutinerie does a great job. There are many locations, so this is a review of this particular location. It's conveniently located on Queen, close to many bars and pubs. Its open late which is great for those late night food cravings!

On this particular occasion I ordered the Montreal Smoked meat poutine. What can I say? It was delicious! If you are a meat eater I definitely recommend this choice. That being said, there are so many different varieties to choose from at Smoke's, I don't think you can go wrong. They do a great job of just the classic poutine as well. And for the price, you get a pretty nice helping of artery clogging fries, cheese and gravy! Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"My first true poutine experience! 

My fiance is Canadian and has raved about poutines ever since I met him. The only time we ever had it together was from Pomme Frites in NYC.. and according to him.. that place's version was just plain awful. 

We came here for a \"light\" lunch. My fiance ordered their sherphard's pie poutine, I ordered the nacho supreme poutine, and his brother ordered their Italian poutine. I think each of us managed to finish 1/3 of the order and was stuffed. I love the crunchy top layer of fries with the guac, sour cream, salsa and bean.. but i just couldn't plow through the soggy fries covered with gravy and cheese. I guess all in all i'm not a big poutine fan (since i hate soggy fries and I really hate cheese.. cheese curds? ew) but the top layer was delicious!

Fiance managed to eat more than 1/3 .. maybe 1/2.. mashed potato on top of fried potatoes? Carb overload.

Will definitely get the nacho supreme again if i return!"}
{"text":"We didn't get to our hotel until after 11, so most restaurants were closed. We decided we could eat something greasy and indulgent after a long day of work and travel, and set out to this place.

The menu is surprisingly extensive considering there's one core menu item. I wish I had realized how large the containers were- I ordered the middle size to eat by myself, since this was a meal replacement, but didn't realize exactly how dense poutine is. If you're considering getting any size larger than the small and you're alone, you better be starving! 

I opted for the bacon poutine, and my fiancé got bacon cheeseburger. We agreed mine was better- the beef was under seasoned. The bacon was plentiful and salty and delicious. There were some varieties that I can't imagine being appealing- a few riffs on nachos, but they still contain gravy! I can't imagine eating guac and gravy together...on purpose.

A solid choice for late-night indulgences."}
{"text":"What is this crap?!? I ordered the Curry Chicken poutine. For the longest time while eating it I thought \"There's no friggin cheese on this poutine!\"  Then after about 5 minutes I realized that the \"cheese\" was that rubbery crap that I often mistook for the rubbery chicken. The cheese didn't melt - not even a little bit! That is a HUGE red flag and a giant \"WTF\" for me. Use real cheese curds that melt, or don't call yourselves a poutinerie! Jean Poutine (former PM, see Rick Mercer Report) would be ashamed."}
{"text":"Great food! Staff is very friendly and personable. Will definitely be back. It's a little difficult to get to due the parking lot but worth it"}
{"text":"Way over-priced, for poutine that doesn't taste as great as most I've tried.
I had the Regular, and it was nothing to rave about. I wasn't happy with the taste. Burger King's is better. The service is pretty good though."}
{"text":"I'd been waiting to make it to a Smoke's for ages. I'm a Poutine fanatic, have had it all over the top 2/3 of North America, and I'd heard great things. We were in Toronto for a weekend and stopped by. 

I'm quite glad we did!

First off, the standard Poutine is OK. It's not great, the fries are wonderful, and the curd is excellent, but I found the gravy a bit lacking. I had the wonderful Steak Peppercorn Poutine next, which was odd. I enjoyed the mushrooms, and the meat was on the money as far as doneness, if a bit under-flavored, but it was all made up for by the gravy. The Peppercorn gravy was incredible, easily the best I've ever had on poutine! It was HUGE on flavor, and played so well with everything else in the poutine. I was really glad I got it. 

All in all, it reminded me of my 2nd favorite poutine place in Montreal with the tininess and the few seats, and the poutines were good, though a slight step below!"}
{"text":"What a 3am visit to Smoke's Poutinerie will do to stay off a hang over.

My first trip to Smoke's was to their Adelaide location - and I wasn't a fan.  The gravy was blah and didn't really hit the spot.  There were way to many choices and I felt that they were betraying the Poutine Code, to me there was only one way to serve a poutine - plain.

My visit to the Dundas location was a story into it's self, but I'm not going to get into that right now.  On this trip I was still in the bag and no one told me that I should only be getting the small - my mistake...the large is HUGE at 3am - it would have been fine if that was the only thing I had eaten ALL DAY - but it wasn't.  I chose the bacon poutine - YUM YUM, but it was SALTY.....I am a saltaholic and it was even to salty for me.

Over all a great late night post bar meal - it will keep the slat in your body and help prevent a hang over....but that could just me my take on it."}
{"text":"We keep going to the same plaza to eat pizza but I wanted something different today. This was our first time here.   We ordered the vegetarian poutine, and the gravy was a mushroom gravy.  The place was nice but I found it a little dark.  Not sure if they want that as effect or for the ambiance.  We went there on a Tuesday Afternoon and the place was not that busy.  We were served quickly.  I enjoyed my poutine.  Could not eat all at one sitting because we ordered a large poutine. The portion was huge.  Both my son and I liked it.  We will be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's the greatest.  The pulled pork isn't the softest. The pork doesn't separate very well. The taste is there but the texture was sort of like paper..

I only went because I have a gift card I needed to use. Perhaps a different location will be better."}
{"text":"Good flavor, but bad execution. 

Cheese was excellent. Thick squeaky curds.. The fries were not bad also. The sauce had flavour but was cold and didn't even melt the cheese.. Also, cornstarch was used as a thickener.. A big no no. The sauce reminded me of something I would have easily found in Chinatown, not a poutinerie. The colder the sauce got, the worst that cornstarch texture became. Not coming back."}
{"text":"poutine!!! i wish they have this in the states! i got the special roast beef, which is pretty freakin good! they actually gave me sliced beef, the cheese wasn't shredded, which is important. there are no seats in the place, but they open till 4am in the weekends!

tip: small is enough for one person, unless you eat a lot?

favourites: good poutine in toronto

do not want: kind of wish i got a meat that is more shredded, easier to eat

last words: great poutine!"}
{"text":"Pretty basic poutine. But what can you expect from a chain joint. They have a ton of topping options which would be the only thing that holds this review at three stars."}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes me want to go again, even though after I eat here, I always say I'm never coming back because I'm just so full.

My husband and I get different poutines and we share. Even though he's a big guy, we never finish, I don't know if it's because your body can only handle so much gravy and grease. They are definitely generous with the toppings. The cheese curds they use are really good as well. 

The pulled pork one is delicious."}
{"text":"Worst poutine ever.  Had the Montreal poutine and was thoroughly disgusted.  Maybe something else is better but was not impressed on my first visit."}
{"text":"Was more crazy about the toppings than the fries here. Thankfully there are lots to choose from. I got the Philly cheesesteak and the red peppers added a nice touch of flavor to the gravy and cheese. Would be cool to get extra cheese curds rather than the combination with the basic yellow cheese drizzle. I will as politely as possible put it this way as well: this should be renamed to poot-tine as I was almost embarrassingly gassy after eating this."}
{"text":"I came went to Smoke's Poutinerie for Sunday lunch. This location was decorated in a typically fast food style. The service was very friendly and the location was clean.

I ordered the chicken bacon ranch poutine. It was very good with a lot of bacon and chicken.

Would I go back to this location? Yes, the food was good and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great service and the employees were very kind, answering any questions I had. I ate the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was really tasty and surprisingly well made. I would definitely come here again when I'm in the area! Also the staff are hilarious and very attentive!"}
{"text":"I know Smoke's is basically the McDonalds of the poutine world, but when it's 4am and you're hungry, your standards are lower than normal. Get the double or triple pork, just don't ask for the calorie count."}
{"text":"Incredible service. My poutineista, Daniel, was delightful, quick, and made a great recommendation (the Nacho Grande). This is probably my favourite Smokes in Toronto! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Sometimes it feels SO good to be SO bad...for you. I have been dying to try out an actual poutinerie for a long time and it did not disappoint. I've been twice now. Once I had the basic poutine and once I had the pulled pork poutine. Both are good, but I really love that pulled pork poutine. The BBQ sauce they have has just a touch of sweetness and it really compliments the fries and cheese curds. A large poutine is more than enough for two people and I liked the little restaurant space with the 80s glam rock playing and quirky pictures on the walls. I guess my only criticism is that they need more seating. Both times I've been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving, but it's gross out on the street and this summer anyway, it's been SO hot outside. They don't have space for more seats, so this isn't really something they can easily fix, but maybe something to keep in mind for future establishments? Anyway, if you want a very unhealthy treat, it's a go!"}
{"text":"A long-time friend of mine is a partner in this chain of fast food restaurants. I've wanted to try it for years but hadn't been to a city where one was located.

Restaurant is casual with counter service and big, bags of potatoes by the counter. Think Five Guys and its bags of peanuts. 

Counter service fast and friendly. We ordered a meal-sized bacon poutine and were VERY happy with it. Neither of us are big gravy fans but we really liked this gravy as it was mild and not thick. The cheese curds were outstanding. Melted nicely like mozzarella on pizza. The bacon was, well, bacon. Pretty hard to mess up bacon and this bacon was most certainly not messed up. 

The only suggestion I'd have would be free wifi for customers."}
{"text":"My brother was visiting from California and has never had poutine so we came here after a night out on crescent street. Had the original & pulled pork, a little procey but the servings are huge & of course delicious after a few drinks, my brother is now on a mission to make his own poutine in CA!"}
{"text":"Mediocre poutine with very chewy and rubbery cheese curds. Cheese curds are a pretty big part of the poutine equation, and for that reason, I can't give this place more than 2 stars. I'm not even sure it's real cheese. It didn't melt (not even a little bit).

On the plus side, the portions are HUGE. Two moderately hungry people could probably share a regular.

Large selection of poutines. We sampled traditional and chili, and the gravy and chili were decent. But the truth is, I won't be coming back, because the shitty cheese curds are a deal-breaker."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of poutine at Smoke's.  Loved the piping hot, made to order servings....it's liberal, even a small is quite filling.  I had the pulled pork poutine; it's like having your pulled pork sandwich (sans the buns) poured over a crispy side of fries, slattered with cheese (curds) and gravy to bind it all together.   Yum.  Messy, but well worth the experience."}
{"text":"Paid $2 for extra cheese curds. Didn't get extra cheese curds. 

Super meh poutine. I only get smokes when there are no other options and only with toppings because the toppings will mask other flavours and textures. Like how peppery and starchy their gravy is or how soggy their fries get."}
{"text":"Wow..I thought I knew what poutine was but this blew me away with all the options. The regular meal size is more than enough for two, trust me on that. We got 4 meal sizes for the 5 of us and couldn't finish them as much as we tried. The bbq bacon and mac n cheese is really good, especially when you add hot sauce. The country style is a great twist on a country style chicken meal with peas chicken and more gravy. Really good place but horrible service. Maybe it would be better at late night and not for lunch. The only person working, some depressed looking man didn't say a thing to us for ten minutes when we were the only ones in the shop. Finally we ordered and the food is great."}
{"text":"First off salty. Back in the day this place would have receive five stars, but after they started franchising it just went to shit. The fries and toppings still remain amazing. The quality of the curds definitely dropped from what I used to remember and the gravy became saltier. I only really go here because if fills you for so cheap. Though usually when I'm in the area and not in need to sober up, I always go to Burrito Boyz right below."}
{"text":"Needed a quick poutine fix before heading to the airport to fly back home, so I Hot Footed it to the poutinerie for some gravy covered goodness.  It came out quickly and was easy to eat.  I got some added bacon to add to the experience and a Fanta just cause.  It would have been better if the Cheese Curds would have been a bit bigger in size.  But all in all a decent value for fast food poutine.

Roggen....out!"}
{"text":"On the next episode of \"Vegetarian things with no nutritional value\" I give you the Vegetarian Poutine at Smoke's Poutinerie.  Though it was visually clear that not even a week's allotment of calories would cover the fat content in this concoction, the sound of \"guacamole, sriracha and cheddar cheese\" in the same sentence just screams \"Canada\" and for a moment, I was proud to be a part of it. 

And no lie - the ingredients listed above, over a bed of french fries, is truly an unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"one word - DISGUSTING.

Worst poutine ever, nastiest gravy. I wouldn't even eat it if I was completely wasted and starving."}
{"text":"Awesome poutine! If you never had poutine before, this is the best place for you to try poutine. This place is the benchmark for all other poutine places. I like the hogtown and double pork poutine."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork pountine is my fav! If it wasn't 2 in the morning, I would totally try the double pork or the triple pork! But I felt guity after finishing half of the poutine with my friend... I only wish they have something as good as this back home =("}
{"text":"Maybe it was the booze.  Maybe it was being surrounded by adults and eating Chinese food for every single meal that the 5 of us went a little nuts when we found Smoke's.  We weren't sure when we'd get another non asian meal.  The line at 2:30 am was long ... the women in line were loose.  The men - normally who'd step aside and offer a drink to perky C cups and stiletto's didn't tolerate anyone cutting in line.  Don't mess with a man focused on poutine.

We ordered the original, the Montreal (with pickles) and the pulled pork that had pulled pork and bacon .  The latter was by far the best ... though all of them were pretty tasty.  At 2:30 am, you can't go wrong with fries drenched in cheese curds, gravy and meat."}
{"text":"My first time in Toronto and was excited to try some poutine. Well the blonde cashier with glasses took my order and totally forgot about it. I was thinking shed check with me, but no. I waited for 20 minutes and finally went back only to find out they never made my order. Smokes needs to hire a better staff and I will never do business for complete incompetence. Totally pissed and never coming back"}
{"text":"This smoke's is literally like any other smoke's in terms of quality. Fries are literally deep dried when the order is made and the amount of curds and toppings is the same as any other location. 

I've seen a lot of people giving this location some flake on the lack of toppings and curds compared to other locations but honestly I couldn't tell the difference. People need to remember that this is a smokes and it's going to be the same good poutine at any location. 

If you're in the area and your craving poutine then you're going to be satisfied by coming here."}
{"text":"I love the following:
French fries
Gravy
Cheese curds

So....let's review.  All of those ingredients are awesome on their own.  Now, if you throw them all together, you end up with something that looks like shit, but tastes like heaven.  If you are in Canada, then it's almost a requirement that you try some poutine.  -drool-"}

The Pulled Pork Poutine is pretty good,  for a decent price."}

{"text":"I've had Smokes before, but in the Entertainment district, so when that good old poutine craving kicked in, I knew it was time to head to the closest Smokes around.

This particular location doesn't have any seating so don't expect to sit down and enjoy your gravy and cheese goodness in-house. There's a high bar that you can stand at (probably best to keep the gravy from clogging up your veins) and look out at creepy Dundas-people while you eat. As per the previous reviewers, do NOT get the large unless you a) intend to share or b) are one of those select people who have a regular serving of something and consider it a snack. My bottomless-pit of a coworker and I went today and he got a regular pulled pork and said it was pretty filling (although he did finish the few cheese encrusted fries I was unable to tackle from my own regular poutine).

As mentioned, I ordered just a regular poutine today (last time I had the one with bacon, chicken and onions and it was FAR too much food for me - although fantastically amazing) and as expected, it was wonderful. Not the very very best poutine I've ever had but a serious contender. Mine was around $8 for my regular sized poutine and a pop and my coworkers was about a buck more including a pop. Lots of gooey cheese curds (which is part of what I like, none of this grated cheese crap), lots of that yummy touch-of-rosemary gravy and yummy golden fries. Note to self: mix well before eating next time. Oh, and the pulled pork was AMAZING, I was really surprised!

I don't think you can go wrong with anything here (except for the likely overpriced fancy sodas they offer). If you're in the mood for something indulgent like a poutine, Smokes is one of the best places for it."}
{"text":"Just ok. I have been looking for a place not too far from where I stayed in downtown Toronto and thought this place (because of the ratings) will be good... meh'. Keep looking you can find much better. The girl that was at the register was only there to get her paycheck. She was not helpful and barely spoke..."}
{"text":"I really wish I had a better experience -- I was pretty hungry when I stopped by around 8:15PM on a Sunday evening, and I do love French fries.

The guy behind the counter was really friendly & patient with me as I took time looking at the menu.   I ordered the large box of fries with the *vegetarian* poutine, caramelized onions, and substituted cheese sauce for the green peas that normally comes with it.  Adding a Jones Soda, & my bill was $14 something.   Jones sodas aren't cheap, but over $10 for French fries??!  Time will tell if the tourist prices can last, when the only tourist attraction is the pawn-store 150' away...

I sat down & waited, and my order was ready about 7 minutes later.   There looked to be a waitperson 'working' -- female in her 20s.  For the entire 45 minutes I was there, she just stood & had some sort of in-depth, personal conversation with some customers seated at another table.  Sounded like she either works part-time at Jimmy-John's Subs, or wants to get hired there.  She was also telling them how there would be filing at the pawn store the following day, and when they're filming is about the only time the owners/main characters from the show are ever there.  She sure wasn't working (though they weren't busy, either).  If she was supposed to be a waitress, she failed.  If she's a co-owner or something, she probably at some point should have come to my table & asked if I was doing OK, etc.

When the order taker inside called out that my order was ready, I waited about 20 seconds to see if she was going to pick up my order & bring it to me (& she was closer than I was), but she wasn't at all concerned, and just kept talking to the other people so I hoped up & got my order -- not a big deal at all, however, not the sort of conduct most small businesses have, either.

When I sat back down with my order, my first impressions where that it looked pretty small for the price & being labeled as a large/complete meal, and that I sure didn't get a lot of cheese sauce -- just a very narrow squirting of it atop the fries.

Again, I was really hungry & like fries, so I was very disappointed at the both the collective & individual lack of flavor.  Very bland overall, and even just sampling the vegetarian gravy, cheese curds, fries, or caramelized onions individually showed the components just didn't have much of a flavor for some reason.   The only flavor I got was the artificial green apple flavor from my Jones Soda...

A little before 9PM, the place was starting to close up.  The guy behind the counter came outside to clean & secure the ketchup dispenser, etc. meanwhile, the worthless waitress continued to just ramble-on with the couple customers at the other table. Only when they finally got up & left did she act like she had any connection to the business besides her uniform -- like I said, gotta be the owner's daughter/wife/girlfriend or have some other relationship that allows her to be there without truly earning her keep (sorry honey, but as they say, \"the truth hurts\").

I drive by the place a couple times a week, but unfortunately, I have no reason to ever go back.    I suspect most of the business it (& the other places in the small shopping center) will get is from tourists there to see the pawn store, and that's not going to be enough in the long run. Hopefully I'm wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered small traditional poutine. 

I dont like soggy fries,these were super soggy. I guess becausethe box was vertical...

Anyway that's just me.

Cheese curds, still curds even from the heat. Tasted like plastic.

Not interested in coming back here."}
{"text":"I've had lots of poutine in lots of places - Smoke's is about average.  While their selection of ingredients is impressive, the \"traditional\" (i.e. plain) poutine cannot stand on its own and compete with Quebec-style poutine and its squeaky cheese curds.  

Still a great place to hit after a night of serious clubbing.  Certainly better than any poutine I could get in London, but not quite as good as Ottawa/Montreal offerings!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Vegas from Canada (Vancouver) and been looking for a proper poutine in Vegas for a bit now. This one is the real deal and head and shoulders above the other places I've tried. Public House and The Blind Pig aren't even close to authentic."}
{"text":"Cons first.
No inside seating.  It was -40fuckingC out, and the wind was slapping my face harder than my ex-gf.  Lost one star for that.  The fifth star in my reviews is always reserved for special ladies.  Second con was the music, but I don't fault them.  None of the early-twenty-somethings working there looked like they liked Roch Voisine all that much either. 

Pros.
The menu is huge.  Everything is some sort of poutine.  They don't pollute it with silly things like hot-dogs or tiramisu.  Straight up poutine.  

I ventured on a limb and ordered the Triple Pork.  I then proceeded to pig out on a huge pile of pulled pork, bacon, sausage, gravy and cheese curds.  Of course I ordered the large.  

I had to stop eating when I lost my breath.  At the time, I just figured it was unrelated, but I had to stop eating.  I packed it in my bag, and left for the GO bus.  The smell must have made the guy in the seat across the aisle hungry, because he pulled a chili dog out of his pocket and started mowing down greedily.  I just got home and pulled out my pout, and started eating again, and LO AND BEHOLD I lost my breath again!  Now I'm sitting here alone, with my heart making a *squishing* noise, and I think I might call a friend to come over and watch me for a while.  I feel myself approaching an imminent cardiac arrest, but I can't stop eating...  

I think it's time for a diet of rice, broccoli and tofu for the next month (smothered in gravy, pulled pork, bacon and sausage of course).

The artwork on the walls was pretty amazing too.

{"text":"The Nacho grande is quite delicious.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Smoke's provides a spectacular unhealthy meal. It's a bit of a dive but the food is always tasty. Considering I never had Poutine before I was a tad skeptical but now I'm a believer."}
{"text":"I went to the 203 Dundas East location of Smoke's Poutinerie this week for lunch one day. For weeks I've wanted to try it out with great anticipation but my experience didn't blow me away. I had a small order of the poutine with bacon. The fries were good unto themselves but, in my experience, larger softer fries (what I'm accustomed to calling \"steak fries\") are ideal for poutine since they soak up the gravy better. The fries at Smokes were relatively narrow, crispy fries. The gravy that was on the fries was of a nice flavour but it was runnier than I like for poutine. The consequence of the consistency of the gravy was that it didn't embrace the curds and they didn't melt very much, which is too bad because the curds themselves were quite good. The bacon on top of the poutine just made it \"food porn.\" It was tasty but, for me, it's just too much. Overall, I don't have anything bad to say about Smoke's because the individual ingredients of the poutine I had were good but they did not come together in a way that I like best when it comes to poutine. I will say that I really appreciated that Smoke's sold Pop Shoppe drinks as beverage choices."}
{"text":"Hello! Just wanted to let whoever runs this franchise know that I just walked by your store at 10:18 p.m., and while there were two employees working and serving themselves poutine behind the counter, they refused to unlock the front door and let me order, or even let me into the shop at all. The sign on your door says 11 p.m. close, and online it says 12. Guess I'll take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The traditional poutine here is ok but it's a little bit too salty for my taste. And it doesn't leave me with that stuffed but I'm craving the gravy-soaked, cheesy potato goodness that I associate poutines with. Which is a bummer, because I really really do love poutine, so I kind of missed having that coma-inducing awesomely satisfied feeling I do after having a good plate of poutine. 

 I have to say though, in terms of variety - this is a really good option. Their cheeseburger poutine with a cheese sauce is a delight. 

This particular location is well-situated, right next to Bathhurst. Service is quick, and efficient."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Cheap authentic poutine :) 

I came in on a Friday and drove downtown to try this place! I got the traditional meal size poutine. It was freaking awesome. The cheese curds and gravy were on point. The fries were fresh and crispy. It was made in literally 5 minutes. The selections are great because they have vegetarian options and the oddest meat combinations which sound amazing! I can't wait to try then

They also have jones soda which is freaking awesome and free sticks! Really cute interior and friendly employees. I highly recommend this establishment for a poutine fix, I will definitely come back to try the other!!

This place is very clean and small. There is also a parking lot which is great because parking downtown is a nightmare. :) thanks smokes poutinery!!"}
{"text":"Triple pork is amazing!  I get this one every time.  The portion is big, it's good for sharing.  Very few seatings, efficient staff, the food comes pretty fast despite a bunch of late night customers.  Smoke's is one of my favourite poutines on-the-go after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"After a night involving more martini's than I can recall I wound up at Smoke's Poutinerie. The line up was massive but it moved quite quickly (in spite of douchie young drunkards - most likely fresh from a nearby disco-tech - attempting to cut the line) so don't be alarmed if you find yourself in a poutine ravenous queue. You will be served sooner than later. 

Now this might be the least Canadian statement I'll ever utter, but when I'm not inebriated I actually don't really care for poutine. I'll occasionally steal a fry from a friend's poutine, but I'd never soberly order it for myself. I think it's because I like my fries to stay crispy. Perhaps I would be on board with a thicker gravy that didn't saturate into the fries so readily. Regardless - poutine? Not really my thing. 

That being said, I can appreciate that this is pretty much the food of the gods to those who have had one drink too many. In spite of the copious amount of alcohol I'd consumed, I woke up the next morning hangover free! I do, however, feel that they could put a lot less salt in the gravy.  Even with a gin-drenched palette I still found it to be comparable to salt lick."}

The options are quite amazing, who know poutine could get any better."}
{"text":"Situated across the street from Concordia University this small poutine specialized joint is conveniently placed to serve the horde of students looking for a quick meal.

The esthetics of the place is nothing special and the service is nothing to write home about.

What really stays with you is the way the poutine is served to you... in a box. My first reaction was apprehension and confusion then quickly understood the genius of it all.

I ordered their Philly steak poutine and got a big helping of it in a box. The sauce and fries were just about right and the toppings tasty. It's was good, sadly not excellent. I'm unsure if they stepped up their game compared to previous reviewers but ultimately I was satisfied. 

Extra points for offering sodas in bottles. I opted for the \"Root Beer Pop Shoppe\" and it was really good. 

The sole gripe I have is the price tag, the poutine and soda came up to about 14$. I guess rent is expensive but if they are to cater to the students more, it's a bit expensive for an average student to come such a place regularly."}
{"text":"Severely over rated.  I feel the high ratings come from the fact that they cater to a low level audience of drunk people coming out of tier 3 bars and clubs on queen west and adeleide.  For a spot that specializes in poutine this was a serious disappointment.  Fries were cold and soggy, cheese was unmelted, overpriced, gravy wasn't hot...harveys is even superior to this."}
{"text":"Just had my first order from here after hearing so many great things about the poutine. I have the Philly Cheese Steak and my wife had the Italian. When we arrived home, we dug in. The fries were 'meh'. Not crispy at all and we only drove for ten minutes. The gravy was quite bland and it needed some more seasoning. They were also pretty skimpy with the meat. Only counted a few pieces. My wife barely touched hers. Said it looked bad and she didn't like the taste. Overall, I wasn't impressed and will not return unless I'm drunk and its 3am which is apparently who their target market is."}

{"text":"During my vacation to Toronto, we were on the lookout for some good poutine (because what else do you eat in Canada..?) Now I haven't tried many poutines before (definitely not an expert), but this was pretty damn delicious. The cheese curds were slightly melty/chewy, potatoes were delicious with all the gravy on it. Just the right amount of salty. Not to mention they have branches all over toronto. I can tell that this isn't the BEST poutine that Toronto has to offer, but it'll work for a quick bite. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Smoke's has always been a good place to grab a nice poutine, although I've noticed the prices going up a bit lately but the quality of the food hasn't risen with it. 

Don't get me wrong, the food is still good, I just think maybe if you're going to hike up prices, do something worth hiking them up for. 

I guess the queues outside the door speaks for itself though, right?"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a snack before going to our next appointment. I had the snack size with gravy. The gravy tasted overly salty, like store bought gravy. It wasn't yummy. My MIL makes better gravy. The fries were fine but I couldn't get over the gravy. Hubby had the poutine with chicken in snack size as well & enjoyed it. The decor here is all white, red and black. It's clean and bright but I find the colours a bit glaring for my taste. Maybe next time I'll try the mushroom gravy. That might taste better."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, delicious. Insanely delicious. Snack size was very filling I couldn't finish. They have veggie gravy made with mushroom but dozens of options for everyone. Also the fries were perfectly crispy. I would say the cheese was amazing too but that should be obvious."}

{"text":"It's decent but nothing extraordinary. In my opinion, the chips were a bit soggy and gravy was cold and lacked flavor. I'm wondering if they keep cooked potatoes on standby since I got mine in just about 2-3 minutes. The curds were passable though, and the place is a pretty cool joint to hang out with friends. I've only tried the traditional poutine and would consider coming back to try their famous pulled pork poutine. Shouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"That some good food right there. Portions are huge! Was looking for something local and stumbled upon this place. Had the country style and wasnt disappointed. Garnished with peas and mushrooms and chicken. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Poutine is supposed to be greasy, salty, soggy and most importantly fun to eat, and thats exactly what Smoke's poutine is. O.k, its now a franchise but it's still great poutine. I had heard about Smoke's poutine for a while and experienced my first poutine from them last week at Richo Arena on the Exhibition grounds. I live at Spadina and Front, and hit the Adelaide street location last night.
I decided to go with the Hogtown Poutine which was a regular poutine with double smoked bacon, sausage, mushrooms and caramelized onions. The toppings were flavourful and there was a generous portion of sausage and bacon placed on top the poutine (you may want to mix everthing up with a fork before you consume your order). I would have preferred the fries to be cooked a little more (hey this is poutine, so its supposed to be greasy) but other than that, it was definitely worth the 20 minute walk to this location. If you love poutine, you will not be dissapointed with their creations!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Canada as an adult. After 3 nights of celebrating the New Year, I had to try the legendary poutine all my Canuck friends keep talking about. So on my last day, we stopped by Smokes, of which they all spoke of highly. I was not disappointed. 

I got the Bacon, which had generous amounts of fries, savory and slightly sweet maple bacon, soft cheese curds, and as recommended, extra gravy. The fries reminded me of the ones at Five Guys, the cheese curds tasted like soft and delicate mozzarella balls, the gravy was thick enough to cover every bite (yet not too thick and starchy) and the bacon was, well, maple bacon is just awesome. 

Why we don't have these in the DC area is beyond me. But it's probably for the best; I'd gain too much weight going there every day. 

Bonus: the joke about Canadians being polite is actually no joke. The woman working there was ever so sweet, and had a smile from start to finish. Next time I hit up Canada, I'll be going there every chance I get."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place, and I tried it for the first time two weeks ago. I was not disapointed. The selection is amazing, and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed. I tried the cracked peppercorn chicken and the curry - both were wicked.

If you like poutine and you're in the area, I think you really have to check it out."}
{"text":"Although I went to college in Plattsburgh and visited Montreal several times over the years, my visit to Smoke's was my first poutine.  It's a good thing I'm generally on a diet that eschews most of the ingredients.  It's delicious and it's clear that it can be powerful comfort food, but it's not likely to be endorsed by any cardiologists anytime soon.

I got a kick out of the pile of 100 lb bags of potatoes packed in Smoke's-design bags that greet you as you enter the store.

I tried the Montreal and the Deluxe Italian.  I bought the food for take out and I was staying several blocks away at Carleton and Jarvis so the cheese curds had melted nicely by the time I got the food ready to eat.

I should do some research and see how much of a passionate debate goes on among poutine eaters since it's clear you can tinker a lot with the recipe, although I suspect some of Smoke's variations might go beyond acceptability for some.  The Deluxe Italian was yummy, but the meat sauce was pretty bland.  A more pronounced Italian meat sauce would have improved the dish significantly.  The Montreal was yummy as well without qualifications. 

I have to disagree with those who didn't like the thyme (?) taste in the gravy. It's a subjective issue but i liked it.  Whether a different gravy might be altogether better or a change is another issue but this one is quite good.

Others have said it but I'll repeat: The \"small\" size is more than enough for one person."}
{"text":"First time coming on a weekday night. The person making the poutine seems different. Although we waited for 10 min for the order it wasn't fresh in the end. Fries seemed like it wasn't cooked the usual. Dissapointed."}
{"text":"I love me some good poutine but the one at this location of Smoke's left me wanting better.

Dropped in on a sunny Sunday.  There was no one at the counter or in the kitchen.  We waited a few minutes and then re-opened the door to set off the 'ding' of the bell.  Waited a few more minutes and finally a female employee emerged from the back.  Seems like we interrupted her as she was not pleased that we were there.

We ordered the Traditional ($5.99) and it was ready pretty quickly.  The employee passed us the poutine and then disappeared into the back.  

Unfortunately, I don't think the fries were fresh.  The gravy was kinda warm but there were some cold congealed chunks in it.  It was just gross. 

A few more customers arrived and had the same wait for employee to come out, first the female came back out and then a male employee emerged from the back room, looking disheveled.  I really don't want to know what was just interrupted.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Smoke's offers the advantage of being right downtown but their poutine leaves a lot to be desired.  I ordered the regular size pulled pork poutine.  The pulled pork was quite good and would have actually been tasty in a sandwich.  The gravy and curds though were lacking in flavour.  I also found that there weren't very many curds which is something I like in my poutine.  The service was quite slow even though the restaurant was rather quiet at the time.   Overall there are much better poutine places in Montreal worth visiting."}
{"text":"If Smoke's was in Quebec, I would give it less stars.
But it's not.  
It's in Toronto, in ONTARIO.  Ontario does not have poutine.  

Smoke's makes a decent meal.  It's comparable to la Banquise in Montreal - both restaurants focus on fancy toppings, and the fancy toppings are fun.  I ordered the Nacho Grande and my wife had the Country Chicken.  

Beneath the toppings is a fairly normal poutine that does not set itself apart from others when compared to real Quebec poutines ---but it's SO MUCH BETTER than everything else in Ontario.  Am I mistaken?  PM me with a better place for a poutine in this province.  

I would go back to smoke's.  I don't think I would crave it, but I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local Toronto beat cop as the best Poutine place in the area, resembles a regular hamburger place from the outside. Interesting spin on the American version of chilli cheese fries, fries with almost anything tastes good. Especially good filler and hangover remedy after a night out on the town binging with the boys. 

We tried the Carolina pull pork BBQ Poutine with cheese curds, this right dafter having a filling meal of the city's awesome ramen noodles. I'd recommended going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after reading a google review.  A great selection of poutine options.  I had the pulled pork and he had the nacho. I almost wish I had just gotten standard (gravy/cheese) poutine because the pulled pork was a little much. It was very good but was not as good as just the traditional gravy style. This would be a great place to hit after drinks - but a lunch time option was a little heavy.  Not understanding the menu I would have gotten the snack size and not the meal.  It's good - but suits college kids after some beers better than walking tourists."}
{"text":"French fries, gravy, cheese, assorted meat, assorted vegetables, a number of combinations, bottled pop, heart disease/attack, and more - what's not to like.  Be warned if you are sensitive to sodium. May cause headaches.  But other than that, enjoy!
P.S. I found a tiny, single strand of hair in the gravy...  BUT it's 4 stars because it's still awesome food."}

Would like more gravy
Less fries
More toppings
Also wasnt as tasty as i would have liked it to br"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of variety of fries (honestly most of the things on the menu aren't really poutine it's more like loaded fries) and they taste pretty decent. 

The only thing I would say about this is that the fries are actually pretty expensive given how small the portions are."}
{"text":"+ crispy fries, lots of beefy gravy
-  cramped quarters, not enough cheese curds 

It was pretty busy at midnight on a Saturday. Ordered the traditional regular, $5.99.  Waited for about 10 minutes while the counter girl went in the back and prepared about 6 poutines that were recently ordered.  Not sure why nobody else was there making them up?

The poutine came in a rectangular container.  The fries were nice and crispy, needed more cheese curds.  I saw the girl making them, she only had a tiny scoop for the cheese curds, putting in one scoop of cheese in each box.  The cheese was good, but just not enough.  I liked the beef flavoured gravy and there was lots of it.  The waiting area is very cramped, especially when people are sitting down eating.

I really enjoyed the poutine and will be back again."}
{"text":"In Toronto for a business trip and got a craving for Poutine. Came across Smoke's Poutine online and made the walk. I got the Chicken Bacon Ranch; and the walk was worth it! They definitely don't skimp on toppings. The fries were perfectly cooked. The Poutine was flavourful and had perfect amount of gravy. They use cheese curds and not shredded. AMAZING!
Only downside is Smoke's doesn't have seating because it is a small building, they only have a standing bar/table; so I walked a block over to a park and sat under a tree for shade and enjoyed my Poutine!
The largest size was HUGE and too big for me to finish, I think they even call it the \"WOW\" size lol - so the container was convenient as it will keep my left overs nicely sealed and the gravy didn't soak through the container!"}
{"text":"I was a tad disappointed in smokes poutinerie. Maybe my expectations were to high? I walked over to smokes for dinner excited to indulge in ooey gooey poutine. I mean this place is a \"poutinerie\" so obviously the poutine must be amazing? 

I was greeted by the man at the counter, the place was dimly lit they could use a few extra lightbulbs. There were so many choices I couldn't decided so I went for a traditional poutine and I added chicken. 

My poutine was okay. Not bad but not great. I found bits of it salty. The gravy wasn't memorable but the portion was generous and there was a good amount of cheese curds. So why the three stars you may ask? My cousin orders the nacho supreme poutine. It was soooo delicious!! Think of Taco Bell fries supreme but wayyyy better! It had jalapeños, sour cream, chilli, cheese, guacamole and I'm not sure what els but I definitely ate my traditional poutine with regret while watching my cousin devour her poutine out of the corner of my eye. So i would go back to smokes but not for a traditional poutine. 

Tip: they should season their chicken with something. It just tasted so blah"}
{"text":"Must try!!!!!!!!

So before visiting Canada we found a list of things that we have to go eat and try to get the full Canadian experience. Poutine was at the top of the list so we were determined and after zipping through reviews we thought this would be the best place. We were right.

There is a parking garage literally across the street so parking was not an issue at all. The buildings sign was well noticeable and easy to find. When you walk in you are stunned by all the art and as we walked closer to the menu board I began to get overwhelmed. There were so many options!!!!!! Based from reviews and recommendations we chose the pulled pork and cheeseburger. It wasn't a busy time so we ordered found a table and basically got our food immediately. My husband and I shared but the pulled pork poutine was my favorite because it was more flavorful and the gravy really got to soak in the Fried. Towards the bottom of the container I was over the cheese curds. It was already such a filling meal it's like I couldn't keep eating that stuffy cheese. Overlap I feel like I could come back to this place and try something different every time. Service was friendly and bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"I've had the philly cheese steak poutine here, among a few others. All were great with no complaints at all. The large size was $10 but surprisingly much more filling than I expected. I'm a big eater and I struggled to finish it. Definitely adequate for a couple sharing a meal. Fries are of great quality and the selection and quality of the other ingredients are also very good, they don't cheap out here. And of course, the gravy is very flavourful."}
{"text":"My first visit was okay. My second visit SUCKED. I ordered the cheeseburge poutine to go and by the time I got home it was too late to go back and complain. The whole thing was DISGUSTING. The fries were stale and clearly not fresh (I ate one on the streetcar before I got home so travelling a distance was not an issue for the freshness). The beef was DRY and disgusting. The gravy was ok. There were 4 cheese curds - I kid you not..I could count them. How is this even possible? I ate a bit and chucked the rest. The whole thing was too salty and doused in vinegar.

Definitely not worth another visit.

Looking at the pics and based on my last visit, the cheese curd situation was really weird."}
{"text":"Smoke's is a place that seems to hit the bulls-eye if you're intoxicated! 
This particular location has a crazy lineup at around 2am but is a pretty good option for a super quick but unhealthy snack at other times!
The pulled pork poutine was very tasty and although it wasn't the best pulled pork I've had it hit the spot. 
The  prime beef poutine includes caramelized onions, mushrooms, and seasoned ground beef... I wasn't into it even though almost anything would have tasted good in my state. Would not recommend this option!"}
{"text":"Had the country style. Can't complain about poutine.   It was excellent. It's worthy of your poutine cravings. There seemed to be only one guy working so I can't blame him for running back and forth cooking and taking orders."}
{"text":"Well, we didn't get sick from eating here. That's a positive right?

I heard Smoke's was a great  place for a first timer by someone who lives in Toronto, but I wished I would have tried a different location. This one is in a sketchy location, only had counter space and was really dirty. It was not busy and the counters were filthy so we had to take our food to go (strike one). My mom got the snack size mushroom and onion. I got the meal size nacho. I was a little grossed out when I saw the guy squirting guac from a plastic bag (strike two), maybe I should have ordered a more traditional poutine.

The guy at the counter was friendly. When he asked if it was to go, I nodded yes. He proceeded to close up the carton and the ingredients oozed out of the top. He joked that at least I was getting my money's worth. That didn't bother me, until he started licking his fingers while he was still closing up my box. I wondered if his hands were clean to begin with (strike three).

Honestly, I couldn't really enjoy the poutine to it's fullest because I was a little unnerved by the whole thing and my mom and I couldn't stop laughing about our poutine adventures. I did manage to eat 3/4ths of it. It was definitely edible. I definitely need a redo...but not at this location."}
{"text":"One of THE best poutines Montreal has to offer! I ordered the traditional with bacon & onions. DELICIOUS!! Fries are perfect (not soggy) the gravy ain't heavy or over salty and the cheese curds pieces are huge and tasty! Caramelized onions are the best I've ever had and the chunks of bacon was amazing! All this for under $10! I recommend to all!"}
{"text":"So much variety.  Makes the original Poutine seem almost boring.  A must visit after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like poutine, Smoke's is my usual go-to. They've consistently dished out great tasting poutine. I'm a big protein guy, so my usual order is the Single, Double, or Triple pork poutine (pulled pork, bacon, and Italian sausage - additively).

I ordered the single pork without cheese curds, which I coin the 'pou' (yeah, I'm one of those guys... But hey, that just means more for you guys!). The gravy is savoury but not too salty, and the pulled pork adds a nice sweetness to it. Fries are nice and crispy, if you can eat it straight away. 

I've taken a couple friends here who have never had poutine before, and I think it's safe to say it won't be their last :).

Dare I say... it's better than Montreal poutine..."}
{"text":"Whenever American friends come to visit, they ALWAYS want to try \"Canadian\" Poutine...along with Tim Hortons, maple syrup, and checking out the igloos. Seriously though, this request has become so frequent that I realized I needed to find a go-to poutine place - Smoke's looks like the place!

Like most of the other locations in this chain, this place was very conveniently located near the TTC. I like the fact that this place was founded in Toronto, still maintains its Canadian roots, and was apparently the FIRST poutine-centric establishment in the city.

There were plenty of \"gourmet\" options to choose from, though being the huge meat-lover that I am, I went with the \"Bacon Cheeseburger\" version. The poutine's here do not disappoint...the fries were fresh, the toppings plentiful, and it all came out hot/warm. I went with the \"meal-size,\" but \"snack-size\" and \"large-size\" options were also available.

Good portions? Check. Fast service? Check. Convenient location? Check. Meets Canadian Stereotypes? Check Check. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:

Even though this location is so conveniently located right near the highway, it's somewhat tucked away in a small plaza. It doesn't look like it gets too much traffic. Not a location that is meant for indoor dining, as it is quite small with just a few stools and a standing table.

FOOD:

Like all the Smoke's Poutineries, the selection of poutines is the most impressive part of the experience here. They have a range of toppings and sauces that can be added to standard poutine components (e.g. fries, cheese curds, and gravy). On my most recent visit, I ordered one of the signature dishes - the Large \"Cheese Burger\" poutine, which includes ground beef, bacon,  and cheese sauce, on top of the aforementioned toppings. The \"large\" size is not quite as large as it was a year ago, and is probably closer to what used to be a medium.

SERVICE:

For counter service, the staff were friendly and helpful. The staff was even honest enough to confirm that the somewhat shocking price increases ($17 for a poutine, what??) were due to the upcoming minimum wage change.

VERDICT:

I am not too pleased with the increase in prices, as $17 dollars for a not so large poutine is a bit much. That being said, I may come back again when I have a craving."}
{"text":"Introducing an American to poutine can be a nerve-wrecking experience. Is this not the few things Canadians are known for? Even though I knew that my boyfriend loves fries and loves cheese, I was still worried that he wouldn't love poutine--why? Because, to be honest, I don't have a thing for poutine. In fact, after having clubbed by smoke's for the last couple of years, I've only had one bite of a bacon cheeseburger poutine, and I don't even remember how it tasted.

When my bf ordered the pulled pork poutine (he also loves pulled pork), I thought he wouldn't be getting the full poutine experience and the pulled pork would overpower the gravy. The fact is that it did, which made him say that poutine is similar to a chili cheese fries at Taco Bell. Since I don't eat fries in general, I have no idea whether the comparison was fair, but I actually quite enjoyed the pulled pork poutine.  Maybe next time, I'll try the curry chicken poutine..."}
{"text":"I tried Smoke's special Beef Stroganoff Poutine back in April.  It was very filling, but did not hit the spot.  When I return I should try one of their more regular poutine choices."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a 3.5 rating.  I'd never even heard of poutine until a friend recommended this place.  We ended up going together and sharing one, since I had eaten not long before arriving.  Let me preface this review with this: I'm a SUPER healthy eater, as a rule - so this is not something I'd eat all the time (hence the low-ish rating).  But I did enjoy it; both of us did.  It doesn't say so on the menu, but you can change up the sauces on whatever poutine you get, so be sure to try the mushroom sauce.  That was my favorite part about it!  If you're in Vegas and you're looking for some poutine, this is the place to go.  And, as a fun touristy item of note, you'll be parked right next to the world famous Pawn Stars pawn shop."}
{"text":"Giving Smoke's at Queen and Bathurst one star tonight (Sunday) because the guy who bothered to come out of his hole in the back after a while was a total asshole. Went next door instead to Falafel Queen, where they were as sweet as usual.  Smoke's, you could learn a lot from the Falafel Queen."}
{"text":"If you want par poutine that's open late and has all the standards plus some not so standard combinations of gravy, cheese, and fries, then this is your place. Since I had limited meals in the city, I needed to take care of both my smoked meat and poutine fixes in one fell swoop;

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smokes-poutinerie-toronto-2?select=rz0cbuc06rMbTryAwUOMow#6CslC6Hn4SHDjZwNDv9D6A

Tasty yes, hot yes, cheese melty under the hot gravy yes. I'm happy."}
{"text":"I was a regular of this place till tonight. The service was normal and the quality of food was also as usual. 

But this is what made me reconsider my attitude to this place. I saw two employees who were taking a garbage bag out of the large garbage bin with their bare hands. After finishing their business, they did not wash their hands. One of the employees was the kitchen staff who was cutting potatoes into fries. He went directly to the cutter, started taking potatoes with his bare hands that he HAD NOT WASHED and put them into the machine. Absolute disregard to customer health!

Hope they can fix this location."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of many mix-ins for my poutine.   Call me a traditionalist in this area. Give me good freshly fried fries, rich gravy to blanket the cheese curds... yum.  That being said, my little nephews enjoy the philosophy, the more the better so off to Smokes it was.  The little carnivore polished off a Prime Beef poutine, which to me tasted more sheppards pie like than Prime Beef. Every thing was piping hot and not a single fry was left uncoated.  The area where this shop excels is customer service, the other munchkin has a dairy allergy and had to have some naked fries (just fries no toppings) ,  i just requested that take a quarter from the poutine order and put on the side so the other can participate.  She gave an small order of fries  along with a full poutine order to them along with a few Smokes stickers.  I told her i would pay for the order of fries and she said no worries and to let him enjoy also.  I tipped her extra as she truly went above and beyond my expectations!  I will definitely come back just for the service (and basic poutine without extra toppings)"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend, we got a medium poutine with pulled pork and bacon. We couldn't finish it because we both weren't that hungry and it was a large portion to begin with. Also my first time trying out this chain restaurant, not bad. The cheese curds are seriously cheesy and stretchy!

There aren't any chairs, just standing tables."}
{"text":"I had the meatiest poutine they could offer. It had sausage, bacon, and pulled pork. Needless to say it would be awhile until I try that again but it was amazingly delicious when I was eating it!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes, because for the past year and a half I have been hearing everyone talk about how great their poutine is. I finally got the chance to go today and all I can say is Costco poutine taste way better than this. I know - it was probably one of those off days. I am still eager to give it a try again, but not the same location. I ordered a meal size nacho grande, the fries, gravy and chilli were cold and at most maybe warm. There was maybe less than a tbsp of gac squeezed in a corner and the chilli was really salty. Probably the most depressing part of it all was the cold, unmelted cheese curds. I could forgive everything, but come on cold cheese curds? Can't even call it a poutine. I tried my best to get them to melt - I dug into my overstuffed box of fries and attempted to find the warmest place I could shove my cheese curds into, but even then they barely melted. 
As to why I will not return to this location again was the staff member clearly look like she didn't want to be there/ really tired? Maybe it has been a busy morning/afternoon or a slow day that has ruined her day? I believe she was also the only one working at the time - front and kitchen. I don't expect the warmest welcome nor the most impeccable service, but a causal tone and a \"hey\" would be nice."}
{"text":"Authentic poutine from a small stand! I like how they have stickers and other random free swag by the register. I ordered the original and my friend got one with bacon. It comes in a reasonably sized box and most of the different varieties they have come with curd, fries, pork and vegetables. 

I barely ate 3/4 of my box before I started to feel a little sick. Poutine is very very heavy and each bite I took felt like a kick to my heart. The gravy and curds were all savory and the overall dish is pretty flavourful. 

Not a bad place to try it though, maybe I'll put my heart & body through similar pain if I ever go to Quebec where I think it originated!"}
{"text":"Pretty good poutine, but I only really come here after clubbing and need a midnight snack.  I can usually taste the poutine in my mouth still the next morning because it is just so salty.  Still...it always satisfies that late night post clubbing craving for something savory."}
{"text":"Maybe I was there on an off day.  Expensive, watery gravy, soggy fries poutine.  That is it in a nutshell.  I do not want to go back because there are many great places to get poutine that I can be sure of.  This was disappointing especially when there was a lot of build up about the place.  Harvey's has superior poutine to this."}
{"text":"Now I know poutine tastes much much better if you get to share with someone!!

This is my second Smoke's Poutinerie location I visited. The first time at the Queen St West location which I found my traditional poutine a little too oily, the gravy a little too salty.. if did not get me too excited.

Second time the Veggie Deluxe poutine which I have the pleasure to share that with another yelper after an intense HOT yoga class tasted so much better!! Especially when your friend kept telling you how good this is!

And I have to say I love my Veggie Deluxe poutine!! Cheese, green peas, mushroom and cooked onions can taste that good?!! We finished the Huge Large order in record speed.......

BTW, this location is so much more spacious.. and at least it has real tables and chairs not just bar stools!"}
{"text":"Poutine is not something I eat regularly.... ! 

Deep fried potatoes (high cholesterol) Salty gravy (bad for blood pressure) and cheese (oh so fattening) 

But on this chilly winter afternoon.. I need the fuel, I need something fattening, I need something comforting... Then I saw Smoke's Poutinerie! 

Original Small is LARGE for a single person. For sure is fulfilling and I just could not finish it.. NO WAY! They should have a Mini size or something... 

The pouting itself is OK.. too much gravy.. and gravy not hot enough to melt the cheese curds.. or maybe the weather was just too damn cold for anything to melt? 

The server/cashier guy is just so awesomely nice and polite.. even with 8 people waiting in line for their orders, he still keep everything in control!

The weekend hours are great!! I can imagine myself craving for some food..anything hot food after a night of drinking and partying on Queen Street... :)

I still searching for that special Poutine that will makes me a convert!"}
{"text":"So maybe I'm a hater but this Canadian delicacy....just never wows me.  It's basically loaded French fries.  I had the bacon cheeseburger poutine...it was tasty, but then again I like my fries crispy.  This just doesn't work for me..unfortunately. I give them credit for originality with all their unique combos (chicken, beef, steak, etc), but the meal just left me unsatisfied. Always seems like a side item, rather then a main meal for me. Don't get me wrong, I was stuffed.....it's a lot of potatoes and meat.  I think if you like baked potatoes for a meal....this is your place"}
{"text":"Huge selection of poutin dish types. BBQ Mac n cheese was really good. The regular/traditional is solid, but the steak fajita had a bit too much in it and made it really soggy."}
{"text":"As a fellow from the States visiting Canada and Toronto for the first time, I've been hearing lots about this so called poutine. The person at the front told a lot of the foreigners that people in the states also have a version of poutine called \"disco fries\". However, I had yet to taste that and I had to try this poutine. The stores have a student special and was $5 for a snack sized poutine and a drink. I was a student from the states so unfortunately the ID didn't work but the person at the front used his employee discount and gave me a traditional sized poutine for 50% off. I ended up paying around 4 CAD. Once I got the poutine, I was surprised how big it was. The french fries were really crunchy, seemed like they were freshly cooked and hit with salt. The gravy was light and albeit salty for my taste. I really like the cheese curds, very stiff and kind of tastes like pull apart mozzarella. One of their slogans is clogging arteries since 2008 and rightfully so, their portion sizes are huge. I wasn't able to finish the traditional sized poutine so I'd much rather go to a place much smaller. I guess this was an in your face poutinerie so you get a lot. Of course if you want to stuff yourself with poutine and regret this is the place to go, I'm pretty glad I tasted it here. Because the next time, I'm drunk and hungry, this will be the first place I go to because it is definitely the most filling drunk food. Maybe for someone who wants to find a nicely portioned place, look somewhere else. But otherwise a lot of poutine for a good price and it is very in your face."}
{"text":"The large pulled pork is good and enough for two. Black cherry soda is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm a poutine freak. Last time I went to Montreal, I ate at least a poutine a day. I think the gravy blubber really helped me survive the frigid Canadian climate.

But Toronto isn't really a poutine town, is it? Smoke's is ok, and they have a lot of cool novelty poutines, if you're into that. The basics are a little lacking though. The fries should be crisper, the gravy should be richer. But whatever. It's gravy with fries and cheese. You can't go too wrong."}
{"text":"Solid eats, nice staff, tasty food! I'm a recent convert to the whole \"Poutine is Good\" mindset, so I've been trying a few different versions here whenever we can. We got the Hogtown and the Chicken Country Style this time around, and both were crazy good. 

The place was pretty quiet and there was only one employee on - Mark I think? He was super friendly and really chill, I would go back just to order from him again."}
{"text":"Poutine, glorious poutine!
I stopped here for lunch and made the mistake of ordering a large size bacon poutine.
The appearance of the large box versus the regular size box didn't look that much bigger and it was only $1.50 more for the large, so I went for it.
Boy, was I in for a challenge!

The large box was pretty much almost double the size of a regular box and in that box was a hefty serving of yummy thick cut fries, cheese curds and smothered in gravy (all was good). Then on top of that was a huge heaping of fried bacon.
I mixed it all together and quickly devoured half of it which is when I felt really stuffed and poutined out.

I like that they have more than a dozen different variations of poutine. The restaurant itself was nothing special, but in a good way. It has a certain nostalgic humble charm without being a hole in the wall.

I will definitely return for another try (the curry poutine sounds interesting) once my arteries has recovered.

One thing this place needs is a liquor license. A cold pint would go so well with a heap of poutine -- how Canadian is that?"}
{"text":"It's not as good as I last tried it at their Adelaide location, but still good.
This time I was smart enough to order the regular size instead of the artery-busting large size. I had the Hogtown, which had caramelized onions, mushrooms, sausage and bacon. It was the perfect combination of ingredients. I wished the fries were fried a little more so that it wasn't so soggy and limp when it was swimming in the glorious sea of gravy.

This location had a limited amount of seating and there are no washrooms (you will need to use the Starbucks next door)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I can't say I did. When I first walked in I noticed the extensive amount of choices. The options were endless, (and a little crazy) which had me saying \"I can't wait to come back to try more!\"

First and foremost this is a tiny little pick-up and eat elsewhere restaurant. We struggled to find seating for 4 during lunch as there are minimal tables.

I went with the nacho grande as recommended by the cashier. Fries with salsa, jalapeños, cheese, sour cream & (pre-packaged) guacamole. I was slightly disappointed that none of the cheese was melted and my fries were cold! Seems like the salsa came right out of the freezer onto my fries. Who likes cold fries.. 

Regular size Poutine with a drink came out to $10.25 which I think is a good value for the portion. Maybe I'll be back to try the chicken fajita."}
{"text":"I eat here before I go clubbing.
Every kind of poutine imaginable! :)

But last time I went my poutine was sooo watered down and wasnt very hot .. 
usually its good.. 
for the price you pay ud think it would be delish!?  :("}
{"text":"Actually I'm giving 3.5 stars but that seems to be a problem for my iPad. Review below:

Pricing: $7-12+ tax


When heading to Eaton Centre one weekend I happen to drive by a Smoke's Poutinerie. I never heard nor knew of its existence until my best friend pointed it out.  I had it in my head to try it out. Since a part time class at Ryerson, I rationalized that was the best time to try it out.

So here I am writing this with a belly full of poutine.  So let me break it down for you piece by piece, fry by fry.  I had the fortunate event of having their last batch of fries sold out so they had to make it fresh. They are a nice golden yellow with a light crispy texture on the outside and a fluffy centre at least until the gravy soaks in.  They become waterlogged err gravylogged and starchy but that is the inherent flaw of the poutine.

The gravy is just right not too watery not to thick but it was a little too salty for my taste. The beefy flavor occasional comes back in between bites.

The curds were not little cubes of cheese but nice chunks. Soft and gooey when hot enough it brings a contrast to the crunchy or gravylogged fries which makes the whole pouting thing work.

I tried the Philly and cheese so I got some caramelized onion, some roast beef shavings and some cheese sauce.  The cheese sauce is lost amongst the complex flavors and the gravy overpowers it so it becomes pointless.  The caramelized onions make a good break from both the fries and the curds and the beef is honestly not that special but it is enhanced by the gravy.

I went for a Large being a pretty big guy and I'll say now. You do not need to go large. Unless you are so hungry you can eat a horse literally or you are in the middle of a bad break up and want to eat to ease the pain or just plain hate yourself, do not get a large portion. The large is an extremely generous serving. Like I said before, I just ate and I have a belly full of poutine, this is not an understatement."}
{"text":"Gross. Possibly the worst fries I have ever had at a restaurant.  I guess the people who like the poutine are talking about the toppings.  Without the toppings, they are just greasy, tasteless fries.  There use to be a great french frie place at this location. Sadly, it's gone and this mess is in its place. Yes, mess, as in the thick dust on the wall right beside where you eat. Yuck. Will not be going back. Should have asked for a refund!"}
{"text":"First of all, I walked into this experience thinking that i wasn't going to like their poutine. Like, I've had poutines before. I've had carne asada fries which is sorta the same thing. I've had fries in gravy before. Sure, all those things are good so coming into Smoke's I had this preconceived notion that it was going to be good, but there was no way in hell it was going to be great. Well, I WAS WRONG.

Let me back up a bit. It was my first time in Toronto and of course, I'm making my rounds and trying to eat all that I can in a span of 24 hours. I just finished up a fancy tasting menu of 5 course at Canoe. I wasn't overly stuffed but i was definitely full. My friend and i grabbed cocktails nearby that took up maybe an hour but then she suggested that we had to get poutine because I'm in Canada. Thinking i would try two bites and be done with it, we ordered a medium-sized (I forget the technical name they call it) pulled pork poutine, and took it home. 

We get home, we open up the box and i try a bite. HO-LY SH*T, that's good. And what are these white marshmallow looking things?? Oh, they're cheese curds?! What in the world is this deliciousness! So, long story short, we were not hungry and we devoured it. 

And now that i am back home, I dream of poutine, and cheese curds."}
{"text":"It's not often I would throw away food but when it's unbearable to enjoy then that would be my reasoning. I've had their poutine from other locations and gated it each time but I figured it was because of the toppings. I tried the traditional today and I have now confirmed smoke's very overrated. I will not be returning to any of their locations."}
{"text":"THE BIG: Tucked away on the busy streets of Little Italy Toronto. Medium sized shop with decent amount of seating. Parking is relegated to metered street parking with tons of traffic on both side.

THE BLACK AND WHITE: It was our last day in Toronto and the bae and I decided to go grab some of what Canada is known for: Poutine! Let me tell you, parking is horrible here. If you have a chance, take public transportation or walk. 

Walking in, the shop is a little grungy but I felt like it fit the decor. Each poutine option was bucketed off into the different proteins: chicken, pork, beef, veggie, etc. I heard the veggie poutine is great. That'll be something I'll get next time I visit Toronto.

We ended up getting the Korean BBQ (beef) and traditional poutines. The traditional contains the 3 essential ingredients: fries, gravy and cheese curds. The Korean BBQ poutine was a bit more expensive but wow did that taste amazing. Kbbq beef with kimchi, cheese curds, and red peppers. Yummm.

THE FINAL BAMBOO: $13.95 USD was the damage here for two distinctly different poutines. Super heavy and filling. Definitely can't wait for the Philly location to open up!"}
{"text":"Had a longer than usual lunch break at work, so I decided to come get some poutine. The service here was really good. The guy was pretty quick and kind. However, I felt like I have tried better poutine at different Smoke's Poutinerie locations. Not sure if it's because it was during the lunch rush or something, but the poutine wasn't amazing (by the way, I chose the usual one that I always get). 3 stars for the good service, clean atmosphere and cheap food."}
{"text":"This was the first (and so far only) time that I have had Poutine, and I thought that it was amazing. Smoke's has a wide variety of selections on the menu, including four vegetarian options.

Once we placed our orders and paid (individually t the counter), we were each given a number and just waited for them to be called when the order was ready. There seemed to be 2 people handling the counter the night that I went, and they seemed to have a pretty good turnaround time for each order. 

I ordered a Rainbow Poutine, which ended up having a generous amount of guacamole, sour cream, sriracha and cheese and tasted magnificent.

The Poutine is served in to-go boxes, which seems to encourage people to take the food and eat it elsewhere. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small and not good for sitting down to eat. there are a few bar stools with a counter for seating against the wall. However, it did not seem comfortable or conducive to a group dinner. Also, given that there were 5 of us, there was not enough open seats. 

I would definitely recommend stopping by this place (or any other place that serves Poutine) and trying the Poutine. If you do go to Smoke's Poutine, just don't plan on sitting there to eat it."}
{"text":"Had to stop by this place because poutine is known in Canada.  There were so many different choices you could chose from but also create your own.  I was thinking the portions were going to small but in fact they were very large.  I almost didn't finish my food.  This place isn't for someone who is looking to eat healthy.  I got the chicken bacon ranch poutine and oh my word there was so much bacon.  Majority of the time there isn't enough bacon.  You could prob go everyday for a month and find a different poutine to eat.  The place was not as clean as other restaurants thus why I gave this place a 4.  If they cleaned a little more and do a deep clean also it will help the image of this place.  Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Maybe I am biased because I walked in starving, but the poutine here was delicious. I ordered the curry chicken poutine. It's definitely better than the ones I had at New York Fries. It tasted a little too salty, but when you're starving it doesn't matter. That box of fries, cheese curds, and curried chicken was heaven.

Now that we have the food out of the way, the line was pretty long. There was only one person taking orders. It took about 5-10 minutes to receive the poutine after placing an order. There aren't too many tables, but there are plenty of bar stools."}
{"text":"I am shocked, SHOCKED, I tell you, by some of these low ratings.

Stumbling here after a hockey game and a long night down at the Antler Room, I was immediately impressed by the wide array of options offered at Smoke's.  Decisively choosing the Country-style version, I was quickly served a steaming box (typing that it sounds kind of gross) of chicken, bacon, peas, fries, curds and gravy.

It was epically delicious!  I posted a picture of it on Facebook and my poutine-less American friends were instantly jealous.  I imagine most of them were licking their phones or comptures, trying to get a taste of that savory goodness.

To be honest, this was my favorite poutine in Toronto--sorry Poutini's...I love you and love your name but Smoke's is the poutine I dream about!"}
{"text":"Woah, I don't know what Tim T. is going on about a waitress not bringing him his food and all of that in his review. If he complained about lack of parking (tiny lot out back) or the fact that unless you're out on a perfect day, you'll be freezing or burning on the metal seating outdoors, I would agree, but there was nothing wrong with the service.

Smoke's has no indoor seating. It's basically a walkup counter with an area for a line to form inside. You order and the cashier will call your name when it's ready. 

There are 3 sizes - a big one that is 2 lbs. A \"meal size\" which is 1 lb & a \"snack size\" but the cashier said he had never weighed a snack out. Probably about 1/2 the size I'd guess.

Brian and I split a traditional meal sized for $7.99. That felt really pricy for Canada's most famous drunk food. The gravy was very thin but good - I could taste the rosemary. Cheese curds were not what I expected - it was a sort of a cheesestick consistency. I expected more cheese for both the price & mountain of fries.

These are much better than the god awful salt lick poutine at Brooklyn Bowl, but I'd definitely try non traditional next time."}
{"text":"O.k., I'll admit this was my first experience eating poutine.

WOW! This is great stuff. I stopped by earlier today to try Smokes. A native told us this is THE best place or poutine in downtown Toronto. We opted for the original and pulled pork varieties. The original was really good but the pulled pork blew us away. The fries were delicious but when you pile on the curds, gravy, and pulled porky he combo is downright dangerous.  Love it!

The staff were courteous and the restaurant was clean. Excellent experience. 

Our experience ended abruptly when the fire alarms went off and we were asked to step outside. 

Love this place, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My fiends decided to drag me out to this joint after partying it up inside a near by club. I have always heard good things but never had the opportunity to try it. Mainly because there isn't one near me (just yet). This joint seemed to be the hot spot at 3am since it was packed with a line forming outside the door. I decided to go in and grab a table while my friends waited in line to order. I let them choose since they have been here and knew what to order.

About fifteen mins later my friends came back with what is called \"THE TRIPLE PORK!\" and let me just tell you.... It's CRAZY and i'm sure it's a heat attack in a box. the 3 of us devoured it but it was just the right amount! There is no way I would be able to eat one to myself and to just think about that makes me full!

Next time I go I hope to try something a little more traditional and see if they man up to the good old classic poutine (which i'm sure they will)"}
{"text":"I never really tried Poutine before but I must say that I am a fan. The gentleman behind the counter helped us out a lot by explaining what it was and even suggesting the most popular ones on the menu. 

My husband got the Double Cheeseburger which was really good. It had some really nice flavors and the gravy was so delicious, but the combination of everything was a bit salty for my taste. I 'm not sure if they salt the fries before they add the toppings or if it was a combination of everything together. 

I Got the Triple Pork, which I liked a lot as well. The gravy that they used is just super delicious, and I really enjoyed the cheese curds in it too. I just wish there were a little bit more- I LOVE CHEESE. ( I wonder if there is an option to get more cheese or not. The pulled pork was nice and tender, and The cooked the bacon and sausage just right. But my poutine was also on the salty side- couldn't eat much after a while. I bet ya if this one had some thinly sliced onions on it... it would've been amazing- it was just missing something to really tie all the flavors together. 

All in all, I would go here again because it was really good. I'll just ask for less salt the next time i go. PLUS they have Jones Soda which is made from real sugar cane. Awesome"}
{"text":"I did not understand all the kerfuffle over Smoke's Poutinerie.  A colleague got the pulled pork poutine for me, and I thought I was going to be sick afterwards!  (I at least felt like I was close to a nap.)

The pulled pork was bland, the gravy was salty and watery, and fries were ridiculously salty and soggy.  The cheese was also not melted in some parts!  GASP!  

In Toronto, you'd be better off even going to a Harvey's (if you can still find one) for a poutine."}
{"text":"Thanks Smoke's for popping my friend's and my poutine cherry. I got the triple pork ($9 pre-tax), which came with pulled, bacon, and sausage. Talk about overload heaven. I didn't even get to the fries/gravy and cheese curds until half-way down the box! It's certainly zero mystery what had to occur after this meal = major food-coma-nap. A bottled coke was the perfect accompaniment to this heavy meal. As if the bubbles somehow allowed extra room in my stomach for more gravy soaked fries. 

There area a couple of seats inside. Seems more like a take and leave kind of place as all the orders were ready in a few minutes. No real hints, just try whatever combo sounds good to you!"}
{"text":"Cheese?  Yass.  
Fries? Hell yass.  
Gravy? Sure. 

All three together??? YASSSSSSSS!  

Came here on Saturday 5-7-16 for my very first poutine.  $26.75 got us two poutines, two drinks, and a hot dog.  The restaurant is located in the new shopping center adjacent to the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop.  Parking was surprisingly easy...we pulled into the lot and a lot attendant guided us into a spot since we're locals.  

I got the meal size traditional poutine for $7.99.  It came in a box and the french fries were the kind with the skin still attached drenched in gravy and cheese curds.  The heat of the french fries made the cheese curds all melty.  It was a hefty portion and I was unable to finish the whole box.  

They have many variations and toppings for the poutine and they sell bottled and canned drinks.  I think next time I would opt for the smaller size because poutine is delicious but very filling.  Yay! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Not too bad! Only one girl was working at the time and she took all the orders and made all the food so it was a little slow.  Portions were bigger than expected.  We tried several different kinds - chicken chili and country style were the best."}
{"text":"Gluttony wanted us to walk in. It was getting cold...the Philly Cheese Steak WOW FOR $15 with tax and a little tip. Delicious, savoury but use some more peppers and mixed in properly. But that's me being picky."}
{"text":"New business attribute suggestion when reviewing businesses that are open past midnight: level of inebriation. As in...

1) Please state your level of inebriation while writing this review.
2) Please state your level of inebriation while ingesting the food reviewed.

This would give a more balanced overall assessment. I visited Smoke's twice in the span of one week: once at 1pm (drunk) and once at 1am (sober)**.

At 1pm, the food was acceptable but not mind blowing. I was able to eat about half of a small order of the Traditional (meat) gravy ($5.45). I am not a fan of the gravy - it tastes overwhelmingly of an herb that doesn't belong in gravy. As Susan C has mentioned, it might be rosemary or thyme? I don't care to scrutinize this any further but it needs to be extracted from the gravy recipe. 

Later in the week I split a large Traditional Veggie ($6.95) with a friend and we handily polished it off. The veggie gravy tasted better than the \"meat\" but still wasn't hot enough to melt the curds. I want more strings dangling from my lips and I want to be wheeled into the ER with a giant melted cheese curd blob in my stomach that requires immediate extraction, OK? 

Love the sticker campaign, guys. Brilliant.

** just kidding"}
{"text":"I was glad to see another late-night eatery open up in the 'club district' as Burrito Boyz usually has an obscene lineup when the bars let out. 

Poutine is exactly the kind of comfort food you need at 3am on a Friday to soak up the countless tequila shots and jagerbombs you've just finished plying yourself with at one of the surrounding clubs! 

The menu is massive and there's something for everyone (I counted four veg options, including veggie nacho and another one with mushrooms). At $5-10 it's not cheap, but there is no way a giant plate of fries smothered in cheese, gravy and other toppings isn't enough to satisfy you at mealtime. 

Next time I go I might ask for the toppings to the side as the fries were too smothered for my liking and by the time I got to the bottom the fries were pure sludge."}
{"text":"Great poutine. Server suggested mixing siracha with ketchup for the bacon cheeseburger poutine. Would have got 5 stars but some of the meat was dried out."}
{"text":"As the name implies, Smoke's Poutinerie has numerous poutine options on their menu. I stuck with the Traditional Poutine since this was one of my first experiences trying poutine. The food was average, not good or bad. The gravy tasted a little watered down but the cheese curds were nice and creamy. Overall, a decent option if you are craving poutine, drunk and need something to eat, or are a tourist who hasn't tried poutine yet."}
{"text":"Poutine..there are hundreds of places that serve it in Toronto. Smoke's is a fast food version of it and to be honest with you, I did not like it here.

The base which are the fries were average as hell. The pulled pork did nothing to me, the gravy tasted way too watery. The cheese curds were of a plastic texture.

I was very disappointed as everyone seems to come here. It's their poutine bread and butter.

The service was fast food oriented. Can't say much more than that. 

If you want good poutine order it from a respectable restaurant or maybe even a street vendor. It's that simple."}
{"text":"Is it completely authentic? No, I'm quite sure you can get better in Quebec quite easily.

Is it good by Toronto standards? You bet.

Are there lots of flavours? And how. The menu is extensive in causes of premature delicious death. One of my favourites is Nacho Grande, and the Thanksgiving Dinner one (turkey, peas, cranberry sauce and stuffing) was awesome.

Is it expensive? Yes. The large is by far the better deal - often $2 more for more than twice as much, and the small on some of the \"higher-end\" poutines is often in the $7-8 range. Don't plan on keeping the leftovers of the large around, though, because...

Does it re-heat well? Not at all. The fries have a tragic reaction to microwaving. Worse than Mickey D's fries.

Is the service good? Depends on who's behind the counter. I've had very friendly, and I've had people who would definitely much rather be doing anything else. Not bad, mind you, just... annoyed. Getting your poutine takes a while, as they seem to cook the fries on-demand.

Is it worth going to? Yes, but for your own sake, not too often."}
{"text":"Really not much to say here. The usual Smoke's food, but with next-to-no seating and quite the grimy location. Been here a couple times, it's in a good location near the Snakes and Lattes and other fun bars and pubs nearby. Service is no better or worse than other locations, takes about 10 mins for each order.. The food is still as good as the other locations but it's really hard to get a spot to sit."}
{"text":"While sightseeing on Queen Street, some local friends brought us here because none of us have tried this \"quintessentially\" Canadian food called poutine (is that plural?), which can be summed up as basically fries smothered in gravy and cheese curds.  Makes me wonder what the history behind this might be, but its getting too late to do some googling.

Smoke's Poutinerie is a small place primarily geared for take-out or a quick eat-in if you can snag one of the few bar seats that line either side of the store on your way to the back ordering counter.  Narrow, industrial space, all black and metal, a blackboard completely scribbled over on one side, tons of framed articles on the other.  I liked their old fashioned menu board, with over 20 options to choose from.  If you didn't know these were the toppings, you'd think it was some mishmash listing of various comfort foods (e.g., bacon cheeseburger, philly cheesesteak, country style, curry chicken, etc).  

Get it small or large; at $6 - $10 an order, the portion size seems about right, meant for sharing.  Our group got the straight-up traditional and double pork.  They come in waxed cardboard to-go boxes, and they simply screamed comfort food in all their sloppy and saucy glory.  The fries tasted fresh, although any frying they underwent was undone by the sauce, which was tasty enough, not overwhelming, and the cheese curds oddly went with it all, even if I'd never eat those curds alone.  The double pork topping was just hedonistic, even if it also went well with it.  

Overall well made, but can't really say I'm a fan of poutine.  At least now I can say I've tried it."}
{"text":"In NYC it's Pommes Frites, in Toronto it's the Poutinerie. A late night godsend, the Poutinerie is open past last call on the weekends. We liked the Poutinerie so much that we came back twice!  Be patient, waiting for your poutine, but its being made fresh and I promise its worth it. 

I had the opportunity to try the Veggie Delux, Veggie Nacho, Traditional and Curry poutines. My favorites were definitely the Veggie Nacho and the traditional poutine. The fries for the poutine are perfectly cooked to a good crisp. The cheese curds are broken down into nice small pieces that start to melt amidst hot, fresh fries and hot smoky gravy. 

If one orders the Veggie Nacho poutine, it not only is lathered in gravy and cheese curds, but you also get layers of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. It's absolutely delicious and incredibly filling.


At $5.49 for the traditional poutine, Poutinerie is a delicious post-bar snack that is sure to satisfy the late-night cravings."}
{"text":"I don't know if this meal was so poor because it was made at midnight or if this place just sucks. The gravy tastes powered and the fries were cold. The cheese wasn't melted. We ordered the turkey dinner poutine.. the peas had a freezer burnt texture and the fries were under cooked. This is the worst poutine I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Came here for snack after workout. The plaza was vacated, well, it's late. Parking is not a concern, they open late!! We had the Montreal, philly cheese steak and pull Pork poutine. Montreal, the idea is good, but the flavor just isn't there, it's two bad pickle. But philly cheese steak was great, colorful, caramelized Onions has great flavor, just wish the steak is a bit more color and flavor. The best was the pull pork, the hero of the story, boring look but pack of flavor, it's the one that I will come back to when I crave poutine."}
{"text":"Eh.... It's awesome that poutine shops are open so late for those late drinking nights. But, was disappointed with this poutine. I got the bacon cheeseburger poutine.

Soggy and tasteless fries
Cheese curds that didn't taste or feel fresh. Like they'd been left in the fridge too long.
Gravy was way too salty. Definitely not the real thing. 

This location doesn't have any bathrooms or somewhere to sit down properly. Just a counter. It's also located in kind of a sketch neighborhood."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a poutine lover and a connoisseur of Smoke's Poutinerie. I was beyond excited to know a new location opened up within walking distance of my office. However, I was extremely disappointed with the level of service received. It seems that the staff here could learn a lesson (or two) in customer service. 

The service was beyond sub par. At any other location, it appears clean, staff are beyond friendly, and even in utter chaos, they keep their composure. This was not the case here. The place was almost empty- at the time I entered, I was the second person in line and there were (maybe) a handful of people sitting and eating. The men in front of me seemed to be fishing for a suggestion from the cashier to narrow their choices, but she was just not having it. 

I ordered 1 poutine and waited 10 minutes for my order to come up. In that time, I placed a second order for 2 more (after 3-4 people had now ordered behind me) and it took another 30 minutes or so for that to happen. So altogether, 40+ minutes of waiting. For context, I've seen that many people go in and out of other locations in under 15 minutes. While waiting, employees were constantly arguing about their line set-up, complaining about missing ingredients and pointing out certain combinations they hadn't made before, making me a bit wary if they knew what they were doing. It seems that since my order was 'to-go', they had pulled my receipt to write this, and as a result, my receipt got bumped to the end of the line. Not once did they acknowledge a customer after taking their order or say 'thank you' or 'have a great day' when handing it off. As I packed everything up, I realized the condiment area had next to no supplies (no forks, no ketchup containers, etc). 

For a place that was 'dead', it seemed there was a lot of stress and frustration expressed by employees which as a customer, made it very awkward/uncomfortable. As a new location, I hope they can fix this issue quickly. Having worked in the food/customer service industry in the past, there is absolutely no reason for a customer to know about anything happening 'behind the scenes' or that something has run out. I think I'll be sticking to the downtown locations from now on."}
{"text":"There are four reasons why I ate at Smoke's tonight.

1. I saw a missed connection at another poutinerie.
2. It was Thanksgiving in the States and I thought eating gravy on potatoes was a nice way to acknowledge that I was celebrating in Canada.
3. It was around the corner from Metro Hall, where I was doing research tonight.
4. I've been meaning to eat here for a while and I enjoy partaking in Canadian culture.

Are those the best reasons? Maybe. Either way, I learned that I can't really stomach poutine more than once a year and avoid Adelaide and John for a reason. There's nothing in the area and I had to listen to really annoying young Bay St. types diss everyone and everything, including my \"oxymoronic\" vegetarian poutine and living on Harbord St.

The place is small and can seat about maybe twenty people tops. The menu is varied and has vegetarian options, which gets big ups, and there are two sizes. I am warning you not to get the regular size. It is simply too much food. It's what you get when you are drunk and your friend is drunk and you are both hungry. Stick with the small size, save money, or splurge on a Pop Shoppe beverage (another Canuck invention) or an extra topping that costs a dollar.

I can't say Smoke's has particularly fast service, but then again, it's not called Speedy's. And you don't really need service at a poutinerie. The service is good, though, and I found everyone friendly.

As for my food, it was filling. I am not sure if poutine can ever be \"Amazing!\" because I didn't grow up in Canada and don't have standards for it. My traditional veggie was good but I chose to douse it with spicy sauce. It's a natural reflex and I learned my lesson: Canadian food shouldn't be spicy. And I don't like cheese curds.

I have mixed feelings on the kitsch decor but my only complaint is that the place is SO COLD. As in freezing. As in I couldn't eat my poutine after a while because everything was frozen.

I'd go back in a drunken stupor."}
{"text":"Smoke's is a very, very welcomed addition to the Annex. It's part of the ever-expanding Smoke's family and they pretty much struck gold by opening shop at Bathurst and Bloor.

There's a great variety of meat options and three veggie choices (traditional, supreme, and nacho) and all of the packaging is eco-friendly. The supreme comes with mushrooms, onions, and peas (so good!), and the nacho comes as you'd probably imagine it (salsa, sour cream, guac, jalapeños for the unimaginative). Check the menu for the meat options, you won't be disappointed.

The place is small, as it took over Chippy's old stomping grounds, and it seats about six or so people and has standing room for another six or so. It's more of an in-and-out place, which is perfect for a drunken walk home. Besides, you're eating poutine, it won't kill you to walk it off anymore than the poutine would kill you itself.

On opening day there was free pop for everyone and I was so glad to encounter such friendly staff. To say that I will be a regular is an understatement."}
{"text":"It was my first time going there, so I had their Traditional Poutine and their house brand root beer.

The root beer was good, I have to admit, but their poutine even if it was the best I have tried, is still just poutine.  As such my review is pretty low for now.

What I hope for is when I go there next time I will get their prime rib poutine and change my rating, because they got their bases right, just needs meat.

I got a large to share between 3 people and we failed, so I am just going to cheap out and save $1 and order the small next time."}
{"text":"Yes, Smoke's Poutinerie locations have been everywhere for a while now. They're no longer the little guy. But hell, I love their veg gravy a lot so every once in a while I pop in for a small with extra cheese. 

This was my first time in this location, and it was clean, large and it's situated near a bunch of pretty parks. Poutine picnic? Oui."}
{"text":"Veggie Delight (veg gravy, peas, mushrooms and onions) + extra cheese. It always hits the spot for me, and I'm a meat eater. 

Also, this location of Smoke's is always playing really fun retro radio songs late at night and I have participated in a pout dance party more than once.

Ghost ride the pout!"}
{"text":"Order the triple pork poutine, the portion size is good, but the menu in store is very confusing. The taste is average, the fries are soft and not crispy. They put too much gravy and not enough cheese. The pork is also very dry and hard."}
{"text":"No mushrooms left at noon on a Sunday?  Boo, but ya know what...  Who cares?  The poutine was delicious.  Thank goodness this shop is in Toronto and I'm in Chicago because if it was any closer, I'd be there way, way too often.

Veggie Deluxe with jalapenos instead of mushrooms, and the Veggie Nacho (I think it was called this - with the guac, salsa, etc) for two of us, which we both shared.  Holy potatoes batman - artery clogging, gustatory transcendence.  Will be back for more next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really happy that this location is by the mod club, the staff are super friendly, even though theres only ever one person here. The food is fresh and the gravy is great. If you want to write a message on the blackboard you can borrow the cleaner to make a clean slate. Quite possibly one of the better locations"}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO ALL LOCATIONS
this is the best poutine shop, if you want poutine with stuff in it...for example...poutine with pork, poutine with chicken, poutine with beef...etc with over 30 different combo's of flavors & monthly speciallities...this place is amazing. 
they have free propaganda stickers as well"}

{"text":"not the best location 
not the worst location 
came in here the other day, and i almost had smoke coming out of my ears. 
i came in to redeem a loyalty program card for a free regular poutine, and i was told it was not accepted due to the \"rampant amounts of fraudulent cards\" being cashed in. 
sent a complaint to the higher powers about it."}
{"text":"this location is fairly new and highly anticipated, i feel that some of the staff are not up to speedy crowds and high demand just yet, however the food delivers as always. lots of parking and a decent amount of seating."}
{"text":"It's Smokes. If you've been to one, you've been to them all. If you haven't, this is a great place for a solid poutine. Went on Saturday around 11pm and there was no lineup like you'd probably see at the downtown locations around that time. We got the Country Style and the Rainbow Veggie. Both delicious, but I am partial to their veg gravy- it has a faint marmite taste and I love it. If you always get their regular gravy, I implore you to try the veg at least once."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of late night spots, but can't say I like Smoke's. Super fast, but I wouldn't recommend it beyond that. Our fries were cold, and the cheese was a bit too chewy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a cold night in early October after leaving a show.  Hopped off the street car when we saw the neon glow of the sign.  I couldn't resist the urge to try a new Canadian poutinerie. We were slightly disappointed to find that this location did not have seating available.  There were just metal counters lining the windows to stand in and stare out between hot bites while tearing skin from the roof of your mouth (please be careful).

On to the important stuff...the poutine was superb!  I got the bacon cheese burger and it was great. Bacon bits on top of well seasoned ground beef smothered in a sharper cheese with gravy.  The portion size was more than I actually planned for. They stuff those boxes well.

My friend had the pierogi.  It was superb. I loved mine but I wish I went back and ordered hers too.   It was that good. 

Coupled with a cold night, there's no better place to be in Toronto than a poutinerie like this.  Check out one of the dine locations that they have if you want to feel a little classier."}
{"text":"Gravy, cheese curds, and fries. I know it sounds like a heart attack in the making but trust me when I say IT'S SO WORTH IT! The simple dish made popular by Canadians has found its way into Vegas and I am forever grateful. I had the traditional Poutine and the strawberry lime soda from the Jones beverage line and my stomach was very happy. If you're just looking for a quick poutine fix and not planning on sharing I highly suggest getting the small portion. I could barely finish it."}
{"text":"I've noticed that this place is really good when you're drunk. Not so much when you're sober.
So yeah, I guess my review is favourable...for drunk people looking for good drunk food."}
{"text":"NO INDOOR SITTING. Good poutine and good choices. Open late too."}
{"text":"The place is conveniently located in a big plaza off the 407; and has late night hours until 4am. It is very clean, and the workers are polite and helpful when asking which poutine is the best. I opted for the WOW size container which I had to leave half because of the very generous amounts of meat and cheese Kurds, Bacon, tasty beef.
My order was the Bacon Double Cheese burger with 1 coke came up to $16.15

I will definitely be back again but not order the Wow, but the small and will be satisfied as again the portions are massive, even though my daughter eats the medium which is called the \"meal\""}
{"text":"This was actually my first time at Smoke's and I have to say I was a little underwhelmed. I may have to go back and try a couple of other items but the poutine I had was way too salty, mushy and overall just not a fun experience. I know they have a variety of options types to keep it all interesting but they want to consider removing some of the more unusual items because some things just don't go together."}
