{"text":"Good pizza, doughnuts and service. The updated website and menu look great. Add online ordering though please! We're hooked on the breakfast pizza!"}
{"text":"Three words... Gluten free pizza! We are so appreciative that our neighborhood pizza place offers gluten-free and does a great job at it!"}
{"text":"To the owners of Coleone's please accept this review as the chance to change before you lose more business. We love your pizza and continued to come even though your service was terrible. The last time we where there however it seemed my order had been for gotten and was rushed an under-cooked pizza.  Take this opportunity to fix the issues before you lose more regular customers."}
{"text":"We went here mostly since they do offer Gluten-free pizza, which is what my girl needs due to allergies, me, I'll take a normal pepperoni, thanks.

I had a fold over pizza which was actually pretty good for the price, and our server did check up on us a bit to make sure we were ok.

On the other hand while ordering my GF tried to order the gluten free pizza and somehow in the conversation they got it mixed up and got her one with gluten.....uh-oh. She did end up getting sick for a few days because of it.  Now why am I giving them a higher star rating despite that? Well because not only did they give the one pizza that she got for free, the next time she ordered they gave her the gluten free one free as well, as an apology for mixing things up. Owning up to something like that and giving two free pizza's because of it, goes above and beyond. Because mistakes do happen, and how you own up to is is what matters."}
{"text":"really great pizza, the only place we go to get pizza! They use great ingredients! We are loyal costumers and go their at least 5 times a week!"}
{"text":"Considering the other pizza options in the area (Donato's, I'm looking at you) this is darn good pizza. 

We ordered a New York style extra-large pizza for delivery - half pepperoni and half green peppers and onions. We also ordered a pretty forgettable salad (except the blue cheese dressing was better quality than anticipated). Delivery was fast and right on time. They do charge a small delivery fee but I guess that's ok in these parts.

The crust was delightfully thin and had a nice crispiness. It was only missing a bit more chewiness but the sauce and toppings made up for it. The sauce to cheese ratio was spot on. The sauce was fresh-tasting, if a little sweet, but definitely not spicy - which is a gimmick some other pizza joints rely on too heavily in my opinion.

We'd definitely order from Coleone's again."}
{"text":"Placed a take-out order on a Friday, and was told it would be ready in 25-30 minutes.  When I arrived, I was not greeted right away, but eventually the owner(?) came out and informed me my order would be out shortly, which it was.  When I told him it was my first time ordering from them, he added a box of donuts at no charge.  At this point, I'm hoping the food is decent so that I have a reason to patronize his restaurant again...

I was not disappointed.  The pizzas (medium cheese for the kids, New Yorker for the older folks) were very good.  Boneless wings were good, although the \"mild\" sauce was fairly spicy.  The apple/dessert pizza was just okay, but overall, we were very happy with our order.  Looks like we will be ordering from Coleone's again!"}
{"text":"I love trying different pizzas.  This place has the best and most affordable pizza I have had in a long time.  Great for delivery or dine in for a casual setting. Some of the lightest and tastiest crust I have ever had and the sauce tasted very fresh and authentic.  The service was on point and the staff went out of their way for our party.  I would recommend to anyone for any occasion."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this pizza. I ordered their deluxe. It was pretty good. The toppings and crust were delicious and I love the fact that they put the cheese over the toppings rather than under like most places. Two reasons I like this, 1) It keeps the toppings more secure, 2) they can't cheat the cheese. I swear some places strategically place the little shreds of cheese around the toppings on the lower layer so you can't tell you've been gypped lol. One thing I think Coleone's needs to work on is their sauce. The sauce is just too basic and more like just a tomato sauce. It really lacks that distinguished flavor that commands the respect of your tastebuds and tells your brain \"Mmmm nom nom nom, it must be Coleone's for lunch today.\" Don't get me wrong, this is a great pizza joint and I will definitely be back. I love supporting family owned businesses and I enjoy their pizza. I just think if they come up with that signature sauce that separates them from the rest then they have a more dimensional pizza and potentially a top contending one as well."}
{"text":"Coleone's is no longer in Avon.  They opened a full service restaurant in Avon Lake on Lear Road.  Still delivers."}
{"text":"Not good, not bad.  This sums it up!  Ok if you have a party of kids.  Doesn't reheat well"}
