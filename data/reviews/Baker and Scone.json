{"text":"Bought 4 scones to go, lasted the trip home and were still deliciously crisp on the outside and tender inside. Amazing selection."}
{"text":"BE AWARE! When you are purchasing more than 6 but not multiple of 6, they chage tax. I went in and bought 9 scones to go, first time ever  I check the recipt, wondering why theres tax of $1.15. So I went back into the store and inquired about this. The cashier lady gave no explanation, but said this is how their system work and is unwilling to further clarify the reason they are charging tax when should not.  Accoding to retail sales act, sales in eating establishment, tax would not apply for \" the product is not pre-packaged for sale and is sold as single servings in quantities of six items or more.\"   Please check your receipt as it looks like this is how their \"system\" works when CRA works differently."}
{"text":"Excellent scones, especially the savory flavors like chive & bacon!  This is an adorable shop with a handful of tables and a rotating selection of scones.  The scones are pricey but a good size and very tasty, flaky, and fresh.  The only complaint would be that they don't have clotted cream to go with the scones, instead they come with a bit of butter and lemon curd or jam is available for purchase.

Worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I live in the area, and I always find myself here on impulse when I'm craving a baked treat! They have so many varieties--sweet and savory. To be honest, I was never a fan of scones until I came here. Scones are often too heavy and dense for my taste, but these are different. Flakey and crisp on the outside, with soft and moist layers on the inside...yumm. I did have a few poor experiences however, had a few that were not so fresh near the end of day, and were pretty tough to bite into. All in all it's a great little shop to have in the neighborhood. Chive and cheddar is my fave one!"}
{"text":"Quaint little bakery nestled in the heart of st. Clair. The wife and I had to wait for stockyards so we decided to grab a scone next door while we waited. We had the cheddar and chive scones. Delicious and well priced. A must try."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I was really really excited about trying these scones. The crispy exterior was nice, reminded me of Scone Witch in Ottawa but there was just no flavour to the scone. I got the chive and feta scone and could nor taste chives nor feta at all. Also there were chunks of butter in my scone, not exactly an enjoyable experience. I don't like wasting food but I had to throw away the rest of the scone. Maybe the sweet scones are better?"}
{"text":"Very cute little bakery-cafe, great addition to the neighbourhood! Very tasty sweet and savoury scones (including some gluten-free ones) in a delightful setting."}
{"text":"I hosted an afternoon tea for 5 ladies and what is afternoon tea without scones? I bought 6 scones from Baker and Scone (salted caramel, honey pistachio, blueberry, matcha chocolate, cheddar, chives and dill, and something lemony). We all love all the flavors. The texture is perfect - slightly crunchy on the outside and the right amount of density on the inside. The flavouring is just right - not too sweet nor too bland. The servers are very pleasant and helpful. The decor of the cafe is quite European. We all agree that these scones are better than the ones served in hotel restaurants offering afternoon tea. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"A great selection of scones. The menu consists mostly of sweet ones but I think their savoury scones really steal the show. 

I ordered a dozen of the cheddar, dill, and chive scones and the rosemary, black pepper ones and my friends hoovered them down in minutes. I barely had time to stash a few for myself! 

The store has a wonderful posh feel to it. But seating is very limited so get there early."}
{"text":"Um, $9 for TWO scones? They're not exactly heaven-sent or anything to warrant the price tag! Really dry and crunchy on the outside, which shouldn't happen with scones. 

Ridiculous prices, just okay scones for how much you're paying. Not going to be returning."}
{"text":"Stoped by for a Americano and a scone, amazing. 

They serve scones that are the harder vs. the spongy style.   These are my favourite.  Had a lemon jammie, yum."}
{"text":"Baker and Scone is great! It is in my neighbourhood and is one of my favourite places. Definitely has the best scones I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"This place has a very enticing aroma that wafts around the corner of St Clair and Christie. Upon arriving at the shop, you are greeted by an abundance of delicious looking treats within a quaint setting. 

I have only tried one of their savoury scones (dill, chive and cheddar) and I have to say that it left something to be desired. I felt the flavour was lacking, it really needed that punch one would expect from cheddar cheese and the flavour of dill was completely absent. However, you can te that the ingredients are fresh and good quality (lots of butter).

In terms of texture, the middle was soft, but the outside was a bit hard and chewy. If you are expecting a good English style, crumbly scone, this is not it. 

Perhaps a return trip is necessary to try their sweet scones - maybe they are the best ones."}
{"text":"Tasty fluffy scones. I had a savoury bacon and egg one and my friend had a blueberry one. Both were light and fluffy. It's a pity they were not warm. The coffee was great. Small cute little coffee shop. Not cheap at 18$ for two coffee and scones but better than anything Starbucks has to offer. Worth a visit of you're in the vicinity. Maybe take out as its very small and cramped inside. Staff were nice. Tables weren't particularly Clean though."}
{"text":"Without being the least but hyperbolic, these are THE best scones you'll ever taste. Golden and flakey on the outside, soft and bursting with flavour on the inside. They have a huge selection that varies from day to day, with somethings for every tastebud: From cheddar, chive and dill, to smoked salmon w/ lemon ricotta, to my personal addictive favourite, salted caramel. It's completely ruined scones from any other establishment for me forever, not kidding....they're that good. What's nuts is that the quality control is off the charts; each one is as perfectly made as the other...no easy feat when you taste how good they are. Honesty can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"Baker and Scone is a small pretty shop. There are not so many seat, but I have a cup of tea and scone sometimes. The scones are not bad but not excellent either. I thought it is a little bit expensive."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, and have tried two savoury scones (feta and spinach; cheddar, chive and dill) and four sweet (buttermilk vanilla; maple walnut; coconut; oatmeal brown sugar). I can't say I have a single complaint about any of them: they were all scone perfection! Those remarking that they're fluffier than \"real\" scones are apparently used to scones being dry and crumbly, and I'm not sure why anyone would consider that preferable to rich layers of buttery pastry with just the right combination of flakiness and doughiness. I would love to try their lunch special sometime soon. Today's was asparagus and goat cheese scone tart. Whaaaaaat??? Gimme!! So pleased they're in the neighbourhood -- and especially pleased they're only steps from the Starbucks where I sometimes spend the day working."}
{"text":"Amazing scones! It's about $2.75 per scone which are freshly baked and have a nice crispy layer. It's even plated for you with a homemade pat of butter when you eat in.

Some flavours I've tried are pear hazelnut, pumpkin spice and lemon blackcurrent - all which were amazing. I'll have to try the savoury ones esp the one with the egg in the middle. The space has a cute twee-hipster vibe that would make Wes Anderson and Zooey Dechanel happy."}
{"text":"Folks there are really nice and the scones are pretty amazing. The salted caramel - is it salty, is it sweet?....what it is is awesome. Just finished a smoked salmon tart...what!!!! Extremely flavourful, could have eaten five of them."}
{"text":"A great hipster hangout for scones that are quite delicious, if not the most expensive ones I've ever encountered.
The scones vary from salted caramel to vanilla and more. 
They seem to be a bakehouse that pretty much only bakes scones and serves coffee. 
Worth a try but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Looking for some of the most delicious scones in Toronto? This is the place?

After eating scones here for a few months, I literally can not eat scones anywhere else. 

Their scones are the perfect combination of flaky, crusty, yet moist and tasteful.

They typically have 6 or 7 options out - and a gluten free option - which are always being rotated and new flavours invented.

While I love their sweet options, I also have come to LOVE their savoury Dill and Cheddar scone. So delicious.

Here is a secret: their espresso is also super delicious.
Here is an other secret: while they are known for their scones, their Kale Salad is pretty incredible."}
{"text":"They have the best scones in the city. Salted caramel is my favourite. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from the San Francisco area and rented an Airbnb around the corner from Baker and Scone.  As a group of 6, we tried every Scone then returned the next morning and bought every type again. Two in our group are bakers and make a pretty decent scone, but these scones . . . how to they get them crunchy on the outside yet moist and delicate on the inside?  Any return to Toronto will involve a stop at Baker and Scone."}
{"text":"It's my Saturday morning crack. The salted caramel are to die for - especially when straight out of overn. Good coffee too. Jammies and salmon sandwiches are good too, albeit a bit pricey. Good americanos complete the ritual.

Also, nice staff..."}
{"text":"Really love this place - after a coworker came with a box of freshly baked blueberry scones, I decided I had to come here myself. The place is quite small with just a few tables, but the smell of freshly baked scones are amazing. I got the Blueberry and Cheddar and Chive. They also feature lots of other flavors, however, they might not have it the day you come, so if you order enough, they can make it for you. What's neat about this place is they also feature (every Wednesday's) a fully cooked meal for family of 4 and 6. The menu's seem to feature fresh and local fare.

Definitely would recommend this place for scones!"}
{"text":"The scones are phenomenal, but the business model makes zero sense. Do not come here expecting a proper brunch; I don't see a way to eat here without leaving hungry. Until they expand their menu, I'll be down the street at Stockyards."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto a month again, and I just keep coming back here for a quiet morning coffee and a scone. The staff is super friendly, they always have new scones to try, and they have a perfect window for watching people go about their morning hustle. They did raise their prices recently, but it is always good to support local businesses. Also, they always have at least two or three vegan options."}
{"text":"I made it a point to go here on a stormy Sunday morning as I was craving baked goods and what better way to satisfy a craving than waking up at 9 am and driving 20 mins through a storm to find parking space that was now a snow bank... Yahhhh I get a little crazy when I crave food... 

Solo it was cold outside and inside...*sigh* I wish the heater was on especially as customers kept leaving the door open. The cafe was really nice, white walls, very clean and chic. There were 4 tables for 2 and a bar that seats 4 along the window. A lot of customers came for scones to go.

At $2.95 each. We got the eggy and the cheddar and chives to share. A chair latte and cappuccino and it came to $18. Which seemed a little steep but we were full after so I guess it was worth it. But we got the salted caramel and apricot jammie to go.

The eggy was good. The eggy was soft and slightly runny. The scone was actually the chive and cheddar scone. The chive and cheddar on its own was also good. The disappointing part was that the scones were cold and therefore hard... So I didn't enjoy it as much as the ones I brought home and reheated. 

The salted caramel and apricot jam filled scone were delicious when warmed. Crunchy in the outside and soft inside. Sweet but not overly. Tasted the flavors.
 
Would recommend this place and would definitely be back to pick up sweet scones!"}
{"text":"Scones are amazing. Flavor are very innovative and surprising yet delicious. I've had special orders made with flavors and have not been disappointed. Favorite choices in my family: butterscotch, mixed berries, and pumpkin. My only reason for not giving 5 stars instead of 4 is that the seating area isn't super comfortable. Small space that gets crowded. Other customers hover over you to get your table when you leave."}
{"text":"A co-worker brought in salted caramel scones from here - delicious and now can't wait to check this place out. Perfect balance with the sweet and salty flavours."}
{"text":"I'm not a scone person, but even these ones I'll eat.  They're soft, flavourful, and delicious.  It's a bit pricey, but they're the best scones I've ever had.  I think that says a lot (not trying to sound full of myself)."}
{"text":"Great scones, specially like the savoury ones, although all of them are delicious. The reviewer who gave 1 star must have had an off day, I live in the neighbourhood and get scones from there almost every weekend and never found butter chunks in mine. Neither are they bland, they are fragrant and the combination of flavours are spot on!"}
{"text":"I've tried at least 5 or 6 different kinds of scones--at all points on the sweet-to-savory spectrum--and they've all been fantastic. A great addition to the Wychwood neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna be honest with you: I've never given a flying fuck about scones, and when this strictly-scones-only bakery opened in my neighbourhood I was puzzled as to why anyone would focus on such a bland niche but my world turned upside down when I tried one of their smoked salmon lemon ricotta scone sandwiches and immediately stopped thinking of scones as piles of chalky flour you just choke down because that's all they have to eat at the tea party at your Nanny's retirement home and I was suddenly overcome with the desire to stand on a corner and spread the gospel about this magical land where scones are buttery and flaky with just the right amount of saltiness that makes them taste so good you're tempted to adopt a strictly-gluten diet and smuggle them into Starbucks (sorry, asiago pretzel), and at around $3.00+ per scone some people think they're a little on the expensive side but I think that's a tiny price to pay to have your mind literally blown by a geriatric baked good."}
{"text":"I love my scones and this place delivered. There is a cool variety, the price is comparable to Second Cup/Starbucks types ($2.60 or so) and THEY ARE SO GOOD. We had 2: a salted caramel (yes, salted caramel!) and berry white chocolate chip one. 
It comes with butter that is just the perfect temperature to add to your scone without fuss. 
I also had an Americano and my brother had a tea. Both good, sliiiiightly more than at a regular cafe, but totally worth it. 
Delicious place. 
Only complaint : jam is extra/$1.50 for a teeny jar, and there is no patio/outdoor seating which, in the summer, sucks. 
Otherwise this place is super cute and delicious and worth checking out."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of joint Baker & Scone for their cooking classes - DONT. It is a waste of money. This $60+ class is nothing more than a demonstration. We were expecting a hands of class after reading their website description and it was far from that. Two hours of watching a random lady bake. We could not see what she was doing as if was all with the mixer. No new skills were taught. We were shown how to add ingredients to a mixer. Waste of money!  I emailed the owner after the class to offer constructive criticism to ideally help make the classes better in the future and heard nothing back. 


Their scones are great and they should stick to that."}
{"text":"I loveeee scones. I went to this particular spot in Montreal (unfortunately closed down now) for scones, tried it for the first time, and became crazily obsessed with them.  Once I relocated here, I was on the hunt for a bakery that specializes in scones. Lo and behold! This bakery has soooo many flavors and types. They have a card you can pick up with the list of the kinds. I had a cranberry orange scone while my boyfriend had a salted caramel. Both awesome with great texture and with a side of small cube of butter. I also had a pretty latte to go with it! They have some shelves that sell jars of ingredients to make your own scone, cool tea packets, indian spices for butter chicken etc.

Baker and Scone also offers classes and high tea, which I asked the girl who worked there. She opened the binder and showed me the upcoming classes! They run about minimum 80/person, pricey, but hey if you happen to have the dough and are looking for something to do, this is a good idea! All schedules are on the website. So take a look! 

I really liked the service too. Very cheerful, warm, welcoming! I highly recommend trying any scone. Although not the best place for lunch the day I went because limited selection, but definitely a cute spot anyways for a scone snack!"}
{"text":"Everything they sell in this place is pretty much expectacular. Try the jam and cheese scones. The hot chocolate was amazing too!"}
{"text":"This place is a lovely spot for morning tea. We arrived on a Saturday morning, and the place was already bustling with customers. We ordered: one savoury scone (cheddar and chive - so fresh), one sweet scone (salted caramel), and two teas. Our total came to, roughly, less than $15. 

We definitely enjoyed the savoury scone more than the sweet - the cheddar and chive was soft and flavourful, while the salted caramel wasn't as soft and flakey (perhaps because it wasn't as warm and just-out-of-the-oven as the cheddar and chive, leaving a slightly hard exterior). Regardless, overall, this was a sweet, light morning treat and combined with the endearing atmosphere, I would definitely drop by again when I'm in the area.  

Note that seating is limited, but if you have a chance to snag a table, grab one and enjoy the lovely, charming atmosphere, as a nice way to begin your morning. Note also that parking on some side streets are free on Saturdays."}
{"text":"A high-quality coffee shop & bakery in a beautiful bright space on St. Clair West. I love coming here on a weekend morning to eat scones, drink coffee, and people watch.

The space looks like a gallery: white walls, tall ceilings, large windows, and minimalist decor. The kitchen is open-concept and the baking takes place in front of your eyes! The scones come in a variety of flavours - sweet or savory. My favourite is the egg scone - an herbed scone with a yolky center. Mmmmmm! The coffee is very well-made which, if you know St. Clair West, is a rarity on this strip. The iced coffee is also great. The bathrooms are extremely clean!

Simply being inside this space will make you happy."}
{"text":"Pretentious as hell.

Scone quality was 100% tasty ...but the service was a HUGE turnoff. 

Waited in line and was mad eyeing one of those \"Eggies\" which are scones topped with an egg. They are super popular so considering how late we went, we knew our chances of scoring one was slim. However, we did the calculations based on how many were left and scientifically crossed our fingers that the few people ahead of us in line weren't going to buy the remaining tray. The person in front of us ordered the second to last one, and in the process, the server nudged the last one into a flop. It was just a little disassembled but they would NOT sell it to us. A.) I'm mad that you're wasting food. B.) Restack and it would've been equally presentable. 

Anyhow, we ordered other scones instead since there were no more Eggies left. They asked if we wanted \"for here\" or \"to-go\" and we said, \"for here.\" Our order still came out in a to-go bag. We sat down to eat regardless. When we asked for a knife to butter our scones, they refused and said to give back the scones since they saw we were eating a to-go scone at a table. They confiscated our scones just to properly plate them and only then gave us a knife. Of course we felt kind of crappy with this treatment even though it was THEIR mistake of giving it in a to-go bag in the first place. 

Pretentious. To the max. 

Unfortunately, their scones were pretty darn tasty. Not dry and well-rounded in flavor. Wouldn't sought it out since I don't like the snobbery, but I wouldn't mind swinging by if I'm already in the area since I can't deny the quality."}
{"text":"The kind of place that makes you want to run home and bake something yourself! The scones are OK, not extraordinary, had the \"salad nicoise\" scone, should be re-named \"opened a can of tuna fish and added half an olive\". Soup of the day badly needed salt, and the advertised Gruyere cheese in said soup would be a nice touch. When an establishment offers sit in eating, it should run like a restaurant, not just a bus stop with food. Salt and Peppes and napkins would be a good start. A pretty blonde hipster boy serving blends into the twee decor quite nicely. Extremely overpriced for what they are selling."}
{"text":"first time i tried salted caramel, it was terrific.
then i tried blueberry..it was okay

but kind service and nice place
u should try lemon curd cream! so sour and fresh ;)"}
{"text":"Any excuse to eat there. Fresh. Well made. Clean facility. Pleasant people serving. Variety of flavour ingredients creative - and they work.  Forget the door-stoppers at chain coffee shops."}
{"text":"To go to this place for a meal is a stretch. I wouldn't consider this enough food to qualify as a meal, maybe just a light breakfast. However, they claim to have breakfast, lunch and brunch which is wasting my time when I walk in and all they have is scones and soup. The scones were very good and I thought the price was fair. However the prices for their tea are outrageous. Service is good but have only been there once so I may have been lucky. It is beside stockyards (the place you should be going to) and in an area with a lot of brunch options so not sure how it survives. Not a lot of space inside to sit, so more for one on one dates. Usually not busy, but I believe they have a very successful take-out/catering business. Just to emphasize, their scones are good, just not really a place for a meal."}
{"text":"I am in love and I don't care who knows it!

The scones are delicious - just like in jolly ole England. I ordered the buttermilk, vanilla scone. The hot chocolate was rich and sweet.

It was like sweet, gentle lovemaking. To treasure the moment forever."}
{"text":"The scones and latte are really excellent. 

If you pass by you will smell it from the street and stop there."}
{"text":"Amazing scone varieties!!! Lovely bright pleasant place. Staff are very friendly., yummy scones.. I love it!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this cute and tiny shop that has a buttery aroma once you walk in! I just died and went to heaven!!! Who can resist butter?!?! The place has limited seating if you prefer to dine in and enjoy your scone paired with one of their beverages! 

We ordered a dozen scones to go along with an Americano & a jasmine green tea! Their Americano hit the spot in the early morning! The aroma was so hard to wait to devour at home so we enjoyed the Eggies scone & cherry double chocolate inside the shop! The Eggies scone was to die for! The texture of the scone was amazing paired with an oozing egg dripping over the fluffy scone! Oh my god! Every bite was heavenly! The cherry double chocolate scone was not overly sweet with the right amount of chocolate and cherry!! Mm!!

I highly recommend this little gem! Definitely the best scones I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We sought this place out and went out of our way to come here. Yummy scones but probably would not go out of the way to revisit. We each got a latte and a 2 scones with jam and took home some lemon curd which was just average. Scones are pretty much always delicious because they're just too finicky to make on your own so when someone else does it, they rock! extremely cute atmosphere and a nice place to just hang for a bit, do a crossword, and sip on a coffee."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I love scones! So much so that I'd trek from Markham to get here to try some of these dough babies. And I was not disappointed. However I have to say, their scones are a bit different. Its not the flaky buttery type you are used to. It's more of a half flaky, half croissant like interior. I still like it but totally not authentic to me. I do however loveeeee their flavour profiles. Their vanilla scone with orange jam was excellent. Their salted caramel scone was unique. Their cheddar and chive one was delicious with softened butter.  They also serve up caffeinated drinks in a lovely little shop with modern white furnishings giving it a clean and fresh look. No Wi-Fi available though and the space itself is small so get the scones to go.... Or bring just your bestie and leave the rest at home."}
{"text":"In terms of scones I give them a 2 star but in terms of philanthropy a 5 star. They donate left over scones to drop-in centers in the neighborhood. I know this because i worked next to them at wychwood open door. I've stopped by numerous times and tried their scones and though interesting and innovative with their flavors, the scones were dense and dry and not light and soft as they are supposed to be. I grew up with high tea and have been rather dissapointed with the quality of both scones and tea in Toronto. Sigh but sometimes that's life."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best scones I've ever had. Every time I walk by I smell the lemon glaze and its intoxicating. Major plus - the staff are super nice."}
{"text":"I reserve a one star experience for establishments that offer sub-par customer service. This was one of them. First off, they had sold out of scones, but not their gluten-free variety. So we decided to have a seat and enjoy. Lo and behold, there is no air conditioning in the establishment. We have to ask an employee to clean the table for us. Service was not friendly at all. Then they proceed to close early (even though their posted hours go until 4 on Sundays), and despite the fact that there are customers still drinking their coffee and eating their scones. A sub-par experience and I would not return. Don't kick out customers when your hours are clearly posted on the door. A sure-fire way to alienate your customer base."}
{"text":"Different varieties of delicious smelling scones! I tried the raspberry jammie and the salted caramel last time - the raspberry was definitely the winner and the salted  caramel was alright! Prices aren't too bad either - under $3 each. I'll be back to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Friendly staff and the scones are to die for. The atmosphere is so light and warm. And the ssssmmeeelll of fresh pastries in there is amazing! Definitely bring your mother. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. Amazingly delicious scones, sweet and savory and the selection is always different. So so so so good. For real. So good. I love them.

They also make a great americano. Whats the point of delicious baked goods if they are not accompanied by equally good coffee? No point!! 

I just love this place. I like to hit it up this place before the farmers market on Saturdays. 

I do wish it was open later on week night evenings so I could eat scones in the evenings as well!!"}
{"text":"I thought I was having an aneurysm but it was just the deliciousness of scones coursing through my brain. Great texture, flavour, and just the right amount of sugar. I'm going to have to keep coming back until I've tried them all.."}
{"text":"What is that saying?  \"Do one thing and do it well?\"  If so, the Baker and Scone folks followed that mantra and have nailed the hipster scone market on St Clair Avenue West.  

Because that is really all they do.  Scones.  And they're pretty good.  Particularly the buttermilk brown sugar.  Just mouthwatering, flaky, juicy even.  Mmmmm mmmmmm.

Tips:  The store is tiny, don't expect to eat-in.  Leave your kids and pets and strollers at home.  Come early, they often sell out.  Always always always order the lemon curd.  Watch for odd holiday / long-weekend / summer hours (I'm glad you want family time, and definitely relate but isn't being open inconvenient days just the cost of running your own food service business?) Line-ups rival those of the Stockyards on some weekend mornings.  While you wait in line at Baker and Scone, send your partner/friend/power-walking buddy to get coffee at Starbucks.  If you're not going to eat all of your scones within 6 hours, freeze them immediately lest they turn into fossils."}
{"text":"Amazing small scale bakery. If you're looking for your traditional bacon and egg breakfast, obviously don't come here. However, if you're up for something a little different they have a wide variety of tasty scones and not to mention they brew an EXCELLENT cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"I have been procrastinating about writing a review for Baker and Scones. 

After a month long scone exchange with my colleague from Starbucks, Timothy's Coffee, Brick Bakery, My Market Bakery, Jimmy's, and Panera Bread, to name a few, I am happy to declare two things -  1) I still fit in my dresses and pants, 2) Baker and Scones has the best scone in town. 

It was love at first sight! These scones are heavenly - crusty exterior with a flakey buttery interior. Fresh scones come out of the oven around the clock! There are ample incredible flavours to choose from - Fresh Blueberry Vanilla, Old White Cheddar Fill and Chive, Feta and Spinach, ect..  While Baker and Scones are known for scones, their soup of the day was also phenomenal. I had the bowl-licking Tuscan Kale Soup! Who can resist a bowl of hearty soup with a warm scone on a cold rainy day! 

Baker and Scones has captured my heart!"}
{"text":"Good scones.  A bit on the sweet and fluffy side but still quite good.  Great addition to the neighbourhood.  Visit them on Facebook or Twitter."}
{"text":"This is a dainty place located on St. Clair. There is limited seating so you may have to wait in line if going for brunch in a weekend. There are savory and sweet scones available. I went with the spinach scone and a soup. The made-from-scratch soup was very tasty and the scone was delectable. If you're craving a scone, this is definitely the place to be!"}
{"text":"We just had lunch at The Stockyards next door and was pretty full but we just couldn't resist going in Baker and Scone (@bakerandscone) when we pass by. It has been on my to eat list and I promised myself I'll just share one and we need coffee anyway, right?!

You'll fall in love with this place as soon as you open the door with the buttery smell surrounding you, it's just heavenly and I can sit there inhaling the goodness all day long.Immediately fell in love with the scone display in all the different size and shape of jars (if you ask any of my friends, you'll find out I have an addiction for them) 

Dark Chocolate Cherry Scone 
~ Perfect!!! Combination of flaky, extra crusty exterior and a very moist interior. 
~ This was so good especially with the sprinkle sugar on top which gave it an added texture.
~  You can also get a mini jar of Greaves Jam for $1.80 but the scone was so good as it that we ended up bringing the jar home. 

Cappuccino
~ Since we are eating in, wish they served coffee in a cup instead of Styrofoam cup #gogreen

Verdict:
~ Seating wise, there was only 4 small table of 2 at the front.
~ Loved it!!!Will have to come back to try the other flavors especially the Savory ones.
~ They always have a gluten free option available"}
{"text":"I love this concept - it's like a cupcake bakery...but all scones! Simple yet genius. The scones were absolutely delicious. I only tried the sweet ones: vanilla buttermilk was to die for, but the chai latte and coconut ones were good, too. I'll be sure to try a savoury one on my next visit. With that said, these aren't exactly traditional scones - they are softer and more like a dense muffin. Real scones are usually a little more firm. 

Scones are served at room temperature, not sure if they can be heated up.

The space is extremely cute, and I love the country theme of the decor. My only complaint is that I wish the place was a bit bigger. It was awkward with all the people sitting/waiting in line."}
{"text":"These scones are PERFECT. I can't even express how delicious they are. Perfectly crispy on the outside, flaky and tender on the inside. Incredible flavour combinations. You literally cannot go wrong with any of the scones you order here. Also- the butter is another level of amazing.

I was lucky enough to get the cheddar/dill/chive scone this morning fresh out of the oven and was blown away. Worth the two minute wait for them to finish baking! This is always our favourite scone, but fresh out of the oven is...mmm....can't even describe.

Also recommend getting a coffee here.

The only downside is the space is small and there is always a line. Really happy to see a local business doing so well though. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love. What a place. The SCONES are amazing! Fresh, real wholesome ingredients, simple, no artificial flavours, just the REAL STUFF. 

I just had the Raspberry and Caramel Scone. Wow. Breath taking. I have fallen in love with the Scone again. 

Nice work y'all!

Seriously if you haven't visited this place then you're crazy. Seriously stop what you are doing and go visit it and pick up a few SCONES you'll be so happy that you did."}
