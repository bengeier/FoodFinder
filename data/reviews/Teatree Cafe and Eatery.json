{"text":"I've really only tried the sandwiches from this place, but they're always delightful. I really enjoy having a healthy alternative on this strip, especially since it's so close to our butcher shop. It's a good place to stop when you have a lot of errands to run but don't want to deprive yourself of nutrition. The salads have real greens in them, not just big hunks of romaine or tangles of frisee. I really need to stop in for breakfast, because the corncakes with jam look amazing, as does the savoury French toast and the black bean breakfast."}
{"text":"I have tried this place  two or three times, hoping for a different result, but no luck.    Today I had the tomato melt along with a bowl of lentil soup.  The soup was quite dismal, like porridge without the zing.  I love lentil soup, and thought it hard to ruin, but this nasty glop did the trick.  Apparently vegan means flavour-free--there were no traces of any spices or other efforts to enhance flavor.  There is a fast-food Turkish restaurant across the street that has a lentil soup--it is much better.  The sandwich also disappointed.  It would be much better with a first-rate multigrain bread, instead of the forgettable rye.  It may be homemade bread, but it lacked flavor and texture.  The overall texture was gummy, and if gummy had a flavor, that would be it.  Never again."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for natural, g-free, organic fare, I love that everything is made in-house at Teatree cafe.  It's in a great, unassuming spot on the Danforth and is great for an afternoon tea, weekend brunch or early evening dinner.  The company I was with enjoyed the soup, chili, shepherd's pie, different teas and desserts. Everything we had was yummy, and the owner is super chill and nice, too.   I hope this place eventually expands to stay open later in the evenings as the teas, desserts and chilled out vibe makes it a great alternative to the Starbucks across the street!"}
{"text":"Great brunch. Amazing cornmeal pancakes and very friendly service. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I'm really loving this place right now, and super happy to be so close to it now that I am living on the Danforth. They have a great selection of teas (chocolate mint rooibos can you say YUM???) and their tea latte is amazing. The place is lovely and the decor super cozy. The food is amazing, which a super awesome selection of gluten-free and vegan items - I had the sheppard's pie (wow) with a soup (yum) and have gone there for brunch before (forget what I had, but it was brunch-y and fabulous).   Only things I didn't like: - not the biggest fan of their coffee. This could be that it was the end of the pot and was cold though. And really that's my fault since when it ran out on my friend they made a new pot for him and they probably would've done the same for me had I asked. - they have vegan baked goods and gluten-free baked goods, but none that are vegan AND gluten-free! Sometimes all I want is a cookie when I'm drinking my tea."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a cozy weekend brunch.  I had the Sweetie Pie brunch which consisted of eggs (any style), vegan french toast and a vegan pancake.  My food came fast and was delicious.  The best part though was the Iced lemon white tea which contained pieces of fruit and complimented breakfast perfectly.  My only critique is a few pieces of fruit as garnish for the brunch would have really completed the meal."}
{"text":"I adore this little cafe nestled at the corner of Danforth and Jones. I used to spend quite a bit of time there as my office was nearby and found the atmosphere, quality of food and beverages and the service just lovely. Erin the owner is friendly, kind and never rushes customers that may want to spend a little extra time there either reading, working or having coffee with a friend. I feel like she understands the concept of \"coffee culture\".  I love the \"tomato melt\" and all the wonderful loose teas, which I have had both hot and chilled in the summer. I also recommend the quiche with the quinoa crust with a fresh side salad. As for desserts,have tried the cookies, muffins and tangerine cake, and they have always satisfied my sweet tooth.  The only issue is that the washrooms are located downstairs, which means that the space is not barrier-free and wheelchair accessible. All in all, a wonderful addition to the east end!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I like meat. And I tell everyone that I don't like vegetarian and vegan food. Including my wife. My wife (who does eat meat) thinks this is pretty funny, considering the fact that in the four years we've been together, she's done everything in her power to get me to join in her quest to eat more meat-free meals at home and abroad, and I always protest.  The reason that's funny is that even though I constantly protest when she suggests we eat something vegetarian or vegan, and I tell her I won't like it, I often end up liking it. Such is the case with Teatree Cafe, a little place hidden away in the non-descript eastern stretch of Danforth just past Greektown.  In truth, it's hard not to like this place. They have a tomato melt sandwich that's just tomato, avocado, havarti cheese and house-prepared mayo. Sounds boring, but it's far from it. And they serve it (and all their sandwiches) on house-baked bread, most of which is vegan and/or gluten-free, and all of which is awesome.  So there it is. I like Teatree Cafe. And I'm starting to like quinoa the more my wife makes it for me. I can't be certain, but hell may be freezing over as we speak."}
{"text":"Great little spot on the Danforth! Not a lot of vegan options in the area so I'm glad I gave this place a chance. The vegan chilli is sooo good!! The veg burger is good but a little bland. They're vegan cupcakes are delicious though! Overall a good place that should please both non-vegans and vegans."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday for a belated birthday brunch with my parents. Since my mother and I are both gluten-intolerant, and they were driving in from Durham Region, we were looking for a gluten-friendly place in the east end, and settled on the Teatree Cafe.   This place is a new favourite. From the adorable and rustic, handmade decor to the downright delicious food (and variety of gluten-free options), you won't be disappointed! I had the Rum French Toast on GF bread, which was really good. The gluten-free bread was made with herbs and spices in it, which was different but not in a bad way. My mom ordered the Grilled Brie and Apple sandwich on GF bread with a salad, which she said was absolutely to die for (I'll be trying this next time!), while my dad (the only one who can eat gluten in my family) ordered the Tomato Melt on Rye, which came with avocado, havarti, and rosemary garlic mayo. He got a soup with it, and really enjoyed both.   The price was right here too - for three people to eat, and all have a coffee, it was roughly $35 after tax (before tip).   Besides GF brunch, sandwiches, etc; they also offer GF and Vegan desserts - cupcakes, muffins, brownies, etc. I got a chocolate hazelnut cupcake and my mom got a vanilla banana muffin for herself and one to take home to my sister (who is also gluten intolerant). My mom wasn't a huge fan of the muffin, but I thought it was okay - the muffin was on the dry side, and had a nutty flavour to it, but the soft whipped cream-like icing on top balanced it out. The hazelnut cupcake, unfortunately, was not good at all - I actually ended up tossing it out after one bite.   I'd hesitate to recommend the baked goods (though I do want to try the black ben brownie, which looked really good), but the food itself was delicious and I'll definitely be back for a meal."}
{"text":"Visited teatree for lunch today. An awesome healthy alternative on the Danforth stretch where pizza and burger shacks dominate the landscape.  Maybe iam a bit bias for such a dining option but Teatree offers a great selection of homemade organic menu options in a fresh and open setting. The lady who served me was very welcoming as I presented as unsure and a bit lost as I do when on my own in a new establishment looking for the best selection for me. This inevitably ended with an order of their blackbean burger and maybe because of my comfort with the atmosphere I ordered the soup as a side (where i'd normally go with the salad). The burger arived in no time despite a relatively busy lunch for the single staff. It was presented with the class of your finest restaurant, minus the double figure price tag and the snooty service. Needless to say that the burger was delicious. The Zucchini and Potato soup was decent. The great thing abour these meals is that they are tasty and filling, and when served with the taste and casualness of the Teatree you cant help but leave the restaurant despite the crumiest weather with the happiest feeling. Huge Five Stars for this Gem."}
{"text":"In my quest to search for a perfect coffee hangout to read and study, I found myself at Teatree today on the Danforth.  I can't believe I found a vegetarian/ vegan coffee shop in GREEKTOWN. While everyone else is eating lamb, chicken and potatoes in nearby shops, this small little cafe serves soups, sandwiches, and baked goods that are vegan and vegetarian friendly, and some are also gluten free!  Their baked goods range from $0.99 to $3.50, but the vegan ones available today were about $2.99 to $3.50: trail mix bar, corn bread, banana bread and a chocolate & rasberry cupcake. I ordered the latter and a cup of organic and fair trade Colombia coffee ($ 1.99). The cupcake was fresh, moist and definitely baked today. It was delicious, but it wasn't all-that as I was able to save half of it for later. The only reason why I kept going at it was because I kept trying to find the rasberries! Needless to say, the rasberries were few. The coffee was self-served, stored in a serving thermos and it was lukewarm.... which is one of the worst thing possible for coffee lovers! Refills were available, but would you really care for another cup of lukewarm coffee?  The cafe features a small, quiet and relaxed atmosphere with neutral colors: mild green with wooden tables and chairs. It's clean, but the wait staff/ cashier needs to keep up with clearing the table tops of crumbs. (But just as I noted this, the cashier cleared the bar table by the window and the table in front of my table. Good timing, like he was reading my mind). It seems like its patrons all agree that it is a good study/ work space as the lady across from me was working on papers, two men behind her were discussing a project and a man in the sofa behind them was reading a magazine. I myself had my course reader open with my highlighter and pen ready to do some serious reading.  The soft music definitely added to the studious environment of this place, although as I was making a note of the this, the music turned to catchy Metrix's Combat Baby -a song that I have not heard in ages! But then it turned to some fast tempo punk music and it just got too hard to read, although the music was set at a very low volume.   Toronto need more cafes like this! Where it's a relaxed and comfy studious environment where patrons can just enjoy their reading materials over coffee, tea, baked goods and light meals. However, my favourite coffee cafe city is still Vancouver, downtown Vancouver to be exact. (Trees Organic... oh how I missed thee!!!) Toronto's coffee culture needs some serious help, any contenders should visit downtown Vancouver for some inspiration. However, I'm glad I found Teatree today, it's a secret gem!"}
{"text":"So, maybe because I didn't have a sandwich I wasn't feelin' this place?   I'm a big-time supporter of local places. Teatree is a cute little place next to my favourite Danforth drycleaner and it's definitely a great are in which to introduce a little cafe serving up many vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. They also have a catalogue of special-order vegan/gluten free birthday cakes, etc. which is pretty cool.   We went in for a brunch, we were the only family there. I had a macaroni and cheese dish with some greens and a cupcake for dessert. It was all just ok, not great, and it was a tad pricey.   The woman working the counter was kind of quiet, but answered all of my questions promptly. I think she was working like 5 peoples' jobs as one person which may have been part of the problem, but yeah. It was just ok."}
{"text":"I've been to the Teatree Cafe three times now, each time trying one of their different sandwiches.  Grilled brie on oatmeal raisin bread with honey baked apples - my favorite of the three - just the right amount of melt and crunch, super tasty  Chunky hummus on rye with green onion, cucumber and sprouts - ho hum, too chunky and fall apart for me. The hummus was a little bland too.  Tomato melt with avocado, havarti, and rosemary garlic mayo - my second favorite, totally tasty.  Also try out their iced rooibos teas - they're pretty refreshing!  Whats great is that they're pretty kid friendly in there and they have no problem with you toting your stroller in (as long as you can make it past the double door). However there is no changing place for babies in the bathroom. There is a little table in the basement which works well in a pinch but watch your kid as its not that sturdy.    Also the chick who is the owner is a bit more proficient then the guy who stands in for her. The cafe is only manned by one staff at a time who acts as server, bus boy, chef and host so don't expect speedy service."}
{"text":"If I could have the Tomato Melt every day for the rest of my life, I would die happy.  And don't get me started on the cakes... *drool*"}
{"text":"The Tea Tree Cafe is under new ownership and they don't do the same type of food as they used too.  With this being said they do make fresh salads, gyros and sandwiches, but seem to be missing the Gluten Free and alternative options that the Tea Tree was known for.  Friendly service with new owners, and the food was good, but it's not the same place."}
{"text":"Glad to have this joint on the Danforth as a veg option... the vegan chili and cornbread I had were... fine, if a little bland and salty. But good healthy food, so I'll go back and try some other stuff.  Strike two, sad to say. This time I had the Black Bean Burger, bland patty, small round bun that immediately pushed the mushy patty out. Work needed on this dish... (bun was nice bread tho...) Salad was an inconsequential bit of lettuce."}
{"text":"So yummy!  We tried this place for the first time this morning.  The tomato melt sandwich was absolutely amazing.  I don't know what they put in the sauce but it's delicious.  my boyfriend had the breakfast with one pancake, one piece of banana french toast and 2 eggs.  It was the perfect size and great to have a gluten free non-omelet option.  The french toast was particularly amazing.   Finally we got a couple of gluten-free mini cheesecakes to go.  Only a dollar each they are a deliciously decadent snack.  Be warned - one is just not enough.  Friendly and inviting atmosphere.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. Oodles of options, friendly staff, nice chill atmosphere. The food is kinda basic to me but it's yummy. Sort of stuff you can make at home. Tea's really rad. I've gone with a few friends & they all like it too! Worth checking out if your around the area."}
{"text":"As a very non-vegetarian I was a little apprehensive. But I needn't have worried - I had a very tasty chili in a pleasantly sunlit and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"VIBE   This tea shop at Jones and Danforth is very unassuming, hence why there was one other girl in the joint that day. The staff are friendly yet not very informative. They have a bar near the window and lots of tables and chairs.  That said, it's a great place to get on the wi-fi and get some work done. I will be here again.   I DRANK I had the honey and ginger tea. It was good. Nothing spectacular. Though they do have a variety of green teas, which I like. And it's affordable at $2.58 for a tea.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I'll be climbing up this tree again. I'm a fan of the indie tea/coffee shops and it's nice to have another one east of the Danforth alongside The One In the Only (which doesn't have a lot of tables to work on or a quiet atmosphere.)"}
{"text":"I only tried two things from here. I had the gluten-free spiced pancakes and homemade quiche. The pancakes had a very chewy/packed bite. It's hard to describe, but I liked the texture of it. As for the spice, I thought it was a bit strong, but the jam was delightful! I love raspberries. As for the quiche, it was different from what I usually had in a quiche, but it was light and fluffy with quinoa and egg! Both were pretty good. I also got a banana muffin which was delicious. I absolutely LOVE banana cake/muffins!!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously cute and Erin the owner is simply delightful. She makes everything pretty much from scratch gluten-free and vegetarian or vegan friendly. Everything is about $7 and includes a soup or salad.  My TOMATO MELT on RYE with avocado, havarti, and rosemary garlic mayo was absolutely superb.  I can't wait to go back and try the CHUNKY HUMMUS SANDWICH on RYE with bell peppers, green onion, cucumber, and sprouts or the GRILLED BRIE SANDWICH on OATMEAL RAISIN bread with honey baked apples. Yum!"}
