{"text":"Thanks to your rude clerk named Holly and your new \"policy\" of scanning my ID for the video cameras just chased away my gaming and cigarette purchases. I dont mind being carded but to have it stored on your cameras and in some database is way too big brother for me. Especially with all the computer hacks these days, I would figure customer satisfaction would be something your company would want. The excuse your clerk Holly gave was utter BS saying that I could have friends outside going to rob the place. I haven't been so insulted. She basically called me a criminal. Hell and I'm a 38 yr old, clean cut, white male in a business suit, just imagine how I would have been treated if I wore jeans and maybe a hoodie? Also right after me a female walked in and she wasnt asked for any ID. Sure sounds like discrimination to me. No worries I will take my $500+ a month elsewhere."}
{"text":"GRRRR! If you don't like your job then quit!!! Don't take it out on the patrons!  That's the feeling and attitude they give off everytime I go into this location. Now this only at the location at Flamingo and Sandhill store #59, because it's not listed here on Yelp probably because they're ashamed and couldn't handle all the criticism they would get.
 
They all suck and should be fired unless this is the kind of people you want to employ. My GF and I only go here because it's within walking distance from our home. And only the women here that should be fired. They are rude and treat everyone that goes into the store with disdain and acting all holier than thou. Commenting about my clothes as if they had any fashion sense and I was wear military fatigues at the time.
 
Are so unhelpful it's crazy. Won't serve you a drink unless you're gambling at a dollar or more per bet which I can see if your only playing to get drinks but I change my bets constantly depending on the game. We we do gamble we are usually armed with a few hundred dollars and typically play for an hour or two at the machines I have won thousands of dollars, more than I lose which is fine . 
 
Ordering food is also taboo  cause even when I see them eating and stuffing their fat faces right in front of me the saying the kitchen is closed no matter what time of day or night I ask so I guess the food is for them only, hmmmm. So we've decided to boycott this location as I can't stand their attitudes. 

 One time the wouldn't even open the electronic door and rang the bell about 5 times. The just ignored the people outside so I left after about 4-5 minutes.
 Dotty's you should fire everyone here and start over here.
  
 As a business owner myself I would never have such people working for me. EVER! So like I mentioned earlier, unless this is your corporate model and if so you need to take a hard look at revamping this ideal. Go to hell Dotty's!!!"}
{"text":"What a dump!!! Food taste like s**t, wouldn't feed it to dead dog!!! Was ignored by the lady working several times."}
{"text":"The worst Dottys ever! Employees are rude. Customer base is a bunch of cracked out people. Non stop arguing: customer to customer, employee to customer. No one knows how to work the Pin creator for your players card...but this is an issue at the past 3 I have been to."}
{"text":"The guy working seemed surprised when I asked if they sold bottles of alcohol. This isn't that kind of Spirits place. They do serve food and drink though. Smoking is permitted inside and they have several little spots to sit and gamble. A breakfast croissant with egg, sausage, and cheese was only $1.99, but we ended up going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wish there was an option to put zero stars.... The moment I walked in for my Best friend's birthday celebration, we were rudely told we weren't allowed to be served because my friend was \"shirtless\". My friend was wearing a crop top, covering all the important and legal areas of public decency. Sharon was so rude and unwelcoming, and we asked to see the policy in writing, which she was unable to provide. After Sharon was unable to show us the rule about not wearing a crop top, she said she wouldn't serve someone because they already had alcohol. Never have I walked into an establishment and been so wrongfully refused. Would never go back to this trashy establishment."}
{"text":"I have to say that out of all the Dotty's Ive gambled at, the employees at this location were the most unfriendly. The only time I was even acknowledged was when I first walked in when I was asked for my ID. After that it was as I were invincible. And when I asked for a drink, while gambling, the woman working treated me like a huge inconvenience. I will not be going back to this location any time soon. I'll stay to the Eastern & Tropicana location where the staff always say hello & at least have a smile on their face."}
