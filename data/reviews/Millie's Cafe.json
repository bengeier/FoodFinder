{"text":"they are one the best family run cafe\"s in america period! They really care and i am very  proud to have such a fine example of my puerto rican heritage in this state.Pastelios de guava pastries are addictive!"}
{"text":"All the food here is very authentic and very well prepared one of my favorite places to eat  I'm glad I found this little hidden place , I I recommend the special relleno De Pappas, and the yucca pasteles are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Simple, cheap, great food. The chicken and roast pork are really great. Try the mofongo and alcapurrias, different and super good.

If your getting take out, call ahead if you dont want to wait (it takes a couple mins)"}
{"text":"My first time here and the food is beyond meeting my expectations! It was so delicious! Small place but was greeted by a friendly face and he even talked me thru the menu so that I can make my best choice! Pricest are very good considering the portion size. Definitely gonna be a regular here considering I live very close! Recommend anything with pork."}

To start out the food is great!
The service not so much, I tried calling in 3 times to place an order no answer so I went there and ordered my food.
I get there and there were 3 ladies behind the counter just looked at me and walk away, then a teenaged boy came out and took my order.
I ordered 2 Cubans sandwiches 2 rellenos de papa.
No one else was in the place then a party of 3 walks  in the boy took their order.
By then I was waiting for my food for 20mins, I could see and hear the ladies talking in the back not doing anything.
Then the party that came in after starts getting their food.
I finally got my food no apology nothing from anybody."}
{"text":"The gentleman who helped me was very helpful and friendly. He took the time to explain the specials too. It is a small place, but not much room is needed to enjoy this terrific food. Went with the Cubano and it was hot and very juicy on a crispy and light roll. Flan was mmm mmm good. Going back for more of this home cooked food as soon as I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on a Saturday night during their music night. The ambience was very lively and welcoming. The food presentation was delightful. The food was very delicious. Will definitely be returning. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Millie's food it EXCELLENT!  The Cuban and Steak sandwiches are the best I've had!  Millie is very kind and patient and helps you figure out what you want, if you're not Puerto Rican!  Try it and delight your palate!"}
{"text":"This place is only open on the weekends, cash only, almost hidden in a strip mall (the only sign out front is a large Puerto Rican flag in the window) but it is one of the best finds in the Phoenix area.  It's the only place I've ever had Puerto Rican food but I think I've been spoiled because it is unbelievably delicious and very very inexpensive.  I have it on good authority that this place is authentically cooked homestyle Puerto Rican food and pastry.  They have mofongo, pernil, arroz con gandules, and different sandwiches like cubano and tripleta.  Mango y queso pastries to finish it off.  Menu changes a bit each week so it's great for return visits.  I can't get enough."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches. Try the Coco-Rico if you've never had it. 
It's hard to find anything but Mexican and chain restaurants in Mesa, so it's nice to have a little variety."}
{"text":"Omg! Went in on a whim and it was sooooo good! Very friendly,  helpful with  the menu. Offered advice on what to get.  Described all the menu ites and what is in them."}
{"text":"I don't understand the glowing reviews for this place. I had the Mofongo Con Muslos plate. Very disappointing! While the chicken drumstick was so tender it was falling off the bone, the Mofongo was just a tasteless lump of plantain with some greasy liquid poured over it. Not a vegetable to be seen! Very unhealthy! This was served in a take home container so I ate one drumstick and maybe half of the Mofongo and took the rest home. Since I was still hungry I ordered the so called flan. This actually was a little cup of cold custard in a manufactured foil cup. Very misleading to call this flan. I was with a small group and the others were also disappointed."}
{"text":"I really loved this little gem.  My family shared several items including the Pernil, chicken mofongo, Cubano sandwich, tostones, and pastel.  I could eat the rice and beans and be happy, they were so good!  The owners are friendly and from the Chicagoland area, which is another huge plus!!  Super affordable AND delicioso!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic. Quality Boricua fare for the hardest to please palate. Be sure to bring your visiting family and friends this fall!"}
{"text":"This was something of a new experience for us, there not being many Puerto Rican or Cuban restaurants in the Valley. We had mofongo, tripleta (sandwich) and another sandwich that used plantains instead of bread. It was all wonderful. We also had a malt (non-alcoholic), coconut soda (Coco Ruco) and a fresh passion fruit juice as well. We sat in part of the restaurant that seemed be like you were sitting on a friend's porch, while listening to Latin Jazz on the stereo. 

It was great. It was like being on vacation."}
{"text":"New Yorker in Arizona constantly looking for the best Caribbean food in the Phoenix area. Millie's is by far my favorite Puerto Rican restaurant."}
{"text":"so i live far out of the valley and being puerto rican, i was just checking yelp for puerto rican places to eat.  i seen this one in mesa, i was ecstatic...

THE FOOD IS AWESOME AND COOKED TO ORDER......that is the best way to do it, at least we know its not processed and just waiting getting dry.  there was so much flavor and it was juicy... i had the mofongo it did not disappoint.......then i had the arroz con gandules with pernil, that to was perfect........it was just like my abuela was doing it.......i will definitely go back for more.......
now they are open on wednesday, just one more day to go see Millie... 

The place is family owned and small but that adds to the ambiance...

I definitely recommend Millie's Cafe to any one and everyone......

Enjoy food from puerto rico......"}
{"text":"The Cubano is awesome. Been here a few times now and will come back again. Excellent quality of food hash tag good food hash tag home cooking hash tag"}
{"text":"So good, just like family makes in New York! I think my favorite is the Pork with rice, although recently I got the Cuban sandwich I was in heaven, every time I meet someone new I always tell them that they have to go to Millie's. and since my sister in-law came from back east who's cooked this kind of food and now that she in the hospital she keeps sending me in for something new, I try to get something different each time we go there, yes I recommend this place to so many I can't count all I have told."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Millie's is great because its so small and unassuming located in an old strip mall, and has delicious, unpretentious food. The food was so good, I created a yelp profile just to post my review lol. I went with my mom, brother, sister in law, and boyfriend and ordered a TON of stuff. My mom, brother, and sister in law lived in Puerto Rico before here and they absolutely loved it! We got 2 cubanos, a jobarito, mufungo, pastelillo de carne, pernil y arroz blanco con habichuelas, a tres leches cake, and flan! Oh I forgot the tostones, amarillos, and a pastel. What can I say, we came ready to eat! Lol but this place is small, unassuming, sparsely decorated with old office chairs, has all plastic utensils, and all dishes are served in sytofoam to go boxes. All drinks are cans and bottles, and there is one large salt and pepper shaker to share between 4 small tables. But the food.. The food. I haven't ever had pork cooked as soft and tender as I did there. The mufungo had thick, crispy bacon and chicharrones. The pernil on the Cubans was utter perfection. The jibarito was perfect, and the arroz con habichuelas was delicious! All washed down with a cold coco rico, this was by far the best meal I've had in a while. I will ABSOLUTELY be going back, and frequently at that. The people there were super nice and took care of us very well. Just know this is CASH ONLY, but the food there is super cheap (we got all that listed above for about $60 and it was a LOT of food) so I definitely recommend visiting Millie's! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Millie please get a credit card machine. I like the food but you would get more money from me if it wasnt because I dont carry a lot of cash with me every day."}
{"text":"Ohhh Wow....Here is The Best Food & Excellent Service!! 
I miss having my homemade food from PR but come and get it at Miliie's...
Thanks Millie's & employers it feels like home..."}
{"text":"We stopped in by mistake. Wanted to get a bite before we flew home to Jackson, Wyoming. Me and my wife got the Cubano Sandwich. I've never had one before but this was just amazing. My wife has and thought it was great. They had a great show playing on the tv and the service was awesome. We will come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I were originally planning to head to Havana cafe for cuban food when we realized the Arcadia location closed in April. I searched desperately to find something that could quench my craving and came across Millie's Cafe on Yelp. My friend agreed to drive about 30 minutes to meet me at the location so I was really hoping we wouldn't be dissapointed.  We were not.

I got there first and was surprised to see how small the restaurant was. However, my initial concern was immediately suppressed by the welcoming owner, whose restaurant was named after his mother in law as I learned. He was kind and went through the entire menu with me. I waited for my friend before we ordered and his mother in law took our order; she was equally as kind. He came over during the order to make sure we didn't have any other questions. Our food came out quickly and was delicious. We ordered a variety of appetizers so we could try everything. The place was authentic, as evidenced by a friendly customer who joked, \"your not Puerto Rican.\" 

The place is small- only 3 tables, and the menu isn't huge, but, everything on it is spectacular and the prices are unbeatable. It happens to be pretty close to me, so I will be back for sure.

P.S. Millie, makes an unbelievable hot sauce like nothing I've ever tried before. Ask for it."}
{"text":"You definitely have to try this place out! I never had Puerto Rican food before -- it's not like it's commodity in Arizona -- and I loved it. The flavoring is very deep, i can still savor it.

I'm certainly planning on eating here again."}
{"text":"My wife brought home some food from this place....  I really liked how the food tasted... Fresh & very tasty.... She also had said that it was a very simple but clean place."}
{"text":"Ay mi madre... This was good. Peeking into the back litchen I can see a few abuelitas back there. I had the relleno de papa, was good. Cant wait to back and get some alcappurrias. Rice con gandules and pernil, que rico..... And the Mofongo. Ufff with the Mojo was just great. Yeah I ate alot that day..."}
{"text":"There should  be more places  like this in AZ. I'm  happy I found it. Authentic Puerto Rican  food. Tried the arroz con gandules, pernil, mofongo, amarillos and tostones everything  was super tasty.  Is not a fancy place but who cares if the food and the attention  is so good. Recomended 100%. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"So good! I got the roasted pork rice dish with peas and it was so delicious and affordable!"}
{"text":"Small place in non-descript strip mall, but neat and clean. My first Puerto Rican meal, and it was quite delicious. We were greeted by a gracious older man who took us under his wing and described the food options. He offered two different kinds of home made chili sauces each of which was wonderfully spicy. Recommended."}
{"text":"The best Puerto Rican place in Arizona! Mesa, AZ is where it's at on Main St. Love it here! Food is great and a lot of PR accessories to buy like bracelets, key chains, etc.!!!!"}
{"text":"good, authentic food from PR..the Mofongo is great and so wsa the pork...needs a ittle attention in the dining, but teh food is great and so was Millie!"}
{"text":"Super good food and friendly service. We had tostones, pastelillo de carne, jugo de guava, a cubano sandwich, the flan...it was all so good"}
{"text":"Amazing Puerto Rican restaurant with very friendly owner. We tried almost everything on the menu(!), and everything was perfect. We highly recommend!  The pastilillos  (empanadas) were out of this world as were the sandwiches. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place
The food is great, the people are great
Will go back again when we return from Canada 
This place is great"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while but have never been in the neighborhood on the right day until today (they are open limited hours, Thurs-Sun 11-8). We ordered our food to go. It took about ten minutes for them to have our order ready. 

The tostones (fried plantains) with garlic sauce were the best I've ever had - wonderfully crisp on the outside, soft in the middle, and you get three for a buck -- pretty awesome. Their garlic sauce was thicker than I'd seen in other cities, and I liked it better than the thin stuff.

I'd never tried mofongo before, but read the reviews here and heard it was great, so we ordered that too, with the pork. I still don't quite know what is in mofongo (definitely some bacon in there, and something else crispy, along with mashed plantains), but it was really good, and combined with the roasted pork it was delicious. 

The man behind the counter was very kind and explained things on the menu that I wasn't familiar with. He seemed really pleased when I told him I had heard about Millie's from Yelp, and he was grateful for the great reviews. But the restaurant totally deserves the accolades -- the food was really fabulous."}
{"text":"Delicious Puerto Rican food. We had mofongo, pernil (pork), chicken, rice and beans, tostones, amarillos, flan and tres leches. Everything was fantastic. (They take cash only.). We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"So delicious! I had the Cofungo with pork and their rice. We also got the fried plantains with a ketchup sauce that were awesome. Nice large portions to share. Friendly and welcoming people."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're trying to get food during you're lunch break. The lady taking owners is super slow and has no urgency whatsoever when taking orders and there's a long line. I waited 10 minutes in line and the line only progressed 2-3 people- and that's just to order. I ended up leaving after seeing the other yelp reviews saying food takes 15-20 minutes to come out. It's a shame, I was really looking forward to trying this place out. It looks like they're just not ready to take on being busy or being a go-to place for your lunch hour."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat in the area. It is a small restaurant, with a small staff but the food is absolutely amazing. 

I have never been to Puerto Rico but if the food everywhere tastes like this I should probably make the trip. I am a lover of sandwiches and the Jibarito has to be one of the best I have ever tasted, easily in the Top 5 sandwiches I have ever had. Well seasoned beef and goodies sandwiched between plaintains, wow!.

Tropi-cola is worth the price, even though it's just a single serving, it complements the food and makes the good even gooder.

Be sure to try the Relleno de Papa and Tostones to warm up for the main dish!"}
{"text":"This is the first Puerto Rican restaurant I've found here and the first one I've ever eaten in since my dad was from Puerto Rico and did the cooking at home. Every now and then I get a craving for arroz con gandules and Millie's doesn't disappoint. I bought pasteles for my mom at Christmas time and she was thrilled."}
{"text":"we tried their pasteles, roast pork and mofongo which was all delicious and also had the potato balls best we have ever had at a restaurant.    
The pastries were also delicious you have to try them."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super consistent and fresh. Reminds me of how my grandma cooked for me on the island. Must get the pernil. Also a must get is the cubano. It's a REAL cubano. Grab a cola champagne while you're at it."}
{"text":"Had the classic Cubano and it was perfect! Also the tostones were great and I especially recommend choosing the homemade garlic sauce on the side."}
{"text":"I've been visiting every restaurant in Phoenix that offers Puerto Rican Food. Being a New Yorican raised on authentic Puerto Rican Food it was really important for me to find someplace in Phx that offered that traditional flavor.  Millie's is the BEST I found.  The most authentic Puerto Rican flavor.  And Millie herself is lovely and authentically Puerto Rican.  My family and I have ended our search for the best and we landed right in Millie's kitchen.  Cant wait til we visit again!"}
{"text":"Yummmmyy! So glad I tried this place. I got the pork with yellow rice. The staff was nice and the service was fast. I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Puerto Rican food in all of Phoenix, this is the spot. The Cubano and Mofongo are MUST!!"}
{"text":"Millies is AMAZING!  I am Puerto Rican (from NY) and often have great food when I visit my Mom & Titi's house but I have to say that Millies Arroz con Gandules are the best I have ever had!  My husband is american and not a big fan of beans but he always has 2nd and 3rds of Millies rice.  We also get most of our parties catered from there and our guests always want to know where the amazing food comes from.  We love Millies and go back as often as we can.  I hope she can stay open for many years to come!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. I recommend the tripleta sandwich.

Down fall of this place- even at their prior location, they are SO SLOW. It take absolutely forever to get your food. Usually there isn't any more than a couple of people working, however, it's really never THAT busy every time I come in. Just expect to not receive your food for 15-20 minutes. Call and order ahead. 
The \"Special sauce\" is to die for!
Great eats."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic comida criolla. Don't miss the Cuban sandwich filled with tender pernil or the rellenos de papa. Wash it all down with an ice cold cola champagne."}
{"text":"I took my Spanish class to Millie's, and it was a great experience.  The entire staff was very friendly and accommodating.  You could tell they truly cared about every one of their customers and are very passionate about Puerto Rican Cuisine.  And the food! Wow! I tried the mofongo for the first time, and was very impressed.  Everything I have tried on their menu has been delicious.  You really can't go wrong with Millie's!!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for something to break me out of the dining rut I've been in and I'm so glad I chose Millie's to break me out of it. Small place on Main, so don't go to fast or you just might pass it. As I entered, I was greeted by Jacob. I ordered the Roast pork with white rice and beans and a drink. It was then that I noticed the cash only sign. I asked Jacob where the nearest ATM was (Food City just down the street) and told him I'd be right back. When I did, he had my order out quickly. The pork was tender and juicy and not seasoned too much which brought out the flavor of the pork more. But the star of the meal were the rice and beans. The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were seasoned very nicely and also had some small chunks of kambucha or carabasa cooked in with it. Since I was the only customer in the place, Jacob asked if he could join me as he ate his lunch. It was nice to talk to an owner of an establishment as we had our meals. I will be coming back again to try some of the other dishes. Oh, and I'll remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a small privately owned restaurant with great food, not a lot of sitting. I got the mofongo pork plate and it had a ton of flavor. The owner was very friendly and went out of his way to give us recommendations since none of us had had Puerto Rican food before. Good food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The pork just melts in your mouth, and the rice and beans was tasty. The Cubana was also excellent. Super friendly service!
Have to go back soon to try the pastels and the tres leches..."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few weeks ago, I have to say I have no experience with Puerto Rican food. I have always heard about it and wanted to try it out back in Chicago. I just have to go off my own taste here, It is very rich as I mean cholesterol wise, so if you are watching your diet, I would not recommend it. The taste is unique, and subtle in seasoning, not strong like mexican food. The way it is prep certainly comes out, like frying etc. 

First I got the Cubano sandwich , tostones, mofongo, and Amarillos. Lets just say my cholesterol probably went through the roof. The Cubano was nice, the pork is dry but most pork usually is that is why the sandwich has ham also to help it out, but it would have been nice with maybe a little more ham to moisten the sandwich a little more. It is a huge sandwich and a very good value at 5.50, It is pressed with swiss I believe like a panini, Good sandwich and a little bland to me, but that is my taste. Tostones are essentially plantains slices smash and deep fried and I ate it with the garlic sauce as someone recommended. A little bit too dry for my taste but I can see for some it may not be. The Mofongo is very unique, fried pork skins and meat combined with pounded plantains and shaped into a ball. If it wasn't  for the Cubano and tostones, I definitely would have enjoyed it, but by the time I reached the Mofongo, I was already overloaded with oil. It Has a unique texture of crunchiness, saltiness, fine texture at the same time. I had it with the lemon sauce I think, it is in a bottle full of pepper and lemon. It even comes with fried pork if you want it, but that will cause a coronary for sure.  The amarillos are similar to fried plantains in my culture so they were very good, just not good for you. 

All in all, I would recommend Millie and I would come back there again especially next time for just the mofongo and the amarillos. That is about all the richness I could take. Oh, I forgot the place is very small, it looks like a bakery that they put a couple of folding tables and folding chairs, so I recommend take home. I was the only one there on that Sunday, but I guess they make everything to order so it will take about 15-20 minutes wait.  Now the quality seems good not great that is why I gave it a 3 star, and it is not an every day or week thing but now that I have a taste of it, I will get in the mood for the mofongo or cubano in a couple of months and come back."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!  UGHHHHH, I'm obsessed.  I'm drooling right now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Best Cubano in Phoenix!  I have lived in Cuban neighborhoods in Boston and NY.  This food is legit and yummity at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I visited Millie's cafe on a regular basis on Main Street. Their new location is much bigger with more seating! They are such nice people and the food is great! She is the flan lady for gosh sakes! They are not open on Monday and Tuesday which is a pain only because you might have a craving for Millie's food on those days. A must try!"}
{"text":"I live in California and I'm a truck driver, I was going to get KFC but noticed the flag of my people above this restaurant. I got the Pernil with Gondules and it tasted like it was made for family! Very delicious and I will always be coming here when I deliver around here!"}
{"text":"This is THE best Puerto Rican food in arizona.   Smells just like my grandma's kitchen when I walk in and the food is amazing!! It's a nice taste of home for someone coming from NY :)"}
{"text":"Cool place! The \"hot\" sauce was really tasty. The pork was so nice and moist and delicious."}
{"text":"We had tried to go to a Cuban restaurant in Casa Grande, but it has closed permanently. So we looked online for another Cuban option and found Millie's.

We drove up and met some friends for lunch.

Very small place, three tables. We arrived for lunch at one, trying to miss the lunch crowd.

The food is more Puerto Rican, then Cuban. Very small menu.

My husband and I ordered the pork with red beans and rice. Our friends ordered the chicken with yellow rice and pigeon peas. We each also ordered a side of tostones. Everything was absolutely wonderful. Pork and chicken were extremely tender and flavourful. 

Prices are very good. Portion sizes are large. Almost wish they had been smaller so we could have ordered other things to try as well.

Highly recommend this place. Do not let the outside sway you."}
{"text":"What a golden treasure to find!!! 

I was taken here as a surprise pre-birthday lunch and I must tell you my heart fluttered once I walked in and smelled the familiarity of it all. 

Being from NYC and of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent, there is nowhere that serves \"our food\" that has gotten it right until this cafe opened its doors. 

The food is authentic, the service is friendly, the music is old school (salsa). 

The pasteles were to die for, the rice and beans were perfect, the pork chop was moist and fell off the bone. 

Greedy as we were since we don't live in the area, we even stuffed ourselves with a guava/cheese turnover and a quesito. 

They have Malta, Coco Rico and ....wait for it......COLA CHAMPAGNE, my absolute favorite!! 

The mother and daughter team are welcoming and friendly, sort of like going to a relatives house and just shooting the breeze for a few minutes. 

If its busy you will have to wait for your plate, but WHO CARES!!! it's sooo worth the wait. 

The prices are beyond reasonable, and you can even get that Puerto Rican flag you forget to buy last time you went home :) 

If you are missing a taste of home, definitely check this place out before you go to to 2 other places that offer this type of fare (i've tried them both, and they are not even half as good and twice as expensive!!)"}
{"text":"got back from South Florida and after sampljng some Cuban food, i needed more on my return to AZ.  I found Millie's and it is every bit as good as South Florida !  I had the Cubano and it was perfect.  Roast park was flavorful and tender.  I highly recommend.  Plus, the service is friendly and excellent, although because everything is made to order, it takes an extra minute or two, but soooo worth it !"}
{"text":"We are in town visiting from WA and tried Millie's based on the reviews and I'm so glad we did. We asked the person working the counter for recommendations and he was very patient while we took our time ordering. We had the arroz con gondules and added beans and the monfogo with pork. It was all delicious. The pork was moist and perfect. Hubby had the hot sauce and loved it. If your a hot sauce lover be sure to ask for it."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Cubano, this little restaurant came up within a few miles of the house. It was amazing, flavorful, cooked perfectly!! The other person in my party had chicken, and it was cooked so well, it was falling off the bone.  When they are busy, be prepared to wait and use the time to visit with those you came to enjoy the meal with.  The staff was gracious, accommodating my dietary restrictions, and very friendly. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Literally the best Puerto Rican food any where in the valley!! We have been here multiple times and all I can say is try it! You will Not be disappointed"}
{"text":"My first intro to Puerto Rican style food was through my coworker who brings him dishes often.
 I ordered the Mofungo with chicken and a side of Pasteles while my coworker aslo ordered sides of Pastelillo de Carne and Relleno de Papa. 
 I had never had Mofungo and wasn't super impressed with this one. The best part was the crispy bacon found in it but other than that there was a lot of grease and no flavor. The chicken drumsticks however were extremely moist and very flavorful.
 The Pastele is like a Tamale but instead of masa it is plantain and it was phenomenal. The pork inside was nicely seasoned while the plantain wrap was very moist.
 The Pastelillo de Carne was like a crunchy quesadilla and it was very crunchy/flaky which I enjoyed and then stuffed with bites of Carne that were seasoned well.
 Lastly the Relleno de Papa was a fried mashed potato ball with some meat inside and it was yummy!
 My girlfriend had the Jobarito which is  April shredded sandwich with crispy plantains as the bread, this and the Pastele was my favorite.

The service was also great. The gentlemen was fun and playful as we joked around as well as being prompt in serving us."}
{"text":"Fabulously, authentic Puerto Rican food!  We enjoyed mofongo, empanadas, arroz con gandules.... OMG!  Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The staff was incredibly friendly.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely come back!  It is important that when you come here you bring cash, as credit cards are not excepted."}
{"text":"AMAZING, authentic Puerto Rican food!!!  The food was cooked to perfection.  I had the Mofongo with pork - delicious!!!  Location was clean. Staff was friendly and personable!  LOVED the music. 

Looking forward to my return visit!"}
{"text":"Don't question (how could you after all of these great reviews?), just GO. I'm so impressed I barely have words. This is a family owned and authentic gem I am thrilled to have discovered. I haven't had cuisine like this since I lived in Florida! Everything that we tried was fantastic... tostones (get the garlic sauce!), amarillos, rice and beans.... The chicken! I I am a very picky chicken eater, and it literally fell off the bone. And to top it all off, the owner was warm, welcoming and explained everything in detail. It's a small place but has a great sense of culture. I would give Millie's far more than 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Me encantaaa. This means i love it. The service is impeccable. Millie is so sweet and the food that she makes is the best puerto Rican food in az."}
{"text":"We'll i never thought it would happen but on my 2nd visit here i found hair in my plantain.... very disappointing."}
{"text":"First time at Millie's and yummy!! Inexpensive and food is delish! We will definitely come back for more we ordered the pasteles, sandwich with toasted plantains and chicken with the rice"}
{"text":"Holy cow this might have been the best Cuban I've ever tasted, and I'm from Florida where Cuban restaurants are pretty common, so I've eaten many. I know it's lame to get a Cuban at a Puerto Rican restaurant, but I can't wait to go back and try one of the entrees.

This gem is tucked into a little strip mall (surprise!) and you can tell instantly it's a mom n pop joint. The lady working the counter was very friendly despite my wide-eyed gringo-ness. I will be back--soon!"}
{"text":"Just ate here with my wife and kids tonight.  Wanted something good and not the usual.  Don't judge a book by is cover.  This gem is great.  This place will be Best of Phoenix real soon.  We all ordered something different and all shared.  Everything was amazing.  It looks like grandma was in the kitchen making everything.  This is worth a trip out of the way for."}
{"text":"You know if I'm driving 45 minutes for a sandwich, the food has got to be amazing. This place has become my regular go-to spot for authentic Puerto Rican food. My favorites are the Cuban sandwich, tostones (fried plantains), pasteles and rice and beans. You can't go wrong with anything; it all has such great flavor. Very reasonably priced as well. 

Bring cash as they don't accept cards--- and you're welcome."}
{"text":"THEY ARE NOT CLOSED.  THEY HAVE MOVED TO:  1916 WEST BASELINE ROAD IN MESA.  


I have been coming to Millie's to pick up food for the longest and it time to update my review and to motivate all you caribbean (puerto rican, cuban, jamaican, dominican,  etc etc) and all you caribbean-minded people to come to Millie's to eat.  Now I order food from Millie's because I live so far from her place that a casual visit to eat there would make a hole in my wallet from the cost of the gas.  So I order food from Millie's and get it frozen in bulk to take home and keep in the freezer.  Yesterday I ordered 24 pasteles and while there, had one of her delicious alcapurrias (fried, ground root veggies stuff with ground beef).  When I eat one of these my feet stop touching the floor---I am floating toward heaven.  They sell them frozen too and I buy a dozen at a time and have them at home whenever I want a quick, delicious meal.   While there I also noticed she had Sancocho on the menu and I felt compelled to bring one home.  It came with white rice on the side.  That was my dinner yesterday and let me tell you it was delicious.  I could make it myself but Millie includes 3 meats in hers (pork, chicken, beef) as well as the root vegetables.  By the time I buy all that stuff AND cook it it would cost me quite a bit not to mention the effort and time of cooking it myself.  Don't get me wrong.  I could.  But who wants to when you have Millie.?
I just had some pasteles for dinner (the ones I picked up yesterday) and they were soooooooo delicious,  I felt I had to update my review to let you know that Millie's just keeps getting better and better and to encourage anyone within a 50 mile radius of Millie's to give her a try.   Her passion for cooking (those of her daughter's words)  shows itself in every single dish.  BTW, I hear her desserts are amazing.  I haven't bought any because I made my own, but people rave about them. Importantly, Millie's is an impeccably clean establishment so not worries there.  
Thanks Millie for making those delicious pasteles for me to order and having them ready on time.  
Un million de gracias."}
{"text":"My husband got the Cuban sandwich and it was way over mayonnaised. They also did small round cut pickles instead of one long sliced pickle. It was also extremely greasy. I got the chicken and black beans and rice. It was good but also very greasy. The tostones were a little on the soft/soggy side. Overall, this place was okay."}
{"text":"What a great Cubano sandwich!!  Excellent prices!  If you're a light eater, one sandwich could easily feed two people.  Rice and beans were delicious as well.  The food takes some time to come out after ordering but you can't rush good food (order ahead if you're in a hurry).  Will come back for sure, even if it is a bit of a drive from home."}
{"text":"I had a five star review that is now gone!  Don't know why as this is the best PuertoRican food around.  The pasteles are especially good.  Millie and staff are always friendly and welcoming.  

Not only was my review missing, but I am no longer getting the emails telling me about Friday and Saturday specials, or special events.  

What gives?"}
{"text":"So in this case I am reviewing the food only.  Everything else here is not going to give you a wonderful experience.  You order your food at the counter, eat out of Styrofoam containers, grab a beverage from the fountain, and sit in mix matched tables and chairs in a environment more like Los favs than a restaurant.

That said the food here is pretty amazing.  I've always felt that PR and Cuban food is underrated.  While often not the healthiest of options the flavors are remarkable.  The cornerstone of their food is slow roasted swine which has to be one of the best meats on the planet and Millie's does that oh so right.  

Their cuban sandwich is spot on and their mofongo is very good but perhaps a little firm and dryer than I prefer.  I'm a huge fan of pasteles and they have nailed them here with such a wonderful banana leaf flavor shining through.  The Arroz con grandules y cerdo al homo was very good and the pork was soooo tender and perfectly flavored.  

Everyone in the place was very nice and welcoming.  They also now accept credit cards which one prior reviewed mentioned was previously not available."}
{"text":"Great place! It's not even a question, when I want Puerto Rican food, I go to Millies. The food cannot be beat and tastes like home. Plus amazing staff and great prices. Seriously love this place!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing lunch today with my wife and daughters. We ordered the Cubano (3), the kids plate with pork and rice, relleno de papa, tostones and amarillos.
I have to say, everything was excellent! We sought out Millie's exclusively for the Cubano. Ever since seeing the movie Chef, we had been wanting to try one. It was exceptional.
My youngest daughter loved the kids plate. She is a very picky eater but loved the pork and couldn't get enough of the rice and peas.
The appetizers were amazing! My daughters liked the relleno de papa a lot. My wife liked the tostones (It was good with the dipping sauce). I liked the amarillos the most. So so good. What looks like a fried banana, but tastes like a very nice dessert. Loved it. 
Service here was also very good. The owner took time to explain the menu and gave us excellent recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My parents are from Puerto Rico and I just took them here. I'd been here once before with my sister and husband and we loved it, but I had to take my parents before writing the review... And they agreed, Millie's Cafe has great, authentic Puerto Rican cuisine. The menu is small and they offer different specials every week. My faves so far are the cubano sandwich, pernil, the tostones, papa rellena and the MOFONGO! Seriously the mofongo is delicious. Crisp pieces of bacon, chicharron, and plantains rolled into a ball of garlicky happiness.  The pastelillos de guayaba and quesitos are great too. The owners are super sweet and straight from the island.  I highly recommend it, I only hope that in the future they can extend their menu."}
{"text":"I got a small taste of la Isla Del Encanto today! Glad my coworker referred me. I'm traveling for work and live in California where the nearest PR restaurant is about 1 hour away. The food was good, the music good and the hospitality was good. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"A little taste of the island that made me. Millie's Cafe is a home away from home for me. I live in California now; however, I travel to Arizona at least once per month and for me, this is a must!

Friendly faces, great food and nice environment. If you are looking for a Puerto Rican restaurant or simply looking to try something other than the typical burgers, tacos or sandwiches...I suggest you come to Millie's Cafe!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch, had an Alcapurria and a Cuban sandwich (I'm Cuban but grew up in Puerto Rico), both were very good. The staff was very attentive and friendly. And the prices are excellent. Will definitely go back to try more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and very good food. We had the Cubanos, plantains (both types) and Flan.
The sandwiches are huge and you really get your money's worth here. Everything we had was superb and we can't wait to go back to try something different. The place is small and almost what I would call communal eating but that's part of the experience. Everyone in there was raving about what they had there were a couple of \"regulars.\""}
{"text":"Dios mio!

I was born and raised on the island, this place hits it out of the park. The only way you will get any more authentic Puerto Rican food is to book a flight to the island!

Small dining room, but man, dont tell my abuela but this is the best Puerto Rican food I have had in YEARS."}
{"text":"Their Facebook page says they are moving locations as of 8/31/16! Their new location should be up and running soon. Just ate there recently and the food was awesome as always. Can't wait to see the new place!"}
{"text":"I will totally recommend this restaurant, love the food is excellent. The mofongo delicious, will come here again and price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Just tried this lovely little place on Sunday. First I'd like to say, I can't believe they were able to focus, be friendly AND produce some of the BEST PR food Ive had outside NYC,(my former home) considering they were trying to contact family back home that STILL has no power or clean water! 
Everything was incredible, the pork and pigeon peas was AMAZING , the Pastillilo De Carne was so yummy I teared up a little! and the Cubano sammy was perfect, moist pork, ham, pickle, mustard on the perfect bread.... crispy but not hard on the outside and fluffy to absorb the goodness on the inside... perfect!
Nice clean, bright atmosphere, love seeing the whole family cooking and helping each other out.
VERY reasonably priced... 3 meals, appetizer, 2 beverages UNDER 20.00!!! Couldn't believe it, I actually had her double check the total because she finally received a call from San Juan (to her relief!) and I wanted to make sure she totted it all up correctly....
FYI, cash only, its printed on the menu, just an additional heads up.
The best news for me.... it's across the street from home!!!!"}
{"text":"SOoo GOOD! Authentic Puerto Rican food in Mesa. Who would have thought it :) The mofongo had just the right amount of garlic and it was really tasty. The pernil was so tender it melted in your mouth. The tres leche was a perfect end to a very delicious and cheap meal. Be advised, CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Amazing food 
Small family owned Puerto Rican restaurant and absolutely delicious. 
Sandwiches and Arroz gandules are incredible"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good. The tripleta sandwich is to die for. Thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"Did you ever say you wished you had a J-Lo butt? Then read on...

I might be a little bias being 1/2 Puerto Rican, but you know you are at the right place when you walk in and see that countries native people eating there. If you want a real treat and have never had Puerto Rican food, please go to Millie's and try it.
It is a Mom & Pop place for sure -you will see Millie herself right behind the counter cookin' your food like you were sitting in her kitchen while her husband is taking your order. The price is definitely right! We practically had the entire menu for $40. Don't be fooled by the ambiance... tiny dining room, fold out tables & chairs, plastic ware & cups with ice from an ice chest propped up on a stool. The food is where the money is!! BTW- cash only, so be prepared. Open Thurs-Sun for lunch & dinner (11am-8pm).

Here are some highlights if you're not familiar:
Tostones... fried & salted plantains - get the garlic side dip
Pasteles... pork inside green banana (like a tamale, but better)
Amarillos... sweet fried banana
Arroz con Gandules... yellow rice w/beans
and last but NOT least (here's where the J-Lo butt comes in)
Mofongo w/a side of pork - it is hard to describe but easy to remember! It is plantain w/crispy fried pork formed into a ball of joy! And the sides of pork that they give are the most tender juicy pork I've ever had. This is a must try item! But not for the faint of heart - literally. 

\"Bottom\" line is I would eat here everyday if I could afford new clothes.

P.S. I read someone else's review that stated that the Flan was not made there. Just FYI, Millie is the Flan Lady & makes the flan right there in that same kitchen. The only problem is that she makes it for restaurants valley wide & so in that mass production - it loses some of it's homemade quality. It is still good though & she makes a mean pastry. Try 'em!"}
{"text":"I don't know where Or who Millie was but if I did, I would have hugged her!  This the best food I've ate out in a long time and definitely the best Puerto Rican food in Phoenix.  The wait for the food is a bit longer then I'm used to but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Truly a tast of Puerto Rican cuisine! My wife and I love Millie's Cafe and truly believe the food and staff are totally worth the almost 20 mile drive from North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The Cubano sandwich is authentic and delicious! The service couldn't be any more hospitable. :) It's located on the end of a plaza, so be careful trying to find it (hole in the wall)."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! Food is amazing, flavorful and a lot! They have flan and tres leches for the desert lovers! I love the jibarito and mofongo! I sometimes get tamarindo juice which I tend to ask to be made without sugar! They have an incredible service and the owner is always so welcoming and nice! They always try for you to be satisfied! I am glad that now they are located in a larger place."}
{"text":"Seriously so good! We had the Cubano, mofungo, and the plaintain sandwich. We will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"My favorite PR food restaurant! I drive a hour to get there and it's worth it! Reminds me of the PR food back home on the east coast and of course in PR! Great flavors"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place.  It's definitely a small place, which cheap chairs and plastic tables, so it's not a place you go for the vibe.

The menu apparently changes every weekend.  I had the Mofongo y Pernil, a cola champagne, and the flan.  The mofongo was delicious, and the pernil was ace.  And it was just $7 for the place, which didn't leave me hungry at all.

The flan was not homemade, which was a bit disappointing.  And the cola champagne came in a can rather than a glass bottle, which I would have preferred.  But I guess one can't be too picky when there is a Puerto Rican place a couple miles from home.

The whole meal was just $12, which is very reasonable.  It's just too bad I can't go pick up my dinner here on weeknights..."}
{"text":"Really good Puerto Rican food specializing in chicken and pork dishes. You can get dishes like pigeon beans and rice, red beans and rice or plantains. 
Nice little family owned joint in a strip mall. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Upbeat Latin music playing. Nothing fancy, but very tasty."}
{"text":"Just get the Cubano - it is the best I have ever had.  This $5.50 sandwich is worth all of $12.00 and so good....it's also huge!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food that was not greasy or overbearing:)  The owner was delightful and charismatic! I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place was horrible. My husband is Puerto Rican so I actually know what Puerto Rican food should taste like. The rice had no flavor and didn't really represent real Puerto Rican rice. The chicken was dry and didn't have any flavor. The prices were reasonable for what you're getting but i would never go back. They serve on foam plates and its cash only. The server was nice but you can tell they cut corners wherever they can."}
{"text":"I came to the Phoenix area and never thought that I was going to find such a great place with really good Puerto Rican food. It felt like being back home."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here after hearing about this place.  The prices are very reasonable and cash only. We had the tripleta, it had just the right amount of each meat and sauce. It's a small place and most orders seem to be to go."}
{"text":"Amazing Jibaritos!!!! We are in Arizona for a weekend we absolutely had to try this spot. Good food and good people. Thanks for all your help Jacob (my Chicago friend)."}
{"text":"Sometimes, this is par for the course for me. Reviewing another place that closed!

Millie was such a nice lady. The food was excellent. Her place was relatively small, and it was packed with customers when we were there.

The Fried Plantains were definitely very memorable. Perhaps, we'll meet up with her again when she opens another place."}
{"text":"I am Puertorican  and all I can say is that Millie's is a little piece of heaven sent from Puerto Rico. Not only is the food awesome but the service and genuine friendliness surpass anything you can imagine. It's like going home to eat a meal. The place is small but that is its charm!! Love you all at Millie's. I drive around 2 hours to get there but sooo worth the drive and time. Go and try it out. You will be very pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"My only and favorite puertorican place. The food is awesome! The first time I ate a Tripleta which is a mix of three meats. My second time I got \"El Jibarito\" which is a plantain sandwich. Love it!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Make sure you call in order if your getting take out.  This place is not fast food.  I think they make one order at a time.  I had the mofongo which was good.   Will be going back."}
{"text":"BEST. EVER. Authentic! Staff is friendly, family owned and proud! Prepare though, as its not open all week and only takes cash."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best cubano I've ever had. I've been to plenty of places (different states, too), and nothing compares to how amazing Millie's is. Family owned, with great music, service, and FOOD! What I really liked, is that they don't skimp on the meat that goes into their sandwiches. Definitely try their guava drink as well!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night and was very impressed! It's a tiny little family owned place, and all of the food is home made. And I mean really home made. They don't have a big industrial kitchen like most restaurants. It's more like the kind of kitchen you have at home. It makes for really great food! The staff is very nice, and the moment you walk in you feel like part of the family. I was shocked at how cheap their prices are, too. You get a really good portion of delicious food for a stellar deal. The pork I ate was perfectly cooked, and the mofongo that I tried for the first time ever was also delicious. They offer a lot of unique beverages that you wouldn't find anywhere else. I had the tropi-cola which tastes like a mix between cola and cream soda. I really liked it. I will definitely be coming back, and telling my friends."}
{"text":"A few months into my move from NYC, I so had a hankering for Puerto Rican fare. I looked up Yelp on my phone and Mille's came up. I was not too far away driving up from Tempe so I took the chance and drove to Mesa.
The restaurant was bare bones, pretty much a takeaway joint with the stray table. I looked at the small amount of menu items and spied the pernil and pasteles. Well, this was exactly what I was missing. Ordered with a side of rice and beans and waited for about 15 minutes for my order to come up.
Driving home, I nearly went crazy with the scents of home wafting out of the bag in the footboards of my car.
Am I going to make it home before I tear open the bag and start eating with my fingers?

I made it home and tore open the bag, took out a beer from the fridge and started to taste my treasure. The rice and beans, tasted fresh enough, the pasteles really good. Even by NYC standards. The pernil, was Okay. On the salty side, really salty. But I endured, because I was so desperate to feel like I was home once again.

3 stars due to the overly salted, pernil. Lack of ambiance at the store front. But the pasteles, man they were right on. Next time I gotta ask if they can sell me frozen ones to keep for another hankering!

Hopefully, they will make to restaurant more inviting in the future. But do come out and try great Puerto Rican pasteles! :)"}
{"text":"Good service...food.blend mofongo dry but ok but pork needed salt it was blend. Pastels were good and alcapurrias really good. The place is so small that we had to wait outside for our order in top of that there's no a/c seriously just a cooler that was blowing hot air!! Not sure if will come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Such an amazing environment and spectacular food. Great staff n service. Ordered just about everything on the menu to try it all. For authentic Puerto Rican food this is the #1 spot!!"}
{"text":"The food was AWESOME I came in with my son and bought a bunch of Yummy Food. The place was clean! Everyone wearing hair nets and The service was very nice. 

I'm Puerto Rican so I know the good stuff when I have it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is killin' me. I'd love to give it four or five stars. The staff is friendly and the flavors are amazing. Price wise, dinner there will only set you back about as much as going to Jack in the Box down the street. There were, however, a few issues that were impossible to ignore. First, we had to wait about 45 minutes for a sandwich and a chicken and rice plate. Not a huge deal if you aren't in a hurry. Good food is worth the wait, but there was only one order ahead of us. Second, my chicken and rice was so dry that I couldn't eat the outer layer of the meat. It was like jerky. The rice and pigeon peas were almost hard due to the lack of moisture. If we hadn't have had to wait 45 minutes in the first place, I would have sent it back. But again, the flavor was out of this world. We are definitely going to try again. I'm hoping we just went at a bad time."}
{"text":"I saw this place visiting another establishment in the area and said a Puerto Rican Restaurant in Arizona Awsome gotta try it.  My family and I have spent a few summers in Puerto Rico and love the food. We went on Sunday and we were glad we did.  The food was great and the service was friendly and helpful. We have a vegetarian daughter and the host recommended several menu items with no meat.  She loved it as we all did.  Full disclaimer the place is rustic and they serve the food in to go containers but that did not take away from the great flavors and abundance of servings.  If I had a rum Mojito I would have been back in Old San Juan.  The Plantains were excellent as was the roasted pork.  We differently will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very authentic, quality hole in the wall restaurant that offers many dishes with tasty dishes with homemade flavor! We love the Cubano and the steak sandwich and my daughter loves their sweet plantains! The only thing is bring CA$H as they don't take credit cards and they sometimes don't answer the phone for to go orders! But they are quick to get your orders in when you get there and often you are out the door quickly after you order!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this cafe today. Excellent food, good prices, great atmosphere. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First I wanna say mmmm mmmm mmmm..... Millie's cafe totally had my husband and I satisfied and to be honest we can't wait to go back for more!!  Both my husband and I are Puerto Rican but all our pr family are back in Detroit/Ohio and Puerto Rico so getting to eat some of the foods we grew up on and loved by someone other then our mothers, grandmothers or aunts was so nice! Totally had us feeling nostalgic... The pastele's were awesome I recommend the yuka ones,but my husband still like the original ones the best... Awesome pork and arroz gandules... Great pastillos... So flaky and good! Rellenos de papas are just like my great aunt would make back home;0) we bought a huge bottle of their home made pike-pika and my husband is now in heaven! I expect to go through the bottle every two weeks or so so.... I suppose we will just have to return again and again to get more ;0)  ultimately with Millie's the owners are so nice and welcoming and since the food is so good and definitely authentic Puerto Rican cuisine it's a win win situation! I definitely recommend giving Millie's a try you won't be sorry! The only thing that could improve this place would be that it was closer to where we live and maybe a few slices of avocado available just in case people wanted to order them... I personally love avocado on everything, but that's just me... Neither the hour drive nor the lack of avocado will stop us from being back;0)"}
{"text":"Food at this place is very tasty. We ordered the yucca pasteles, tostinos, arroz con condules and more! All of it was amazing and is authentic. Everyone is very friendly and they play salsa music while you eat. Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! No need to fly to Puerto Rico when you can drive to Mesa for authentic Puerto Rican food. This place is a very intimate gem with seating for 10-12. The food is, flavorful and the service extremely helpful and friendly. Ordered two meals on first visit;  a sweet plantain lasagna served with rice and beans and a mofungo filled with bacon served with shoulder pork. Both meals were incredible and each cost less than $9! For dessert had home made flan (which is also served commenting). Shall definitely return. When you go,  remember,  CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"New, larger location and the same delicious food! Every meal I've had tastes like it is coming from a kitchen in someone's home in Puerto Rico. The staff are always extremely friendly and helpful. Whether you are here for lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed. In addition to the delicious food, I thoroughly enjoy the equally flavorful music which is always playing."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Pretty authentic taste and quality that I'd definitely recommend to anybody. It just took a bit of a while for the food to come out"}
{"text":"Great food.  Raul is the best. Truly authentic food. Wish it was always open.  I don't even mind that it's cash only."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their food is amazing and so well priced! If we lived closer, we'd probably eat there once a week. lol. Definitely a family favorite!"}
{"text":"5 stars for this small but excellent place for Puerto Rican food.
Cuban sandwich and my alcapurias were made perfect to my liking. The new location is bigger than their old one but food tastes the same. I will always recommend this spot to anyone who wants to eat Caribbean food."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! Great prices and We really love the authentic food they serve!! The owners are so friendly and super sweet. I've spread the word about Millie's :)"}
{"text":"Stop here frequently! Best Puerto Rican food in Arizona!! If you're looking for some pr comfort food you must stop in! I love Millie's famous flan but always stop in just for pastelillos!! They are just like the ones from the island!!! 

Pros: large portions
Home made from scratch 
Great prices 

Only thing is it's cash only!!!"}
{"text":"This is Puerto Rican soul food at its best!!! 

When I used to live on that side of town a few years ago I frequented this little gem a couple times and am still dreaming about the tostones (flattened and fried plátano) with garlic mojo sauce (garlic, olive oil, seasoning). OMG!!!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. *licks lips*  This little bit of heaven along with a healthy portion of pernil (if you don't know; you better aaasssk somebody;) con some pollo asado y arroz con gandules.......yummi yummi yummmmms!!!

Ay!!!! Mi madre!!! Seriously, this could be my last meal and I'd die a very happy chica.

I hope one day they can expand. But until then I will gladly make the drive to Millie's in Mesa."}
{"text":"Millie's!!!!!!!! GUURRRRLLLL!!! You have outdone yourself again!

This jibarito is Bomb.com! Who knew a sandwich made with no bun could ever be so satisfying?

I wasn't to sure about the sauce that normally comes with the sandwich which is a mix of ketchup and mustard so I had then put it on the (el lado) + asked for a side of the garlic sauce I already love. Let me tell you the sauce that comes with the sandwich is better than I ever expected.

Of course, the usual fare is still in the menu like tostones, mofongo, pernil, etc.

You can't go wrong with whatever you order. Hop on over here to the new location at Dobson and Baseline in the same plaza with the Baiz grocer.

Go Millie's...Go Millie's...Go...Go...Go Millie's! \(^_^.)/"}
{"text":"I am Puerto Rican and the one thing I thought the Valley lacked was a diverse selection of Latin food that tastes authentic. Millie's is amazing!!! I loved loved loved the food. I ordered a dozen pasteles and a dozen acchapurrias. I didn't share with my family and I ate them all. I am already getting ready to place another HUGE order. Her food was as good as my Grandmothers' and that is a HUGE statement. I love Millie's Cafe and I will be back! I HIGHLY recommend it to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY.
We tried this place on a whim and it sure was good.
I got the slow baked chicken legs with rice and beans. The meat literally fell off the bone when I picked it up. So soft and tender. Great flavor. Rice n beans good too. Got really full from the meal. The rice and beans stick to you.
We tried the fried banana slices served with garlic sauce. I didn't really like them. Must be an aquired taste.
I think the people working there are the owners. Very friendly and accommadating. 
The place is small. Has four, 5ft tables and some chairs. Decorated with Puerto Rican photos and decor and they have Puerto Rican music playing.
The prices are very reasonable. I paid under 8 for my meal and drink. 
Good place to eat. Good food. Friendly people. Clean.
I can't eat heavy food all the time, but when I do, I will come back here. Yum.
Also try the soda they sell that tastes like bubble gum."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Not a huge menu but an amazing menu! Yes it's a ways away but it was worth the drive. The pernil melts in your mouth. We will definitely go back and try something new every time. Also tasted alcapurrias which I have never enjoyed, these were delicious!"}
{"text":"Greeted by a kind and personable staff member. I could feel the Puerto Rican pride in the air, I loved it. I tried the Cubano sandwich (worth the $7) my first visit and it was delicious! I will definitely be back to try some authentic Puerto Rican food."}
{"text":"We had the pork and chicken entrées. Moist and delicious like you might never taste anywhere else. The pastelillos de carne and the 2 plantain appetizers were exceptional as well. The owner said we got lucky on the sweet plantains because she has trouble getting good ones here. Millie and her daughter were very friendly and took the time to guide us through the menu choices and afterwards explain the recipes. If you like some heat, the mix of peppers/water/vinegar/oil/spices was unique and flavorful. Everything is very plain and simple there but it was a great experience. Looking forward to going back and trying some other things as well."}
{"text":"Small little place but VERY GOOD food!!! We go at least once a month. Plantains, Cubans and specials are always great!!! Millie is always there cooking the meals herself. She talks with us and is always so nice. I highly recommend this home cooked Puerto Rican joint to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"If I was just reviewing the food and the friendliness of the staff I would give 4.5 stars.  Both are really great.  Overall I give 4 stars, because they don't take credit cars for one.  That is a big drawback for me because I don't usually carry cash and I had to go to an ATM and come back.  Secondly, they don't sell fountain drinks.  They sell it in cans but come on...we all know thats just not the same.

I will be going back though because the food is that good.  I had the BBQ pork, yellow rice, and tostones.....all fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome Puerto Rican food spot! I had the Red beans and rice (arroz con pollo) tostones and the flan. All were excellent and the garlic sauce is highly reccomended. Definitely will be back to gorge."}
{"text":"Small local family owned Puerto Rican restaurant is amazing and the food is off the charts. The pri c es are reasonable and they make everything from scratch even the aguas. We ordered Tamarindo and it was made right there on the spot. The pastellitos made of cheese and meat are great appetizers.  The mofongo is amazing and the pork falls off, tender, juicy and fills you up quick. The pique is homemade and you can buy a bottle on the side for $10. It tastes  great on the white rice.

I approve this restaurant"}
{"text":"Millie's new location is nice. The food is still outstanding. And they take credit cards now. Will be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. I love the one off family atmosphere. Support local business and have some good food!"}
{"text":"We went on our first date night here. It was not too rambunctious. The staff was very kind attentive and polite. We tried the chicken fettuccine Alfredo, Caesar salad, and shrimp Alfredo. 

We have gone back a few times since then. Bring a big appetite because every time we go we leave stuffed. Your not going to get short changed here on food. 

The bread with oil was a great start to a relaxing night."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of millie's since we moved to Az from nyc... puerto rican food is so hard to come by but millie's gives you authentic puerto rican all the way. It's like mom or grandma cooking for you. Big portions for a reasonable price. The new location is even better, so much more closer to me and so much brighter and bigger."}
{"text":"I come  here because we basically don't have anything else here, they continue to be very disorganized and all they have is two meats in their menu. The food has a good taste but you will think
by this time it will seem more like a real restaurant.Its not the impression you want to give people that has never been in Puerto Rico, we have classy restaurants with plates and regular silverware in our Island. They really n rd to improve in their customer service skills, quality of food and the look of the restaurant it's falling apart. Really disappointing"}
{"text":"As a Puerto Rican who lived in the island for 26 years and who cook Puerto Rican food on a weekly basis, I have to say, hands down, that Millie's Cafe is a great option for those interested in authenticity. The staff is really sweet, they make you feel like home. I had their alcapurrias, mofongo and sandwich cubano, and everything was amazing. The only critique is that they don't accept credit cards. Besides that, Millie's is a great option for those who are looking for authentic flavors from the Spanish Caribbean."}
{"text":"First off I'm Puerto Rican! I was not impressed with the food here at all. The flavor was lacking and so was the gravy. Who wants to eat dry rice and chicken! Sorry, just keepin it real. If your looking for friendly service then by all means eat here. The owner is sweet. I didn't finish my food. So after attempting to eating here I went home and cooked real PR food..yum. Gosh I miss the East Coast! Umm I won't be back."}
{"text":"Number of times visited? 2
Would I come back? Yup

I was told by a Dominican friend of mine to check this place out.  There aren't many well known Puerto Rican restaurants in Arizona so I was excited to try it.  I've been twice so far and have been very satisfied both times.  I've never had Puerto rican food before but regardless, the food was pretty damn good. The place is small and humble, and the food has a homey and fulfilling quality to it.  Jacob was the one who helped my girlfriend and I both times and was very welcoming and eager to explain the menu.  

We had the mofongo with pork, pastelillos with cheese and with beef, and also the pork with rice.  The pork is tender and moist. Similar to a Filipino lechon.  The pastelillos are like empanadas.  The one with cheese is very tasty and reminds me of like grilled cheese empanada.  I am a big fan of plantains so the mofongo was delicious as well. I was a little thrown off by the hard pork rinds in the middle but overall it was very good.  

Jacob recommended the Jibarito next time which is like a sandwich that uses plantains instead of bread.  It sounded and looked amazing so I'll definitely be back to try that and other items on the menu."}
{"text":"If you like Puerto Rican food and you're in the Phoenix area then this is your place. You can either spend hours in the kitchen, put your family on a plane and bring then here to cook for you or just go here for great food. Good portions, reasonable prices and great flavor. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I've been here a few times and each time it's good."}
{"text":"Great food tasted amazing! I only wish we could have tried the pasteles we paid for. I Came into town for the weekend and had to stop here. The food was tasty and the lady in the front was nice. We ordered about $80 worth the food to go and left a 20% tip. Waited for our order and were handed all the food packed up. Drove half an hour back to where we were staying and unpacked the food. That's where we realised that they didn't give us the $14 worth of pasteles we ordered. They were the last ones for the night and they were closing in 30 min. I attempted to call multiple times to see if they could be delivered but there was no answer while they were still open.  Make sure if you're ordering to go to check everything before you leave.
Update: i have to change my review because i got a lovely call from the nice lady that runs the cafe. She went the extra mile and called on a day that they are closed. She apologized for the mistake and they are refunding the amount missed! The food is great here and the pork is amazing. I hated to give it a low star review so i had to change it. I will be back here for a return visit."}
{"text":"Really good. The owner was very nice. I will definately be back. Had the chicken with rice and pidgin peas and a relleno de papa."}
{"text":"Excellent service great Cuban sandwiches and we enjoyed all but one appetizer on the menu. Extremely traditional recipes and their pork was fork tender, it was also a bit bland, again very traditional. I wish someone would add the Cuban pork stew to their menu. I had it in Miami once and wish it on every menu, but alas it is not there!  This place could use the diversity of adding it. But if you are after Cuban sandwiches search no more you found a great place here! I've already been here three times.  Yummy.
Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Their new location has Great seating. A much needed change from their small place on Main Street. Same delicious food. 
They were still \"getting the bugs\" out of the operation when we went there. Ordering took longer than food prep. That isn't cool with two \"bouncy\" kids and 3 adults. 
New systems can be tough. But now they take credit cards so I am sure that helps. We will try again shortly. Hopefully the bugs are out of their system."}
{"text":"We've been going to Millie's since her last place. The food is awesome just like home. Next best thing to getting it made by my mom. Congratulations on the new place."}
{"text":"Prepare for something different! My wife and I both had the roasted pork plate. Hers with the rice and mine with the fried smashed plantain. Do yourself a favor and get the plantain. With bits of bacon and tons of garlic,it was awesome. We also had the Relleno de Papa which was good too. The service was very very friendly and atmosphere was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"I love this place the owners are friendly and the food is great. It's cooked fresh to order and it's clean. I usually get the mofongo and although I'm not sure what traditional Puerto Rican food is supposed to taste like... This place tastes like home. everything on the menu that I've had has been delishhh!"}
{"text":"Visited with my wife to try out Puerto Rican food. We ended up ordering the Cubano, Pastelillo de Carne, Tostones, and Amarillos. The Cubano tasted good but was a bit on the dry side for me. The Pastelillo de Carne tasted awesome as it was fried perfectly and the inside was flavorful. I think our favorite was the Amarillos and Tostones as the plantains were delicately sweet and the crunchy plantains were delicious combined with the garlic oil they supplied. Overall, the service was great and all the food was fresh. The only thing really keeping this place from getting a 5 star for me was the fact that since it is fresh the food took longer than I expected even with minimal customers.

If you're looking for good Puerto Rican food, you need to check out Millie's Cafe."}
{"text":"I have longed to try mfongo for so long! Was in the neighborhood and stopped in. Great!  Had mfongo w roast pork. Mashed plaintains with garlic and crispy bits of pork and flavorful moist roast pork. Prices awesome. Friendly place!"}
{"text":"My wife is Puerto Rican and one of the pickiest people on the planet when it comes to food especially puerto rican food. If her mom didn't make it can't be good right? WRONG! I ordered pernil and tostones just to try the place. 
My wife could not resist. She ate half of what I ordered and proceeded to order a second round and added arroz con gandules.
She ate until she was full and we brought the rest home for later.
Based on my wife's reaction, this joint is great!
Great prices too but cash only!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly owners, a new favorite.

I'll admit up front that I'm a huge fan of Caribbean food--anything with plantains in it automatically gets points in my book. I had been wanting to check out this place for a while, and now that I finally have, I'll be sure to make it back here regularly.

This is a little place in an otherwise unremarkable strip mall on Main St. I believe there are only 3 tables inside this place, so there were a number of people who took their orders to go while I was in the restaurant. I think I heard one person say that he had driven from the other side of the Valley for the food, so I was pretty sure that I was in for something good. There are a bunch of pictures inside of Puerto Rico, as well as a number of little souvenir-type trinkets for sale. It's all enough to make me want to visit the island, especially when combined with the delicious food.

There were a number of daily specials, sandwiches, and other items to order. As I was trying to decide, I saw a newspaper article on the countertop about the Jibarito sandwich. As soon as I saw that it used tostones (fried plantains) as the \"bread\", I knew what I was getting. The people with me got the pernil with arroz con gandules and the chicken with arroz con gandules. We also ordered sides of tostones and amarillos (a more dessert-like version of plantains) to share before our entrees. My nephews also each got a mango juice.

The person taking our order--who I assume to be the owner of the place--was very friendly and helpful throughout. They definitely know what they're doing here, food-wise.

So back to the food: My Jibarito was amazing! The tostones as bread contained some delicious pork and nice complementary items. I tried it with some of the hot sauce made in store as well as the garlic dip served with the tostones, and it was even better that way. This really is a good sandwich! It's not huge, so if you have a big appetite (like I do), some other food may be necessary to satiate your hunger.

I'm writing an entirely separate paragraph for the garlic dip that comes with the tostones. This stuff is amazing! It's really a simple dip, I'm sure, and you have to be comfortable with the people you're around for the rest of the day after eating it, but it is delicious! There is a nice little spiciness to it, and it goes great on the tostones and the Jibarito sandwich. I'm sure it goes great on a number of other things as well, but I only had so much to use. Great stuff!

Both the pernil and the chicken were done really well--great flavor and tenderness. The arroz con gandules was really great, especially with some of that hot sauce poured onto it. Speaking of the hot sauce, it's a very liquidy mixture that is very different from any hot sauce I've previously had. I'm not sure exactly what was in it other than a bunch of little chilies which seemed to have been pickling in the liquids. Whatever it is, it's a great accompanying flavor. Both of these dishes come in pretty substantial serving sizes.

The tostones and amarillos were both done perfectly. The tostones were hot and crispy, while the amarillos were hot and sweet. Seriously, I could survive solely on variations of plantains. Finally, the mango juice was excellent. It's made fresh in the store with pulp, according to the guy helping us, and it smells and tastes like it's fresh. It's really like liquid, ripe mango.

I'm really satisfied with my visit. This place turns out delicious food, provides great service, and does it all at a really reasonable price. For 5 of us, it was around $45, juices and appetizers included. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Moved here from Florida in January and looked up Puerto Rican restaurants and I was disappointed that there were only two in all of Phoenix. When my mom came to visit (my parents were born and raised in PR) we went there for lunch and I'm so happy we did! The pernil was perfectly moist and the arroz con gandules tasted like we were sitting at my aunts house in Ponce! Thank goodness you're here! 

Where are the Puerto Ricans at?!! Does anyone know where I can get details on the Puerto Rican day parade?

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Having moved to Phoenix only a few short months back, we were hoping to find authentic Puerto Rican food in the area since it's everywhere on the East Coast.  We found this place through Urban Spoon and decided we just had to try it out.  

The restaurant itself is one of those \"hole-in-the-wall\" places that you might just drive right past without even realizing it.  It's obviously a mom and pop place and continues that feel when you walk inside.  The decor is simple, but functional - read as, minimal with fold out table and chairs that work just fine for eating in.  

I don't think that the owner and his wife could have been any nicer!  They were just charming and easy to talk to about where we were from and how much we loved Puerto Rican food.  If you go for nothing else - go say \"hi\" to the owner.  

We had the chicken and rice, pork (carne asada),  and an order of the empanada - he called it something different, but I forget the name, my apologies.  The chicken and pork were to die for, but the rice wasn't at all what we were expecting.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't awesome.  The meats more than made up for the difference.  

Overall, I'd say we'll go back after trying a few more local area places and perhaps try different sides then the rice and beans (which I won't lie, is disappointing).  

Rating: B+"}
{"text":"Best Puerto Rican food in AZ, hands down! The daily specials are always great, pernil is always tender and chicken juicy. I don't only go there for the the food, I go for the awesome service. I feel like I'm part of the family. It's all love at Millie's."}
{"text":"I went to Millie's and had the most delicious Mofongo. Yeah, I had no idea what that was before I stepped into the place, but now I can't wait to go back and get more. I'm excited to see how this place changes as people discover it's there.. smallish place with everything served in to-go boxes but it's clear that these people care about the quality of their food. Recommend this to people who love to try new places in a casual environment or even for a takeout option."}
{"text":"A very small establishment with very simple decor, yet extraordinary food. This place is cash only, so make sure to get some before you come. Everything is reasonably priced, I ordered Pernil with arroz con gandules and that cost $6.50. Throw in a can of soda for a dollar and we're talking about lunch w/tip for about $10. My food was excellent, it reminded me of mi abuela's cooking. And the portions were huge, so I'll be having a trip down memory lane for lunch tomorrow too! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went to new location first day open today and had the best meal ever. I'm happy they are closer to me."}
{"text":"Going back once again for that taste of the island. This is GREAT food cooked like it was from your beloved grandma. The pork or chicken are both outstanding. If you can't make the trip to the island, you can enjoy some of the flavors as the food is very affordable."}
{"text":"Best Cuban sandwich EVER!!!  Great service, clean and DELICIOUS!!  I ate the cuban sandwich with a side of maduros and a malta..my better half ate Pernil w/mofongo; alcapurria; papa rellena and topped it off w/tres leche cake. (He likes to eat)--we both Highly recommend!!!!  All that food under $30....Cash only so come ready"}

{"text":"A diamond in the rough! Order something to go as seating is limited to about 12 persons inside. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and the owners are amazing! We will definitely be back! The pork was my favorite and lived the cola!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The Pasteles are to die for.  And their Alcapurreas are great as well. Only thing I didn't care were their red beans....need more salsita and served separate from the rice, not over the rice.  The Pernir is tasty too."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting family in the area. I am in love. The Pasteles, Gandule Rice, and Guava Cheese Pastry is unbelievable. The pastele was $3.50. The pastry was just under $2. The gandule rice came with slow cooked pork and was on special for $6.50 The food is plenty and well worth it. Although I'm used to paying less for ala carte pastele. It was delicious and I would totally go there again. Who knew cheese and guava could taste so good??!?"}
{"text":"Food was excelent. The people were really nice.  Totally recommend the mofongo with pernil."}

We wish Jacob and his family much success at the new restaurant."}

{"text":"Millie's is such a great little place.
The people are super nice and helpful, and the food is really good.
I had the chicken and rice and my mom had the pork and rice. It was not fine dining or pretentious -just delicious, flavorful comfort food. They also have their own hot sauce which is a must try. The price for everything, under $8 per person is just awesome and there is so much food that you'll have enough for two meals. Definitely check this place out for good, unpretentious Puerto Rican food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service at affordable prices.

You have to try either of their daily specials (piernil o pollo al horno) they are delicious.

They have home cooked quality food at fast food prices!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little dive, and I mean that in the most complimentary way. 

I'm no expert on Puerto Rican food, and to be honest, it was the Cubano sandwich that brought me here. Called me, like the siren of the Atlantic. Resistance was actually futile. 

Possibly half a loaf of French bread, or something like it, was filled with roast pork, ham, cheese, pickles, mustard and oozing mayo, and then pressed on a griddle or something magical. It comes out toasty on the outside and melty on the inside. Delicious y magnifico!! Big enough for two, or keep a half for your next meal, or just greedily scarf it all down, I won't judge. 

The nice folks that run this place won't judge either. They seem genuinely delighted to welcome one and all. They will happily explain what all the dishes are, but I did sense a slight disappointment that we were only interested in the Cubano. \"Most people order the Cubano\", we were told. We really should branch out, but that thing is so ridiculously delicious that we're powerless to fight the urge. Have been there twice now, same problem. 

We did manage to try the desserts, preferred the flan to the dulce de leche, but we were so full of Cubano sandwich that it was a bit hopeless."}
{"text":"I've had the mofongo, totones, arroz con habichuelas and pernil.  Everything was great!  Staff there are awesome, very friendly and bring things to you. 

The things I would definitely work on for this place are:  DON\"T take credit cards only cash.  Also they serve things on paper plates, I don't understand why they won't serve on regular plates, even if they are plastic.  

However, food is good and I will be back."}
{"text":"Must love garlic!!! When you first walk in it doesn't look like the fanciest of places paper plates plastic utensils soda machine out of order but the food makes up for it just make sure you like garlic ane be careful with the hot sauce it's really really really hot. The service is super slow but the food might be worth it"}
{"text":"This was my very first time here it was fast service very clean affordable very friendly owner who recommended the plantain pork sandwich I cannot pronounce it but it was amazing I will be back"}
{"text":"I'm a New York Native and Millie's Cafe has all the goodies that remind me of home. I always get the pernil (roast pork) and rice with gandules which is always great. She also makes great cakes and pastries. The customer service is exceptional and the prices are reasonable. I would recommend Millie's cafe."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices! Being born and raised in Puerto Rico I'm a tough critic when it comes to \"comida criolla\" and I gotta say this place is an oasis in the middle of the desert. I just wish it was closer to Yuma so I could go more often."}
{"text":"Best place ever! Their food tasted exactly as if you where in Puerto Rico! Will recommend to anyone! It is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I'm CUBAN and as far as Cuban food in Arizona goes  there is none. No and I don't like Havana cafe.  Milly is the best that we have found. The picnic pork was as good as homemade. The rice is excellent as well as the yucca.... the mofongo which I suggest anyone to try was amazing. It was very.inexpensive ad casual. Totally worth drive fromNorth Scottsdale.  We loved it so much we ordered it for our engagement party and fed 20 ppl for about 150 bucks. Thank you Millie!! We are now regulars."}
{"text":"The food at Millies is 5 star for sure! The flavor and feel for Puerto Rico is there every time!  The only Issue I keep running in to with this restaurant is the fact that they do not answer the phone. They do carry out, but don't answer the phone.... I have called 15+ times to be exact, and it rings and goes to voicemail. This has happened to me on several occasions. Might as well go in person and wait about 30-45 minutes, since they don't answer any way."}
{"text":"I went in skeptical (being from NY and having had horrible Puerto Rican food at other places in the valley), but left feeling happier and nostalgic for the good ol' days. The arroz con gandules y pollo al horno?!? Um, yes please. It was amazing and seasoned just right. Platanos? Definitely on par with how they should be cooked. 

While nothing beats home cooking, this place comes REALLY close. And their prices are amazingly decent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food. Don't miss the sweet plantations. The chicken falls off the bone. The garlic sauce is fresh and flavorful. Very authentic and takes you back to Old San Juan."}
{"text":"Small but wonderful Puerto Rican restaurant. The staff was very nice and quick. We tried almost everything. It is all very good. Has pastelles, amarillos, tostones, empanadas, chicken, pernil, flan. Everything was gone. The kids destroyed everything we placed in front of them."}
{"text":"Excelent food. The sandwich Tripleta and the alcapurrias are my favorite. Here is where I buy my sofrito. Since you walk in the ambience is pure Puerto Rico. Love it!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and we split a Jibarito (which is a sandwich with fried plantain instead of bread) and we had the beef version. It was so yummy! Can't wait to go back and try the pork version!"}
{"text":"Millie's Cafe might be just a hole in the wall cafe but man this place is just one of the BEST Puerto Rican Cafe's in Phoenix or plainly Arizona.  I myself come from the East coast and been living out here for over 8years now and honestly was getting sick of all the mexican joints out here.  Once I discovered Millie's Cafe I brought back to me a piece of home that I was missing.  There food is truely authentic, just like my own mother use to make.  And with her having a special different dish every weekend makes returning every week worth it.  Here prices also are amazing with every dish being under $10 dollars...c'mon who can not budget that within a given week.  Millie's also Caters for parties.  She catered my daughter pool birthday party just a few weeks ago and EVER family member was just in shock and awe about the food.  Sad to say there were hardly any leftovers for me to enjoy =) 

This place is truely a mom and pop shop that can not be compared. People may complain that is not high class and five star dining but the FOOD makes up for it.  There Sandwiches are amazing...if you don't like the MAYO simply order your sandwich without it...if you like extra cheese just ask and it shall be yours.  I like my Sunday morning Ham Egg & Cheese extra egg extra cheese and me and my son get full off of just one sandwich.  Subways can't fill me with a footlong for crying out load.  And for the price you can not complain.  Millie, Raul, Alexis, Antonio & Misty run that place like magic.  And the food is always made to satisfy and with love.  I encourage anyone who misses the East coast REAL Spanish Cuisine's to come and enjoy a plate at Millie's."}
{"text":"Ordered the rice with pigeon peas and baked chicken to go with a side of plantains and garlic sauce. The chicken tasted like if it was from the day before I really didn't like it at all but rice and the garlic sauce were really good. The plantains were too ripe but still eatable. Give this place 2 stars until I can come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service Great.  Selection is small.  I ate the rice and pigeon beans, pork, and tostones with garlic and olive oil.  The restaurant had picé (hot sauce) for the rice.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I just moved over here from San Diego. The Puerto Rican food here is by far the best I've tasted since my mom's home cooking."}
{"text":"I love this place. Puerto Rican comfort food. Always hits the spot! Everything I've had on the menu is delicious! Food comes out fresh, in a timely manner. I love coming here and hope to be able to for a long time!"}

Review 7/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016

I actually tried to order something from here a few days before our visit today, but unfortunately someone had broken into the restaurant the night before so they had to temporarily close for the day. I felt really bad for them. As a small business around the holiday season this is the one of the worst things I can imagine happening to them. I resolved to go back in a few days to help them out with our patronage.

Millie's Cafe has a wonderful selection of Puerto Rican dishes. Finally, I've found a place that has good mofongo! I ordered it con cerdo (With pork) and also had some pasteles, one of each variety (Yucca and pork, plantain and pork), and had a bite of the tripleta sandwich.

The pasteles came out and smelled delicious. They are similar to a tamale, but are wrapped in banana leaf and use plantain or yucca instead of corn for the dough. I wasn't exactly sure which one was the yucca and which one was the plantain but they both were well seasoned and moist. The yellow colored one (I think it was the yucca) had a super soft spongy texture. The browner colored one (Probably the plantain) was more enjoyable for me due to the mix of seasonings and the slightly firmer texture.

I liked this rendition of mofongo. It had crispy bits of pork and plantain adding to the softer textures of the mashed plantain. There was a generous portion of roasted pork to go with it as well.

The tripleta sandwich was awesome. It had the perfect mix of textures, seasoning, soft inner portion of bread, perfectly crispy pressed outer portion of bread, meat and vegetables. We had a bottle of spicy house-made sauce to go with our meal which was piquant and a good compliment to our entrees.

Service was friendly and warm. Unfortunately the soda machine was out of order when we went but they did have bottled sodas and juices available.

If you love Puerto Rican food or want to try a taste of this great island, visit Millie's Cafe and you won't be disappointed!

4.5/5."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come the food is great and the service is amazing! I'm Cuban and I definitely get the family environment. The food is authentic and it reminds me of my mothers and grandmothers cooking. I plan on coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"Great food great service!!! We are from Chicago so expectation where high and this place definitely held up to hype!!!"}
{"text":"Yum fest. Good classic food and reminds us of home. We will most def be back for mofongo!! True gem for authentic PR food."}
{"text":"Millies was super yummy! Fantastic Puerto Rican food!"}
{"text":"Calling all Puerto Ricans if you haven't been to Millies you haven't been to the best Boricua food West of the Mississippi and possible east of it. My mother in law who lives in Puerto Rico is the only other amazing Puerto Rican food and I'm not obligated to say that ;) We are here on Mother's day and the little place is packed. From the Pernil con arroz con gandules to the pasteles the food is amazing. They are known for their mofongo which is really good too in fact everything on the menu is good. And don't forget the flan for dessert. She makes it homemade and from what Millie has told us she sells it to other mexican restaurants in the area. I would take a picture of the food but I already ate it. :)"}
{"text":"Customer friendly and clean. I visited Millie's when it was on Main Street and even then everyone was friendly and made accommodations for my son's Wheelchair. Food is tasty and authentic"}
{"text":"So good! We tried lots of different things. This place did not disappoint. The guy taking our order (which we later learned was the owner's son-in-law) was very patient as we took our time ordering. Both he and his wife were so friendly (we asked lots of questions about culture and cuisine). Never had Puerto Rican food before. 

Our final order was: 1 cubano sandwich, 1 baked chicken with rice and beans, 1 roasted pork with rice and beans, 1 kids meal (w/baked chicken), 1 pasteles, 1 order of totones (3/order), and 1 order of amarillos (3/order). We were stuffed and still took home leftovers. We also shared an order of Flan and an order of Tres Leches.

The Cubano was a hit with everyone! So tasty. Great combination of flavors. The meat in every meal was tender and full of flavor. My husband especially enjoyed the pork. The tostones were an adult favorite, but both kids kind of turned their noses up at the plantains (tostones and amarillos). Everyone liked the Flan and Tres Leches.

Not a great place for large crowds. They have 3 small folding tables and some folding chairs. While we chose to sit and eat, there were lots of people in and out picking up take-out orders. There are no fountain drinks. But they do have canned and bottled drinks available (I noticed bottled coke (reg or diet), dr.pepper (reg or diet), sprite, water and some canned fruit nectar drinks). Be prepared... Cash only!!!

Overall, an awesome place... we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ever since I saw one on TV, I have been wanting to try a real Cuban Sandwich for the longest time, but there aren't many Cuban places in Hawaii where I grew up. So after reading the reviews on here, I had to try this place. 

It did not disappoint. 

The Cubano sandwich was awesome. The pork was juicy, the bread was crispy, and the elements worked so well together. The sandwich was also huge, and could easily be a lunch and dinner, a steal for only $5.50 plus you get a small bag of chips. The only criticism was that it was a bit too salty (you know how you get some spots that are more salted than others, that was the case here). I also got some deliciously crispy tostones with garlic dip. Yum. Better than french fries."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic food, casual atmosphere, great service. Mofongo is amazing and the roasted chicken literally falls off the bone. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Little place in a strip mall. We've been passing it for years - and what we've been missing! Wonderful authentic food, made fresh by real people. Service was terrific - the owner served us & explained several dishes to us newbies. He was passionate about the food, friendly, and helpful. 
All four of us loved our food and shared each dish around. In fact we ordered a few of the side dishes because they sounded so interesting - everybody tried everything & loved it all -  nothing was leftover. Will definitely go back & would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I just found our that Millie's recently moved to my neighborhood and had to try it again.  I had a Cuban sandwich and a  papa rellena.  Both were amazing.

Great food and great service.  I highly recommend Millie's."}
{"text":"The food at Millies is so delicious! Me and my family were very pleasantly surprised. We went in with fairly low expectations. We tend to eat a lot of light food including salads and other green vegetables. Their menu doesn't include those but the food they have is so yummy. The restaurant itself is pretty bland and the presentation of the food is not necessarily so beautiful either but Millie is delightful and her food is amazing! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"2nd time here and great both times. Side of Tostones and the pork. First time I had the Cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"Shared  Cuban and jibarito sandwiches . Both were very good. Staff is friendly . Place is clean !"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! I had alcapurrias, rice and beans, jugo de parcha, the jibarito sandwich, and  pastelitos. If you are looking for authentic puertorrican food this is the place! Look no further. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Horrible and I mean horrible customer service. The wait is way too long for the type of food they make ( pork rice and beans ). And is served in TO GO containers and still can get the food out to the customers quick. Wow I am amazed by this place. I will make sure I'll never it here again. This is not acceptable for a business to treat ppl like they do.  It's a bad bad place to go eat."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, but food is good and authentic, and the staff is friendly. If you're in the mood for something a little different but not totally out of the ordinary, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I am Puerto Rican and it doesn't get any better than this in Arizona. Their catering is also great I can't wait to try out their new location."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED!!!!! How does the bread get so soggy on a grilled/pressed sandwich? All I could taste was bread and mayo. Could not make out the swiss or ham. It was as if it wasn't even present. There was one pickle, really only one. The pork was boring, just blah. 
Maybe I was just been spoiled by good Cuban sandwiches in Florida and the Keys.
What a shame"}
{"text":"This was THE best Cuban sandwich that I ever had! I have found a new place to get GREAT food! Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good puertorrican food.
Delicious Latin food seasoning.
Reasonable prices.
Very convenient order by phone
 and pick up to take home.
Very nice & friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice to see a place with good authentic Puerto Rican food in the area. Not the greatest looking dining room but, great food!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and everyone here is very friendly. It takes a little bit of time for the food to get to your table but it's well worth the wait. When I'm missing my abuelita's tostones and arroz con gandules, I know Millie's has my back. Don't hesitate to try everything on their menu- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"don't let the barren decor and plastic chairs fool you. this place is good. nice owners, straight , honest meals. the baked chicken with beans and rice is delicious. absolutely moist chicken with a wonderful baked skin. it is the best chicken I've had.  my girlfriend had the pork and it was equally good. from our booth we could see the two ladies preparing every dish and the owner came out to meet us. we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Honestly so happy I found Millie's Cafe. Living in Arizona I have not been able to find good Puerto Rican food just like my grandmother makes it and they truly have met that level of greatness."}
{"text":"que carajai!!! Por la mazeta!!! Boricua lost  in  Mesa came upon this eatery and a pleasure surprise... authentic comida Criolla!!! Ironically the street up the block is called \"Isabella\" which is a town on the north coast of Puerto Rico ... the food was hot, delicious to the palate and affordable for everyone!!! A joy ....pero  por favor ... play some good old jibaro music!!! Rafael Hernandez!!! El trío vegabajeñio!!!! What's better with comida criolla?!"}
{"text":"Cuban Food....
True authentic Cuban food!!!!!  
I am not a fan of Cuban food but if you are this place will be a home run."}
{"text":"Damn this place was good! The strip mall this place is in isn't as welcoming as some, but move past that. Walking into the cafeteria style restaurant isn't super becoming either, but move past that. We checked Millie's out as a recommendation when we were looking for some Cuban...it's Puerto Rican but that didn't disappoint! The man at the register was super great about explaining the menu. 

We started off with Pastelillo de carne and Pastelillo de queso. Both were good but the seasoning on the carne made that the favorite. Frankly, for $2.50 I will be going there often just for this starter. Melt in my mouth! 

Next we had sandwiches - a Cubano for me and the Tripleta for my friend. Damn these sandwiches kicked ass. Seasoned meats that made taste buds sing, melts cheese, crusty bread!!! 

Warning - they sandwiches are filling. 

The only thing that would have made it better is if the sofa fountain was operational. They have bottles but it's just not the same. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"The absolute only reason why its four stars and not 5 is because like all the reviews say it's cash only. Luckily having read all the reviews we were prepared for that but it would be more convenient if they accepted cards. We are at the owner, extremely friendly and nice man, what the two most popular dishes were and ordered them. When was the chicken with rice dish, and the other was their signature dish which was plantain fries with bacon. It was amazing! I highly recommend the plantain. We also ordered the flan, he said that this was what they started out selling and they make it homemade and distribute it to different retailers. We had our baby with us and got a side of beans for her which she thoroughly enjoyed. We will be back."}
{"text":"Always looking for an adventure when dinning and this is a good adventure. Real nice people greet you and take the time to be friendly. Food was outstanding, I will definitely come back when I am in the area again. Only negative is the ambience is cafe at best a little small inside and a bit warm. But don't let that stop you, try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best spot for authentic Puerto Rican food just like Grandma used to make. Great for both dine in and carry out, I've used their pre-order services multiple times around the holidays with great success!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My daughter had the Tripleta sandwich, which was delicious. It has 3 types of meat and onions. I had the rice, beans, and rroastef pork plate. The roasted pork was amazing and the beans good. If you order this, ask them to add a little more beans as the ratio of rice to beans was too much rice and not enough beans."}
{"text":"It was so exciting to be on vacation and see Puerto Rican food, and this is the real deal. I loved the taste of everything and everythinf was freshly made. I brought friends who have never tried this kind of food before and they all loved it as well. Customer service was exemplary, on top of the fantastic food."}
{"text":"My first time with Puerto Rican so I don't know how authentic it is but I can say the roasted pork is amazing and so full of flavor.  Small menu which I like, service takes a while but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Business trip to Phoenix.  On the way out decided to search for Cuban food since I can't get any where I am from and love Cuban food (thanks to my Cuban/PR soul mate). I loved Millie's   , the white rice with pork was to die for. Mofongo had great flavor, just couldn't finish a side of that on my own. Go here hungry! also tried the sweet plantains, wish they were a little sweeter, but that's a preference. Worth your money to try this place out. if you've never had this kind of Latin food , go for it! try the pork :)"}
{"text":"You guys...you have to eat here ASAP. Seriously. It's so rare to find Puerto Rican food in Phoenix, so to have a place that makes EXCELLENT home-style Puerto Rican food is like winning the food lottery.  I'm Cuban and our food is very similar to Puerto Rican food, so I was in heaven.  

Everything tastes just as good as what my mom & aunts/uncles cook - some of the things we ate were even better than my mom's cooking (the rice & beans especially). What brought us here was that they made jibaritos - a plantain sand which that I've only ever had in Chicago. That was on point and a definite must try if you've never had it. But, what will keep me coming back is the fact that is a family-run business that puts love in their food. I could taste it in every bite. 

This is such a hidden gem. I'm so, so, so happy we found out about this place. Anytime I miss food from home, I'll be coming here. And you should too!"}
{"text":"Me and a friend were trying to find a new Cuban food restaurant since Havana Cafe's Arcadia location closed in April. My friend found this place to try, which is Puerto Rican food and very similar to Cuban food so we decided to give this place a shot.

It's a very unassuming, small counter service place with just 3 tables but we were able to grab a table and order quickly. The menu is small; they had a couple of specials listed, a few types of sandwiches,  a variety of sides, desserts, and canned and bottled beverages.

A large part of the positive experience was based on the service. They were sooo nice! They asked if we had any questions and explained any dishes we weren't sure of. I wish you could find service like that in other places! 

As far as the food, I ordered the half steak sandwich,  a side of Amarillos (sweet fried plantains, akin to Cuban Maduros), Alcapurrias (banana/yucca mix stuffed with ground beef), and the rellenos papas (a deep fried ball of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef). My friend ordered the...and my apologies I don't remember the name...the chicken dish with rice, a pastel (tamale like concoction stuffed with pork), and the tostones  (savory plantains smashed down and fried like chips) with garlic sauce. Everything was amaaazing! So good! Just as good as Havana Cafe yet it was very affordable...bonus!!

The only downside was they take cash only and the menu is small but all in all I think it was a 5 star worthy place.  Unfortunately,  I live in the North valley but if I'm on that side of town I'll gladly stop there!"}
{"text":"Just for background, I have never given anyplace 5 stars before, because it's just never \"as good as it gets.\" Till now. 

A friend from Puerto Rico recommended Millie's, so I tried it with my husband. It's \"simple\" food - we ordered the rice, beans, and pork. But simple was done perfectly. The meat was fall off the bone tender and juicy. The beans were perfectly done; flavorful, but not \"slap your face\" spicy. Even the rice was perfect. Even the service felt personal - like they cared that we were there.

Millie's is in the path of light rail construction coming through any day now. We plan to go back REGULARLY to help them through that tough period. And afterwards as well. It's pretty small, so I would suggest early or late lunch, or take it to go. But try this place!"}
{"text":"I know I posted a review on Millie's a while back but it's gone. So I have to say, if you haven't been there - GO there! The menu is short and simple. Service is also simple and you feel like it comes from the heart.

We ordered pork with red beans and rice the first time. Sounds simple right? The whole thing was absolutely WONDERFUL. Tender, tender pork, flavorful (but not in your face spicy) beans, and even the rice was kind of spectacular! I didn't like the chicken quite as much, but I'm going back OFTEN - especially since their new location is almost walking distance from our house."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Good authentic Puerto Rican food. Great value for the food. Best place I've had Puerto Rican food in AZ."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm at an advantage or a disadvantage for being from NY but I know I would have enjoyed the food from Millie's even more if I wasn't from NY and hadn't eaten Puerto Rican food a thousand times. Nonetheless Millie's provides good tasting food at a reasonable price is pretty much the only Puerto Rican restaurant relatively close to me in Arizona. 

I ordered my lunch to go based off of the menu on Facebook intending to pick it up on my fifteen minute break since I run errands during my lunch. I ordered the rice w/ pigeon peas and baked chicken along with an order of tostones and was told it would be ready in ten. I gave them a little over fifteen minutes before I went to pick it up and when I got there, there was only one man behind the counter and you could tell he was overwhelmed. They had only opened maybe forty minutes ago and had a good amount of people sitting inside and after I arrived, two or three other couples showed up and formed a line behind me. I was waiting for a little bit, maybe eight minutes, while the host tended to the phones which wouldn't have been a problem except I only had 15 minutes on my break. I was getting a little anxious but Millie's is so close to my job that I made it back in time. 

The food was really good but not great. Everyone in the reviews is raving about the garlic sauce but I could have definitely gone without it, it was very oily. The mayo/ketchup sauce for the tostones was great but I eat that combination with pretty much everything already. The tostones weren't oily or overly salted, which I really appreciated. The chicken, two large drumsticks, was cooked to perfection: tender and really flavorful. The downfall, I think, was the rice and beans. It was as if two different batches of rice and beans were combined to make my plate. Some beans were cooked well and some were overcooked and dry. Seriously, they were like little black dehydrated circles. I gave my fiancé the rest of my food and tried to pick those out before I gave them to him because she's so picky when it comes to trying new food (he isn't from NY) and I didn't want to give him burnt beans as his first taste of PR food! Other than that, I enjoyed my meal. I mistakenly poured the garlic sauce on my rice and regretted it later because all that oil did not sit well with my stomach so now I know for next time to just skip it."}
{"text":"We still go here every time we visit Arizona we look forward to our visits the food is consistently great truly authentic Puerto Ativan food just like on the island"}
{"text":"Just. Visited the new location roomy and comfortable could use a little more PR decor but the food is as delicious and well prepared as ever!! I will continue to visit whenever I am in town!!"}
{"text":"Millie's is truly a gem in the Valley: excellent food, outstanding people, and the new location offers much more room. 

The mofongo with pork is my favorite dish, but we haven't been disappointed with anything yet--even my picky toddlers devour the pork and chicken. Enjoy the music and the people, and expect to eat just a little more than you should."}
{"text":"Millie's had some great food and the owners are very hospitable.  If they took something more than cash I would be there more often."}
{"text":"I went today with all my family and my experience was great!!! Great people great service really fast and they make you feel like part of there family is a family own business and there great there only for the moment taking cash and open only from Friday to Sunday but really tasty food and really cheap!!!! All plates are less that $ 9.00!!! Can't wait to be back!!!"}
{"text":"My no# 1 gripe about Phoenix? Where are all the Puerto Rican's?? My people!! Millie's is where it's at!! Delicious food that takes you right back to the island! The mofongo is spot on. The owner chatted with us for a little while as we were waiting for our food. Super nice people! The restaurant is in a small plaza. The dining room is tiny so this is not ideal for a large family gathering but it fits about 15 ppl comfortably. It is CASH ONLY!! I had no idea and drove 40mins from downtown phx. Thank goodness I had cash on me! Phew. 
The walls are littered with all kinds of photos and art from Puerto Rico! So you really get to experience the island through the food and the photos. A cozy friendly place with delicious flavor full food. I just wish it wasn't so far from downtown! That's the only reason for the -1  !"}
{"text":"Latin Soul Food  Super tender meat and loaded with flavor  My go to place from now on!"}
{"text":"Authentic Puerto Rican food. I drove an hour to get here and it was totally worth the drive. I was able to take frozen pasteles home with me. I ordered just about one of everything and it was all spot on. My family and I are definitely coming back."}
