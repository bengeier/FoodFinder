{"text":"I got the pad thai takeout and was impressed by the amount of flavor. When I order takeout, I usually have to season it when I get home but this didn't need anything other than a squeeze of lime. Decent portion size for the price, definitely adding it to my list of favorite takeout places."}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon to this place and it was a great choice! Family owned restaurant and has a very welcoming feel. The employees were extremely attentive and gave great suggestions on what to order. My boyfriend got the Mango Curry and I don't quite remember what I got...oops.  I was jealous of my boyfriends dish though...it was delicious! Glad we purchased the groupon because we love to support small family owned restaurants and this one is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Excellent Panang curry! Friendly staff. Best Thai food in Cleveland Heights. Prices are reasonable. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It used to be Mekong river and was one of my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I moved away from Cleveland a year ago. Came back this weekend and visited my favorite Thai restaurant today and it was a huge disappointment. The service was not only slow, its practically non-existent. I ordered shrimp in the blanket, pad tai, and green curry with beef. The food taste fine. However the serving size shrunk. They were almost half the size as before. The curry came with a very small plate of rice so I asked for more. Can't believe charge me  almost $2 for the extra couple spoon full of rice. Don't think I will visit again."}
{"text":"Good food. Very casual atmosphere (although not so much as the previous Mekong River). Excellent lunch special. A welcomed alternative in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It was a great restaurant to go out on a dinner date. We ordered pork pad thai and it was good! We also got great service from Tyler (our waiter)."}
{"text":"Food was served quickly and was very good, however pretty standard Thai. Service was a bit lackluster however. Ordered tea and the server forgot and never brought it."}
{"text":"Just got pad tai and Siam rolls for take out. Pad Thai was good except for the chicken which was a little tough and had an odd flavor. The Siam rolls were boring and oily - seemed like frozen store rolls. Won't be back as there are better Thai places around."}
{"text":"After trying a number of thai places in Cleveland I am shocked that this place was not packed the night I tried it. It has a cozy family vibe and it was the best thai food I've had in Cleveland and cheaper :)

The lemongrass chicken is one of the best things I've ever tasted. Their Kuai Tiao (Thai pho) and their pad thai were pretty good.  We could have skipped the Thai ice tea and the fresh rolls, though. Not bad, but not nearly as good as the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Went early on Sunday for dinner. For only 8$ I got the veggie tofu soup, pad kee mow (see ew), and fried banana dessert. My wife also had the 8$ special with salad, red vegetable curry, and fried banana.

My soup was a light broth with tons of fresh crisp veggies. My wife's salad was fresh and pleasant and her curry was excellent with an assortment of vegetables. We both got plenty of tofu with our entrees and they were large. The sauce on my pad see ew was good. The fried banana dessert was fun and tasty. 

Sure, you might find better Thai elsewhere in CLE but in my opinion the food was still excellent and a far better value at 8$ when compared to the other Thai I've had around these parts. 5/5 stars; We definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Im an american guy not particularly enamored of very spicy food or cocoanut milk so my crew sometimes has to twist my arm to get me to eat Thai food.  But a recent visit to Lotus Thai house has me looking forward to returning often. The soups and main dishes in our fivesome were all outstanding and prices are reasonable. Decor and service are pleasant as well. A great find!"}
{"text":"Their potstickers are the best I have had since moving to Cleveland. They are steamed, not fried; which is my preference. They also tasted homemade, including the wrapper. Some places use pre-made wrappers or flat out pre-made dumplings, drop them in the deep fryer and call it good, not this place.  We also had the Tom Yum soup and it was very good. I have had a lot of bland Tom Yum soup in this town and was excited to find a place that does it well. The Phad Kee Mao was also good, not the best I have ever had, but pretty solid. If you are in the neighborhood, definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. I got the Pad Thai, and it was pretty good. Nice staff, no wait time. 

They sometimes have deals on Groupon so you might want to check that out to see if it's still available!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times now, with family, with friends, and with co-workers. The food is always fresh & delicious. The service is usually very good. Lotus Thai has become or go-to restaurant for an informal, delicious meal in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Meh. Our visit was only OK. We had been wanting to check this place out for awhile, but the dark and mostly windowless exterior was a little off-putting. Not due to any fear of endangerment or anything...just claustrophobic and dark. We finally came and I was just...not impressed. Luckily, we got the window seat...

I immediately regretted my decision to get the basil fried rice when my husband ordered curry. It just sounded better and turned out it tasted better too. My basil fried rice was not what the photos on Yelp show--barely any veggies and an unnecessarily large portion. The spice level was hard to pick up on and it was completely underwhelming. I barely made a dent in my dish and ended up feeling like I ate too many empty calories. Not my first choice when thinking about eating Thai, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Lotus Thai House is the new version of the former Mekong River restaurant. I loved that place, one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. 

I ordered carry-out today from Lotus Thai House, so I can't speak much about the service. Food was ready a quick 15 minutes from when I placed the order, props to that. The outside of the restaurant still looks like a janky strip club (which is totally fine, don't let that turn you away), and supposedly they renovated the interior, I didn't get a chance to inspect that carefully. 

My favorite dish at the old Mekong River was the garlic fried rice, and they've done away with that on the new menu, which was disappointing. One great thing is the prices have definitely come down as compared to before, albeit slightly.  

I ordered the pad thai and the \"three-way pork fried rice\", which sounded a little kinky. I don't have the most discerning palate for pad thai, but it tasted a tad on the bland side. I got the fried rice because I thought it would be really unique, but it turned out to be basically regular \"American style\" Chinese fried rice, not the explosion of flavor the old 'garlic fried rice' was. The menu said it comes with three types of pork: grilled pork, pork sausage, and fried pork belly, but there was no sausage to be found, leaving it a plain-old two-way. The pork belly was fun, but there was very little of it compared to the mounds of grilled pork. The onions were a little raw for me as well. 

That all sounds bad, but I still had no trouble scarfing it down; all in all a decent meal, just not a 5 star meal. I will be back to dine-in sooner or later, and will try some other (hopefully better) dishes."}
{"text":"I love Lotus Thai!  I drove by for several months before I got curious enough to  step inside. So glad I did!

When dining at a new restaurant I always ask my waiter what they would suggest. Let them put their best foot forward. The staff is great; very warm and responsive. My waiter wholeheartedly recommended PLA RAD PRIK. It's a delicious talapia dish. Melt in your mouth goodness!!  It's hard not to order this every time I go back. But I like to try their specials and I continue to ask different waiters about their favorite dishes. The basil chicken is excellent. Honestly, I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here. Great food, terrific service, great value!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and had a craving for thai food and this was the closest and most highly rated place that popped up. We chose to dine in, which may have been our first mistake. 

It was on the early side for dinner, probably around 5:30pm and literally NO one else was in the restaurant and yet it took a surprisingly long time for everything to happen. Between the long breaks between our server's appearances, we endured Steve Harvey hosting family feud on full blast on the TV while simultaneously hearing our servers laptop at the bar blaring a thai soap opera. To make matters worse, they are directly next to a dance studio and on top of the soap opera, and the family feud, there was a constant \"untz-untz-untz\" of bass beat accompanying the entire thing.... 

The food was just okay. If we had gotten take out and hadn't experienced the lack-luster service and atmosphere then maybe we would continue to do so on occasion, but for the foreseeable future I don't see us going back."}
{"text":"-Delicious, fresh, authentic Thai food (we ordered the summer rolls w/ tofu as an appetizer and for mains I had red curry and my boyfriend had the mixed grill)
-Quick/friendly service
-Easy to use Groupon
-Full bar
-Would suggest they play music to improve ambiance (it was pretty quiet)

Overall a really good experience"}
{"text":"After reading so many high rating reviews, I finally stopped by for a lunch, quite disappointed. 

The restaurant locates on a not so good part of Lee rd, overall atmosphere is.. A-Ok in terms of Cleveland Asian restaurants standard.  

I had a lunch special combo, Tom-yum soup, a side salad, a veggie egg roll and Pad Kee Mao, it is good to have a little of everything for $8. However, none of the dishes will lead me come back again. The tom-yum soup is so light that almost looks like \"dirty water\", the pad kee mao is REALLY sweet that I can barely finish it, the veggie egg roll is OK. Overall, if you want some thai food, I recommend the places on Conventry rd. such as Tree country and High Thai or Lemon grass on the other side of Lee."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Pad Thai noodles were rubbery, chicken was dry and the pad Thai was so sticky I could barely eat it. Crab rangoons tasted frozen, not homemade. They also charge for refills for soda."}
{"text":"I live in the Cleveland Heights area and have eaten at Lotus Thai House multiple times (both dine-in and take out).  The food here is always amazing and very authentic.  Portions are huge (leftovers always make for a great lunch the next day).  Prices are very reasonable.  This is a family-owned business, and we have always received the most kind and thoughtful service from the staff at Lotus Thai House.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very expensive and not all that good. Placed a pick up order and when we got there they locked the doors way before closing time. It is a bit of a spooky place."}
{"text":"We were hit with a strong smell of mildew as soon as we crossed the threshold. The chef took a page from the Marge Simpson School of Cooking - \"the secret ingredient is... salt.\" Yet they were shockingly crowded. What did I miss?!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars, but the ambiance makes it 4, although they've done some recent (in 2016) work on that with a fireplace and added decor. The food, though, that deserves 5 stars. It is really very good Thai food (spoken by someone who lived in Southeast Asia for 4 years) and the best pad thai I've had since returning from those gorgeous lands... Their curries are amazing, the summer rolls on point, and the soups are that spicy sour you want in real Thai food. You can make anything extraordinarily spicy if that's your preference and the servers and owners just love to please. The service can be slow, but it's been better in the last few months since their son started working there, and they even cater events now! They delivered to CWRU for a work function of mine and were on time, friendly, and served their consistently delicious fair. My coworkers raved, and I was glad neither they nor I disappointed. This repeat customer is now confirmed for dine in, take away, and catered events. Basically? The food is delicious, the service is good, and if you really want to feel like you're supporting a quality mom and pop--come here!! You will be."}
{"text":"They are one of the few restaurants that deliver with a minimum $25 order and and an  additional $5 fee .  Ordered the Panang Cury and the Pad Thai. They were both excellent!   Will definitely order again if I find myself around the Cleveland Clinic area in the future."}
{"text":"Found this place after snagging a Groupon. Clean space with super friendly staff. Their pad Thai is the best I've had in Cleveland, albeit not the best I've ever had. Panang and green curries are always reliable choices as well! Their early bird dinner specials are a good deal ($11-12 for three courses) so come before 6p if you can!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! I visited this restaurant on a recent  Thursday during dinner time. I am all for supporting local small businesses, but the food was not that good. I had mango curry and all it had was the mango juice taste. My husband's beef entree was just tasteless. I am not even complaining about understaffed place, but it can definitely be improved."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has a great variety of Thai food. Sure, the prices are a bit on the higher end, but you get what you pay for in terms of portion size and taste! My go-to dishes here are their curry puffs for appetizer and pad thai for entree. You get 2 curry puffs per order, and they're a decent size! The outer covering is really crispy, while the inner core is soft, packed full of curry :) The pad thai is super delicious! It has a tiny hint of sweetness, which pairs well with the savoriness! 

My only question is why is it always so empty? The food here is really amazing! I wish they got more customers!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Nothing fancy in appearance but the food was was properly prepared and delicious! I tried the Mango Curry at spice level 2 and it had a nice kick to it! I don't think I would go much hotter. The Crab Rangoon and Lotus Puffs were excellent, as was the Pad Thai my wife had. 

Service was excellent.

Found out about Lotus Thai House via Groupon but the prices are quite reasonable. We're definitely coming back here for more!

What a wonderful surprise!"}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about going here, after reading some of the Yelp reviews, but not any longer.  This was pretty good stuff:-)   I had purchased a Groupon which was due to expire in a few weeks, so my daugher and I stopped here early on a Saturday evening.  The dining room was empty when we arrived, but started to fill up shortly thereafter.  The waitstaff was super nice and very attentive.   We started with the thai wings and potstickers.  Both dishes were expertly prepared and were very good.   The only complaint, the wing appetizer included only 4 wingettes ($5).  I ordered the basil fried rice.  The portion was huge, and arrived hot and fresh.   The rice included, thai basil, bell peppers, onions, chicken and was slightly spicy.  This dish was GOOD!   My daughter ordered the lemon grass chicken.  The entree contained 3-4 nicely portioned chicken breasts slices bathed in a lemon grass sauce with jasmine rice and a nice assortment of vegetables.  Once again, the portion was large, and she thoroughly enjoyed the dish.   The entrees being served to tables around us also looked very good, curry puffs, pad thai, curries etc.   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Not as good as I remembered, but still one of the better Thai restaurants in Cleveland. The prices are great for portion size and they have a lot of vegetarian options. I highly recommend ordering the pad Thai."}
{"text":"Very good food. Fried rice could have had more meat in it. Appetizer, shrimp in the blanket was excellent. I noticed the walls needed wiped down in the dinning room, which was gross since its at eye level."}
{"text":"This place has not been crowded the 3 times I've eaten there.  But it should be! Slow down to savor the nuanced flavors & fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients!  My uncle owned an award-winning Asian restaurant, so my taste buds are fine-tuned to Asian fare.  

Chef Eddie suggested the Pla Rad Prik, and we just ordered it for the 3rd time!  Tilapia surrounded by a very light, slightly crispy batter, with artfully arranged veggies and delicate, fragrant tamarind sauce -- not over-thickened or too salty like at many Asian restaurants.  Also, the tofu Lad Na, tofu string beans and vegetable spring rolls are winners.

Can't wait to try the banana eggroll with chocolate sauce and sticky rice dessert next time if I can restrain from getting stuffed on the yummy main dishes!  Maybe meeting a friend just for dessert might work?

RUN, don't walk, to grab a quiet seat or phone in a carry out here!  Quiet enough for cozy conversation.  It's away from the Coventry parking meter headaches, too, as there's a free lot around back.

I like the casual vibe, with plain ( no tablecloths) wooden tables topped with small vase with a  flower floating on water.  A small candle at each  table, Thai music and no TV at the bar would add romance to the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I visited at 10pm on Saturday, December 28th. Perhaps the Pad Thai was dry because they were about to close at 10:30pm...I'm not sure but it was DRY. Both orders of Pad Thai were dry. The dish tasted decent but it wasn't juicy enough. 
The spring rolls were delicious. My mother enjoyed her mango fried rice but it could've had more shrimp."}
{"text":"I've been here in two seperate occasions. Both visits I found the food to be fairly good, but the service to be lacking.

The curry sauces are all made in advance, so if you are vegetarian or vegan and want to request a fish sauce free curry you are out of luck. This meant there was only one curry I  could order, and it was ok at best. My date had the chicken green curry in on our first visit and the yellow curry on our second and said they were ok at best.  The portions are significantly smaller than others in the area, but cost about the same. I was surprised is that our lunch for 2 on the with no beverages and 1 appetizer ended up costing around $30 before tip   We frequent several other Thai places in the area that are in my opinion much better and are significantly more affordable. 

Overall it was okay and I would go back if a friend were wanting to go, but it definitely isn't the best Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"We've gotten delivery from Lotus Thai via SkipTheDishes several times now, and I'm definitely a fan!  I haven't been into the restaurant yet, but the delivery service works well-- the fee isn't outlandish and goes to the driver, and I've never had any problems with missing items or order accuracy.

We've enjoyed just about everything we've tried.  I wasn't a huge fan of the larb salad, and my husband said the Thai basil chicken was good but wasn't sure that he'd order it again.  Everything else we've had has been excellent.  Maybe I'm boring, but I'm a sucker for good pad thai, and it's delicious here.  4/5 gets hot that's barely tolerable, just the way I like it, and I've enjoyed both tofu and chicken.  My husband's liked both the red curry and the green curry, although we haven't gotten it quite as spicy as he'd like quite yet.  The chicken satay is tasty, and the house salad is nice and fresh (get it with the peanut sauce dressing).  And while I know that crab rangoons are a tradition out of San Francisco, not Asia, Lotus Thai has the best ones I've had. As a bonus, portion sizes are huge-- we get two to three meals out of each order.

I can't speak for the ambiance or the customer service in-house, but I'll definitely be a repeat customer for the food!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Didn't read any of the reviews before going. Just read them now and I see mostly positive reviews. Makes me wonder if I just happened to go on an off night because the food was mostly unimpressive. Started with the chicken satay, mango wings and Tom Yum soup for appetizers. The satay chicken was delicious... perfectly tender. Wings were just okay - burned in some areas. Tom Yum was too salty for my taste. For the entrees, we had:

Thai Style Basil Chicken - pretty good! Nicely spiced, good flavors. 

Macadamia Beef - beef over cooked, dry and gritty. 

Tropical Bird's Nest - server told us that they ran out of nest and asked if it was okay to serve without it. We agreed. It was a pretty good dish, except the scallops completely ruined it. Scallops were tough and rubbery. The seafood was not fresh. 

Finally, the three dishes each came with a small cup of rice. As someone who eats a lot of rice, a cup certainly was not enough. I asked for more rice and was flabbergasted when told than another cup of rice would cost $1.50!!! I frequent MANY Asian restaurants and I get my dose of rice when eating Asian. This is the first Asian restaurant I've been to that charges for extra rice. Most Asian restaurants just put a big bowl of rice on the table for everyone to share - and they keep bringing you more if you ask. They seem to be very calculated with their rice, which soured me a bit. I mean, they're entree dishes are already priced on the higher end... but still seem to be okay with nickel and diming their guests for rice???

Again, not sure if it was just an off night. Based on the majority of the reviews here, I hope it was. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I'd like to say I'll be back to try again. I do, however, hope that they get rid of that extra charge for rice."}
{"text":"Not sure if my experience was bad because this was the last thing they served but my pad ki mao take out was horrible. It looked like a re-heated meal that had been sitting there for the whole day. I had to throw out the complete meal after a single bite. What a waste of my $15 and time. I rate this experience worse than a zero."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food.  The grandparents are cooking in the kitchen, and the service was very attentive. The waiter was the grandson and he was excellent at recommending what \"they make and eat at home\"
We went for the lunch and the portions were a good size.  All in all, we will be adding this to our lunch rotations."}
{"text":"Great little Thai place in a low traffic area in Cleveland Heights. I order food to go and upon arriving early my food was waiting still hot. The greeter was extremely nice, very pleasant and had a great energy. The food was phenomenal, rice cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"This has replaced the old Mekong Delta, which I never did eat at. But I've enjoyed Thai food all over Cleveland and other cities. I also like to support small local businesses. But this is the WORST Thai food I've ever had.

I had the $7.99 lunch special, which on the surface seems like a fantastic deal -- an entree, salad, soup and an egg roll. But not one item was really excellent. The egg roll (a ground pork filling) was good and hot, but tiny. The Tom Yum soup, which normally has shrimp, here has big pieces of chicken -- and they were not moist soup meat, but dry pieces of stir fry. The broth was good, but the chicken was just weird. I didn't eat it.

The salad was generic bagged lettuce, covered in peanut sauce (like for satay) rather than a peanut based dressing. This was like eating lettuce covered in sweet peanut butter. Weird. It was a surprisingly large salad, but lettuce and carrots were limp.

But one of the biggest disappointments was the Pad Thai -- this is generic stuff today. Even mid-level Chinese eateries can turn out a good Pad Thai. Here it is tiny portion, no shrimp or tofu, but covered in ... yup, again some large pieces of very dry chicken. The whole thing had a strange aftertaste.

Lastly, I ordered STUFFED chicken wings, a favorite of mine. The waiter must have misheard me and brought something called \"Mango wings\". This was like bar-style chicken wings, presumably brushed with a mango marinade. I detected no taste of mango. They were not crisp at all, but had rubbery tough skin.

I did have a bubble tea, in coconut, which was delicious -- the only really good thing about the meal. The restaurant keeps odd hours -- 11-2:30PM except Friday and Saturday, when they have dinner also. It was almost empty at noon when I went.

Too bad, we could really use a good Thai place. This is not it."}
{"text":"I have been to Lotus Thai House a few times and have really enjoyed the food! The pad thai is very good and the service is awesome. It's my new Thai spot!"}
{"text":"I don't have one bad thing to say about this place which is why I was so generous w/my stars. 

The goodness started w/the eye candy (he'll be known as THG - \" the hot guy\" from here on out) that greeted me at the door! Yikes! He was very very handsome and while I'm not sure if this is Yelp appropriate I'm glad I came in today! 

When I arrived there wasn't anyone else that I saw there besides \"Grandma and THG\". I sat at the bar and THG was very patient as I talked on the phone/counseled my Stepmom and decided what I wanted to order. 

The menu had a lot of deliciousness to choose from. I went with the Lotus Siam Rolls and the Oriental Salmon and I was not disappointed. The Siam rolls came out fast. I also had a drink while I waited and THG served a nice one. 

Midway into my rolls, my entree came out and it was great! I had a groupon which required me to dine in but THG made my mandatory stay worth it. I plan to return. Btw THG's real name is Jimmy ;-)."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place closed a few years ago. I'm glad I discovered this place.  I went here with family and we all seemed to enjoy our meal.  It was a slow Sunday night so we had great service.  I ordered the masaman curry which was the perfect blend of vegetables, tofu, and spice (and by spice, I mean not to spicy).  I unfortunately do not remember what everyone else ordered, but pretty much all of our food was gone by the end of the night so I'm guessing everyone was pleased.  There wasn't anything particularly unique about this place - it's your standard Thai place.  But it was good and I would go back. I've been to a couple other Thai places around town and haven't enjoyed their curry as much as I did at Lotus Thai House."}
{"text":"Really want to love this place but the food is inconsistent. The portions get smaller and smaller every time. I don't understand. I want to give this place at least four stars because the food is great but the portions keep me from returning. The Pad Thai, House fried rice and Mango Curry are my favorites."}
{"text":"Often when I read not-so-great reviews of a place I've loved, I wonder if I actually went to the same place the other reviews are about. 

On a Monday at 5:45, there was no one else at Lotus Thai House - so the service was quite superb. I guess when you're the only people in a restaurant, it's hard to get that part wrong. 

And the food... so it's been about 10 years since I've had actual Thai food (Because Pad Thai from Rocky River Brewing Co. can hardly be called real Thai. Umami Moto and Phnom Penh are probably closer, but I've always been seduced by their other dishes.)  -- so maybe my authenticity meter is lower, or maybe some of the other reviewers went on a bad night? 

Maybe we just got lucky -- because my boyfriend and I had a very tasty Thai dinner this early Monday evening. 

We started with the Lotus Curry Puffs -- two large and flaky, flaky, flaky deliciously fried pastries with ground chicken, sweet potato, cilantro, onions, and curry powder, with a sweet sauce - and a small bowl of Kuai Tiao (Don't let \"small\" fool you - it was easily enough for one meal really - even split between two of us there should have been some left over. [But there wasn't, because we were pigging out a little. Ok, a lot.].) Their Kuai Tiao is a lot like pho, and just as yummy. 

The boyfriend got the Pumpkin Curry - a little strange presentation I think, as it's served in a fried tortilla bowl (think taco salads) - but the contents (chicken, shrimp, and veggies with yellow curry) were delicious and prepared with care (yay for shrimp that isn't tough and rubbery!), and almost hot enough for him at the extra spicy level. (I sometimes think there's no such thing as too hot for him.) My Masaman Curry, medium spicy (I could have gone a little hotter) was even better - though I think it would have been better with beef. My own poor decision to go with chicken, as far as taste. The chicken was good chicken though - not the gristle laden chunks you end up with in so many Americanized Thai places. 

The only complaint I had at all was that the main dishes came out a little too fast on the heels of the soup and appetizer... we weren't even close to being done. I'll chalk that up to us being the sole patrons the entire time we were there though - I suppose the guys in the kitchen didn't have much else to do.

We stuffed ourselves thoroughly, and enjoyed every second of it. And though I have to admit there is a selfish part of me that enjoyed having the whole place to ourselves, I really hope that isn't the norm - this place should be packed for dinner. I know we'll be back for more! (Though maybe we'll stick to the early dinner to have it to ourselves...)"}
{"text":"Great food! Great company! Real Authentic Asian home style cooking! The green Curry wAs really good."}
{"text":"I came here by myself, to use one of my groupons that had expired.
The service was decent, the young lad was spot on his recommendations.
The curry puffs were a mouthgasm. The shell was crisp and the inside was chock full of flava.
I ordered some spicy noodle dish with basil, it was pretty good, it could have used more protein, but the flavor was outstanding.
 I ordered it a 5 for spicy and it had nice heat, I did supplement it with a Thai chilli and fish sauce concoction, I was glad the did not give me siracha. That shit is so over prescribed."}
{"text":"Hurray!  This is a cozy thai restaurant near the intersection of Cedar and Lee.  They have their own parking lot!  So no meters to worry about.  The curries are about 11$ for tofu or chicken and 14$ with shrimp.  The specialty dishes like duck are 15-20$.  White rice is included.  I really liked the panang curry, jumbo shrimp, and pad kee mao.  The chicken wings appetizer was delicious.  I'm already look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"First of all, the portion sizes here are extremely generous. And thank goodness for that-- the food is amazing! Tonight, we started with the clear vegetable soup, which was perfect for tonight's chilly evening. I found myself wishing I had more soup when I was done, which almost never happens to me when I go out. For the main dishes, we got the Lad Na, and the Pad Thai. I highly recommend both. Each dish is carefully made to order, and they are vegetarian and allergy friendly. You will not regret going here for a meal. I cannot believe how each bite is bursting with so much flavor! You can definitely taste the love and care that went into preparing each meal. Our server tonight was very helpful and kind. Already looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Groupon Alert!!!  Not bad Lotus, not bad.  We came into the establishment and were instantly met by a cute atmosphere that was clean and warm.  We ordered an appetizer, pot stickers which I would actually suggest you skip.  Not very good and thus the downgrade to 4.  We honestly could have been full without it anyways.  Our meals though were another story.  We got the pad thai, which is a classic and eggplant scallops.  The pad thai was a bit \"wetter\" than I\"m used to but overall the flavor was there!! There was a sweet hint of flavor that I couldn't quite place my finger on but I really enjoyed it.  The eggplant scallop was on point.  The scallops were a little bit smaller (but that is usually expected) but the eggplant and sauce was delicious.  Everything was cooked well and the waitress was really helpful in our meal decisions.  Quiet atmosphere, pretty good food (skip the pot stickers), and a discount, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food was delicious and there were no issues with service. Definitely recommended. We ordered the potsticker appetizer, pad Thai and pumpkin curry. All very good. We also ordered bubble teas! If you visit this place you must get a bubble tea. We ordered the banana egg rolls to go and they were a yummy treat later on in the evening. Hopefully Lotus Thai House sticks around because I think it might be my new favorite."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have had in Cleveland!! The Shrimp Pad Thai was as good as I've had in New York City--perfectly prepared by the pros and well priced. And salad with peanut dressing was delicious as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai!

We drive all over Cleveland just for different NON chain Thai restaurants. 

Thus place was on point with their Pad Thai and basil fried rice. NOT to mention the crab Rangoon was  perfect. I also got a Thai coffee that was perfect. Sometimes it's hard to get those perfect. Lol.

The service was a bit slow. But, I didn't mind. It gave me the time to take in the entire place. It's clean, well furnished and smells good.

The bathrooms are clean and there were plenty of paper towels. ( I don't understand why this is always an issue)

The entire evening was awesome. We got some basil fried rice to go and we didn't even heat it up. It's delicious cold."}
{"text":"My wife and have been working thought the Thai restaurants in the area and I think we have found the winner.  The staff was very attentive and all the food was fresh and well done. We will be back. 

My only complaint was that they charged us $1.50 to bring another scoop of white rice out.  This is a personal pet peeve."}
{"text":"Really liked the Paradise Salmon. A generous helping and nicely presented. 
Tried my first bubble tea and was impressed; didn't think it would be satisfying  .
Haven't had room for dessert yet."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place, because we really wanted to be able to take applicants here for inexpensive Thai food.  But, we were, unfortunately, very disappointed.

So first of all, the additional star is because the waitress here was really friendly and attentive, filled our waters, and took good care of us.  When we did not finish our food she even asked us if we thought the food was okay.  We didn't have the heart to tell her what we thought of it.  

For appetizers we had the shrimp in a blanket (a fried shrimp dish with a crispy shell).  This is only restaurant that has ever served me shrimp in a blanket with mayo inside.  Frankly, the additional lumps of mayo inside killed the authenticity and made it taste like a stereotypical, westernized dish - crab rangoon.  We also had a pad thai, which was soggy and had a very strange flavor to it that quite simply turned us off.  We ended up not finishing it.  Also had a Lotus Thai fried rice - the rice was undercooked, but it was okay (luckily, because otherwise we would've gone home hungry)."}
{"text":"We have been here twice: 
1. the food quality is consistently good. The 4 stars are really because of the food. We've had noodle dishes, duck, curry, and apps - everything has been tasty and good. 
2. the wait service, while lovely, it a wait. slow. it'll be at least an hour and a half for dinner. 
3. the restaurant was EMPTY the first time and PACKED the second time... who knows... 
4. the ambiance is open. whatever you are talking about, the table next to you will hear you."}
{"text":"If you liked Mekong River, you'll like Lotus Thai House.  Same location, same atmosphere, and in my opinion the food has gotten better.

I decided to be a little adventurous and not order chicken satay and potstickers, which is what I almost always order for appetizers at a Thai restaurant.  Instead, I started off with the stuffed boneless chicken wings.  The mussels were big and came in a tasty lemongrass broth.  The boneless chicken wings were small.  Basically they are deboned chicken wings stuffed with ground chicken, vegetables, and spices.  In one order, you get 2 wings that are each cut into thirds.  I would have preferred more wings, but the presentation was good and what we got was delicious.

For the entree, I ordered the Salmon Paradise.  Just like when this restaurant was Mekong River, you get a lot of food.  The piece of fish was very large and was served with a lot of curry.  There was a lot of flavor in the curry and the fish, which was advertised on the menu to be \"steamed to perfection\", did not disappoint.

My friends ordered the Pad Thai and the three way pork fried rice.  I didn't try any, so I can't comment on how those dishes tasted.  I did observe that their portions were also well sized."}
{"text":"I am a fan of thai food and have had in many thai restaurants. This will be one of the best restaurants that I have had from. We started by ordering a coconut milk soup and chicken pot sticker that was good but can be better. Then we got thai basil fried rice and pad kee mau as our main course and those were too good. Would definitely go here again. No pics to post it as we were too hungry to click pics :P"}
{"text":"Really great food and service. The server helped is select good options from the menu and was very friendly. It was a little slow for a Friday night, but that worked out great for us! Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"We used a groupon during our visit. We ordered thai iced tea, curry puffs (great!), red curry, pad thai and mango sticky rice. Everything was excellent. The thai iced tea tasted a bit different than other places because I think they used cane sugar (which is better bcz its natural sweet). The service was very friendly, and attentive. They were more than glad to take our groupon (unlike other places where they may lack customer service or food quality). My husband and I could not believe we got to eat some delicious thai food for half the cost. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I frequently get take out from lotus, not only bc it's very close to my house but also bc I absolutely love their pho. Customer service is pleasant. Will continue to frequent as long as I live here."}
{"text":"Terrible, slow service! Attempted to come here before a concert at Cain Park last night.  We were seated immediately, but it was 15 min before anyone came to inquire about an order and 40 min before we even got drinks (like iced tea.). We never got sweetener. Half an hour later (1hour 10 min after arrival) they still hadn't started cooking our food and couldn't tell us when we would get it.  At least two other tables also planned to go to the concert and hadn't gotten food, having arrived before us!  We were told one of the chefs had called off, leaving only two.  We finally cancelled our order and paid for the drinks (with 10% discount) and headed to the concert.

We felt bad, but knowing many patrons were going to the concert, better customer service would have been to notify people of a potential delay when they sat down.  They also lost their liquor license, so BYOB."}
{"text":"We came here for their grand opening and the food was amazing! Huge menu selection and great prices. 
This was formerly Mekong River restaurant. The new owners went in and revamped the place and have also put a bigger bar inside. 
We were very pleased with our meals. We got the stuffed chicken wings for appetizers, curry beef and pad thai for our dinners. Loved it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is just terrible. I don't know if we showed up when they were busier than expected, or what. But everything from the food, the service, the ambiance, was a disaster.

A long-standing complaint about the previous tenant, Mekong River, was that the interior was in dire need of updating. I had heard that they were planning a renovation, but instead I guess they closed up shop, and Lotus Thai House moved in, without taking on any of the planned renovations.

I came with a groupon with my wife, daughter, and in-laws. It was stifling hot inside, apparently the two wall A/C units were not up to the task of cooling off the dining room. It took about 10 minutes for the waitress to finally come over to take our dinner order, never bringing us water (until we asked), or even stopping by for an initial drink order. 

I don't remember what everyone ordered, but I got the pad thai, and we ordered a tofu triangle appetizer for the table. The app came out relatively quickly, but I would have rather eaten a plate of cardboard. They were bland, dry, and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I know it's tofu, but I expected way more from this.

My wife and her mom ordered a dish and asked to hold the shrimp. Both came with shrimp. The main courses were brought out at different times... everyone else had finished eating by the time my pad thai showed up. The waitress tried to make it up to me by offering a free dessert, which we accepted (a pretty standard fried banana egg roll with ice cream), but there is no way I would come back to this place if you paid me. Every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Cleveland is leaps and bounds better. Trust me, if you're in the area and want a good Thai meal, skip this place and go to Lemon Grass, High Thai'd, or even Tree Country Bistro. You've been warned."}
{"text":"They have dinner specials during the weekend. They seemed to have ran out of desserts. The service is very slow but the restaurant is very busy with people getting take out. They many need more servers. The lemongrass chicken soup is very salty. The cook put too much fish sauce. For the entree, the Thai basil pork was okay. I've had better. The waiter put our dessert on hold which made us lose the mango sticky rice we ordered. The mango sticky rice was great. I think the service needs to be a lot better."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight for the first time. The food was incredible, great flavor, quality ingredients and cooked perfectly. The waitress was nice and gave good descriptions of the food. 
Unfortunately, it was the WORST SERVICE I've ever had in a restaurant. There was one other table dining in and one carry out order. Yet we had to eat from the serving dishes because we had no plates, even after asking. For some reason, she found it more important to spend time answering questions and chatting with the people waiting for there takeout than actually provide to people actually trying to eat their dinner
#TakeOutOnly"}
{"text":"I had a groupon and took a friend. I think I have high standards and expect intense flavors, but the drunken noodles were a little bland for my taste. They ask what spicy level (0 to 15? I think or 10?) and maybe I asked for too weak of a level. Wouldn't go back though and probably prefer somewhere in Asia town area."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant after Mekong River stopped their business. I don't know what happened, but it is a lotus thai house right now. The place is fairly empty and the waiter was pretty friendly and let us pick our own seats and tables. We ordered two appetizers: shrimp in the blanket and puffy curry. They were very yummy and well made! The shrimp dish was deep fried enough to have the crispy shrimp shell that was totally eatable but not burned or too oily. The flavor was pretty good as well. The puffy curry was very flaky yet soft. The curry inside was very yummy as well. My friend from malasia said that it tasted very similar to one of their dishes in malasia. although both appetizers were fried, they were in no way too oily. For entree, I ordered lad nah with chicken. I don't know about other dishes, but mine was pretty good. Very flavorful. The chicken however may need some more work - it was a little too cooked so it came off very dry and kinda hard. It also needed more flavor in the chicken.

Service was great! The waiter was very friendly and willing to accommodate to our friend's taste - i.e. make it more spicy and add some garlic to the dish. When we were driving out of the parking lot, I was still debating whether I should give this restaurant a 4 or 5 star. Then we saw our waiter RUNNING out of the restaurant with only his tshirt on in this cold, snowing day to catch us because one of our friends forgot his beanie on the table. At that moment I was like YEAH FIVE STAR IT IS!"}
{"text":"I have lived in New York City and Chicago, and was looking for a good thai restaurant in Cleveland. Got a groupon and tried this place, and now I have gone every single week :) 

This restaurant is one of the best thai places I have had ever! They have the sauces just right. The spicy level is pretty accurate (we got a 2 for our curry and nearly died), start low!! The service is great. The server is always friendly, the food comes really fast. It's family owned as well. 

What a gem to have this restaurant in Cleveland. This is out go-to place for take out and dine in. Keep up the great work Lotus Thai!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots on the east side. The staff here is hands down the best. I have a anecdote to prove it. The second time I went to Lotus Thai, I went with my girlfriend and our friend. We had a wonderful dinner and left satisfied. About a month later, the three of us returned. After sitting down, the waiter said he had out water bottle we left the last time. He then brought out our friends Nalgene Bottle that she didn't even remember losing. It blew my mind that he remembered the event.

Besides the amazing service, the food is amazing! The best Thai food I've had in Cleveland! My favorite is the Massaman Curry. Please support this family run spot."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night around 8 o clock ! Coming in they weren't busy nor were they slow.  We sat at a table and starting looking through the menu . We started the appetizers with egg rolls and dumplings but the server told us for another $2 we could get Another appetizers which was their specials! And I am so glad we did because we ordered the curry puffs (chicken ). My favorite ! It Tasted like samosas which is an Indian appetizers but the pastry was more flaky and soft . That was the best appetizers I have had In a while ! The server was very helpful since it was our first time here . We ordered pad Thai for dinner spice level 7 and lemon grass chicken which comes with rice . Both were delicious ! I would definetly come back ! This place is really good the servers are very nice and attentive and most of all the food is good !"}
{"text":"The family that owns and operates Lotus Thai House are worth the visit alone. I had a great time sitting at the bar on my last visit and shooting the breeze with them. It is great to see different generations of a family working together under the same roof. The grandfather is awesome and quite the conversationalist. The prices are reasonable. The Bangkok beef curry has been one of my favorite meals. The basil chicken should not be missed. I usually order green curry at Thai places and this one did not disappoint. Brown rice is available if you want to go the healthy route and stray from jasmine. The spice levels are from 1 to 3. I ordered the 3 and wish they would have kicked it up a notch. It is worth departing from my usual Thai Kitchen in Lakewood to make the trek across town to Lotus Thai. It also gives incentive to stop a few hundred yards down the road and have a great beer at the Bottle House to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend here in Cleveland and just wanted something quick for dinner and this turned out to be a great Thai restaurant! 

They have a great early bird special for a three course meal that includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert! If you choose Chicken it was all for 10 dollars! The quality is very good and was very happy we stopped in for dinner! Would go back!"}
{"text":"I really liked the Pad Thai with beef. The sweet lime taste really tasted good. I asks had the Kuai Tiao with beef excellent! The grandson works there and he was very helpful with what did would be great to try for my first time. I am very glad I listen to him because I want those same dishes for the next time! I'll be back to this place to eat again. Oh, they did have a good Groupon for this place too."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've had a few of the seafood dishes and pad thai, and it's been great. I have never dined in, but it looks nice and clean. When I've ordered pick up, the time frame is 10-15 minutes. That's quick. The people there have always been super friendly in person and on the phone. I like this better than Mekong River."}
{"text":"Eaten here several times after work around 7 p.m.  Quaint, quiet, good food, friendly service, and quick.  We like this family establishment enough to help it out. We always try something different.  Food is always good for the money.  Nightly bar specials are good, but one drink was a bit strong for me.  Groupons are available.  Notice people call and take carry outs, too. (See my photos.)"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place for traditional pad thai!! Also my all time favorite thai place becuase the prices are incredibly reasonable! This restuarant has a full bar and the service was friendly and welcoming. The portion sizes are exceptional given what you pay for a meal. Even a great place to come just for a beer and appetizers or a glass of wine and fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Walked into a balmy dining room with an odd smell (like moldy wall or something?) Definitely not a fancy place, but definitely felt that authentic vibe. Had a very attentive server who was not too pushy or looking over the shoulder all the time. He was very patient when taking our orders and had a few good suggestions. Thumbs up to you my boy for suggesting those Curry balls as an appetizer.

These tasty morsels are about the size of palm, fried and flaky sort of like an empanada. Inside, curry stew with chicken, potato and aspirations of ordering seconds.

We ordered two dishes: minced basil chicken and classic chicken/shrimp pad thai. For the basil chicken, I felt it was quite lackluster in taste. Hardly spicy but nothing some good ol' uncle sriracha couldn't fix. The vegetable to meat ratio was like 50/50, never had bell peppers in this dish before. I thought could have used more meat.

Hard to go wrong with pad thai, but I thought this particular entrée was sweeter than I've had in my lifetime. 

I grew up eating rice with all my Asian dishes, and for the two of us, we were given a cup of white rice...a cup? 

Private parking lot in back is always a plus for me."}
