{"text":"This is hands down the worst middle eastern food experience I have ever had in my life. I love food and eat out a lot.  Service and the taste of the food was horrible. I can not even compare the taste of the food to anything cause it was the worst I've ever had. All the food looked like it was just sitting there, the sauces on the table were missing the caps and it was just disgusting.  I fell like the whole place was really unsanitary from molded produce, to the dirty kitchen i had seen it all."}
