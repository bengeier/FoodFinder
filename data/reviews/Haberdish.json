{"text":"Moving to CLT from PDX we were kinda excited to experience NoDa. We heard about this place and followed it in IG. Finally made out way to the area and it's def like a Portland vibe. Only they food missed the mark.  I got the fried chicken and waffles. Chicken was average and the waffle was bland and hard like a brick. I absolutely hated the syrup.   Hush puppies were the best thing we ordered and were prob the best I've had since moving here   Bacon jelly biscuit was also good but I wouldn't order it again   Overall it's a fun spot with average food but we will go back  at some point to try it again."}
{"text":"They create some of the best cocktails in Charlotte by far!!! Jen is the best mixologist in Charlotte.  I described my tastes and she made cocktails that were out of this world."}
{"text":"Awesome food and very friendly ppl. They got the best fried chicken in town and nothing can beat their beet pickle, which they said is part of their changing menu."}
{"text":"We will definitely return here with friends and family. Service was excellent and very attentive. Immediately served water then asked for our drink order. Beautiful decor and loved the atmosphere.   Fried Chicken was excellent. It was full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Hush puppies were delicious along with the butter they serve with them. Corn bread pudding was ok. They cut it in half so you have one side that is delicious, then the boring side which was somewhat lacking in flavor. I'd rather them not cut it in half. Macaroni and cheese I have mixed feelings about. The cheese sauce was bland but good(needed salt). Pasta was too large which took away from the flavor of the cheese. Last but not least was the banana pudding. It has very good flavor, but too much whip cream and not enough bananas and cookies.   At the end of our meal they brought us warm wet towels to clean our hands. Nice end to such a lovely dinner.   We look forward to coming back for more chicken and trying the other sides!"}
{"text":"We went on a date night last week. We used the no wait app and put our name on the list. We ordered several different things off of the menu. The portions are tapas style. Cocktails were great but on the small side. The place is super cute but can be noisy since it's one large room."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in NoDa. Although the wait can be atrocious, download an app to beat the line. I often grab takeout here and walk back to my apartment. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the bar is nice to relax at.   Chicken tenders, fried chicken (white or dark), mac & cheese, kale salad, bourbon glazed carrots are all my jam. I shall try the rest of the menu sometime but I just love all of those So good. I mean real good.   Also their BBQ and honey mustard sauces are legit. Can't eat enough. Funny thing is, I tried to type can't get enough but I was going to fast and it typed can't eat enough. Which is true."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim with a friend after hearing about it recently opening. From the outside it definitely has a great look to pique your curiosity to want to go inside.  Once inside we were not disappointed with anything from the decor (copper vs. silverware, so cool), the ambience, our fantastic waiter, the food, and the prices.  For reference we ordered the sweet potato dumplings, kale salad, deviled eggs, and cole slaw, and split the waffle for dessert (OMG the waffle with the buttermilk ice cream all completely homemade and amazing!!!!).  Highly recommend this place despite the parking being a pain around there but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food and drinks are phenomenal, the service is friendly and quick, and the atmosphere is the perfect balance of hillbilly-chic that is popular but hard to achieve these days! I recommend the Red Flower cocktail, Deviled Eggs and Hushpuppies for apps, and the Roasted Chicken entree with Roasted Okra side dish - but honestly any choices made at this establishment are great ones!"}
{"text":"This charming little gem of a restaurant is situated in a quaint part of town. The food was excellent, the service was great, and the atmosphere was vibrant. I recommend it highly, it was a wonderful experience. Take lots of friends, you will all have an awesome time."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal tonight!  Loved all the vegetarian options.  Husband and I shared the cauliflower steak and a bunch of sides.  The cauliflower would have fed a small army, but we loved it.  Intense but delicious.  Sweet potato dumplings were amazing...then again, I love anything cooked in sage butter!  Kale salad was fresh and okra was perfectly cooked.  Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Haberdish. Can't go wrong by going here. Their homemade ranch dipping sauce for the chicken tenders is not to miss. Great job on decorating the inside. Service is decent. Only wish they took reservations."}
{"text":"I only went for cocktails, but the menu is creative and everything is hand crafted! My favorite was the four roses bourbon which is served with a spherical ice cube with an actual rose frozen within! Such an awesome touch. I love the rustic decor, and the menu looks amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant the food was delicious and the service that Melissa gave us was amazing we will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Heard a lot a bout this place so I finally got a chance to stop by and check it out. From the orders that I seen that were being brought out to the tables, everything looked amazing. I went with the fried chicken, charred okra and hush puppies. Didn't have a chance to get into the cocktail menu but something tells me that I will on the next visit."}
{"text":"Based on the outstanding reviews, we decided to give this place a try. We arrived at 3 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately as there was no wait. For appetizers, we ordered the smoked deviled eggs and both agreed they had too much vinegar for our liking. The hushpuppies with sweet tea butter were fantastic. For entrees, my wife ordered the the two piece white fried chicken while I ordered the chicken tenders. Her chicken was good & moist, but my tenders were overcooked and very dry. The sweet potato dumplings were bland and heavy, while the mac n cheese was lacking in taste. I was hoping the banana pudding would save the day as it is my favorite dessert. Alas, it was not very good. Both of us thought the whipped topping was very salty. I mentioned it to our server, who investigated and removed it from our bill.   We were hoping this would be a place to take friends, but I don't think it is worthy of a second chance. It's too bad as I had really high hopes."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Haberdish.  No wait to sit outside on a Sunday night.  The homemade pickles and fried chicken were outstanding.  The cocktail list was very creative, and the The Honey Bee and the Buzzing Monk is a must-try drink.  Kevin was a great waiter...he was very enthusiastic and friendly and took the time to answer all our questions and explain the menu in detail."}
{"text":"everything wa incredible. You do not want to miss out. I would definitely reccomed their cocktails."}
{"text":"Love this place! Comfy environment, great drinks, amazing food! The menu isn't huge, but what they do have on it is excellently done! Like a southern food tapas (small plate), crafty cocktail drink list kinda place. Drinks were amazing (black manhattan). Fried Chicken was incredible! Mac and cheese with fried chicken skins, kale salad, and my favorite was the Smoked deviled eggs!  I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing. We had a hard time picking what to eat; everything looked delicious!! Our waitress was very attentive and quick to help with suggestions. The only drawback is they don't take reservations - but you can use an app called No Wait to \"get in line\". Atmosphere is cozy, fun and kid friendly."}
{"text":"Really tasty food and drinks. The fried chicken is amazing and the sides were all terrific. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"There are two restaurants in Charlotte that feed both the body and the soul - Haberdish is one of them.  First off, kudos to the creative name: the haberdashery of quality dishes. \"Haberdish.\"  The fried chicken is perfection. I thought another restaurant in town had the best overall chicken, but Haberdish is, hands down, better in every way.  The sides are on a whole 'nother level. I'm an avowed carnivore/omnivore, but their side dishes are so good that they may make you forget the chicken. Try all of them.  The sweet potato dumplings are a show-stopper - butter, sage... just glut yourself. You won't regret it.  The cornbread pudding is like the sweet, delicious, southern Jiffy cornbread staple but turned up so much that Spinal Tap would be jealous.  The cocktails are delicious and well-made, so Haberdish can double as a good place to catch the spirit(s) while chilling at the bar.  I hate writing this review because I'll rue the day that getting in here will be damned difficult. Parking is already a problem (it's NoDa, so that's not Haberdish's fault), so be sure to Uber/Lyft/cab it out there.  In conclusion, it's my and my fiancée's favorite restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I ran across Haberdish via the \"Nowait\" app.  My boyfriend is always in search of the best fried chicken- so we decided to give it a shot for Sunday brunch.  We started off with the biscuits & bacon jam.  The bacon jam was so meaty and delicious, it was great.  The biscuits were ok- while beautiful and golden brown on the outside, they were in fact slightly under baked.  This should have been foreshadowing...  For the main course we both opted for the chicken and waffles (you can select your chicken- we both opted for 2pc white).  The chicken was good- juicy, crispy fried skin, very good fried chicken - I think it could be improved with a bit more seasoning.  I just wish our server had offered us the hot sauce!!  In fact, I think it would be pretty cool if you could choose a dip (i.e. offer \"hot chicken\").   The waffle- it's a traditional liege-style waffle batter that is more of a dough base.  My issue was- both of our waffles were egregiously undercooked: the outsides were a beautiful brown/caramel color and the insides were raw dough (which according to our server is how they are meant to be??? Raw dough??? Ok...I know raw dough when I see it...).    We'll return- perhaps it was a rough morning- and we'll probably just stick to the fried things. :)"}
{"text":"We went around 6pm on a Friday night. Everything was fantastic! We did the deviled eggs and hush puppies for an app-both were so good. Our table ordered everything from the pork shank to the chicken tenders. All of it was excellent. Banana pudding dessert was amazing. Our waitress and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Atmosphere inside is cozy and decor is cool. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Haberdish on Dec 21 and loved it! We are big fans of the Crepe Cellar, and couldn't wait to try Jeff Tonidandel's newest restaurant. My husband had the pork shank, which was smokey and tasty, but would have liked for it to be served with a sauce to keep the meat moist. The macaroni and cheese was rich and delicious but not what he expected. He assumed it would be a baked dish, but this was more like a pasta with cream sauce. I had the trout and okra, both of which were outstanding. The menu is limited, and we were surprised there was no main dish of beef. We loved the ambiance and lighting of the restaurant. The service was spot on, friendly, warm, and helpful. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cool hipster place. This dishes are very rich and fatty, so don't go there if you are on a healthy diet. I love the cauliflower stakes and charred okra. Kale salad is also very tasty. The portions are very big, so don't over order."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Had to wait a little bit for a table, but the food was worth it!  Good portion sizes and really great drinks!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and ordered a few things and not did a one disappoint. I got the mac and cheese, I recommend this stuff. When the waitress asked if I wanted it topped with chicken skins I said, \"Hell yes\". The okra with bacon jam was delicious and gave me my vegetable macros for the day, gotta keep my diet balanced says my wife. The fried chicken tenders were PHENOMENAL, at first I was skeptical as usually I elect bone-in when available but my friend ordered them so sans bone I ate. Put your name on the list but wait for a bar spot to open if you don't want to wait, we were in and out on a Saturday night in an hour and a half."}
{"text":"New favorite place in Noda. Was a pleasant experience from start to finish. Food was so flavorful and reasonably priced. We got the pimento cheese, smoked & fried chicken. Kale salad was yummy! The waitress was excellent and frequently checked on us and refilled water. Luckily we checked in on No Wait... the wait was 2 hours when we arrived. Only thing was- it was a chilly night and they had the large door to the patio open which took away from the coziness. Will definitely be back (with a jacket)!"}
{"text":"The wait was really long and there seemed to be confusion from the restaurant about who was getting seated next.  Our server was really good.  The food came out very quickly and hot.  The deviled eggs were amazing as was the brined chicken,  I would get that again.  The chicken tenders (not your typical tenders) were also really really good.  I would t recommend the safe sweet potato dumplings,  they had very little flavored and came in a pool of grease.  Craft drinks were good too.  Had the mint julep which was great.  Prices for food were also really reasonable.    Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go on a limb and arguably say this... some of the best fried chicken in Charlotte; and I'm a Charlotte native. Very nice ambiance. The menu is nice, the specials are as well. The homemade condiments are amazing. Definitely try the macaroni&cheese and brussel sprouts. My only negative would be that they do not take reservations so get there early to avoid the wait or download the app \"No Wait\"."}
{"text":"I couldn't have loved Haberdish more! My new favorite place to eat and imbibe!  Let's start with getting a seat. Use your Yelp app (or your wife/husband's) and get on the wait list. How long is the wait? Depends. You won't mind. Go browse the great shops in Noda while you wait or grab a drink elsewhere.  Haberdish is a restaurant that gets it...and will continue to get faithful swarms of customers that love a restaurant that gets it.  The inside is spacious and appropriately lit for a jovial celebration or a romantic (albeit a bit boisterous on the weekend) dinner. There is a coastal Italian feel to the place that feels airy and light.  The food...oh the food! Let me get one thing out of the way. I don't think adults should ever order chicken fingers. It's just a thing with me. Pull them britches up and order chicken on the bone. There I said it...and will probably keep saying it.   That being said...I am always prepared to challenge my assumptions and assertions in every facet of my life. We ordered some chicken fingers...GASP!!  What did I just do? Ugh...regret pouring in...and the shame...oh the shame... boatloads of shame...day after day...more of the same...UGH....sorry!  Great service! Didn't trigger the chicken finger shaming. Great service!  Holy...What! How can this adults kid menu item be so delicious? As a good friend from back home would say...\"It's the Dippin Sauce.\" He's right! The chicken is insanely good...but it's the fact that you will finish your chicken strips before you ever decide which \"dippin sauce\" you like best. Fantastic! I will now allow you to \"not\" be judged by me for eating chicken fingers...at least here...lol.  Here's what else we had...and I'll spare you the lengthy gushfest...because you won't need it. Selling you on a kids menu item needed a bit of a sell.  The biscuit and bacon jam. You heard biscuit and bacon...right? Sweet potato dumplings...an odd addition...but good nonetheless. The mac'n'cheese was good...but I'm not replacing Aunt Jennifer's recipe with it. I can't remember if we had anything else...I was food-drunk halfway through the meal.  Ohh...almost forgot...the drinks. All of the cocktails (not that I had all of them...or did I?) were homeruns (sorry about the football talk)! Spot on and unique! The beer selection was nice...but I see room for improvement.  Lastly...come here. It's very reasonably priced. It's comfortable and delicious!  Try: The hushpuppies...I forgot to mention them. The best...yes...best I've ever had!  Avoid: Not a thing"}
{"text":"Some of the best fried chicken I have tasted in the south! Excellent house pickled veggies, made daily! Oh, and that delicious mac and cheese..."}
{"text":"Great food and energy! The menu is pretty eclectic but common. The patio was heated so that was nice as long as the employees remembered to close the door! I'd go back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been there 3 or 4 times in the last month, this place is GREAT..not going into each individual item because it doesn't matter what you order the food is good. We eat out almost every meal and this is now our favorite place...and if it's possible the service is better than the food...great people. I strongly recommend this place. The bartenders are great servers are great the managers are great.....and we never order dessert but my girlfriend ordered some for take out just to see if it held up to the rest of the food Lemon meringue pie...Damn that became her new boyfriend for the evening....."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place on Yelp and to be honest it did not live up to the expectations. Our soup was luke warm, we ordered the deviled eggs which were okay, we also ordered the smokey boiled peanuts which were really good. Next was a 1/2 chicken, Mac and cheese, carrots, sweet potatoes, and okra. All in all it was very good but it wasn't great. There really wasn't any wow factor i.e. something that would make us want to come back. Our bill was $100, not really sure it was worth all that."}
{"text":"Great spot in NoDa w/a charming, hip decor. Busy on weekends (expect a 30-60 min wait). Some dishes border on the rich or heavily fried side, but the chicken is memorably good & Haberdish is deserving of its popularity."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been debating about going to Haberdish but just haven't had the time to go until a few nights ago and I'm glad we did! We started out with the biscuits and bacon jam which was pretty good, but the real treat came when our main entrées arrived. We got the smoked chicken, a few chicken tenders, mac & cheese with chicken skins, sweet potato dumplings and the slaw. The smoked chicken had an amazing Alabama sauce covering it that paired really well with the smoked chicken flavor but didn't overpower it. For dessert we had the waffle. They were out of the buttermilk ice cream so we substituted the daily special peach ice cream and that worked pretty well. I honestly tried to pick out my favorite portion of the meal and I can't do it. No matter what we had it was all very good, and I can't wait to go back and try even more!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been wanting to try and it did not disappoint.  Went for brunch and ordered the arugula quiche with wilted kale salad.  Delicious twist on brunch classics.  I couldn't resist and added the biscuits with sweet tea butter...flaky and so fulfilling.  Great service.  Beautiful space and great vibe!  Will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have big parties and share plates. All of the sides are so delicious and the cocktails are really unique. You can't go wrong.   Favorite thing on the menu: Tie between Mac and cheese and kale salad."}
{"text":"This place came recommended, but the food and experience didn't match the hype. Over-salted trout, burnt to blackened corn pudding bread, and strange combo of ingredients for the carrots. Biscuits were very good. Chicken was good. Beer menu is small and fairly bland."}
{"text":"Haberdish has been on our food bucket list for such a long time. Saturday evening we decided to do a Noda date night and check it out! Such an amazing experience.  The wait was long but we put our names on No Wait and bar hopped around Noda while we waited. When we finally arrived for our seating, we had to move tables since the AC vent was leaking condensation on my head. The waiter was super gracious about it and moved us without worries or a fuss.  For drinks I got the Mint Julep and my husband got a beer. The Mint Julep was absolutely delicious and a beautiful presentation with the shaved ice.   To start, we ordered the biscuits and bacon jam. It was more like bacon jam gravy as it covered the biscuits. An order came with two and they were absolutely delicious. In addition, we ordered 3 chicken tenders (they are sold individually which was cool), the hot side of the day (a squash casserole), mac n cheese, and sweet potato dumplings. Out of this list, I have a really hard time picking my favorite. The chicken was cooked so nicely. The dumplings had this butter taste that just made the dish. The squash casserole was such a surprise and well seasoned. The mac n cheese was everything we expected plus a bit more. We got smalls on everything and were both able to have a full plate of food.   I was also surprised with the price to value. Our total bill with drinks and tip came to around $50.   We will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Haberdish is just the right vibe every Charlotte neighborhood needs. Indoor/outdoor seating, community and personal table options, long bar with unique drinks such as \"Red Flower\" and \"Love Potion\" aperitifs and \"Luck be the Lady\" spirit. Great wine bottle prices too- i.e. California Pinot noir as low as $25.   We tried the deviled eggs and hush puppies for apps. The eggs have a hint of bacon or bologna? taste- very unique. The hush puppies are out of this world!!!! Melt in your mouth with the best batter imaginable.   For the main course, we had the fried chicken tenders, Mac n Cheese with fried chicken skins, and charred okra with bacon jam. For dipping sauce, we had ranch and honey mustard. I recommend the ranch bc the honey mustard was more so a honey Dijon which is not what I prefer with chicken tenders. Chicken was meaty with a great batter, the skins in the Mac and cheese was delicious and made your spoon keep coming back for more, and any okra lover will adore Haberdish's version.   And the great thing is- you can order small or large sides depending on how you want to share. The small side is definitely big enough for two people! And the chicken tenders are priced per tender, so get as few or as many as you would like. For me, one tender was enough with all the apps and sides we had- just to at least get a taste of their famous fried chicken.  Excellent restaurant! We will be back."}
{"text":"Holy crap is this place AMAZING!     you must go here.   I am not kidding.... amazing."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Haberdish after hearing everyone rave about it, but I was underwhelmed. Admittedly, I take my food very seriously and expect to be wowed when I go out (yes my expectations are high, but there are several places in Charlotte that wow me...unfortunately, Haberdish is not one of them)."}
{"text":"Fantastic local joint that hit the nail on the head for fine southern cuisine. Especially if fried chicken is a favorite of yours. The brined, fried chicken is crispy and oh so delicious, throw on a bit of their hot sauce and bam. Every side dish we tried, and we almost tried them all, was stellar, meaning star like in and of itself. If you try one and you don't like it take your taste buds to the doctor for a check up. Lastly, eat dessert in waffle form! Keep Pounding and eat great in Charlotte by dropping by this NoDa spot."}
{"text":"Oh my, oh my - Haberdish is the best food experience I've had in North Carolina.  I travel here for work a couple of times a month and always like to try new places and neighborhoods, when I do.    Tonight's adventure brought us to NoDa, my favorite of the neighborhoods.  It's only a few blocks worth of real estate but NoDa packs alot of interesting shops, breweries and dining spots into it's footprint.    Haberdish has a stylish but sparse decor and an expansive bar in the main room.  We sat in the heated patio area which was very comfortable in spite of a chill in the air - I imagined that the outside table options would be bustling on a warm night.  Carolina was our server and she was excellent - she gave us a brief tour of the menu and highlighted a few cocktails and dishes that Haberdish is known for.     We started out with a glass of Proseco and a Negroni cocktail - not one of their signature cocktails but expertly made, nonetheless.  I loved the glassware and the whimsical touches they added, my second cocktail had a carnation frozen into the ice sphere and a bunch of babies-breath clothes-pinned to the edge of the glass.    Our food choices included the Cheese Straws as a starter - they were tasty with a good amount of jalapeno.  We also tried the Chicken Tenders with some Kale Grits and the Savory Corn Bread Pudding as our sides.  I'm sure we were drawing some very strange looks from the surrounding tables as we dove into the first few bites of our food...everything was so delicious our eyes were rolling back in our heads!!  The tenders were large, we ordered four and couldn't finish them all.  The small versions of the side dishes were also very generous for two people to share.  We didn't want to overdo it so we could order the Buttermilk ice cream for dessert - it was also spectacular!  I will be back in Charlotte for another business trip in two weeks and you can bet, Haberdish will be on the agenda - I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was a cute spot to visit but since we sat outdoors the flies were a bit of a problem but I think cooler season it would be fantastic  The sweet potato dumpling was simply gross  All other items we had were tasty"}
{"text":"Great food. Wonderful staff. Lovely ambience."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I was blown away at how much I enjoyed this place because this is not the typical menu style that I go for. Went for brunch and had chicken and waffles - fried chicken is NOT usually my jam but oh my goodness they do it so well. It was flavorful, juicy and not greasy and I loved the ethical healthy sourced chicken. And the waffle was the best I've ever had!! We had great service, the atmosphere is very nice and the covered patio is perfect for a pleasant afternoon meal. Also will add we were very pleased with the drinks"}
{"text":"Wish I had gotten a chance to TRY Haberdish!  Planned to go with some friends on Dec. 20th - following the instructions on the recorded message on the restaurant phone, we downloaded the wait list app they recommended and were advised of a 15-to-25 minute wait time and told what time we should be at the restaurant so as not to lose our place in line.  We arrived promptly at the designated time, and, after the hostess scanned electronically what looked like a huge list of names, she advised us that it would be another 30-35 minutes before we could be seated. Although they have no designated seating area for waiting, we found space at the bar....and waited....and waited.  After 35 minutes, I approached the hostess again to ask if we were making progress.  At that time, she informed me that the wait list app was not working correctly and had given us a much shorter time frame for a table than what the reality was and that it would be \"at least\" another 30-45 minutes before we could be seated (making for a total wait time after adding our name to the list of over an hour).  Of course,  our party of five left and went elsewhere, taking our appetites and money with us.  On a positive note, the two appetizers we had at the bar - charred okra and hush puppies - were delicious and I would love to try more of Haberdish's cuisine - but not until they work out the kinks in or totally discard the wait list app they recommend. The phone message is quite misleading; the messages the app sends regarding wait time are, as well.  And, in our case, it led to a most disappointing experience.  My advice would be to discontinue recommending a system that doesn't work, and either start taking reservations or simply say you don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Haberdish has reinvented what a hushpuppy and a tatertot should taste like - their version is out of this world amazing!!   The menu is very limited. More small bites, chicken, chicken, trout, pork shank and more chicken. There is one vegetarian option (cauliflower steak).   I have not tried a drink yet but their list is very extensive and lots of variety.  The staff has a long way to go in being comfortable with the menu - they were very hesitant and couldn't make the best recommendations - understandable considering they opened a little over a month ago.   Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal at Haberdish!! My husband and I shared the quarter chicken, biscuits, okra, pork and mac.  It was all delicious!! Cocktails were on point and don't forget banana pudding for dessert! Highly recommend a break from being healthy and treat yourself to a meal here."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Highly recommend the smoked chicken. Cocktails were awesome, sat on the enclosed outdoor patio and loved it!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  I had been seeing this restaurant all over social media so I was really interested to see if it was actually worth the hype or just another trendy Charlotte restaurant with high prices and mediocre food. Very glad to report that the food was delicious and the prices actually aren't that bad (besides the drinks)!   We were immediately sat on a Wednesday night around 8.  Still a happening place, but not overly crowded. Really nice atmosphere with simple industrial decor. We ordered the Mac and cheese, two tenders, kale salad, hush puppies, and deviled eggs.  We got all the small plates and it was plenty of food for us to feel satisfied.  I really liked it all, but was most surprised about how good the kale salad ended up being.  With so many other unhealthy/delicious options it was a bit hard to order kale, but it was super great with goat cheese and some delicious crunchy topping.  I'm of the mindset that Mac and cheese and fried chicken are always good, but I do think theirs may be above average.  The Mac and cheese was super creamy and the honey mustard for the chicken was amazing!  Deviled eggs were good, but as a deviled egg connoisseur, I do feel that they could have used a little more spice or something to help them not be as basic.    Only complaint would probably be the price of the drinks.  We got two drinks and the drinks almost ended up being the same price of our entire meal when we got our bill.  I got the red flower which I wouldn't recommend as it is just basically a small glass of champagne with a flower in it.  I only ordered it bc I thought it was going to have this fancy ice flower in it that I saw on Instagram, but I was sadly mistaken.  Apparently you have to ask for the fancy ice flower (next time I will be prepared!!).  Overall it would be nice if they had some cheaper drink options or at least drink specials like most restaurant do during the week, but I do plan on going back and can't wait to try the okra and cauliflower.  Oh, and for brunch!"}
{"text":"From Pennsylvania and wanted some good fried chicken. Everything including the pickles were tasty. The fried chicken was perfectly crisp. I got the biscuit sandwich, and tator tots."}
{"text":"Great place! Environment was awesome. Food is eclectic and very good. This is not a cheap place be prepared to spend some dollars. Drinks were expensive as well. All in all a great experience"}
{"text":"Haberdish es un lugar sensacional no te puedes perder de ir a comer sus ricos platillos  ala carta es un ambiente agradable con buena atención"}
{"text":"The pan seared trout was out of this world! Beautifully crispy skin and simple, clean seasoning-lovely!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! My partner and I always get the a la carte chicken tenders and then 2-3 sides and its more than enough food. Delicious Mac and cheese, biscuits, and bread pudding. Drinks are pricey, but if you're craving comfort food, eat here. Use the No Wait app to avoid the really long wait times. Or at least have more control over how you wait."}
{"text":"Good food. Limited menu. Tapas style. Try the fried chicken! Cute atmosphere and great cocktails."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed here. Called ahead and asked if they were pet friendly with out door seating. They responded with yes, we have a covered patio and fully outdoor seating. We arrive (two of us and my dog) and get seated outside, although it is clearly about to rain. Before she was even done setting up our table, I asked the hostess what we would do if it started to rain. She went inside to ask a manager and told us that if it started to rain we could (the humans) could move to the patio, but since the patio was no dogs allowed, the dog would have to stay outside. I brought to her attention that no one else was sitting on the patio and that would mean tying my dog up in the rain, and if that was the case we would be leaving. She said she understood, so we left.   Two stars because I'm sure the food is good. My dog is a service animal, but I didn't feel like retrieving her papers since clearly they were strongly opposed, as she was not allowed to come onto the (outdoor, but covered) patio, even in the event of thunder and lightings."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We decided to give Haberdish a try on a Sunday around 9:30PM, so it wasn't too busy. Waitress was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.   I had a few simple, but not so simple dishes. Macaroni and cheese with crispy chicken skins. It was absolutely delicious. I also had the pimeno cheese ball with spiced pecans. It was served with thin sliced apples and crackers, also amazing.   I was very satisfied with the service, food and the overall experience Haberdish had to offer."}
{"text":"Came here after hiking in Smoky mountain. Sooooo goood! The okra, broccoli steak, fried chicken are the highlights. The atmosphere is great too!"}
{"text":"Outstanding decor, food and service. We came here for a birthday party and everyone loved this restaurant.  The menu is exactly as advertised - it was like southern style favorites with a high end flare.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best. Fried. Chicken. Ever. This place is a Charlotte gem and is a personal favorite of mine. The interior is well decorated, clean, and the staff has always been super nice and welcoming. This place is very popular so the wait can get a little long but there is so much to see around the neighborhood that the time will fly if you explore a bit while you wait. Their fried chicken is cooked and seasoned to perfection while always being super juicy. The Mac n Cheese with crispy chicken skins is a must have. The fried okra is amazing and it's truly hard to cook well without it being slimy but Haberdish does it very well. The banana pudding is extremely good but needs a bit more cookies in it ( I personally like a lot of vanilla wafers in mine but to each their own). The bar also are on point with their drinks and never skimp on the booze. All in all a definite A+."}
{"text":"Great take on southern cuisine. Our favorite is the chicken tenders. Great sides. It's a neat place and their chicken is amazing. Atmosphere is really cool. Been a few times and always enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. And the restaurant itself is gorgeous, casual but super well designed."}
{"text":"I really can't believe that I've not reviewed Haberdish yet!  OMG!  I've been here at least four times in the past year for brunch, and all I can say is WOW... Every time is a wonderful experience!   The fried chicken tenders are amazing as are all of their homemade dips... I've had a ton of their sides... share with a friend, they're big and delicious... Their biscuits are on point... and (though I could do with slightly less of it on my plate) the bacon jam is unique and yummy!  Let's not forget their Counter Culture coffee (always a favorite) and their spectacularly crafted cocktails... I had a mint julep the last time I was there... in true Kentucky Derby fashion it was GOOD and STRONG... You won't be sorry!!  If you're looking for a place to share a cozy and delicious meal with good friends (old or new), give Haberdish a try!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and atmosphere! Grateful for the vegetarian menu and the waitstaff is very nice! I had cauliflower steak and the Mac and cheese! It was GREAT!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in NoDa and at Haberdish! I was impressed as soon as I walked in with the ambiance. It's an old warehouse style with all the fancy industrial finishes. My waiter Aaron was very attentive and explained the a la carte menu very well. I opted for the hush puppies, 2 piece dark meet, and kale grits! Let's just say I cleaned my plate! I highly recommend Haberdish."}
{"text":"No doubt, the best fried chicken I've ever had. You can really taste the pickle brine and it's delicious. Hush puppies are the lightest, most fluffy HPs I've tasted. Mac and cheese was good but the chicken stole the show. Tip: checkin online using their app, the wait can be brutal."}
{"text":"My husband thinks the food is ok I think that I tried it and don't have to go again service was great atmosphere was great food not so great also the chairs are not for anyone who has any type of back side very uncomfortable if you have hips or a butt"}
{"text":"Love this place! My family meets here about once a month- the food is amazing! Must try the okra and mac & cheese.  My favorite thing about the menu is that you can order chicken tenders individually- they are pretty big chicken tenders so between sharing all the side dishes, one is usually enough for me.  The cocktails are also delicious! The punch bowl is perfect for a table of four to share. I haven't tried their brunch yet but I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"So.....apparently you cannot make reservations.  If you want to try and schedule a dinner you have to use the Nowait app. You can only check in if you are within 10 miles of the location.   My wife and I tried to go to Haberdish on a Saturday for a post Valentines Day dinner. We checked in when we were 10 miles away from the location. There were already 41 people ahead of us! We left our house at 6pm. The suggested arrival time was 7:35pm.   We arrived and checked in at the restaurant. We were told it was going to be an hour wait, consistent with the Nowait app. However, at 8:30pm, there were still 8 parties ahead of us!   This location is only for people who live in NoDa and can check in right when they get off of work. They really need to reconsider allowing people to make reservations, otherwise it is a poor business model."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch with coworkers and loved it from the moment we stepped inside. If I could have fit the whitewashed tables and the really cool stool seating in my purse, I would have gone home with some (just kidding, I'm not a thief). We got the hush puppies to share - crispy on the outside and warm and delicious on the inside, and the butter was amazing. The homemade tater tots are equally as good! The habonero sauce is delicious! I got the deviled eggs topped with trout and the coleslaw. Perhaps a weird combo but it was perfect. Service was outstanding! My water glass never got half empty. I will definitely be back to try more menu items and to try something stronger than water : ) I hear the cocktails are great."}
{"text":"We met some friends in Charlotte recently and wanted to try a new spot of course. She sent me a list of 6 places, we chose Haberdish. The pics and reviews were so enticing. It was an excellent choice. I will admit, I was taken aback by the small menu. But that shows confidence, and they have a little something to be confident about.  We ordered hush puppies for the table - and then we ordered another round. They were so so so good.  I went off the rails with my order, I had liver mush toast and a side of okra. Most of my friends know I love ordering from the appetizer menu, I'm not sure why - but I do. My husband had the smoked chicken. And we ordered macaroni for the little one. Disclaimer - The only reason we order her a meal is because it came with milk. It's usually a waste of money because she eats our food. She did not eat the mac and cheese, but my husband ate it. Our friends ordered the half fried chicken, kale grits, the mac and cheese with bacon crumbles. I tasted the grits. They were ssoooo good. My mouth is starting to water right now, hmm go figure.  Also, I love the decor and feel of this restaurant (just had to throw that in).  Would I try this place again, absolutely. Would I recommend it, also-freakin-lately, oh and I have recommended it several times.  Sorry, I completely forgot to say - great wait staff!!!  Parking is tight in the NoDa area. But it's still worth the trip. Besides once you find a space you should just walk around and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Pork shank out of this world!! Barbecue sauce is amazing. Corn pudding a bit greasy but ok. Mac and cheese was tastey!! The atmosphere is really nice. When the doors are open it will be awesome!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new-ish places in town! The wait can sometimes be daunting, but it's worth the wait. Food is awesome, and the bar is great too! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and recommend their fried chicken and smoked chicken along with some smaller dishes such as okra with bacon jam."}
{"text":"Best food I've eaten in forever.  I went with a group of five and we got just about one of everything in the menu and shared.  There was not one thing I could complain about.  Quantities will not disappoint."}
{"text":"HABERDISH.  First dinner my girlfriend and I went to after moving to Charlotte. Boy, did we pick a great place to make our introduction to our new city.  Since we live in NoDa, it was a quick walk to the restaurant since its right on North Davidson. It was poppin on a Thursday night and we asked to sit outside. There's a good bit of seating out front and a ton inside, and then to the left of the main dining area there is a sort of inside/outside eating area that is semi-enclosed by a roof, but gives you all the feeling of sitting outside except the sun in your face.   I started off with the Besame Tequila cocktail that was pretty to look at AND delicious. Sometimes you don't get both! It was very sweet, and might not have gone too well with the food we ended up ordering, but oh well.   My girlfriend and I ordered the biscuits with bacon jam, friend chicken tenders (we are obviously children), kale grits, and hushpuppies with sweet tea butter.  Hands down the best thing was the biscuits with bacon jam. The \"jam\" was literally pieces of bacon mixed with God knows what that was smothered all. over. the biscuits. It was amazing. 10/10 would bacon jam again.  The hushpuppies were fried to perfection and the sweet tea butter was damn good. I'd eat that on any kind of bread.  Chicken tenders, very solid. It came with four different dipping sauces which is always a plus.They're also sold individually so you don't get pigeonholed into ordering too much and can still order different things from the menu!  My only slight gripe was the kale grits. Maybe we got a \"meh\" batch, but they definitely needed some salt or some sort of salty cheese. They were still good, just lacked as much flavor as the rest of the dishes. Maybe that was the intent? I'm not sure, but I like my grits' flavor to hit me in the face.  Overall, the food combined with the ambience, and the great service, i would 100% recommend this place if you want some damn good southern cooking. Can't wait to go back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the  restaurant exterior and interior.  The food was excellent.  The kale salad is so refreshing and the sweet potatoes dumpling were absolutely delicious! Must go while in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The hushpuppies with sweet tea butter to start was a great way for us to start the night. The fried chicken was delicious - seasoned and crisped perfectly. But the winner of the night was the waffle and ice cream for dessert! Save room!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to get back to this spot. The atmosphere and vibe is amazing. Love love love the patio seating. Our service was spot on. Server gave great recommendations. The Pork Shank was definitely my favorite dish on the table. I don't think I can ever not order it. Chicken and waffles was great. Waffles was a surprise with the sugar crystals embedded in the waffle. They don't call it a Sugar Waffle for no reason. Sides are great too. Did I mention the atmosphere is super cool? Cause it is."}
{"text":"Good food but the flies were just bothering, service was slow and awful. And we had to send back one dishes because the chicken was way too bloody"}
{"text":"Ate here two weeks ago with a group of 6 and look forward to returning.  We had two cocktails a ginger drink and a punch, can't recall the name.  Both were good, but the ginger was the best.    Most everyone at the table had fried chicken except me.  I am not a big chicken person, but I tried my husband's and it was very good.  We started with cheese straws.  Normally I don't like things like that because they taste fake cheesy, but these did not.  They were very good.  I shared a ton of sides and all were great: Kale grits-one of my favorites Carrots w/ goat cheese - a special that night, good glad I tried it  mac 'n cheese- it is mac 'n cheese it is delish corn bread pudding-definitely would get again brussel sprout salad special-this was good and I love garlic but it was a little too garlicy for me  I wouldn't go here if I was trying to eat healthy, but it was great comfort food!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back! Recommend the fried chicken tenders with all the homemade sauces!! The Alabama white sauce is amazing! My party ordered most of the sides and the group favorite was the sweet potato dumplings and hush puppies!! Everything was delicious and relatively average priced! Will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Food was a little different from what I expected mainly the sides but the chicken is awesome. Expect to wait awhile on a Saturday night. But it's worth it. Can't wait to go back and try their drinks."}
{"text":"The kale salad was awesome! Much of the food is good, but mac&cheese is just meh. Good atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Love the Haberdish. I was in N.C. visiting relatives and the haberdish came up in one of my searches of places to eat. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This was my BIG Fat Tuesday meal. Like my \"treat yo self\" to one of everything on the menu meals...and I'm pissed I didn't love it as much as I expected!   After reading all the amazing reviews I knew it was going to blow my mind. And well that just didn't happen for me. Now, don't her me wrong there were definitely some winners from my meal but overall I was a bit disappointed.  Here's everything we ordered:  Hush puppies Deviled eggs Chicken tenders (with alllll the sauces)  Cauliflower Steak Sweet potato dumplings Mac and cheese - with chicken skins  See what I mean...give me everything on the menu.   The big wins for me were the hush puppies and the mac and cheese with chicken skins. The hush puppies were light and fluffy and the sweet tea butter was excellent! And the mac and cheese was classic - all the flavors were there! But adding the spicy chicken skins totally won me over! Honestly, I should have just asked for a large order  of this for my dinner.   The deviled eggs and chicken tenders were average. Not too special for me but they weren't bad at all. However the only sauces that I really liked were the ranch and bbq. But shout out to the sauces all being made in house!   The things I didn't love were the cauliflower steak and the sweet potato dumplings. The flavors weren't there in the cauliflower for me. The fried chicken coating was too bland for me. And the dumplings just weren't what I expected. I'll chalk that up as to me not reading the menu description.   Oh well.   The service was good. The food just wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"Haberdish is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. It is (dangerously) close to my house, and we've been visiting on a weekly basis since they opened. The food and cocktails are always exceptional, the ambiance/vibe is perfect, and all the servers are super friendly. Must trys: chicken, okra, tater tots, mac n cheese, and well the whole menu really. I can't say enough good things about Haberdish!"}
{"text":"The food was beyond delicious and the beer selection wasn't too shabby either.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the server (while very polite and nice) was not very attentive at all.  Had a great time though."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The kale salad is amazing, I'm also obsessed with the cauliflower steak!  The drinks are well priced and delicious! One of my favorite brunch spots around."}
{"text":"You.  Must. Go. Here.  I had the ever-elusive experience of a food-rection last night, and I will not be seeing a medical professional if it last longer than 4 hours.  Hush Puppies - Yes.  Smoked Chicken - Hell yes.  Sweet Potato Dumplings - F**k Yes.  Okra w/ Bacon relish - Howard Dean-style 'Byaaaaa!!!!'"}
{"text":"If you don't love this place you are crazy . The decor is beautiful,  the food is mouth watering and the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Vying for top restaurant in Charlotte, IMO, and could compete handily in many a big city market. I have yet to find a weakness on this menu, and prices are extremely reasonable for the quality. As my husband put it, this place cooks and mixes cocktails with confidence. Bravo."}
{"text":"Best southern food especially the fried chicken! Nice service. Drinks were excellent."}
{"text":"I loooooove the chicken tenders, and Mac and cheese (with skins), and okra here. Oh my goodness. It melts in your mouth and you just need to keep eating. They also have vegetarian and vegan options which was great for my other team members needing those. It is a magical place."}
{"text":"Our group of four visited on a Saturday mid-afternoon. We sat outside. The inside was decorated farmhouse chic and with the sun shining we opted for under the pergola outside. We had several craft beers and one of our group ordered a bourbon drink with an orange finish which we all sipped because it was delightful. We had one half fried chicken, one half brined smoked chicken, a 2 piece white fried chicken and a pork shank. All entrees were excellent. Moist, flavorful and tasty. We had sides of charred okra ( super good), mac and cheese (very good) and tater tots. My only slight ding is a personal issue with the tots. Since I've never had home-made tots I must be crazy because I like the Ore-Ida store bought slightly better. The Ore-Ida seemed to have more potato flavor. It seems illogical that in-house is less flavor than mass produced so I didn't deduct any stars because it makes no sense. Must be me. I felt like the prices were worth the fare....no issue. A satisfying meal. Oh, our server was excellent. We didn't see her a great deal but we didn't require much from her after the food was dropped off."}
{"text":"Very cool spot. Hope this makes it. Interior design very well done. Awesome \"indoor/outdoor patio.\" Food is solid, plus. Everyone seemed to like fried chicken. Mac and cheese was okay. Potatoes tasted like air, but again interesting. Definitely stop in. Good stuff. Very eclectic menu for Charlotte - a refreshing change."}
{"text":"Very trendy restaurant in NODA, and always crowded. I just came with my dog, and we sat on the front patio watching people come and go. The Southern menu is comparable to food you'd find in Charleston... I was highly satisfied. 2 chicken tenders  ($2.50 each) and a side will fill you up for right around $10. You can't go wrong. The cocktail menu is extensive and they have great wine selection. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Haberdish has been on the bucket list for a LONG time but he stars have never alligned for a meal there. We finally made it in for a late Saturday lunch when we had some guests in town. First impression was I love the openness of it and the covered patio on the side. The walls are made of brick and beautiful wide tables. We started with the bacon jam biscuits and hushpuppies. Both are great \"southern\" Foods and they know how to do them right. The bacon jam is more of a marinade, with nice crunchy chunks of bacon over the fluffy biscuits. The hush puppies are served with a sweet tea butter, which looks like tuna fish but tastes amazing and soft.   Both appetizers were enjoyed by our group. The menu is very small, which is my only complaint. I'm not sure if the dinner menu is bigger, but it's basically fried chicken, fried cauliflower steaks and a bunch of side options. So, obviously this place doesn't attract those who don't love fried chicken.   The fried chicken is very good. You can order tenders (2.50 each) or half chicken. Sides include Mac n cheese, kale salad, biscuits, and a few other options. We tried the Kale salad and Mac n cheese. I also have the cauliflower steak a try, which is \"chicken fried\" with plenty of fried batter. It was okay, not my favorite but I was curious about it and wanted to give it a try.  They have an amazing and extensive cocktail list, with various creative and craft choices. I went with the seasonal doc porters vodka base with watermelon juice. Delicious! We all loved the cocktails we tried. I'd love to come back for dinner or brunch but love the whole atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the menu is very limited. Drinks were okay, nothing too special. We had a group of 6 and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We tried to call ahead, they said they don't do call ahead seating. The whole time we waited there were two open 8 top tables. About fifteen minutes before they sat us, they sat two couples, one at each end of one of the 8 tops. Just seems like poor management/planning. The fried chicken itself was good, but I doubt I'll be back"}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte for a couple of years now and have been wanting to visit this place for a while now, so last Sunday my mom and I came for brunch and sat outside. Everything was amazing it was such a nice day out we had some mimosas and ordered quite a bit off the menu just to try as much as we could, our server was excellent, he explained the menu well and how the portion sizes worked which was very helpful. I had seen photos of the food on instagram and that made the anticipation of getting our meals even more. I was thrilled when our food came out looking exactly like the photos and wasn't just a nice look for the pictures (that's rare) the Mac and cheese was amazing we got the fried chicken skins on top and when it came out it had a spicy sauce on top and it was INCREDIBLE our server even gave us some to go! Everyone in Charlotte should be regulars here! It was outstanding!!! I love NoDa more and more now, keep it up guys thanks for making our visit so awesome!"}
{"text":"Went in for a late night snack and some drinks.  Overall atmosphere was lively and the food was very good.  The disappointing part was the lack of drinks available.  Being in Noda, I would expect more of a beer selection and the cocktail menu was underwhelming.  Overall, a good place for a late night snack but not much else."}
{"text":"Haberdish is a really great spot to go out for a girls night. The atmosphere is fun and yet you can still be casual. Be sure to get there early or put yourself on the list. Otherwise it's going to be a long wait and they don't take reservations. The chicken is pretty good as are most of the sides and appetizers. My personal favorites are the deviled eggs and the biscuits with bacon jam. The cocktails are really good and beautiful as well. Share a punch bowl if you are in a bigger group. Food can be kind of slow coming out but service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"AH-MAZING! If you are craving some good southern food stop in. The mac n cheese, biscuits and sweet potato dumplings were heavenly. Great fried chicken! Liver mush toast and the kale salad were the yummy surprise dishes of the night. Not one complaint. Definitely get the mint julep. Service was awesome and the decor was done right. DO NOT leave without trying the banana pudding. You're welcome. Btw this is in noda so expect to search for parking."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations for this place. I looked at their menu beforehand and wasn't interested. But boy was I wrong! My boyfriend really wanted to check this place out. He loves chicken and waffle, and we heard this place was famous for it, so we gave it a try. Because they had a small menu, I just ended up getting a kale salad, and it was so delicious! (I rarely say that kale about salads!) They didn't have \"chicken and waffles\" on the menu, but our server was kind enough to get that order for my boyfriend. His dark meat chicken was very tender and juicy. The waffle was so good that he had to order another one. We also ordered hush puppies (not pictured because we devoured it so quickly) and it was probably the best hush puppies I've ever had. In addition to the good food, service was really good and our server was always attentive. We will definitely be returning.   On a side note, my only complaint is that their menu isn't extensive enough. :("}
{"text":"To save you time reading all of this: SO good!  The service is great, interior design is super cool, you can tell that everything is very well thought out and there was a lot of love and effort put into it.  For the appetizers we ordered biscuits with bacon jam, which were amazing. Entrees were chicken and waffles. Not only they were delicious, and served with housemade habanero hot sauce, it was also a lot of food, for a very reasonable price. Also ordered banana pudding for dessert, very good too.  14$ cocktails are a bit much, in my opinion, but I don't drink, so it doesn't affect my impression of the restaurant.    Definitely coming back to try more food.  UPD: came back here for Mother's Day. The food was just as delicious and service was fast and friendly. This is definitely becoming one of my favorite Sunday brunch spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We had 5 people and ordered food for 10!  Every dish was excellent. None was bad in any way.  The best, however, were the Hushpuppies, NC Trout, Corn Bread Pudding, and the Blueberry Ice Cream.  All of the chicken dishes were very tasty and I would order any of them again (I am usually a Pescatarian by the way; the chicken was that good!).  We were torn on the Tater Tots and Mac n' Cheese, both of which were very tasty but not \"special\".  The Hushpuppies and Smoked Chicken were truly outstanding and worth coming back for (we live in Los Angeles, by the way!).  To top it all off, our Server (who could easily pass for Zoey Deschanel's Twin Sister!) was really attentive, friendly, and made us feel welcome.   In short, if you are ever in or near Charlotte, NC, get yourself over to NoDa (North Davidson, an old Mill Town converted to a hip and modern arts and culture district), you simply MUST go to Haberdish!"}
{"text":"Was so impressed with the service here! A group of six of us came for a birthday celebration and the waitress was so nice and accommodating. She answered our flurry of questions regarding the cocktails with a lot of knowledge and patience. She helped take end of night pictures and recommended that we stand in a different area for better lighting. She also noticed one of my friends didn't eat her rice pudding and asked if she didn't like it. My friend hesitated because she didn't want to be negative but we did confirm that she didn't really enjoy it so the waitress took it off the bill. Completely unprompted! Lastly, they offered us three free desserts for our birthday celebration also unprompted!  I would come back just because of the service but the food was great. The appetizers were awesome but the pimento cheese ball really stood out. I got the chicken breast and wing combo which was well seasoned. The desserts were awesome especially the banana pudding. I also ordered a side of tater tots which I enjoy crispier than they made it but it was still good. Overall, impressed!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles are to die for. Waffle with sugar crystals and 2 pieces of fried chicken. It tastes the best with maple syrup."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great southern kitchen. Atmosphere is perfectly old school meets modern. Their fried chicken does not quit! Fun place to sit by the bar, or share some family sized meals with friends or family. Awesome space for meeting people."}
{"text":"Sometimes you find yourself in a whirlwind romance, especially with a new found lover. Everything is extreme through the passion, excitement, and everything in between. Though this, is a lover none like the rest.  I ventured to Haberdish for an early dinner and fell completely in love! I'm a sucker for a well-designed space and loved the rustic modern feel Haberdish exuded, especially in its unexpected (though charming) NoDa community. Every dish provided adventure and a sense of anxiousness as almost nothing was as I perceived. From the Smoked Deviled Eggs to the Dill & Scallion Trout and the Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese (special of the day), each dish simply titillated my taste buds and kept me yearning more. I would also recommend the Sweet Potato Dumplings and Hush Puppies that came with a magical Sweet Tea Butter Spread. I loved the flavor of the Pork Shank, but it fell on the dry side and took a bit away from the dish. The only dish I truly wouldn't recommend is the lackluster Fried Chicken (White Meat), which was underwhelming and left my palate desiring more (especially in comparison to the others). Nonetheless I had an amazing \"feast\" I would say, and can't wait to return to try the infamous Kale Grits!"}
{"text":"In one word, Haberdish opening in Noda is exciting! Major props for converting an eyesore building into a super vibrant space with a cozy interior perfect for a cold, almost winter night. I'm sure that it will be equally hopping in warmer weather. Really, from start to finish, the space seemed to be transformed in record time. We were greeted immediately, as the hostess is basically posted at the door. They probably need to get some kind of small hostess stand. Anyway, the place was pretty packed and we were given options on tables and we chose the long community table just off to the right of the entrance. I think that they've been open for about a week, but the menu provided a lot of options for all kinds of diners and drinkers. We were 4 people, including the wife and another couple, so we just decided on a bunch of small plates and sides to share with our chosen entrees. But first let's talk about the drinks. There was a lot of variety on their cocktail menu to go along with beer and wine options. When one of us asked our server about their gin options, she had one of the bartenders come over and talked about the options. I really liked that added touch, whether it's a regular protocol, or maybe the server wasn't comfortable discussing the gin options. Either way, the drinks were good and I'm pretty sure that they can make you any drink that you want based on the many bottles on the shelves behind the bar.  For food, we ordered entrees of trout, half chicken, and pork shank. As sides, we shared the daily special pickled veggies, in this case beets and onions, the daily special roasted carrots, okra and the cornbread pudding. Now we ordered a large portion of cornbread pudding, but only got a small one but also got a small plate of sweet potato dumplings. We figured more variety, so we didn't make a fuss. Ultimately, we all wound up being stuffed, so again, we didn't make a fuss, but we all agreed that the sweet potato dumplings were our least favorite. For me they fell flat and were very doughy. All the other veggies were great, especially the carrots and pickled beets/onions. The okra was good too, but I'm not a super fan. As for the cornbread pudding, it was rich and delicious, and I usually don't like cornbread. The entrees were all presented well, and again we were all in agreement that the trout and chicken were the leaders of the pack with the pork shank trailing behind. Let's just say that the shank could have been more moist in some areas. The trout was cooked to perfection and while the fried chicken wasn't earth shattering, it was well cooked and moist with just the right amount of batter. Plenty of food for the price and we were stuffed, so no dessert for us on this night. Once again the group was in agreement on some return visits to have more of our favorites and we all look forward to see how the menu evolves. I know that I for one am looking for an ever changing seasonal menu going forward. On this go around the space and atmosphere out shined the food a bit but there is clear potential for the future."}
{"text":"Great place for food. The boiled peanuts are next level and cocktails are out of this world. Cool vibes !"}
{"text":"The Fried Chicken is a must here. I heard about it from multiple people and it did not disappoint. It was juicy, tender, great flavor and a crisp/crunch exterior that you want. I got the 2 piece white meat with a side and it was more than enough for lunch. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were making drinks the whole time and they looked very interesting. I didn't get one as I was going to a brewery after lunch.   I went with someone who is gluten free and they had a separate menu which told you which items were gluten free. It was awesome having that option. She ended up getting the ribs and they were fall off the bone good. Would love to come back and try some of their craft cocktails when I get a chance."}
{"text":"You literally can't order anything bad off of this menu. Everything is incredible, especially the hushpuppies and mac and cheese with the crispy chicken skins. Cocktails are delicious. The wait is well worth it every time."}
{"text":"The food was good and I thought the prices was pretty decent too. I was told they are known for their fried chicken. I ended up getting the chicken tenders. They weren't your normal chicken tenders as in size and taste. They were huge, more like a chicken breast. Overall taste was nice. Sides were fresh and fantastic.   Dinner was great and atmosphere was pretty cool too. Only complaint, it was extremely loud, hard to have a conversation with anyone at the table that wasn't sitting next to you. But, kinda expecting that for a Friday night.   Will be back to entertain my family from the North. Let them try some good southern food."}
{"text":"I really really really wouldn't leave Charlotte without trying this place! Cocktails are yum! Mac & Cheese and Pimento cheese ball and cauliflower steak is worth it! The sweet potato dumplings are not. But the real treasure here is the BANANA PUDDING!! It comes in a darling mason jar and is to DIE FOR. the wait was around 30 min which passed fast - they text you when your table is ready and are pretty quick with the service! Ambience and decor is definitely on the trendy/ hipster side but it's a real chill place - def worth a visit."}
{"text":"We went for the fried chicken which was just ok. What had me was the banana pudding. OMG. I could eat that every single day. It was that good. Can't wait to take our friends."}
{"text":"So returned to Haberdish for my bday! Y'all this place is my favorite!!!! My waitress was a big part of this. She was so sweet! She was super helpful and when she found out it was my birthday she have me a glass of water with an ice cube that had a ride in the middle!!! Y'all I love stuff like that! She recommended great food choices. She was also super funny. Every time I come here the service is so good! Stephanie C you are amazing! You made my birthday so great!"}
{"text":"Solid uniquely southern meal, just what I wanted when visiting Charlotte NC. Elevated southern favorites with an inspired flair. Breakdown: +Loaded grits - the man's favorite out of everything with cheese, bacon, chives - indulgently delicious +Livermush toast - wanted to try this because its a NC thing. It was very tasty had many bold flavors almost masked the liver, but that was OK with me. +Sweet potato dumplings - was nervous about the mixed review on these, but I loved them  the most. They ARE savory, but that's what I want a dumpling to be..with a hint of sweet potato essence. +Pimento cheese ball - yummy starter, made refreshing with apple slices +Trout - perfectly cooked, but a tad bit salty for my taste +Banana Pudding - tasty, but not incredibly memorable +Sonker - cooked to order and it came out HOT, interactive - pour your milk over it...very unique and would recommend"}
{"text":"This is a fun place don't get me wrong, Great menu and great drinks BUT my mother and I spent $60 and our waitress ignored us and acted as though we were bothering her. Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. She just didn't want to deal with us though we were spending more than any other table in her section. May come back but won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This review was difficult, there were so many aspects of my experience. I plan on revisiting very soon and reevaluating my review. My wife had the chicken fingers and mac & cheese, and I had the pork shank. Please read the whole review to understand why I only gave it 3 stars. I will start with my 5 stars first.  Atmosphere 5 stars Service 5 stars Beer and Wine selection 5 stars Taste of food 5 stars Appetizer & side selections 5 stars Entrée selections 2 Stars Smaller entrée selection 0 stars Price 3 Stars  Bang for your buck 3 Stars (Unless it's the chicken fingers, then it's 5 stars)  Constructive criticism:   Install a coat hook for customers jackets.  If you serve chicken fingers, offer blue cheese and hot sauce as an option and serve aside large enough to dip your fingers in.   Offer more entrée options then fried chicken, trout, and pork.   I understand they are new, and still figuring things out. This place has the ability to be five stars all the way around. I will say they've hired an excellent staff and I was very impressed with the service as well as the quality of the food. I just wish I didn't leave still hungry."}
{"text":"Exquisite in an unassuming way...visit and you will be quite content no matter your choices"}
{"text":"Haberdish is now my favorite spot in town.  I have been like three times in the last couple of weeks. I decided to meet a friend for brunch last Sunday.  Since they have been getting so much traffic we decided to go early.  Well, unlike most other Brunch spots they don't start until 11:30 am. We just hung around for the 30 minutes. Now, the food is awesome!  Hands down, the BEST chicken and Waffles in the CITY!! I can actually enjoy a waffle without syrup, thank goodness, because the sauce that comes with the waffles is not very tasty. Its like honey...Its the only thing I didn't enjoy.We tried the deviled eggs: I like my deviled eggs sweet, but they weren't bad. The cornbread pudding: it was delish! Reminded me of corn bread that tastes a little like Thanksgiving dressing. BUT the COCKTAILS...I tried the Love Potion, Rum Punch and the Hibiscus drink, my, my, my...their concoctions are one of a kind! Quite a few flavors I wasn't familiar with but man, they were swell!!! Overall, they have a super exciting spot here. I look forward to going up on a Tuesday (Biscuit night, yay!)  Parking is dreadful in NoDa. Hopefully, that will improve in the near future as there is another restaurant next door that will soon open."}
{"text":"Awesome first experience at Haberdish. First off, no wait saved our evening. I put us in on a busy Saturday night before ordering the lyft, and ended up with around an hour to do some bar hopping before dinner. Estimate was a bit short, but no problem for us.  Drink menu and selection were rather impressive. I ended up going with a BBL stout and my wife chose a mint julep which featured great flavor and impressive presentation.  Regarding the menu, it is simple and small, but everything on there was intriguing. Yes, the fried chicken is amazing. Biggest surprise for me of the night was the sweet potato dumplings. Awesome flavor and texture. I would also recommend the biscuits and bacon jam - which was closer to biscuits and gravy IMO. I also feel you get a good bang for your buck. We split the meal (The sides are big enough to share) and our food bill was only 30. Glad they aren't overcharging and we were stuffed. We are definitely looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"interesting place. mint jeulep was very good. other drinks seem unnecessarily high priced though. That does not lend itself to \"stop in for a drink.\"  Had appetizers so can't say anything about the food. Service was fair.....more distant and distracted for an easy Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is very desirable in design, decor, and space. I'm on the fence about a return visit."}
{"text":"Decided to try Haberdish last and wasn't disappointed. A lot of restaurants that try to add a twist on southern food miss the mark but for the most part Haberdish succeeded.   It's tucked away in NoDa and offers a great cozy atmosphere and a craft cocktail bar.  We ordered the fried chicken and roast chicken for our entrees. Everyone agreed that the fried chicken hit the rare combination between crispy-crunchy skin outside and moist juicy meat inside. The skin's flavor was okay--decently seasoned but could stand improvement. The roast chicken was equally moist with a tasty white sauce drizzled over it.  One area Haberdish could improve on would be the side dish department. The side selection is small and none really stand out. Our group ordered the kale grits, charred okra, and mac and cheese with spicy chicken skins on top. The kale \"grits\" were good but I wouldn't call them grits per se. The charred okra was good. Our group all believes that if mac and cheese isn't baked it's not real mac and cheese. This mac and cheese was the creamy stove top cooks version so it wasn't our favorite but the spicy chicken skins on top were delicious and I think Haberdish would do well serving a spicy version of their fried chicken entree.  All in all I think Haberdish was a good experience and I would recommend it to people for a good relatively inexpensive night out in NoDa. If you're looking for authentic soul/southern food you'll be disappointed but if you're looking for comfort food with a twist you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"Ultimate southern comfort food experience. Has fun country farmhouse charm inside. Mac cheese with chicken skins on top is a MUST!  We got 2 tenders as our main dish and shared a bunch of large sides at our table of 4. This ended up being a really affordable dinner!  Okra and sweet potato curds wasn't impressive. Hush puppies and hard boiled eggs were amazing."}
{"text":"I know the wait can be long but oh is it worth it! The staff is quite friendly and knowledgeable. The food is what brings me back time and time again (not to mention the creative cocktails!). The cauliflower steak is perfectly seasoned and can't be missed. The chicken tenders are by far the best I've had (try the white hot sauce with them). The King cocktail uses a sous vide to be created?! Seriously. They care about their creations.   The leadership is doing something right. And we'll keep coming back for it!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand all the hype over this place. The food was okay, but the menu is very small and leaves much to be desired. The server got busy after we got our appetizers and never really came back to the table so we didn't have an opportunity to order more food but I really wasn't impressed with what I had already eaten or the things on the menu. I think there are much better restaurants in Charlotte that deserve more hype than this place."}
{"text":"- Ninja Level Custom Cocktails - There was a real rosebud frozen into my ice cube and violet liqueur in my drink. I loved it.  - Southern favorites with a modern twist on the menu. Fried Chicken = a must! I know, Boo.. but you have to try it! Cornbread, Okra, Biscuits! Et all..i mean eat all.   Also give the digestives a try following the meal.  - Hipster atmosphere - even if you left your beard and handlebar mustache at home, the surroundings will make you feel just like you are wearing horn-rimmed glasses...    If you want to meet friends in the hip artsy area of NoDa and have dinner and serious DRANKS - this is the place. I am a smart cocktail lover and so when I heard they had an award winning bartender and a custom cocktail menu TDF, I was down to try it.  Love it and I will be back next time I am back in the QC!"}
{"text":"Family style brunch? Don't mind if I do. Haberdish offers a wide variety of souther dishes all spectacularly made with great flavors that you can share with everyone. Indecisive people like me, welcome, you're gonna love it. Think of it even as tapas style brunch. Personal favorites include chicken and waffles, hushpuppies and mac and cheese"}
{"text":"It's fancy southern food. The menu is very simple. Pretty much fried chicken or fried chicken with some sides. Large portions are great to share. Some appetizers were just funny to me like cheese straws  (I got them) and boiled peanuts...you know, like the things you get in a huge styrofoam cup from the guy on the side of the road.    Atmosphere was nice. Very open fancy farmhouse feel. Ball jar glasses, candle light , but get ready to hear every thing the table beside you is talking about. The tables are really close. At one point our neighboring tables server had to reach over and her butt was pretty much in my face. I had to lean over.    Ok, lets talk booze. The beer selection was mediocre at best. I asked for a local beer and was offered wicked weed. When I explained I wanted a Charlotte beer she told me they only had one!  I am a person who will make a decision on where to eat based on the beer selection. I know I'm not the only one so I hope this helps somebody out there.  The cocktail list on the other hand was huge. I'm not a cocktail drinker but that list and looking around at other tables made me want one. They were really pretty and cool looking.   So after all that, would I go back? No, but if my  non southern  friends come in from out of town I would take them there. It was nice and the food was good. If they up the beer game I may give it another try."}
{"text":"Tried their brunch menu. It was superb. Boneless chicken thigh was the best fried chicken I have ever had the pleasure to eat.  Service was fine. I definitely go back and try their dinner menu; first rate food in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"They accommodated our large group of 11 with ease considering there are no reservations. The food was excellent. I had biscuits and gravy with cheese grits! Others had chicken and waffles. All were amazing! Great Bellini drink as well! Well definitely return!"}
{"text":"The weather was beautiful and I wanted to dine outside, Haberdish has a patio.  The restaurant is quaint and the patio seating was fine.  The patio would have been perfect if the seats weren't stained and food wiped from the table to the ground where the debris stayed.  The service was fine at first but after my appetizer was delivered, I never saw my server again.  I ordered hushpuppies for an appetizer and they were disappointing.  They were made to order but barely warm, dry and bland.  I waited for more than 20 minutes for my server and had to get someone else's attention for assistance.  I placed an order on tater tots and white meat fried chicken, I asked that onions, chives and shallots be excluded.  The entrée arrived with chives all over the chicken and I had to send it back.  My original server returned to table to find out what went wrong and I responded.  The server left and returned to say that the person who took my order thought I didn't want onions, chives or shallots on the tots only.    I received another entrée without onions, chives or shallots.  I asked if the meal would be discounted because of the wait and mix up.  I ate the tots which would have been perfect with less ground black pepper on them.  The chicken is brined than fried to make it moist and flavorful.  The chicken had a faint odor that I could not identify but just thought it was the brine.  I ate a little but stopped and concentrated on the tots instead because the taste was off-putting.  I boxed the remaining hushpuppies and chicken.  Although the server removed the chicken for the bill; a few hours later, my stomach began to ache.    The ambiance at Haberdish is inviting but the food doesn't come close to being decent.  I will not be returning to Haberdish."}
{"text":"Tasty meal ribs were nice and Smokey, fried chicken was crunchy and juicy.  Tried the liver mush toast and bacon jam biscuits. Both were filling and deviled eggs were classic. Service was on point. Lots of diversity in this feel good spot. Gonna try the smoked chicken next time. Honorable mention Mac & cheese & banana pudding"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I loved it. Atmosphere, wait staff and food was great. We will go back. We liked everything we ordered. Plates are shareable so order a variety share with table. Nice cocktail choices too. Go early due to popularity they are busy. They don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!! Tip: Haberdish tends to fill up very quickly so add yourself to the waitlist on the Yelp app. If not, you could easily be waiting an hour plus on a Saturday night. It's that good!   We started off with the hush puppies and biscuits with bacon jam. The fried cornmeal dough with sweet tea butter is a taste of sweet southern heaven. We probably should have stopped here as the portions were quite large.  But we ordered more! had two fried chicken tenders ($2 each) which are brined, battered and fried and are surprisingly quite large. I love that their chicken comes from a local farm in NC (Springer Mountain Farms) where it is vegetarian-fed, hormone and antibiotic free. I also had a side of charred okra....a perfect compliment to the delicious, juicy fried chicken.  My boyfriend ordered the pork shank which was more than enough for one person. It was cooked to perfection and had a smoky BBQ taste.   We also ordered the mac & cheese. Needless to say our eyes were too large and we brought home leftovers.   The atmosphere is lively and vibrant and has a diverse crowd of patrons. While we sat at the bar, there's both inside and outside dining.   Highly recommend Haberdish."}
{"text":"Had some friends from NYC come down here to visit and they wanted some southern food. I've been to NYC once and they have some cool looking restaurants with good food so I did my research and picked this place for them. They were just as impressed as I was, good atmosphere and great food. Big portions for a really good price. Fried chicken was amazing, hushpuppies were great, and so were the tater tots. Their tenders were okay. Also got the Black Manhattan, strong and delicious. Definitely will come back to try more!"}
{"text":"The quality of food and sevice was amazing. So happy that the patio was open. I had the much talked about chicken and waffles. The chicken was amazing, although the waffles were a bit overly sweet. Chicken, pickles, and waffle bite was delish and well balanced. I shared to of the punches which were also well balanced."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner to celebrate my mom's birthday. We've heard such great things about Haberdish so we were very excited. Overall we thought it was ok, but probably wouldn't go back. Hate to be negative, but it just wasn't anything special. Our server was great and the ambiance is awesome but we weren't crazy about the food. We had two cocktails that were pretty good but I would try something different if I find myself there again. We had the fried chicken, okra, Mac and cheese and hushpuppies. The chicken and okra were good but the rest was just ok. Definitely not bad, but definitely wasn't as good as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Hipster style service. Foods are too salty which make it tasty. Nothing very impressive."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken!! The fried chicken and chicken tenders are great...large portions and crispy breading. They have a large variety of southern sides...Mac n cheese, okra, and scratch made Tater Tots to name a few. Had hushpuppies as a appetizer...awesome as well. Staff was very attentive and knowledgeable...cocktails and beer selection great as well. Will definitely be going back, great addition to the NoDa neighborhood."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's very open and the staff is usually pretty friendly.  I tried the chicken tenders and waffles which was pretty good, but the batter seems to separate easily from the chicken and is tad too thick for me.  The waffle is more like the liege waffle which is sweet but good.  The hushpuppies with sweet tea butter are good also.  My favorites are the kale grits with a touch of honey.  I realize not everyone will like this, as the consistency is different and it doesn't look all that great but again it is my fav.  I recently discovered another favorite, the rice pudding with strawberries, blueberries, and pecans......amazing!  I usually visit for brunch only as the parking is a little easier on Sunday's."}
{"text":"We literally just left the restaurant, after eating here, and went to another restaurant to get a meal.   Let me back up...We heard about this restaurant from a friend who heard good things about this place. So, we were in the neighborhood and were excited to try the food. The only plus, we were seated immediately.   1. Our waiter was lackluster, it's as if we were wasting his time. Very little interaction on his part. At the end of our meal, I wanted to have him give a message to give to the kitchen, but he collected the plates and the paid bill so quickly, I did not get the opportunity to do so.   2. As vegetarians, we look for restaurants with new takes on veggies. We ordered the cauliflower steak and BBQ carrots. The cauliflower steak was a huge portion, and it looked absolutely delicious. However, the cauliflower was so salty, I was unable to finish my portion. I honestly would have been better off dipping the cauliflower in salt water to tone down the amount of salt on it. I don't think anyone from the kitchen tasted the food before they sent it out. The carrots were good.  We spent about 30 minutes in this restaurant, and spent less than $25. I am thankful that we did not come here with a large group and paid more for this experience."}
{"text":"If I could do a negative I would after been here several times and having a good experience Rachel was very difficult and rude it's funny how people will pay attention to a certain demographic and be tip and treated poor while overlooking others this will be my last stop here just based on that but still left a good tip bc of Ria to many restaurants in Charlotte for the bs"}
{"text":"A promising spot located in trendy NoDa with an industrial modern feel to it with exposed brick and wooden tables.  We tried to use the NoWait app to get in line when we were on our way, but the app said there was no wait.  Then did not update (despite refreshing) which meant when we arrived we were disappointed there was a 30 min wait.  We decided to wait at the bar.  We ordered drinks - which were OK - and a couple dishes (one of which never arrived).  More than an hour later - 77 minutes to be exact - we still were not seated, the host did not say anything and wasn't that sympathetic to my disappointment in the wait.  It was made worse when another (large) party arrived and were seated almost immediately (ahead of us). When we were seated someone came by and dropped a few appetizers on the table - not knowing what they were, looking perplexed - someone eventually explained they were on the house and what they were. The food was hit or miss.  The hush puppies were fresh and probably the best I've ever had.  The ribs had a good smokey flavor, but they weren't very tender.  The mac n' cheese - my go to side - left something to be desired. All in all, not worth going for another long wait, but it had a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Ohhh hello amzing cocjtau..  (The above is what I wrote after having brunch here.. yikes! Readers.. immediate post Haberdish cocktail reviewing isn't a great idea!) My word their cocktail menu is divine, absolutely loved the Pineapple Spiced Rum Punch cocktail! This is a lovely venue, spacious and modern and really lovely service.  We went for brunch and had a lot of catching up to do so were there for hours and never once did we feel like anyone wanted us to go, just kept coming back for more cocktail orders.. oh wait, actually, maybe they're evil! :) Haberdish staff, thank you for making us feel welcome. On the food front, we ordered a starter of Hushpuppies. Made of cornmeal and served with sweet tea butter.. so good! Then, I had chicken & waffles. You had a choice of the type of chicken aka.. tenders or thigh. Tick here. Dining partner had the cauliflower and it was droolworthy! We also had the kale salad and mac n cheese as sides. Didn't quite finish all that.. not through lack of trying! I highly recommend this venue, even if just for that amazing cocktail (aka cocjtau) list! Thank you team Haberdish!"}
{"text":"Friends and I visited Haberdish for a birthday celebration and I'll be honest... being 99.9% vegetarian made me nervous about ordering off the menu. The food is served family style and it's highly southern meaning that it's just about all meat everything! I definitely felt like I was taking one for the team. However, it worked out really well and I enjoyed my time here.   First, the place is beautiful! There is a ton of natural light, big windows and a patio, the whole shebang.  It was very modern farmhouse and my group was lucky enough to get seated at a giant family style farm table. We all gathered around and got lost in their drink menu. While I wasn't drinking during the visit, I did try a few of my friend's cocktails. I can't remember the names of them but they were all divine. I know one had jalapeno and cilantro in it and it was super refreshing and unique. I almost said screw it and got one but it never ended up happening.   I ended up deciding to just order on my own, separate from group. I choose the kale salad, which included orange slices, goat cheese, and candied sesame with a pomegranate molasses dressing.  It was fantastic and I was left wanting more. It was fresh, had some crunch, and it wasn't too sweet. I would recommend it to anybody. The group got a few sides that I tried a bite of. I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato dumplings, simply too heavy for me. The tater tots were fantastic! A good tot might not sound like a lot to ask for but I'll tell you, it can be hard to find sometimes. The bbq glazed carrots were definitely a standout! They were cooked well and the flavor was spot on. Don't skip these puppies!  To celebrate my friend's birthday, she was treated to some ice cream and we all got a few bites. It was very thick and creamy and almost tasted like cheesecake. We were all really impressed. All in all, this place is dope. If I lived near by I would imagine coming here for drinks on the patio and definitely for brunch. You should come, there's no doubt about it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Yelp you never let me down!  David picked my dinner and was on point.  Chicken was amazing.  Seriously everything I had was great!  Finished up with the banana pudding.  I def will stop here again!  This place is a gem in this city.  Get your butt here!!!"}
{"text":"What a delicious weekday brunch! We were visiting from out of town and were not disappointed the least. I had the blonde bloody Mary which was very light and refreshing and followed with the chicken and waffles! I suggest doing the thigh because the tender is rather small. Regardless, the chicken was tender and crispy and the waffle was out of this world. The best part of the experience was our waitress, Ali D. She provided suggestions for the rest of our day, all of which were great. Thanks Ali!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and I strongly encourage the new brunch. Drinks are delicious and strong. Haberdish is a cool trendy restaurant, filling a great need in Charlotte: southern food worth waiting for. That said, the service......needs some help. Last night, we were told we were next up to be seated. We asked about the open table for four and were told that we could have it only after someone on the list didn't show. Their time would expire in another 30 minutes. 30 minutes go by, all with an open table, and we are told that we can now have the table because they found the person a better table in a different part of the restaurant. You read that right: the person who doesn't show up for the reservation gets a better table while they sit us, who have been waiting for 90 minutes at the table that had been reserved for the guy who hadn't shown up for his reservation after 30 minutes. Then, then service was meh. They didn't bring plates for the starters (which were delicious), even after asking. Then, they brought the food (mostly very good), but didn't offer dinner plates. We had to ask, again. They are busy. Really busy. They should be proud of what their chefs are producing. And it may be time for more staff or \"all hands on deck\" on a Saturday night. Still, a very good restaurant, with delicious food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Poorly trained staff and bad management.   We were traveling through town on my wife's birthday. We called asking if little dogs were allowed. They said yes, on the porch. When we showed up the policy had changed. It was very inconvenient when traveling with my whole family, including my 93 year old grandmother. The manager had no interest in supporting his staff and threw them under the bus.   It's very unfortunate because the food looked good."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town visitors for a taste of the South. Great ambiance with indoor and outdoor seating and the food & cocktails are top notch.  We have tried almost everything on the menu but highlights include the tea brined fried chicken, the smoked chicken with white sauce, got to have the hush puppies with sweet tea butter and if they offer charred okra with bacon jam  sign me up!  Even those who don't like okra will love this side dish. The kale grits are crazy good and they often feature another special dish featuring grits, in our case they were loaded grits and were very good.  The only complaint I have about Haberdish as with any place in NODA is the parking which can be challenging.  Food: 4.5 Sporks Service: 4 Sporks Atmosphere: 5 Sporks Sweet Tea: 2 Sporks Value: 4 Sporks Local Beer: 3 Sporks"}
{"text":"Phenomenal in every way. The smoked chicken and corn bread pudding are the subjects of dreams."}
{"text":"We came to Haberdish on a Thursday with two adults and four kids.   We ordered chicken fingers, Mac n cheese, dill pickles, tater tots, and waffles. The chicken fingers were freshly made, moist and hot. The waffles were dense (in a good way) and well flavored. The dill pickles were nice and tangy and a great recipe! The tater tots were fluffy and crispy. The Mac n cheese disappeared in 5 min flat with all of us grabbing spoonfuls.   I would highly recommend this restaurant. The ambiance was just the right amount of cozy and trendy. With six people it is sometimes hard to accommodate us and they easily found us a table.   Watch out for parking though- it's tricky! We had to find a parking lot nearby to pay to park and walk a short distance.   I would definitely go back to this restaurant! It is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, the background music was great, yet  neither of those compare to the food on the table in front of you.  Some of the best fried chicken this side of Price's Chicken Coop!  As good as the chicken was, the sides were possibly the highlight.  We ordered mac & cheese (wouldn't get again, simply because it was the weakest of the bunch, but if you must, go for it!), kale grits (OMGG! O Maizing Green Grits), okra with enough bacon jam that it's approved by the Pork Council as a meat, sweet potato dumplings (some said they were a little on the salty side, which they were, but still the highlight for me), kale salad (sounds blah but try it and you'll change your mind), and tater tots (smaller than most other places, but it packs a flavorful punch).  The Alabama white sauce is good for dipping, as is the house made hot sauce (which is not overly hot btw).  A friend got the special, which was chicken and biscuits (described as chicken pot pie filling over 4 biscuits). A very large portion but it looked amazing.  I had too much food in front of me to try, but everyone said it was good.  The beer selection was a little weak for me, but still enough options to find something.  They certainly push the mixed drinks and wine as opposed to the beer menu.  I stuck with beer but a few folks at the table had mixed drinks and all were pleased with their orders.  2 beers, an order of 2 piece chicken, and a side had me out of the door for $30 after tip.    We were there by 5:30 on a Tuesday and had no wait.  However, the place was packed out by 6:30.  As others note, there is a waitlist option on the Yelp app, so save yourself some stress and take care of that before arriving.  Walk down the street to any one of several bars for a pre-dinner drink, or just hang out in the bar and run up your tab.  Whatever you decide, just decide that this place is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"When I heard about this place. I was anxious to try it out. And they didn't disappoint. I'm all about comfort food and southern comfort food too, I just died!  Went on a Wed/Thurs with a friend. My treat.. walked in and was greet right alway. Love the decor. Wood beam with reuse jean fabric booth hosiery! Good ole chic farm feel.  We sat down. Order our drinks. And omg their drinks are strong. No joke. I had one and done. I don't think I even finish it. Got a nice buzz very early one.  Here's what I ordered.. and you better NOT judge. I wanted to try it all!   Deviled eggs,  dill house pickles,  hushpuppies,  biscuits with bacon jam,  4 pieces of dark meat chicken,  cast iron NC trout,  mac and cheese with chicken skin topping,  kale grits,  sweet potatoes dumplings,  corn bread puddings and  chocolate sheet cake!   Some highlights. The breading on the chicken is awesome. Right amount of season and crispy just the way I like it. I tried a little of kale grits. Meh. Sweet potatoes dumpling was comforting. A nice natural sweet taste to it. Love the corn bread pudding. And omg I'm crazy about the trout. Presentation was nicely done. Crispy skin up and perfectly cook. And best of all, mac and cheese with the skin.. I need to starve myself the next 3 weeks for that.  Lastly, the chocolate sheet cake. That's one thing I didn't care for. The cake is very solid and cold with the raspberry sauce was tart therefore it overpower the cake completely. I only took 2 bites. Many kudos to the manager Jim on duty that night. At one point I saw him darted pass just. Thought he was chasing a criminal. Nooo, a customer forgot their leftover. How sweet. You can count on me to come back!"}
{"text":"Hip decor. Try a bunch of small sides. We sampled the house pickles, smoked deviled eggs are a must. Fried chicken is there specialty. Skip the kale salad, good but boring. Our server was fun and knowledgeable. Visiting town but will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Dined here on their first \"official\" opening night and everything from the service to the food was on point and could not have been better.  Wonderful atmosphere - you can tell they have a deep appreciation for the neighborhood's history and this is reflected in the restaurant itself.  The food was nothing short of amazing. The cheese straws, hush puppies, okra, sweet potato dumplings and fried chicken were all standouts but for us the show stopper was the savory bread pudding!  What an amazing addition to the neighborhood and to Charlotte's food scene."}
{"text":"Southern inspired comfort food combined with excellent craft cocktails, framed in a \"order to share\" style restaurant. If you are from the North and you need to experience a nice intro to Southern food, try Haberdish.  From a native South Carolinian, I was excited to try out Haberdish's fried chicken and their take on Southern sides. The sweet potato dumplings are an interesting addition to the menu and pretty tasty, although I was not blown away. The grilled okra with bacon marmalade on top was pretty good as well (that's about as sexy as okra can get folks). Yet another interesting side, kale grits, which were good. I think I enjoy regular grits better though.   Saving the best for last...the biscuits and fried chicken. I know good biscuits and I can truly say that Haberdish has some of the best in CLT. They have nailed the art of biscuit making. The same goes for the fried chicken. Their recipe and process are on point and have set the tone for fried chicken in Charlotte.   The downside to my experience was the service. Even at 9:30PM we had to wait 15 minutes to get drinks delivered and longer still to put our food order in. Hopefully the oversight in service isn't a common thing.  Haberdish hits the mark with craft cocktails, biscuits, and their chicken, but could use a little tweaking in the sides and service areas...4/5."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best southern style places I've been to in Charlotte. The fried chicken was full of flavor and crispy, the mac & cheese was creamy and layered with different levels cheesiness! The Kale salad  was light and crisp with a slight sweetness. Our group was also impressed with the drinks and service that night. I would definitely love to bring out of town visitors or others to this place again."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. Haberdish was an excellent intro into Charlotte food for me. My sister just recently moved to Charlotte and we wanted to carry on our Charleston tradition of having at least one 5-star dining experience per visit. She chose Haberdish for my first Charlotte meal and I am so glad she did.  We sat at the bar (as you should always do!) and we immediately hit it off with our bartender. I didn't get her name and she left early (she wasn't feeling well but didn't let it show at all) but she helped us pick a drink and our meal. We split the Liquid Pumpkin Pie Punch ($22 for a medium - ended up being about 4 1/2 glasses), which was given to us with a beautiful sprinkling of flowers and a great presentation on how to pour the punch.  For our meal, we started with the pimento cheese ball ($9, and we brought home most of it) which came with apples and homemade crackers that were delicious. We then shared the cauliflower steak ($12 and more than enough for 2 people) and the bbq glazed carrots ($6 for half or $12 for whole).   Everything was top-notch and each bite was better than the last. I am so very impressed and hope to check out more of the menu on my next visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was amazing. I went on a Sunday and although they do not offer brunch on Sunday they did have chicken and waffles as the Sunday special and it was amazing! They also have a brunch cocktail menu that had very unique drinks. They also have a nice bourbon and whiskey list as well. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"3 of us went and got just about everything on the menu to try. Must have appetizer, deviled eggs. Pork shank-amazing. Cauliflower steak-just too much vegetable for me. Mac n cheese was really good and creamy. Fried chicken-good. Ambiance-loved it. Service is why I can't give this 5 stars. She never came back. We had to flag her down at other tables for refills. The glasses are too small and they should consider a water carafe to go with them. When we really nicely asked for refills, she glared and made faces. She wasn't over whelmed with tables, at one point we were her only one. We will go back, but I pray to never get her again."}
{"text":"Well, come to Charlotte and expect good comfort food, well thank you Haberdish for making this a reality.  We enjoyed our last dinner here and boy was it great. The atmosphere at Haberdish is comfy and sophisticated, once again walking distance to our homebase in Noda. I can't believe how much good food was walking distance from our place.  Haberdish really delivered on the comfort food, with a small menu. When you see a small menu, sometimes it is a bad sign, but many times, a great sign - they have really mastered their art in the form of these foods, choose and be happy.   In this case, the center of the menu was fried chicken, so it was a no-brainer for me - I LOVE fried chicken. This particular fried chicken was everything you would want, it was perfectly portioned, crispy, the right amount of salty, and yet still juicier than the world, inside. I will put this as the top five fried chicken dishes I have had the pleasure to enjoy.   The mac and cheese was fine, nothing to write home about but a good accompaniment. The biscuits with bacon and jam were excellent, a great balance between sweet and salty, on top of flaky and buttery. I might say the biscuits were a bit doughy, but honestly I would be nit-picking at this point.  Overall, a great meal, served by an excellent waiter."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. And just in time for Valentines Day! We cocktails and dinner last night and I cannot begin to rave about our experience. I would love to host and Event, rehearsal dinner or private event here. Just for the sole fact the food and service was great.   I look forward to our return with a bigger crowd!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Haberdish as I did not like the idea that the menu mostly consisted of Fried chicken-just not my thing.  We tried it today and everything from the silverware, to the food, to the tasteful bluegrass music playing at the perfect volume, to the overall ambience was impeccable. Our server, Jamie, was absolutely great!  She was attentive and helpful.  We ordered deviled eggs, (best I've ever had-a hint of horseradish) chicken and waffles, chicken tenders with all 3 sauces (ranch, BBQ, and honey mustard,-ranch was my favorite), tater tots (highly addictive) and the best sweet tea (just like my grandmas-made by Jamie) Thanks for a great experience Haberdish! We will definitely be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Great southern fair!  The food is well focused, simple and perfectly executed.  Its pricey but the venue is beautiful, the staff is amazing, and the drinks are well poured.  I would recommend it to friends"}
{"text":"Been here several times and have never been disappointed. I recommend the smoked chicken, and the craft cocktail list always has something new and delicious to try."}
{"text":"My parents and I came here for brunch last Sunday. We shared fried chicken, biscuits with bacon jam, deviled eggs, livermush toast, okra with more bacon jam, and cole slaw. Everything was fantastic except for the livermush toast; all the condiments were unable to disguise the unpleasant flavor of the livermush. I suspect this is something no one likes unless they grew up eating it. In general, this was easily the best brunch I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Damn good fried chicken, but the sides were even better!!!!! Sweet potatoes dumplings, mac n cheese, but the kale salad was by far the best! Definitely worth the 40min \"No Wait.\" Will return again."}
{"text":"If you want the best and most beautiful cocktail in Charlotte, come here! Bartender Rhea will create the cocktail of your dreams. Also excellent food!! Well done, Haberdish!!!"}
{"text":"I live close to Haberdish and was wanting to go more and more as I saw fellow Yelpers pictures they posted and reviews that were coming out. Its fairly new so staff is just now getting to wine training, etc., from what I heard. The owner of Growler's Pourhouse and Crepe Cellar opened Haberdish.  I am not a big beer fan and think there is a void in Charlotte for great cocktails. Its getting better though and Haberdish is helping me out there. They take on the classics and have their menu sectioned off in three sections from a low alcohol to high proof. I selected a lemon cocktail but did not jot the name down and they don't currently have a cocktail menu handy on-line. It was tip-top though! My friend and husband got their version of a Manhattan. Haberdish even makes their own tonic so make sure to get a Doc Portor and tonic while there. Their specialty is the fried chicken which you can get a few ways and can even get tenders instead of on the bone. Their sides are things like cornbread spoon bread, which makes for a killer breakfast with an egg the next day and they also offer homemade tater tots, charred okra and the list goes on. We did take out and the veg of the day was broccolini which came with crumbled bacon and a hot sauce hollandaise. We added some of that left over hollandaise to our egg the next day! Big score there.  I totally appreciated that the bartender who took our to-go order relayed a message from the Chef who wanted to let us know the sauce might break and may not look as pretty once we got home. It didn't though and was great. We tried to get the lemon meringue pie to go but they did not think that would work well as a to-go desert and recommended other choices. I like that because I know how particular I am with how my food looks and tastes when I cook.  We got taken care of really well, we had our questions answered and the staff was efficient and friendly.  I have one gripe; I don't think this bar/restaurant should have a TV in it. It totally kills the vibe and is unnecessary in my opinion.  During the spring, Ill come for the sliding barn doors that open up to let fresh air in!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends with the intent of having a light dinner. There were too many good things on the menu and the portions were large so we ended up leaving stuffed! Chicken tenders & Mac and cheese was delicious--and much classier than it sounds. We also enjoyed one of their punches--pretty good but fairly pricey for what it was. Overall would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"My initial Haberdish experience was great! The grub and drinks were delicious and at a price point that doesn't hurt the bank. This place will definitely be on my favorites list. It can get crowded so be prepared to wait a bit.   Drinks:  - Kentucky Hello (5/5) ... Delicious   Appetizers: - Hush Puppies (5/5)  - Biscuits & Bacon Jam (4/5)  Main: - 2 piece dark fried (6/5) - Mac & Cheese with Chicken Skins (6/5)"}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend hoping to have brunch after seeing all the wonderful pictures of their brunch food. Apparently, to my disappointment, they do not serve brunch on the weekends and they only have a weekday breakfast menu, which leaves me feeling like they are missing out on a big market. The food wasn't bad and the service was okay (the bartenders were great) it just didn't live up to the hype for me. Maybe I'll have to give it a second try."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! After signing up on the wait list (it was a busy Friday night and the wait was quite long, even for one person) I was able to snag a seat at the bar. The bar staff was attentive and got my drinks and food order out quickly. The chicken and macaroni and cheese with the skin was DIVINE! I can't wait to go back again. Yum!"}
{"text":"The hype is real. That's some dang good chicken. And cocktails. And biscuits.   The secret to not waiting in line is to go for Saturday brunch. They open at 11:30am on Saturday. Splurge on their brunch cocktails. If you like bloody Mary's try their blond version and enjoy the savory/zesty flavor.   Make sure you go with friends that share so you can really sample the menu."}
{"text":"EAT AT THE BAR! Eat only apps. Drink the good drinks. Waited 2.5 hours for ok food."}
{"text":"Loved every moment at Haberdish, the service and the trendy atmosphere. Their cocktails are worth the visit"}
{"text":"Haberdish gives you a great first impression as you walk in. The bar and the restaurant have the whole Edison light bulb, open brick wall, utilitarian hipster look down, and the wait staff are friendly. Brunch was busy enough that the place appears popular, but not to the point that you decide to try somewhere else. The house julep I got was good. Was it the best I've ever tasted? No, but I did not feel ripped off, and I'm used to NYC and DC pricing.   The food, however? Only the biscuits with fixins transcended beyond \"meh.\" There was a special for the day of maciated strawberries on rice with benne seeds. Translate through the hipster filter: chopped strawberries on rice krispies and sesame seeds. This had the potential to be interesting if there was any flavor, but I have never had strawberries this bland in my life. At least I have an idea of what future synthetic strawberries may taste like if we lose the ability to grow them, and I'm not about it.  The egg tartine also lacked much in the way of seasoning. Even the waffles with fruit disappointed. As plated, the waffles came with a ton of whipped cream. Sounds great, right? Well, the cream melted quickly and the waffles arrived at the table with a very mushy consistency. The place may look promising from outside, but the food did not measure up."}
{"text":"The most delicious chicken fingers in the world. I literally dream about them. The food is family style dining so it's easy to taste a lot of things and another favorite is the gnocchi. I think the prices are decent and it's an excellent addition to the noda neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great great great !  I haven't been here where the food isn't great.  Service can be slow at times , so I would say they could work on that but the Chicken is awesome.  This is always a recommendation for me to folks who are looking for a new restaurant to try out."}
{"text":"Feeling the hanger coming on, I got on the trusty Yelp app to see what was around. Haberdish has been popping up on my socials for a while now so it piqued my interest. I saw that you could put yourself on the wait list via Yelp (!)... done and done. Parking can be a pain, but if you know the secret spots around NoDa you'll be fine. After checking in with the hostess, I made my way to the beautiful bar to order a cocktail. I decided on the Manhattan, which was deliciously crafted. The interior area was a little crazy and cramped but people were very polite and courteous. I grabbed my drink and made my way out to the front patio area. When my table was ready, they sent a text to my phone.   In terms of food, I ordered the smoked deviled eggs, biscuits with bacon jam, chicken tenders, fried chicken, mac-n-cheese, brocollini with pancetta, and okra with bacon jam. The fried chicken was jammin'. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The chicken tenders were nicely breaded and the ranch was delicious. I was pretty happy with everything. I honestly don't know what would make this place 5-stars for me, but it just wasn't. Maybe a second trip will get that 5th star."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become our absolute favorite.    I'm Vegan and to find a restaurant with such great choices, has been a true find. My husband loves the  deviled eggs and Fried chicken. We both love the Blond Bloody Mary's. Atmosphere is welcoming and fits well with the entire NODA scene. We use the no wait app and it has made a huge difference in our wait time.  Just can't say enough about this restaurant. The farm to table concept is delicious. We have and will continue to dine here often."}
{"text":"I wanted to wait until we tried it again before reviewing, Since we first went for dinner on their fourth night open.  The first night we both had chicken.  Her the white meat, me the tenders.  So damn tasty.  We had the roasted okra, mac and cheese, smoked deviled eggs, and tater tots in accompaniment.  All were extremely satisfying.  Those smoked deviled eggs are insane and my lady loves the okra. We made our second pass tonight with her mother.  Luckily, we got there early as the place was pretty full by 730.  The ladies stuck with what we knew on sides and chicken.  I ventured over to the pork shank.  The portions were all of a healthy size and everything was delicious.  We added the daily special pickled beets as well.  Tasty. They have the same ambitious sort of cocktails from Colleen that they do at Crepe Cellar, with a solid beer and wine list. We also enjoyed the banana pudding and the ice cream of the day, a raspberry cheesecake. The decor is homey and inviting with the dishes coming out like they just came out of your grandmother's china cabinet.   This is a solid addition to the neighborhood with fantastic gourmet southern fair.  I cannot wait until spring when they open up the barn doors."}
{"text":"Being in the South, you often find the food industry over-saturated with restaurants that claim to specialize in Southern food with a twist or Southern fusion. I've tried enough to say that Haberdish does it best. My friends and I stopped by before their grand opening night, and went family style with their sides of mac 'n cheese, kale grits, tater tots, charred okra (personal favorite) and kale salad. Everything was spectacular. We also ordered chicken tenders at $2/each, which were lightly fried and delightfully succulent.   If you're not in the mood for food, Haberdish also has a selection of craft cocktails and a cozy bar that reminds of The Coupe in DC. I highly recommend the Black Manhattan. If I remember correctly, the bartenders added cherry-vanilla bitters using a medicine dropper. Their recipes are precise, and their drinks are worth going for."}
{"text":"This place had a lot of hype and it totally delivered!   I've been there twice and everything I ordered was outstanding.  The cocktails are top notch as well.   Still need to do the Sunday brunch there, looks great.  The Alabama chicken is a must but like I said I enjoyed everything I tried."}
{"text":"After reading about Haberdish (seemingly everywhere lately), we decided to go tonight.  The general vibe and decor are spot-on.  Contemporary industrial(ish) without feeling contrived or \"me too\".  Our server was quick to greet us and always tended to our table - she was sweet and helpful but not overly sugary.  We got there about 545P (on a Tues) and were seated right away.  There were only a handful of tables occupied then, but within about 30mins, the place was packed.   We got hushpuppies for an app and the chicken-fried cauliflower steaks for dinner with sides of savory bread pudding and mac & cheese as sides to share.  We got a double order of m&c and it was a huuuge plate's worth!  Could've easily done the single order and would have been plenty, but we had lots of leftovers to take home.  Everything we had was phenomenal and had a hard time picking a favorite dish.  We were so impressed with the meal that we ordered the chocolate sheet cake (not a whole one...) for dessert and it did not disappoint.  Prices are more than reasonable, especially considering the high quality of the food and great service, and the portions are extremely generous.  We arrived very hungry and left stuffed (with more than half our meals in to-go bags too!).  Needless to say, we loved it and will definitely be back.  What a great addition to Noda and the Charlotte culinary scene."}
{"text":"Was overall very pleased trying out this new spot in Noda. A group of us went on a Saturday evening, and knowing it'd be crazy, looked into reservation options. Luckily, you can add your name to the waitlist right from the Yelp app!  The deviled eggs were fresh, sides including mac & cheese and carrots were really good, and the chicken tenders were tasty, though if you're picky about chicken and don't like a heavy breading when fried, it may not be the best menu choice for you. The sweet potato dumplings were just ok. The mint juleps were refreshing and served in nice glasses.  Will definitely try it again, perhaps for brunch when some of the buzz dies off a bit."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Went for chicken and waffles... it was a Wednesday. Chicken and waffles are Sundays only! Got chicken with Alabama white sauce instead. Great! Loved the flavor and freshness of the chicken.   Returned on a Sunday for chicken and waffles -- fried chicken cooked well but could be more flavorful, waffle was satisfying, wasn't a fan of syrup (chicken and waffle didn't even need it!) Carrots were odd but enjoyable.  A fan of the decor inside and outside.   Will return!"}
{"text":"After an evening of shopping my friend and started searching for a new and trendy place to grab dinner. Haberdish popped up and the ability to get on the waiting list via Yelp. We wrapped up shopping and headed over to NODA.  The streets were packed but there was plenty of parking at the Y which is right in front of Haberdish. It was raining but there's a covered patio and a few tables outside. We got a table near the center and our waiter was quick to take a drink order.  The cocktail menu is unique with some old fashion libations with some interesting twist. The table next to us ordered a bowl of punch that was served table side from a beautiful bowl.   The food is served  a la carte and family style. The appetizers are plenty for 2 - 3. We had the deviled eggs and biscuits with bacon jam which I would certainly have again. The fried chicken and tenders were recommended but they were not amazing just okay. The Mac and cheese noodles were way under done but it had a good flavor.   It's hard to order dessert here when Popbar is across the street but the waffle with homemade buttermilk ice cream sounds like a winner."}
{"text":"Outstanding decor but the menu doesn't do much for me.  Drove down to NoDa from Cornelius today from brunch at Haberdish. I't gotten a lot of very good reviews across several platforms and maybe I ordered the wrong items, but it did not do much for me. More on that coming up.  Parking in NoDa is a pain but that is true for any venue in NoDa so be aware and don't let that bother you. Just be prepared to cope with it.  When you enter Haberdish, the interior is outstanding. Very light and attractive with the use of light to create a place of beauty. The bar is particularly well done and obviously, well appointed.  Service is excellent and we were immediately greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. Our server was there immediately with menu and to take our beverage orders..We both ordered coffee and since she was not driving, I ordered her a drink called a Love Potion which is as close to a Bellini as I could come.  Looking over the menu created a problem for my wife. She is on a diet and trying to stay away from fried foods and carbohydrates and there was little on the menu that did not fall into one of these two categories. There was a brined smoked Chicken but the smallest portion was a half a Chicken which is a bit or a large serving.  She ended up with the Kale Salad which turned out to be excellent and the Chared Okra which was OK although the texture was a  bit different.  I order the two piece Fried Chicken all white meat along with Corn Pudding and Chared Okra as well. I know that a wing is technically white meat because of the chemical makeup but to me, I still do not consider it White Meat.  The 2 pieces of White Meat turned out to be one breast and one wing, both overcooked with little flavor outside the coating on the outside and very dry. I felt the same way as my wife about the Chared Okra.  On the other hand, the Corn Pudding was the surprise of the meal. Simply but very flavorful like my mother used to make in the Summer when the Sweet Corn came into the Garden. This was the high light of our meal.  Again. maybe I chose the wrong items because there were another of other items on the menu that looked good and I could have tried. Family at the next table had the Mac and Cheese and it looked great. Maybe I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Four stars for the ambience. 3.5 for the food. Service was average during busy dinner. Nice place to take a date if you are looking to dine outdoors. Their outdoor eating area has a motorized ceiling that adjusts depending on how much sunlight is out. More shade during high sun and more open during dusk and evening. Food for me didn't really stand out."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening. I was under the impression it was a very small estblishment. But they have a good amount of seating. Inside had a wait, so we sat in the outer portion with no wait(right where you can see the entrance to Mangos). Good amount inspects flying around that kept flying into my eyes. Very annoying.   Stephanie was our server. 3 of a us shared a family style Mac and cheese with chicken skins. It has was ok, had a kick to it. And each of us end up chicken tenders and a waffle. Overall it was ok. It could be a option to return in the future, but I'd like to explore some of the other restaurants in NoDa."}
{"text":"OK, I took off a star for the wanna be hipster bartender who was too busy rolling her eyes to sell us the bottle of wine we wanted to purchase. Haberdish is a splurge. In fat and calories.  Prices are actually reasonable. Go for the bustle and food. They actually make ordinary things (carrots?) taste good. Even interesting. The chicken tenders are huge and to die for even if you are older than 8. The hush puppies are luscious. Recipe to a happy night...Expect good fried food and be prepared to get over the service"}
{"text":"This place has a way of pulling you in but outside of the decor, the menu was very short (maybe 5 items) and left a lot to be desired. Luckily, I was there for Saturday brunch and the chicken and waffle special was quite the steal! Two full pieces of chicken (choice of white or dark meat) and a sweet waffle (comes with honey, not syrup...but available upon request). The chicken was fried crispy and seasoned to perfection. The waffle wasn't my fave but wasn't bad. I also tried a side of Mac and cheese...pretty tasty. My friends had cocktails and enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Awesome. Had the 2 piece dark chicken, okra, Mac and cheese (with skins) and pickles to start.  All excellent.  Also had an old fashioned and they know what they are doing. This is a no BS place- do the chicken right +Make a solid old fashioned + Delicious Mac and cheese = winner. I will go back for sure and this will be the first restaurant I recommend to anyone visiting Charlotte. Cheers."}
{"text":"A beautifully designed Southern-style eatery. Some of my favorite dishes that I recommend trying here are the house pickles, sweet potato dumplings, mac and cheese, and fried chicken. You will not leave here hungry. Haberdish is also known for their amazing handcrafted cocktails and punches, so do not miss out on those if you enjoy a drink with dinner!"}
{"text":"Probably a 4.5 star (if Yelp let me give half stars). The meal was amazing. My husband and I nearly sampled a little bit of everything and then had leftovers for days.   Smoked Deviled eggs: Delicious. There wasn't too much smoke and just had all around great flavor.  Hush puppies w/ sweet tea butter: yes. And that butter. It's amazing.  Fried chicken: near perfect. It's definitely a must-have. And could very easily be the best I've ever had.   Charred okra: perfectly done. And the okra wasn't slimy (which, really, is a risk anywhere you go).  Mac & Cheese: So tasty it would make my mama proud.  Kale Grits: not bad - but it was my least favorite side we ordered.   Beer and drink selection is perfectly on point. My husband had a cocktail and it looked divine. I can't wait to go back post-baby to sample!"}
{"text":"The food here is quite good. Only the inattentive service and a disingenuous move on the menu prevent me from giving Haberdish five stars.  We decided to visit Haberdish on a Sunday night. It was busy, unsurprising given the hubbub online about the place. We used Yelp to get onto the waitlist, and when we arrived fifty minutes later, we still were back in the queue for a table. Things cleared out after the last football game ended, however, and we were seated no long after that.  Others have spilt much Yelp ink about the decor, so I won't delve too far into there. Suffice it to say that it's a modern rustic look. I especially loved the exposed beams in the ceiling. Apparently, a furniture maker converted some of the wood from the original ceiling into the tables at which we were now sitting. Pretty cool.  We ordered the kale salad, chicken tenders, and the trout. Everything was really, really delicious. The kale salad was finely chopped, the citrus fresh, and the salad sparsely dressed (which, with a thick dressing like pomegranate molasses here, I appreciate). My wife tells me the chicken tenders were, well, tender. The trout was also excellent: moist, full of flavor. It could have used a little less oil in the bath on the plate on which it was served, but that's a small gripe.  The service was less stellar. Our waiter was friendly, but absent. After we ordered, we barely saw him. Water refills? Not so much. Around the time our food arrived, he told me he'd bring me a refill on my ginger ale. I finally saw that refill about the time the check came, some twenty or thirty minutes later.   And then there's the shenanigans with the whiskey list. It's not bad, although not as extensive as, say, Midwood Smokehouse. But the prices are a ruse. There's a price listed next to each whiskey. Fine, that's normal. But hidden at the top, there's a qualifier, that goes something like this:  Neat, rocks, up: +3 Cocktails: +4  Well, that's confusing. This qualifier isn't readily apparent--I had looked at the list for five minutes before noticing it. (Maybe I'm just dumb--that's a possibility.)  I asked the waiter. Apparently, the price listed is for a shot of the whiskey, or if one orders the whiskey with cola or soda water.  Now, this is just disingenuous. That price could work if the whiskey list consisted of Jack and Crown, as sure, those are mixers or shooters. But Jefferson's Oceans (a really excellent bourbon, by the way), is neither. I assume that no one is having a Jefferson's Ocean with Coke, or no bachelor party is coming in and downing five shots of it. It's drank neat or on the rocks, as are many--probably 95%--of the whiskies on their list. 95% of those whiskies will be ordered neat or on the rocks. Surprise! You just spent extra money.  Put another way, I order whiskey out a lot, and I've never--never!--seen a restaurant try to pull this one off. In New York, it would get a restaurant ran out of town. Just imagine the Brandy Library trying to pull this one off.  That's not enough to knock the restaurant down more than a star, though. Avoid the overpriced, dishonest whiskey pricing and come for the great food."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I tried what was probably the best chicken biscuit in Charlotte. It was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I also had a kale salad that was unique and flavorful. I did not care for their diet cola, but I'd love to come back and try a cocktail. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Def worth the hype. My brother and I got the cauliflower steak, fried chicken, sweet potato dumplings, smoked deviled eggs, and the Brussels sprout daily special. Everything was incredible. Huge portions also. Would 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with a great outside sitting area. The food in general was overall good and decently priced. I was not a fan of the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal - the chicken & waffles, with a side of kale grits.  I grew up in the deep south, so I'm always a little skeptical when somewhere not in GA, MS or AL tries to serve southern dishes - but Haberdish was spot on with their food.  It was delicious.  And although I normally don't like anything but butter in my grits - the kale grits were good!    The inside had a cozy and comfortable feeling - they had tables for large groups or communal dining, as well as individual tables.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected find. Husband and I are walking down the street looking for a late night bite to eat on our last night in town. We walked up and down NODA to find this lovely spot. It wasn't too busy so we went on into the bar area since March Madness was on tv. We got greeted by a cool bartender (love the Legends of the Hidden temple throwback shirt) and gave us some waters while we looked at the menu.  A look at the menu showed some craft cocktail drinks. I don't know how to emphasize that this was truly craft rather than just throwing that name out there. I ordered the Honey Hibiscus Punch and it has got to be one of the smoothest drinks I have ever ordered. My husband ordered the Peach Keen Punch. It had bourbon in it (something I'm not a big fan of), but after a sip - I think I could have ordered and enjoyed it myself since it was just as smooth to drink.  After enjoying a few sips, we decided to order some appetizers and small plates as our late dinner. I ordered some smoked deviled eggs. Husband and I shared his mac and cheese with spicy chicken skins. He got a plate of some of their fried chicken.  I like the twist on the food. I love me some deviled eggs and loved how smooth the filling was. I could taste the smoky flavors, but happily not overwhelmed. The fried chicken was tasty and the meat was tender. The mac and cheese was a big serving despite getting the smaller size. We're not big on spice, but the chicken skins were still enjoyable despite our weak palette for it.  I loved the vibe of the place. It was rustic with the wood touches and felt modern with the clean lines of the place. The staff was down to earth and welcoming. A one of a kind spot with some smooth drinks and a nice twist on southern food."}
{"text":"I've been here two times, and both times have been awesome! The price is super affordable for very fresh and awesome food (the pimento cheese, hush puppies with sweet tea butter, and fried chicken are a must!!), and the cocktails are absolutely fabulous as well. Saturday night is hard to get a table, but we went for Sunday lunch and literally had no wait!"}
{"text":"Haberdish lives up to the hype! The ambience is rustic chic and cozy but well-lit enough for you to actually see your food.  The service was great, especially the hostess - very attentive and kept us informed on our table status when our party's arrival times were staggered. Boiled peanuts and hush puppies to start, then the fried chicken tenders and family style sides - okra with bacon jam, mac and cheese and sweet potato dumplings. Everything was delicious! I appreciate how the neighborhood's history is intentionally incorporated - from the traditional southern staples with a twist to the mismatched dishes that remind me of Sunday dinners at my grandmother's house."}
{"text":"This place is super nice inside scenery is great. The wait staff is really good full of personality. Their drink menu as expected is very good. The place is new so the food needs a little help to be 5 star. The fried chicken and pork is good the sides need some help especially the Brussel sprout salad it was really bad. The Ocre also needs so additional flavor."}
{"text":"The sides are AMAZING.  The okra is my favorite.  The fried chicken tastes like my aunt is in the chicken.  I love the cocktail list.  I have never had anything from this restaurant that I didn't like or felt could be better.  I just wish they had a more extensive dessert menu."}
{"text":"We picked this place because it had a good selection of meatless options. Glad we did! Cauliflower steak was delicious, wonderful biscuit, and tasty salad. The pimento cheese was really good, and maybe a little big for only two (we found a way)."}
{"text":"I  this place!!! Must try the smoked deviled eggs and the house made jalapeño hot sauce."}
{"text":"Overrated, wait was very long it took forever to get our drinks so we left after that."}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant with good customer service looked at other comments and pics so I had to try it out and was not disappointed but didn't like the sweet potato dumplings everybody was raving about but the chicken was the best thing to me and the kale salad the hush puppies really all and all a good experience"}
{"text":"We have been to Haberdish twice now and have yet to have something we didn't love. I would recommend this restaurant along with Davidson Street Public House as the two mush try places in NoDa.   The old brick building housing the restaurant was abandoned a year and a half ago when I first came to Charlotte. They have done an amazing job turning something that looked like a tear down into a building with character and great ambiance. I'm excited to dine in the outdoor patio when the weather gets better. They have large barn doors in the inside space that open up to connect the two areas.   Of course you have to get the fried chicken. The 2 piece dark meat, a thigh and leg, is only $6 and the two piece white is $8. Not a bad deal for the quality they offer. It's hands down the best fried chicken I've had in the city and maybe anywhere. I love the extra crispy crust, seasoned to perfection and the tender moist meat inside. Fried chicken doesn't seem like it would be hard to do right, but it really is. They've figured out how to make it just the way I like it.   So far we've a handful of sides - the sweet potato dumplings, mac and cheese, hush puppies, house pickles, and the cornbread bread pudding. They have all been excellent, particularly the hush puppies and dumplings.   The full bar has a decent selection of beers and a great variety of cocktails.   Luckily I live right down the street so I can now frequent this place as much as I want. The food is decadent so I'll probably keep it to once a month at best."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Prices are very reasonable. I am a vegetarian so I have never had the chicken, but I like to fill up on the sides. I love the pickles, Mac and cheese, deviled eggs, and hush puppies."}
{"text":"One of the best spots for southern food in Charlotte. We got mac n cheese, chicken fingers, biscuits, and hush puppies. It is one of our favorite places in the city. The drinks are average, but all of the food has been great. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Rounded out a weekend of good friends and good food with a stop at Haberdish. A very cool location in NoDa, and they do a great job of decorating along their southern theme.   Dinner consisted of hush puppies (appetizer), two pieces of friend chicken with fried okra and kale grits on the side, and the lemon tart (dessert). The hush puppies were delicious, but I think it's probably hard to screw that up. My favorite part was the fried chicken. Two good sized pieces (a breast and a wing) that were so SO good. Not too much breading, thick, and juicy - full of flavor. The fried okra was also a show-stopper. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale grits, but I have a bias against kale for no good reason! I'm not usually a big dessert person, but the lemon tart was great.  The service was not inattentive, but was slower than I would have liked, hence the four stars. We ended up spending close to two hours! Overall a great experience though."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place and can't wait to return!  We went on a Friday night around 6:30 and we're seated right away. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. We all ordered the chicken in some form as our entree and all loved it. Full of flavor, juicy inside and crunchy outside. We started out with the hush puppies and deviled eggs and everyone agreed both were delicious. Though the mac and cheese was OK, the cornbread pudding and tater tots were on point. Can't wait to return to try the grits, biscuits and cauliflower steak. Plus their dessert menu looked amazing!! I'll need to save room when we go next."}
{"text":"Great meal and service. Beautiful restaurant. Place was packed but we managed to be seated in a cozy corner. Everything was delicious. Cheese straws were tasty! Chicken tenders and Mac and cheese were both spot on. All in all, really affordable and we will definitely back."}
{"text":"OOHHH MYYYY foood coma!!!! SOOOOOO good.  Their punch bowls are beautiful!! And everything I had was incredibly delicious.  Do not come here if you are on a diet because you will want to try everything and then you will want to eat all of it."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. Everything we ate (destroyed) was delicious. A great bourbon and cocktail menu that pairs well with the food they offer as well."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this, by far BEST Restaurant, Dining Experience in Charlotte!!! Chicken so good made the Colonel $hit his country white suit pants. Cocktails are imaginative and wonderful. Oh those sweet potato dumplings, savory pillows filled in heaven by gastronomic angels. Mac-n-Cheese with the Chicken Skin Cracklings, the devil made me get seconds! Speaking of the devil, the Deviled Eggs are perfection especially since you get two double halves per order (no fighting over that odd half like other places make you because they are chinchy or the cook was hungry). If you are on a date, gotta try the pickled veggies of the day - fondly brings out that pucker face you know you wanna see. The Kale Citrus Salad is refreshing and crisp.  Attentive & Knowledgeable Staff.  Great value for quality, ambience & service. Your well behaved dog is welcome at one of the outdoor sidewalk tables (My Isabella loves coming here every week)."}
{"text":"The meat selection was limited to chicken. We ordered tenders, Mac n cheese, pimento cheese and sweet potatoes and it was all, eh. Tenders were too over cooked, the Mac was very bland, the potatoes tasted like pasta and the pimento cheese had a cinnamon taste to it that I wasn't too fond of. The best part of it all was the Motown oldies music playing and our servers. They were personable and outgoing. However, I won't be going back :("}
{"text":"Delicious and wonderful Southern Inspired food. Service and atmosphere were great as well! Sweet Potato dumplings were my favorite!"}
{"text":"V confused about the reviews, Haberdish was overpriced and average at best. They also have some of the steepest cocktail prices I've ever seen in Charlotte: $11-$15 what? The fried chicken and biscuit were decent but all of our sides were awful. One reviewed below hit it spot on.. someone has a super heavy hand with garlic salt on the mac and cheese, that's literally all you can taste. Kale salad is tiny for $7, okra was oily and bland. Service is also pretty apathetic, no water refills, dishes left on the table even after we paid the check."}
{"text":"This is hand down THE BEST fried chicken in Charlotte. Everything I've had here down to their pickles is amazing. They offer so many unique cocktails and even punch bowls for bigger crowds. I take all of my visitors here and they still talk about Haberdish and how amazing their experience was. Pro tip: my boyfriend and I get a whole chicken even though there are just two of us. It makes great leftovers. The best side dish is their cornbread pudding and we always get the kale salad. Definitely share everything. You wouldn't get to taste everything if you ordered a meal for yourself. They use Nowait if you don't want to wait in line and if you find yourself waiting, grab a seat at the bar, get a pre dinner donut at reigning donuts around the corner (we have actually done this) or grab a drink at the common market a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Good aesthetic, good food, good drinks. Definitely come on a weekend and try the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday & loved it. Highly recommend: the hush puppies, any fried chicken, and the okra and Mac and cheese sides. The food was fun & great portions. The restaurant is really well designed. Cocktails were great, and the service was wonderful. Can't wait to go back! (Definitely use the app for the line-- the wait is intense)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It's a beautiful restaurant with a good drink menu and delicious food. We started with the deviled eggs, house made pickles, and hush puppies, all really good. Then has chicken tenders, creamed kale grits, and the mac and cheese. Everything was shareable so and portioned perfectly for two people. Our server was awesome! No bad recs. The drinks are good too!!"}
{"text":"OMG, this family sharing Resturant is always popping in the Noda area ... screened in porch with the best southern feel coupled with friend Chicken, Mac and cheese, hush puppies and pickles!!! My friends and I truly enjoy everything about this place"}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places. You have to be committed to a good Southern dinner but if you are...best restaurant in Charlotte! Order the chicken tenders and don't look back :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vibe and decor of Haberdish. I would say that their menu does lack a little variety as far as entrees go. I split a few dishes with a friend of mine and we didn't try the fried chicken (probably should have based on the fact that that's what everyone said is the best). We had the pickles, one of their salads (which was pretty large as a starter). We opted for the \"healthier\" chicken option which was roasted and it was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed everything that we ate.  Their service was a little wonky, and that could be because they are still fairly new. If you order a cocktail, the bartender will bring it to your table. You have a server, but you may see a few faces as your plates come out. There was some confusion surrounding the wine that we ordered. It finally got squared away by the time our entree was already out.  Despite the slightly unorganized serving style, we really enjoyed are time here. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went in for brunch on a Friday and were able to grab a table without a problem. We camped out there for a good part of the day getting some work done and there were always some open tables around us. We sat on their covered patio and it was a great place to enjoy some fresh air, but still be cozy on a late fall day. They have heaters out there that they were happy to turn on until the sun warmed up the place a bit more.   The brunch menu was super southern and an interesting mix of things. You don't really see the traditional brunch items on there, but you can order eggs any way and add in all sorts of sides. My group shared a bunch of small plates and sides and by the time the mains came I was already pretty full. The mac and cheese with crispy chicken skin was awesome, would definitely get that again. The cinnamon roll was good, but I'm not sure I'd order it again. The hushpuppies were some of the best I've ever had, super light and flavorful (light considering it is still a fried ball of dough). The kale salad and pickles were tasty as well. For my main I got the bone broth chicken soup. The broth was super tasty, a little too many veggies for my taste as it was hard to get a big spoonful of broth with some many thick veggies in the way. The beet tartine was also a hit as well as the chicken tenders!   On to the cocktails! You can just take a look at the photos and see they take their cocktails seriously. Ice cube flowers anyone? A few of us were between the traditional Bloody Mary and the yellow bloody Mary. Our waitress explained them both to us and offered to bring a sample of each so we could try it. I ended up going for the yellow bloody Mary, it tasted fresh and lighter than your usual. The rest of the cocktails ordered at our table were a hit as well. Overall just an awesome place to hit up!"}
{"text":"BEST restaurant in Charlotte. Order the savory corn bread pudding and experience the culinary work of the gods. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Five stars for a strong start! I rarely visit restaurants in the first month or two of opening, but my dinner on Saturday, January 7 made me want to return again and again, both with locals and friends from out of town.   We were able to score three seats at the bar about 20 minutes before they closed the kitchen, so we quickly ordered a cornucopia of southern staples: biscuits and bacon jam, fried chicken, brined smoked chicken with smooth Alabama white sauce, sweet potato dumplings, mac and cheese, tater tots and charred okra. All of these things were delicious and came out on separate plates that made it perfect for sharing.   That being said, the hushpuppies took the prize for best snack; the fried cornmeal dough and sweet tea butter were amazing. They had the right balance of not-too-crunchy exterior and pillow-soft inside...I would say the hushpuppies had more in common with a donut hole than your standard southern kitchen fare.   I'll echo Nikki W's comments that it is good to be prepare with limited parking. My dining companions were impressed with their cocktails and our service was great, especially considering that weekend's dusting of snow that psyched everyone out with expectations for real accumulation.   We took a piece of the fried chicken home, along with a biscuit and okra with bacon jam, and all were delicious the second time around. I wish we had saved room for dessert, as the selection looked amazing. Next time I'm trying the savor corn bread pudding and fried chicken tenders. Cloth napkins, a real bar and a nice price make Haberdish a can't miss addition to NoDa!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest it's definitely Charlotte's hottest restaurant right now for a reason. The deviled eggs are drool worthy and the fried chicken is perfection. I love their no wait app so you can grab a drink somewhere in Noda while you wait. I hope it stays this good for a longggg time! I can't wait to try their brunch now."}
{"text":"Visited Haberdish for brunch after one of my clients raved about their fried chicken. We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday. There was a 10 minute wait while they cleared tables. The ambience was chill, southern inspired.  There were copper accents throughout. The utensils, lights, shelves, were all copper.  On Sundays they have chicken and waffles. You choose your type of chicken (dark, white or tenders) and the waffle add on is $4. We ordered the huspuppies to start. The texture was fantastic. They were crispy on the outside and pillowy soft inside, served with sweet tea butter. We both opted for the chicken and waffles, white meat. For the sides, which are served family style, we got mac n cheese (w/crispy chicken skins), and sweet potato dumplings. The chicken was wonderful! Crispy,  juicy and well seasoned. The mac and cheese was ok. Nothing to rave about. The dumplings weren't good at all, we'll pass on those next time.  Drink wise, the menu is decent. Lots of craft cocktails, good bourbon and beer selection. I had the peachy keen with flower ice. The ice had a full rose inside. They don't have coke or Pepsi products, instead offering house made sodas.  All in all, it was good. We'll definitely return. Good service as well. Great spot for apps and drinks for sure."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and loved it. The Aperol spritz was perfect. Chicken and Waffles delicious. The fried chicken was crispy, juicy, flavorful and not greasy. Rather than maple syrup they serve a honey based sauce that has both sweet and savory elements (did I taste a hint of Worcestershire sauce in the housemade creation?)  Service was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was casual, rustic and urban all at the same time. A lot of attention to detail with the decor made it all come together using a lot of reclaimed materials.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First, here's what has to happen to get at ***** review.   * Staff is uneven. Some care, some don't. Waitress for the evening disappeared without a word to go home. Had to ask bartender for check ... which she processed with a great attitude. Welcome was underwhelming for a party of four, all above age 65. We had a total of four waiters plus a runner. Attending to the table was poor with us twice getting up from the table to ask for more wine, for example. Checking backing with the table was unacceptable with large times between even asking if we were ready to order. * Wine prices are double full retail or more. This is unacceptable. The Jordan Chardonnay can be found in stores for around $30-32; their price was $70. Since this is more of a bar than a restaurant, and since their wine list is so very small -- though nicely chosen -- I would not visit again with wine drinkers. We chose the Stellina Pinot Gringio (2 bottles) and the Jordan Chardonnay. * It seems that they are, in part, chef driven. The \"Biscuits & Jam\" had to be replaced because the biscuits were too hard to eat! This should not have been served! I actually took my knife and banged on the biscuit before it was removed! However, the deviled eggs are spectacular and recommended. The pimento cheese ball was also a hit. These are, of course, perfect bar food items and not restaurant appetizers but \"snacks\" as listed on the menu. Another favorite was the Liver Mush Toast. I asked if it was Neese's (a local provider less than one mile away), and the waitress was unsure. It was recommended by the clean plate, though. * The two entrees came with nothing ... that's nothing! No bread, no waffles, no nothing; all was a la carte. The pan fried trout was well cooked but a bit salty. The fried chicken was crunchy beyond belief; it makes KFC Extra Crispy seem soggy. For my taste, this experience reminded me of crunching ice, and the herbs in the copious breading gave an odd sense of burnt (which it wasn't) frying. For real Southern fried chicken, I suggest changing the breading to something traditional and frying in one of your cast iron skillets and not in a deep fryer. Also, the Anson Mills grits with kale is just plain weird, It reminded me of Irish steel-cut oats. BTW, I am an Anson Mills customer, just so you know. * The banana pudding was a huge hit.  If you're looking for a neighborhood bar with aspirations of \"sports\" and the loud pop music that often accompanies, and you're hungry for good bar food, this would be a fine choice. The care that is taken with the food is uneven (yes, I observed the kitchen) and it depends on when you come and the age of your party; young, energetic tables seem to attract the most attention. In some ways, this is understandable, but it in others it is just stupid. Our table of four old guys dropped an over $200 tab while the table of four cute girls next over spent a total of $55. 'nuff said?"}
{"text":"My wife and I met another couple here for dinner because of a recommendation from a friend.  I'm so glad that we decided to go. The food was amazing!  The chicken tenders are huge and the dipping sauces are homemade.  We couldn't make up our minds on side dishes, so we ordered 6 of them to share at the table.  I can't say which one was the best because they each were soooo good.  If I had to pick, it would probably be the tater tots."}
{"text":"This place deserves all the accolades it's been getting. Great, open space in the dining room that blends perfectly into the bar area. Service was excellent. Food was outstanding! Traditional southern classics elevated. The changes are subtle and only accentuate the best qualities of the dishes. You'll be hard pressed to find better deviled eggs anywhere. Fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and FULL of flavor. The brine adds flavor and keeps the meat from drying out."}
{"text":"It was a good atmosphere, I got the specialty chicken. Nothing bad to say at all about this place"}
{"text":"The food is ok, let's just say their appetizers and sides are the best things they have on their menu. The guy host is great, but as for our server...can't say the same. Sadly to say I won't be back. Foster and last time."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I am not the biggest fan of \"Southern Food\", even being from the south myself. Their food was very good, however, I think I had extremely high expectations after talking to friends and reading other yelp reviews that I went in from the viewpoint as if \"the sides and chicken were essentially from the gods themselves\".   I went here for the first time with a very large group (11 people) on a Sunday night and there was no wait, which was great! The ambiance is incredible, having both inside and outside seating (part of which is covered so you will not be basking in the sun). Our waitress was very accommodating and extremely knowledgeable and helpful. It is not too loud or quite, and you can either make it a fancy date night or a casual dinner with friends.   Thier drink menu is semi-expensive, consisting of mostly very fancy cocktails. However, I ordered a simple bloody mary and was NOT disappointed (the mix was similar to Zing-Zang).   For food, I ordered two chicken fingers (with multiple sauces) and the kale salad side. I really enjoy that they give you the option to order your chicken fingers individually (similar to what other yelpers have written). However, I wasn't head-over-heels, absolutely in love with them. To be honest, they were good (clearly better than fast-food chicken fingers), but not great, I wasn't really IN LOVE with them, like other yelpers have made it seem. The kale salad was really good as well (it came with goat cheese and oranges on top, which complemented the other flavors very nicely). I tried the tater tots as well and those were also good. I had a bite of the mac-and-cheese and it was extremely creamy and cheesy.   My biggest cons with Haberdash (and why I gave it a 3/5) would be that the menu is not that diverse in terms of light versus heavy dishes, and that the price point is just way too expensive for the amount/quality.   Like I said in the very beginning, I am not the biggest fan of 'southern food', but I do enjoy having fattening, creamy, what-your-southern-grandma-would-make food once in a while. I may have ordered different and more sides/appetizers if there were more options to complement all of the VERY heavy options. Second, the price point is annoying in itself. Everything is a la carte (which really bugs me when I have to pay extra for sides). The small kale salad was 7 dollars (see in picture) and I wish I had either gotten more or would have cost less. I think a lot of people end up getting the chicken fingers simply because they are the only thing on the menu that is appropriate for the price.  All of the other food that our table order looked and tasted delicious as well (I had a few bite of other random sides). I do not doubt that people will keep going here, I just think there are better options for your money out in downtown NODA or throughout Charlotte.   I would suggest giving this place a try if you haven't. Either you will be like the majority of reviews and absolutely love this place. Or you will be like me, where you aren't exactly disappointed, you just aren't WOW-ed by it. I am glad I went here, but I do not think I will be returning unless it is for a birthday party or group dinner."}
{"text":"Is everyone else drinking the Kool-Aid? The fella and I made a special trip to NoDa from Fort Mill to hit Haberdish, and we got there 2 minutes after they opened. There were already two groups at the bar and three groups seated; apparently this is the hot ticket in town.  I loved the atmosphere - twinkling lights, a magical bar, cozy lighting, and massive, wooden garage doors that open up to the outdoor patio on nice days. There are two unobtrusive TVs over the bar so you can keep up with the games, too.  We started with the pimento cheese ball ($9). We were hoping for a good, Southern pimento cheese, but it was a little sweet and didn't have much of a kick. It was rolled in pecans and served with Granny Smith apple slices and crackers. Huh.  For dinner, I got the fried chicken tenders($2.50 per)  and sweet potato dumplings ($4). The chicken tenders were pretty bland, but the honey mustard cleared my sinuses. When the dumplings didn't look like dumplings, I asked the waitress about it... she said they mistakenly brought the bread pudding. She left the bread pudding and brought dumplings. Ironically enough, I liked the bread pudding better. The dumplings were covered in Parmesan cheese, so they lost all sweetness I was expecting from sweet potatoes.  The fella got the fried chicken ($6 leg and thigh), and he said it was pretty bland, too. He got the macaroni and cheese as a side ($4), and although it was cheesy, it was pretty thin. I like a thick, hearty cheese, so perhaps that's just an opinion thing?  Our waitress Marnie was nice enough, but it took so long to get a drink that we almost canceled our order. Apparently the bartenders bring the drinks, not the waiters, but when we asked where our drink was, she said, \"Oh, that comes from the bar.\" Ummm, could you maybe check on it?  Man, I hate that we had such a blah experience because I was SO excited to try Haberdish. Thankfully, Crepe Cellar is right next door."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... I think I'll be dreaming about this fried chicken for the rest of my life. We LOVE this place. My favorite thing to do here is to come as a foursome and eat family style (which is also their recommendation). We get one whole fried chicken and 3 sides and it's more than enough to leave us all FULL and HAPPY. :)   Last time we got the livermush appetizer on toast which was good, but a little small for a shared appetizer. We got the whole chicken and our 3 sides were the kale salad, the macaroni and cheese (with the added fried chicken skin crumbles on top, of course) and the sweet potato dumplings. They were all delicious.  The cocktail game is also on point here. I love their mules. They do a solid Moscow Mule and Kentucky Mule (with bourbon).   And, at the end of the night, we didn't have sticker shock on our bill due to the fair pricing and family style eats. We'll be back for many double date nights or friend groups to come."}
{"text":"Best place on the block hands down. Cocktails, chicken fingers (yes chicken fingers!), and darn near everything I've tried on that menu is phenomenal!!!! Try the ribs, try the Mac and cheese but make sure to add the chicken skins too it and if you like it spicy use the sauce on the table! I think I just talked myself into dinner!"}
{"text":"Their side dishes are all so delicious but the fried cauliflower was way too much salt and breading, I couldn't finish it. I'll be back to try the cocktails next time."}
{"text":"Y'all.. this Mac and cheese is life! Make sure you get it with spicy chicken skin on top. You just can't go wrong with fried chicken that tastes this good for the price point. To say Haberdish is my favorite CLT restaurant is an understatement. It's a must-go place for any out of towners!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Our sever was great. We had a ten top for brunch and received all of our food in a timely manner. The restaurant was beautiful! Great southern cooked meal with a simple but elegant twist!"}
{"text":"Suggestions: Hush puppies, pimento cheese, chicken and waffles, sweet potatoe dumplings  and mac and cheese. We ordered half orders and shared ... very good ... great brunch spot"}
{"text":"I AM SO SERIOUS THEY HAVE THE BEST CHICKEN IN ALL OF CHARLOTTE! I really had to use all caps just to convey how impressed we were with the chicken. I mean it was absolutely incredible!! Cocktails and draft beers were amazing as well. It's definitely an amazing place to do an a la carte brunch for you and a few friends. Love the vibe, obviously obsessed with the food, and the establishment as a whole."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN TENDERS! The service at the bar is always great and the bartenders are willing to help. I took my mom there and the bartender made her a craft cocktail that wasn't on the menu with ingredients that she liked. They also have the best okra."}
{"text":"The owners have really outdone themselves with this southern charm kitchen.  We dined in a big group and ate family style--which is highly recommended because you don't want to not try everything on the menu.  Group favorites included mac n' cheese with chicken skins, fried okra, and house pickles.  Cannot forget to mention the cocktail ice with flower frozen inside!  You know it's a good night when you find one these random treats in your drink.  This will definitely be on the must visit places on return trips to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Oh man I loved this place! I had to avoid it after a while because every time I visited I'd eat my weight in delicious Southern food. The chicken is good, but it's all the other stuff that makes this place awesome - the sides, the appetizers (I was obsessed with the seasonal pickles), the drinks, and the desserts. Service was typically really great, and I found the prices to be excellent value considering the quality of the food, drinks, service, and surroundings. Last time I visited the woman working behind the bar found out I was in town for work and went out of her way to give me a bunch of great recommendations for local food and entertainment."}
{"text":"Fried chicken - excellent.  Other dishes good but not hot.  Ordered okra, ribs, Mac & cheese and fried chicken and drinks.  Beware drinks are super sweet, but I guess it is the south!"}
{"text":"Edit: The management here reached out to me personally.  That alone wins them back a star. Still havent been back, but thought I should make note of it.   End of edit.  I expected a lot more given the hype around this place. The food was good (just good) which is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. The other 3 stars are missing due completely to front of house issues I experienced during my visit. I served throughout college and am pretty patient, but frankly the service flat out sucked. Like really sucked.   We started by grabbing a drink from the bar while waiting for our friends. The girl that helped us was a snarky and condescending. It was pretty obvious she didnt really want to be there.  If you go to their bar, try and get the male bartender with the long hair as he's much nicer and friendlier.  At the table, our waitress was just a mess.  It was Sunday night and the restaurant was well staffed, and yet our waitress was seemingly too busy to stand by our table for more than 5 seconds. As a consequence we never got her name. After our appetizer we sat at the table for 15+ minutes before she came back to take our order, and she had to come back by and ask us again what it was because she'd forgotten parts of it. (Maybe she should have written it down?)  As the food came out, she was nowhere in sight. The foodrunners (or other servers?) ran our food out and we were  missing an item.  We just figured she didnt put it in and were going to let it go, but she came back to the table after we'd asked for our bills and noticed we hadnt gotten some of our food. Aka this item died in the window. She would probably have known if she ran any of the food or came by at all.   Foodwise...  Biscuits with bacon jam were very meh.  Never thought I'd say this, but it was too much bacon and not enough biscuit.   Fried chicken was okay. Pretty juicy but heavily breaded and a bit saltier than I prefer. Decently spiced. All-around, just alright.   Sides were the best part of the meal. Cornbread pudding, okra, and cheesy grits were all very flavorful and textually pleasant. The okra was not over or undercooked, and had some firmness to it. The cornbread pudding was very nice- rich, decadent, and a bit sweet.   Despite haberdish's played out concept, the restaurant manages to have some level of uniqueness and identity. One that I actually liked.  The food was alright and the ambiance was nice, but the service was terrible. Overall, I'd go once more to try it again if the service hadn't been such garbage. But it was. So I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Haberdish twice now and continue to be impressed. It is a great place to take friends from out of town and for a date night. The fried chicken is phenomenal but for me its all about the sides. We have tried the mac and cheese, okra, pickles, and more. The food is served 'family style' so sharing is encouraged and the service was great even when we went on a busy Saturday night. They also use the No wait app so you can see how busy they are before you go as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Charlotte. The sweet potato dumplings and the biscuits are also must orders. The staff is always knowledgeable about the menu and the cocktails. Don't be afraid to ask for a recommendation."}
{"text":"This is a long over due review.   We went to Haberdish with a large group of 10 people (this is to be avoided in the future as the restaurant isn't really able to accommodate this large of a party -- reserve for date night or dinner with one other couple). Although we called ahead, used no wait app -- we still waited 40 minutes.   The wait really wasn't a huge deal to me. We posted up by the bar, perused the cocktail list and got busy sipping! I ordered 'The Local Melon' - Doc Porter's vodka watermelon and lime juice, sweet basil bitters, cracked black pepper and a salted rim. It was divine! I made the mistake of adding it without the flowered ice cube. The second one I ordered I got the flowered ice cube. Note: do not forget to ask for the ice cube. While their drinks can stand on their own as far as looks and taste go... they become instantly Instagram enviable when you get the gorgeous ice cube!!   Once we were seated, we ordered biscuits and bacon jam for the table. The biscuits were good - not great. I love a really fresh and fluffy biscuit. These were a little denser and drier. The bacon jam though -- I'm currently licking my lips thinking about it -- yes, it was that good! I ordered the roasted chicken and sweet potato dumplings. My goodness! Those little dumplings were delicious! Tender and sweet. I highly recommend them. The roast chicken was actually very tender and juicy. I really liked it. I know most people come for the fried chicken (which my husband ordered and it was great) but be open to the roasted chicken if you feel you need something lighter - you will not be disappointed.   The ambience is cool. Lots of grey shiplap interior. With sort of an old timey feel. Very clean. There is a cool exterior area that I would love to be seated in next time I'm there.   Overall-I was really pleased with our experience and I look forward to our return."}
{"text":"Have been to Haberdish about 8 times in the last two months and it's at the top my list of places to visit in Charlotte. Highly recommend the spring fever cocktail, hushpuppies, fried chicken, and the carrots. People say the biscuits are amazing. I'll make sure I try them next time."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, very nice bar service. We walked in on a busy weekend lunch and the bartenders, though overwhelmed with table drink orders, never made us feel neglected at all. We tried a few small items but mainly stuck to a few cocktails, and everything was amazing. Definitely recommend trying, I think they use the NoWait app if you want an actual table!"}
{"text":"Fun trendy spot for southern comfort food.  I had hush puppies, chicken tenders and tots. The food was great! Service was great! Tenders came with 3 dipping sauces. The BBQ was my fave. My only complaint would be that it was way over crowded and not worth the hour long wait."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this location after walking around NoDa and I have to say the previous reviews were spot on!   The place was great, we had the hush puppies, biscuits and jam, large okra, mac and cheese, chicken tenders and waffle sundae. Everything was delicious but by far the best item on the menu kale salad!   The atmosphere of the restaurant was very similar to the NoDa environment being hipster/trendy. Our waiter was great, checked up on us every couple of minutes and made sure that we didn't run out of coffee or water. Its definitely a great place for breakfast, lunch or a good old brunch!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Classic southern! The cocktails are also out of this world. There is usually a wait and it can get crowded space wise - but so far the staff seems able to accommodate and handle it well."}
{"text":"We got our seat (3 guests) over 15 minutes ago and have yet to have our server come over. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because we waited at the bar and got a drink before, had the deviled eggs and they were great. The king drink was also good. Service has been dissapointing so far   Update: they apologized for forgetting about us, brought a few drinks an an appetizer: I respect that, and they treated us better"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance are great. A bit pricey and the menu is a big small, but I'd go back. I ordered the trout which was very tasty. The drink menu is also very good."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! I love the concept of larger dishes, so great to share with friends and family. I recommend their cauliflower steak, I have never had something so flavorful in my life. I also recommend stopping by the bar because they have some of the best cocktails in Charlotte. They ya e so many food and drink options! Please come here you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I had read about Haberdish within the past few weeks and kinda wanted to try it out, but I wasn't expecting it to be anything fantastic. Well... it was. Start to finish, everything was phenomenal. The lighting, the details, the open space -- the ambiance was great.   We didn't know what to expect of the portions, but the waitress was knowledgable and advised that between two of us, the \"half fried chicken\" would fill us up. And she was right. It included one wing, one drumstick, one thigh and one breast. (And if I heard correctly, I think you can specify which pieces you want.) We were indifferent, so that's what we were brought!   We skipped appetizers, although the pimento cheese ball next to us look awesome and I plan to order it next time. Along with the fried chicken, we ordered the large mac n' cheese and the small cornbread pudding. Both were amazingly delicious. The cornbread pudding especially had lots of flavors going on. Cheesy, herby, and very moist. We just so happened to everything we ordered, but someone else may have had leftovers -- oops! :)   All in all, Haberdish was a win. I love when the experience is that enjoyable from start to finish. I hear they are all about the cocktails. We stuck with IPA's, but they did look fancy! Just GO! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! The atmosphere is beautiful and calming and all of the decor is classy and fun. We arrived for dinner at 7 with 7 people and were seated right away - win! Our waitress was amazing! She was fun and helpful and really enhanced our experience. We ordered drinks and everyone's cocktails were beautiful. A guy in our party ordered bourbon and they gave him a huge ice cube with a flower inside, beautiful!  Now for food. I'm really sad to be writing a review because I'm on a diet so I feel like I can't even review all the awesome food here. I swear I'll come back and order all the delicious looking items when my 30 days are over. We ordered deviled eggs and biscuits as an appetizer. The biscuits were huge! Everyone loved them. The deviled eggs were fine. Most people in our party ordered the fried chicken which looked amazing! The smoked chicken looked awesome too. One friend even ordered the fried cauliflower and she loved it too. I ordered the trout. It looked amazing but it was way too salty and I did not love it :(. I was really bummed about it because based on everyone else's reactions this place definitely deserves a 5, I will be back to order fried chicken, mac and cheese, cocktails, and dessert and re-review.   But overall I love this restaurant and can't wait to come back! We had an amazing time at our dinner, great props to the service!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night, and it was so good! The service was amazing from the second we stepped inside. It's such a cool space - rustic and homey. The patio looks awesome. They have a great cocktail and beer list. The prices are really reasonable, so you can try a lot of the different 'snacks' and sides. We got the hushpuppies and deviled eggs as appetizers. The hushpuppies were AMAZING - Sweet and salty and the I could've eaten the dipping butter with a spoon. My husband and I both got chicken tenders. They were really good, but I would probably get a piece of chicken next time. The homemade habanero pepper sauce is really good. We got mac n cheese, tots, and charred okra. All were delicious! Make sure you get the banana pudding to seal the deal!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: came back again and had a FANTASTIC experience. Jen was my bartender, and not only was she super attentive, but she even took the time to ask my name after I ordered my first drink and continued to address me by first name thereafter. She was clearly doing it on her own volition, which goes a very loooong way with me.   That said, humans are humans. It's hard for me to pass judgment on my first experience because you never know what people are dealing with or going through in any given moment.   But I can say with confidence, that this time, I thoroughly enjoyed the smoked chicken, okra, and deviled eggs. Jen also made PERFECT manhattans.   So I'm giving an enthusiastic, well-deserved , revised 5 stars ((mostly for Jen!))"}
{"text":"Great meal. We started with the biscuits with bacon jam. Best biscuits I've ever had - so flaky and soft while the bacon jam had incredible flavor.  The fried chicken was so good. Perfectly crispy, juicy and flavorful. The star though was the mac n cheese with crispy chicken skins. Best Mac n cheese ever! Definitely will be back! One of the best meals I've had in Charlotte in a long time. Added bonus that the restaurant also has a great atmosphere and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"I got the biscuit and sausage gravy which was more than what I thought it would be.  It was very good and was bursting with flavor.  Their chicken and waffles that my boyfriend got was amazing!  I never was turned into chicken and waffles until I've had this one.  I also loved the cinnamon biscuit.  You determine how much sweetness you want to put on it and it's so nice and flaky!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at this tasty spot! We ate on the patio, and it was a wonderful environment for a delicious meal. It started sprinkling a bit, but no sweat, they closed the mechanical slats above us, turning the open patio into a covered one - very cool. The chicken was deliciously seasoned and tender. The mac and cheese with fried chicken skins is a must! Great drinks, although a bit pricey, but paired with the reasonably priced food, it all evened out. Awesome spot in the heart of downtown NoDa!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, the fried chicken and trout were great. Cocktails were solid.  The Mac and Cheese is bland as hell. Like the flavor of a Lean Cuisine. So bad I want to give 3 stars but I feel like they put in a lot of effort elsewhere. Sweet Potato Dumplings were really delicious."}
{"text":"finally went here to eat to see what all the hype was about and i was disappointed. the best thing here is the chicken. the mac and cheese was horrible once it got cold it was worst. not sure i would go back here"}
{"text":"We came in for brunch around 1pm and we were seated right away. Our server Makena suggested we start off with the hushpuppies and I was beyond surprised to learn that hushpuppies are not fish but cornmeal batter. We also ordered the fried chicken, mac and cheese, kale salad and chicken tenders. The hushpuppies were surprisingly delicious, especially paired with the delicious sweet butter. The mac and cheese was just ok, but the rest of the food especially the fried chicken and kale salad were really good. Makena was very helpful and gave us great suggestions to check out in the area."}
{"text":"AMAZING CHICKEN, MAC N CHEESE, AND TATER TOTS. What more can I say?   My hubby and I came up to Charlotte from Orlando, FL for a little weekend getaway and we came across Haberdish. We noticed how cool-looking the restaurant looked and we wanted to try it out. After all, we are in a new place!   We came here twice on our visit and we loved every minute of it. I loved the chicken tenders and the sauces that came with it. I decided to try every sauce on the menu and was not disappointed by one. I don't know if it was just my pregnancy cravings but I couldn't help it!   The mac n cheese and tater tots are my favorite! I would recommend this to anyone who is visiting the area! Try it! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"So very good. Make sure to get on the wait list before showing up. Brunch is a must try and possibly even better than Dinner"}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago for the first time, on a Thursday! It was busy & poppin' - they do not do reservations! But they do the app 'no wait' so you can get in line before you go. I recommend that every day of the week there! Our wait time was like 45-1 hour and we arrived at 8pm. By the time 8:40 rolled around a spot opened at the bar so we ordered cocktails, and then ended up just ordering dinner there too bc we were done waiting & hungry. Besides the bar wasn't a bad spot.   They have a lot of special cocktails that they apparently change out every so often. They are pricey. Like average $12 I'd say. I had the love potion ($11) only bc I was on the mend from being sick and didn't think I could handle anything too crazy. By reading the description I didn't think it would be too lemon-y. But it was, just a heads up!   I love that you can literally order ONE chicken tender. lol. Good sized though, with house made sauces. I had their honey mustard (Idk what they called it for sure). I also tried one of their sides, a kale salad. Was really good. I felt healthy and good about it, you know after pairing it with my chicken tender. Or maybe I had two, I don't remember.   The inside was cool, my kinda place. But I'm weird. Go give this place a try. The reason I'm not giving a 5 star rating is because: no drinks specials - ever, drinks are pricey, and no reservations."}
{"text":"So, I'm a fan of Haberdish... is it because of their carefully crafted cocktails? or their delicious tapas style southern fare? You'll just have to go to find out.   Their extensive cocktail list and liquors make it a nice place to sit down and nosh of a few items and be perfectly fine. It's perfect for a family brunch or a nice date night with the significant other.   Their fried chicken is why you go (chicken tenders especially)... but the sweet potatoes gnocchi is why you will come back... I didn't order them the first time I went and I'm regretting it ever since. The sage and brown butter pair perfectly with the doughtiness of the gnocchi. Anything home pickled there is also amazeballs. Their home made sauces are delicious.  The only problem with this place is the parking... Noda is notorious for limited parking, but for Haberdish, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I like Haberdish quite a bit! Parking in Noda can be tricky but its worth it. The service has always been great, the food top notch, and the drinks are ok. I take people from out of town here for some good southern food."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! We went relatively early on a Saturday night (6:15ish), and got a table outside right away. It took forever for someone to take our drink orders, but they seemed to realize this and were really friendly and did a semi-decent job explaining the delay. Easily forgiven.  I wasn't super excited about the menu because I like to eat semi-healthy, but I threw calories to the wind and just enjoyed a super fattening, high sodium meal. If you want to enjoy yourself, go there with a similar mindset. We started with the pimento cheese, and I think it's the first time in five years of dating that my husband ate more of an appetizer than I did (cheese and crackers aren't typically his thing). The fried chicken was amazing (I got 2 which is plenty for a normal female appetite; the man - who usually eats enough for a small army - got 4 pieces and said it was too much). We also split a mac and cheese and sweet potato dumplings. Both amazing, but the dumplings were a little too salty for me at this point in the meal.  No room for dessert after we each had three drinks (Prosecco which was eh and Old Fashioned which he said were really good...mostly because of the clear ice cubes).  Highly recommend. But make sure to hydrate before. Your body will thank you for it later.  Also, a good value. 6 drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 chicken orders, 2 sides = $120 w/tip."}
{"text":"I had some friends in town so we were looking for a fresh, new spot to try and came across Haberdish. We saw they were on NoWait which is awesome. They happen to not have a wait on the Sunday morning when we got there, but that quickly changed as they filled up soon after. Parking is terrible, as it typically is in NoDa, so plan accordingly.  Some of my friends started with some coffee, which was served in a thermos. They weren't huge fans of the thermos and pouring it themselves. I order the chicken and waffles, while others at the table ordered biscuits with bacon jam and chicken tenders. The chicken and waffles was great, and they allow the option to choose the type of fried chicken that you like(tenders, white, dark) to go with your waffles. They have several sauces for the tenders, most of which are good. Service wasn't the best here, but food was definitely really good. The hushpuppies were light and fluffy and the chicken was fried to perfection. The bacon jam tasted like a bacon hash sort of, which I was a fan of on the biscuit. All in all, I'd visit again for brunch with a hope of slightly speedier service."}
{"text":"So I had to update my review, because now at this point, I've eaten about half the menu over the course of about five visits.  I completely stand by the Cocktails.  OUTSTANDING.  This is absolutely a place where you don't have to run to your favorite beer as a safe choice.  I'm still completely obsessed with the flower filled ice balls.  As good as some of the cocktails are at the bars in NoDa, this little detail is a nice touch to make the drinks stand out.  As for the food, absolutely yes to the fried chicken.  I also tasted the chicken tenders again and they were moist with less breading (MUCH better than the first time I was here).  The real winner of my visits though was the Chicken & Biscuit special during the week.  If you like chicken pot pie (seriously, who doesn't love chicken pot pie?!?!), you need to order this dish.  The Mac has always been a bit salty (which is my speed), so you may want to order some veggies to offset the sodium intake.  I'm glad I continue to come back here, because it gets better each time.  Service has always been a little slow, so be prepared to come in and relax with some friends and have a casual meal."}
{"text":"Decided to try the weekday brunch. The menu isn't exactly extensive when it comes to brunch options, but what we chose was 5 stars all the way. The coffee.. The Cinnamon roll with caramel sauce as an appetizer, the fried chicken and waffle..  this isn't a regular waffle, this is a liege waffle with the crunchy sugar pearls. Everything was delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype, or the long wait times.  The menu was extremely limited and what we did order was bland.  Only plus was our waitress had a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"I came for brunch one Sunday afternoon, and thanks to Yelp, I reserved a spot in line before walking through the door. Our wait ended up being about 10 minutes! The menu was sparse, not sure if that is just a Sunday brunch menu thing or if it's always like that. But it worked out great because the fewer options means that they specialize in certain items...and less indecisiveness from me. We ordered the half fried chicken, brussel sprouts, the sweet potato dumplings and the okra. Everything tasted fresh and satisfying! It was a little greasy, but what else do you expect from a southern restaurant. Haberdish is definitely a good place to come with a few people so you can order a couple of side dishes and sample everything."}
{"text":"Man, oh Maneschevitz!! This place is Great!!! Yes, I must admit I was probably a Doubting Thomas when it came to the reputation at Haberdish. Until I got an invite to sup and dug a little deeper. 331 reviews with a 4.5 star average with most of the complaints being a policy of not taking reservations. I can totally understand from a management perspective of not wanting to deal with the headaches of taking reservations! It probably makes life so much easier!  We used the App and waited only about 15 minute before being seated on the covered patio. Love the detail oriented design/décor that focuses on conservation and recycling. The outdoor section was surprisingly toasty and festive for December.  The Yelpers I roll with like to go whole hog - and boy did we - we ordered about every side they had some chicken tenders and starters. The Smoked deviled eggs and hushpuppies were excellent (perhaps egg-cellent) and love the addition of Sweet Tea Butter with the pups. Soooo  after eating massive quantities of Tater Tots (house made), corn bread pudding, charred okra, glazed carrots, mac and cheese with crispy chicken skins, kale grits, pickled coleslaw and sweet potato dumplings, there were some definite stand outs but no losers. For me the sun beamed down on the Kale Grits, Glazed Carrots and Okra - all of these had a special twist that really made them shine.  The servers are really on top of things here - love the cocktails and beer selections and the kitschy mismatched dishes. All the food/dishes were presented timely and hot - what a beautiful and delicious spread!  \"And then I ate their grits and now I'm a believer!\""}
{"text":"I love that we have more elevated food in NoDa since the majority of what has historically populated the area are dive bars and bar food.   Lets rate the overall aesthetics - Its got a fun retro vibe, very clean open and inviting. Love the front outdoor seating areas, love the side porch that can be closed off and utilized in the colder, or rainy days.   The libations are a plenty, but I tried their hibiscus vodka drink, I was sorely disappointed. In fact, I couldn't finish it, I let our bar tender know and switched to my regular order of a dirty martini which was also not as great as it could have been. I like my drinks super cold, please shake, dont stir, in a lot of ice please, martini or otherwise. My friend loves Bourbon and they have an extensive list of high-end. The pour was maybe an once, maybe, it was very strange. I do understand that typical pours are around the once, once and a half, but it was less, for sure. We were out to have a good time, so we tried to keep it under wraps, no big deal. So this leads to the service. Our bartender was not only not that friendly but the drinks themselves were not so great. It keeps me wondering if it was the drinks themselves, or just her.....???   The food was surprising good. Like I said, more elevated bar food. You can order chicken tenders, singular, or a few at a time. The size were more like chicken breast, but I certainly wasn't complaining. They were delicious. We had a side of mac'n'cheese with the chicken skin crumbles and the deviled eggs. I personally thought that the deviled eggs were not bad. The center was whipped and a great creamy textured, great flavor. However, they did have a smoked paprika my friend didn't care for, claimed last time they had bacon on them. I personally liked them. The mac'n'cheese was very good. Pasta was cooked perfectly, cheese was velvety and the chicken skins on top is what definitely made it.   So would I return, absolutely. Perhaps not eat at the bar but that is neither here nor there."}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this restaurant since they opened. Food was really amazing (fried chicken, smoked chicken, mac and cheese, pimento cheese, okra with bacon jam) but their bloody Mary's were a HUGE disappointment. The yellow tomato was too sweet and no spices. We really came for a great Brunch bloody.  It was a good food experience but super disappointed in their bloody' when clt is such a competitive Bloody Mary town."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in CHARLOTTE! The food, drinks, and atmosphere are out of this world. You have to visit and try the hush puppies....to die for . I also love their chicken tenders because they are HUGE and come with some delicious side sauces. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really over priced and always way too busy.  If you want a better meal walk down the street to Crepe Cellar where they never disappoint.  I really don't know what the fuss is over this place.  I give it another 6 months."}
{"text":"Usually when you order chicken and waffles you get syrup standard as a condiment for your waffle right? Not at this place. Ordered with no mention of the $2 syrup, then a different waiter comes by and says it's $2 and they're out of the usual syrup, so I ask shouldn't it be free if you're out? Why are you trying to charge us $2 if you're out? He says, well this isn't some Aunt Jemima syrup, this is special. I don't need your special $2 syrup! And then they tried to charge us twice for this syrup after the first one spilled and we asked for another. Never coming back here again just for this ridiculousness."}
{"text":"After hanging out in the area, I had to find dinner and still had southern food on my bread with the holiday season coming about.  I decided to try a bookmarked restaurant and made an online order as I found close parking.  The order took about 15-20 mins.  The restaurant was warm and cozy.  The room was dim with romantic lighting perfect for a date.  Seating and bar was spaced appropriately.  I got some of the most favorite picks: Alabama brin chicken, Mac n cheese, and sweet potato dumpling (curious based on the name & topping). The takeout separated well and compacted neatly.  Everything was good and like another reviewer I oddly felt the dumplings could have came with a syrup in the side.  Seems a sweet topping could have fit in.  The chicken has be fired in bacon fat judging from the smell and taste.  It was good and fulfilling (non greasiness).  Mac and cheese was superb.  I was waited on upon visiting the bar and wish well on the way out by two different employees.  Always a good thing.  One bartender was snarky when I sat at the bar for my finished order.  I told her I had been helped by her colleague behind her but we'll look over her.  Glad to recommend and return."}
{"text":"This Gem of a restaurant is located in the former mill town of North Charlotte which is now known as \"NoDa\".   Features:  According to their menu; Notice at the bar the counter top. It is a soap stone bar top that came from a quarry in Virginia. The table tops were hand crafted in town (Charlotte, NC). The bar taps are used spindles from a former mill.   Menu Items Ordered:  Fried Chicken, Homemade Tater Tots, Mac and Cheese and Sweet Tea. All food was delicious. I was full when I left.  Customer Service:  They really took care of me while I was here. I sat at the bar because they were really busy since it was lunch time. Several bartenders and waitresses spoke to me while I was here. They gave me water to start off with. Then I asked for sweet tea. My order was brought to me within a few minutes after ordering.   Other Mentionable Menu Items:  Deviled Eggs, Homemade Dill Pickles, Hushpuppies with sweet tea butter, and Potato Salad with fresh herbs. These menu items I did not try but are popular reading the other Yelp Reviews.   How Discovered:  I found this restaurant while visiting a coffee shop about a block or two away using the Yelp App. The food pictures looked good so I book marked it.   College Students:  Looks like while visiting this area, it  is frequented by college age students. I see there are about 5 colleges or Universities within a 5 mile square radius of this restaurant which is why I see mostly people in their 20's out and about outside and inside this restaurant. There looks to be some apartments and condominiums close by too where they might be staying.  History of Local Area:   This is an old part of Charlotte that has been revitalized. I saw some industrial businesses in the area while on my way here. NoDa is a popular arts and entertainment district of Charlotte, NC. I saw a music venue across from the coffee shop I visited. You can find bands that play there too. I recommend visiting the online website of www.NoDa.org for more information to plan your trip in the area.   Final Thoughts: Yes, I highly recommend visiting Haberdish when you come down here. They also have a bar where they serve drinks such as beer and liquor and even cocktails too. So, you can have lots of fun here which includes dining out, having a cup of coffee, drink a beer and finally see a local band play all within a block or two of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been following Haberdish on Instagram since their construction days and finally got a chance to try them for dinner last week. I had really high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. We arrived early (around 5:15pm on a Tuesday) and were seated right away but the place quickly filled up and there were people waiting for a table by 5:45.   Everything on the menu was so appealing that it was difficult to choose what to order. We ended up over-ordering (as usual) and left feeling uncomfortably full but very happy. Here is a rundown of what we ordered:  Hushpuppies: Sneaky star of the show! Hushpuppies are pretty much always a safe bet, but these were extra crisp on the outside while staying soft in the middle. The sweet tea butter was a wonderful accompaniment and now I need it with all hushpuppies in the future.  Biscuits and Bacon Jam: wow are these GIANT biscuits! You get two with your order and they are covered in a salty-sweet bacon jam. I'm not a huge bacon jam fan, but I definitely liked these better than the ones at The Asbury.  Chicken Tender: I knew I was going to be full after all the appetizers and sides, so I only ordered 1 chicken tender just so I could try their fried chicken. The breading was thick and crsipy, well-done without being burnt, and the chicken inside was juicy and tender. Overall exceeded expectations.  Chicken and Biscuits: **Only available on Tuesdays** My friend ordered this and devoured it before I could try it, but seemed to really enjoy it. Lots of gravy and white meat chicken, some veggies, and more(!) giant biscuits.  Mac and Cheese: Creamy, cheesy, and homemade. A little salty for my taste but I would definitely order it again  Sweet Potato Dumplings: I was most excited about these, but they were really salty and a bit forgettable.   Tater Tots: Definitely homemade and, I never thought I would say this, definitely better than the frozen OreIda ones that I grew up on.  Overall I can't wait to go back. If I had one complaint it would be that the dishes were a bit salty, but I am kind of sensitive to salt so it may just be a personal preference. Haberdish is a really versatile space- great for a date, girls night out, brunch, or just some small plates and cocktails at the bar."}
{"text":"This is a slight 4 star review, borderline 3 for me.  Here's the thing, I know they are poised for expansion and that is a good thing due to the awkward layout of the bar relative to staff needing to maneuver about the restaurant.  The bar area should have enough space to queue waiting patrons.  This one is a bit too tight to allow this.  And when you have a popular place such as this, that can be problematic.  With that out of they way, let's get to the food.  The food is divine.  Southern divine.  Just take a look at some of the photos and you'll get the idea.  I don't feel like I need to get into too much detail here in that regard.  The seating is nice and comfy and the wait staff was quick to deliver with a side dish of politeness to boot.  The acoustics are a bit tough but I find that to be the case anywhere such as this place where they have retrofitted an otherwise non-restaurant space.  A few acoustic baffles may help but doesn't really detract in my opinion.  In short, this is a solid addition to NoDa and I'm sure it will expand and grow into another staple for the hood."}
{"text":"The food was fair; however, the waitstaff was apathetic and was unprofessional.  When we tried to bring up our concerns with the manager, we were made to feel as though our input did not matter. Overall, not a good experience."}
{"text":"Oh HABERDISH! You make my heart melt with so much happiness! The flavor of your food and the atmosphere of your restaurant is beyond great! And may I include your awesome staff, incredible drinks and unique way to give your customers their checks #masonjars! Who doesn't like a great mason jar! DETAILS PEOPLE DETAILS! It's all about the details in 2018 and Harberdish gives you that and so much more. Do not hesitate coming and bringing your entire crew to this restaurant. Suggestion, do as my family and I did and order EVERYTHING! Two people ordered two items each in family size from the menu and it feed a family birthday party of 15 WELL! And we even had enough to take home, it's worth every calorie you can burn that off later lol just enjoy the MOMENT!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, food was great, plates were cleaned! Cocktails were on point per usual. Service could have been more attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you like that southern comfort food, this is the place. I love that it has a gourmet twist! Amazing fried chicken -- tender, crispy, and juicy. A gem in NoDa. Walk around the area while you're there, such a great up and coming place."}
{"text":"Sweet. Potato. Dumplings. Out of this world! Everything here is amazing though, really. Fried chicken, waffles with pearl sugar, cornbread pudding, hushpuppies. Chicken and waffles all day on Sunday ="}
{"text":"I've heard and seen so much hype surrounding haberdish, especially about its brunch so we decided to try it out on a Sunday morning! 1st of all we we're told they don't serve brunch on Sundays! WOW WHAT? We were told by our waitress it was served during the week so now we have to shift our focus to lunch unless we wanted chicken and waffles, the only breakfast on the menu. Well we we're next to a Large party of people who received all of our waitresses attention! We were told that at about 1145 AM they were out of Tater Tots, then after making other selections we finished our orders and proceeded to wait about 20 to 30 mins then our food came surprisingly my food was Good, i had the smoked chicken with macaroni & cheese, and kale grits instead of the Tots. The grits was just ok needed salt and pepper which we didn't have on the table, we had to ask the host and hostess for extras we needed which they helped out! But my wife's chicken and waffles were cold not even warm enough to melt the butter and the sugar sprinkled on the top was too hard to eat. So unfortunately our impression didn't live up to the Hype!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken biscuit sandwich, Mac & cheese w/ the added chicken skins and the egg and cheese biscuit and everything was delicious. I also ordered the rice pudding but when we went to pick up the order, they said they didn't serve that anymore (even though it was on their menu) so we opted for the deviled eggs (which weren't bad). This place also offers brunch during the week, which is pretty cool, seeing the fact that most times places only do so on the weekends only. It's in a fun little area (Noda).... And I would go back!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying brunch at Haberdish - really cute place with a nice outdoor patio. Ordered the hush puppies as an app for the table and the sweet tea butter was amazing!!!! As my meal, I got the chicken and waffles (white meat) and the sweet potatoes. Both were delicious - the skin on the chicken was my favorite part and the homemade hot sauce was a close second. Got the Love Potion cocktail - also delicious. Pro tip: ask for a flower in your ice cube! Will definitely be back for more fried chicken :-)  *only complaint is the parking in Noda is always a nightmare"}
{"text":"Loved the deviled eggs, chicken and waffles, and okra. Wasn't too crazy about the sweet potato dumplings. It's beautiful inside and has a nice atmosphere. The honey syrup for the waffles was delicious. I think the deviled eggs were the best I've ever eaten. We will be back."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was totally up my ally.  I am a sucker for those hipster places and this is one of them.  It had a cute rustic feel inside and the interior was very cute.  I got a seat at the bar, the bartender was very attentive.  I ordered 3 small dishes, I went for the charred okra with bacon jam, savory corn bread pudding, and pickled beets.  Loved the charred okra and with the bacon jam it was a perfect combination!  The savory corn bread pudding was very good, if you like corn bread and bread pudding; definitely order this.  I am a huge fan of pickled beets so this was right up my ally.  Overall great spot and very affordable.  All 3 dishes came out to $20 with tax and tip!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a couple friends while we were visiting from out of town. I really liked the ambiance of the place, kind of a Hipster vibe. The hush puppies were a very good appetizer, I would recommend. However, our waiter overhyped the rest of the food a bit unfortunately; saying it was without a doubt the best Mac and cheese, and fried chicken in Charlotte. The fried chicken and Mac and cheese were just \"okay\"...Definitely not the best I've ever had. Chicken was nice and crispy but didn't have much flavor for some reason.  They have a good assortment of mixed drinks and a stocked bar. I'll try this place again next time we're in town to see what the rest of the menu is like."}
{"text":"Haberdish was incredibly delicious! Came here on a starving stomach on a Saturday afternoon, and everything was great!   The cool thing about this place is that all the dishes are 'shareable' plates. Some plates are super small so I don't know what a shareable portion means to them. Because I'm vegetarian, we ordered Cornbread 'Pudding', Hushpuppies w/ sweet maple dip, Sweet Potato Dumplings, and Mac & Cheese. They have a vegetarian menu if you ask for it, so that was nice to see!   Of everything we ordered, my favorites were Mac & Cheese and the Sweet Potato Dumplings. The Hushpuppies were good too but I didn't like the sweet dip. I'm more of a salty dip type of person, I think the Hushpuppies dipped in ranch or spicy yogurt or something along those lines would have tasted better.   We also ordered 2 drinks, 1 was a Champagne 'Blood Orange' Punch and an Old Fashioned. Both drinks were very pretty, and I noticed A LOT of their drinks are vodka-based which is not my best friend. Definitely still recommend for anyone to visit!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant located in the trendy Noda area of Charlotte. We arrived right when they open at 11:30 on a Sunday and had to wait in line to be seated - just shows how popular they are! We ordered quickly but the food took a while to be served. It seemed like most people got their food long before us. The food itself was delicious, though. The sweet potato dumplings were great, as was the kale salad. My table mates had some chicken tenders and said they were very good, as were the kale grits and barbecue carrots. Definitely recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, but maybe not if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Haberdish is probably my favorite place to get a really good Negroni here in Charlotte. Their Negronis are in an ice filled glass with a rose trapped within the ice sphere which really gives it an elegant touch.  Their food prices are extremely reasonable on your wallet. For \"tapas\" style dishes, you really get heavy portions for your money. I suggest getting the 1/2 lb fried chicken for two, along with a few sides. Their smoked deviled eggs, charred okra, and mac and cheese are all delicious! Perfect date night spot, or for large parties too. Be sure to get on the nowait app to reserve a spot ahead of time!"}
{"text":"We headed to Haberdish today for my father-in-law's 68th Birthday. It was a very disappointing experience considering all of the wonderful reviews. The restaurant has a trendy earthy, vibe. Upon entering we were barely acknowledged by the hostess who seemed unhappy with her job, in spite of the unwelcoming vibe, I placed our name on the waiting list. 20 minutes later, I received a text notification that our table was ready. We were seated promptly outdoors on their semi-covered patio. Our waitress came over, super bubbly and introduced herself. We ordered rather quickly (within the first 15 minutes of being seated) but it took forever for our food to arrive. When it finally did, the appetizers and entrees came out at the same time. As for the food: the biscuits were burnt and the fried chicken was dry. We sent the biscuits back and the replacements were a bit better. The side dishes lacked flavor (macaroni and cheese, sweet potato dumplings, and kale grits) Shortly after receiving our food, the service stopped, no one came by to check on us and we received no additional refills. We were left with empty glasses of tea and lukewarm water. When we finally spotted our waitress, I had to flag her down. I asked for a water to-go (I was very thirsty) and the check. When she brought the check, I guess she was trying to save face since we were all sitting there with sad looks and she offered refills.   Bottom line: The food is instagram-able for those doing it for the 'gram but at best the food was mediocre and we left very underwhelmed. Maybe we stopped in on an off day but for us we wanted this to be a special experience for my father-in-laws birthday. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Holy moly. I stopped in here for lunch on a whim last weekend. What a treat!  It wasn't crowded at all at 3 pm on a Saturday. I was by myself so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered their fried cauliflower with a side of charred okra and sweet potato dumplings. I also ordered some cheese straws to start.   The cheese straws were good -- kind of hard to mess those up -- but not anything I'd just have to have again. I liked the presentation: served standing up in a mason jar.   The sides were delicious. The okra came kind of tossed with bacon jam which added a nice depth of flavor. It was charred just right and the okra had a perfect texture. The sweet potato dumplings were not at all like I had envisions but they were delicious, nonetheless.   The cauliflower though. My god, THE CAULIFLOWER! First off, I am fairly sure I got an entire head of cauliflower. It was huge! Second off, the textures and flavors were perfect. The sides complemented it nicely but I'd have been satisfied with the cauliflower alone.   Everyone I interacted with was really friendly. I liked the overall vibe but it could feel entirely different at a busier time.   As for pricing, I got out of there for under $40 including tip. This is more than reasonable when you consider I had enough leftovers for dinner that night and lunch the next day. It could be a really nice place for an in-between date night: not too dive-y but not too uppity either. Assuming the portion sizes are consistent across their menu, you could easily split an entree and some sides, then splurge on one of their amazing sounding cocktails or desserts.   I'm glad I finally got to try the place. I look forward to going back for a date night, or girls' night, and trying some more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The location, the food, the ambiance, everything!    We went on Friday night and walked in around 6:45.  There were a handful of tables open, but by 7PM, the place was packed!  I noticed at 7:30 there was a 1-2 hour wait.  Definitely get there early!  The decor was warm and comfortable.  The antique bronze silverware and the serving plates were complemented by mason jar candles & serving spoon holders.  Our table ordered 4 chicken fingers, 2 piece fried chicken, and the roast chicken (1/2) with Alabama white sauce.  Our sides included mac & cheese (large), sweet potato dumplings, tater tots, kale salad, and the special green been casserole.  We had more than enough food for the four of us and our food bill was only about $15 each!!  Everything was delicious, especially the mac & cheese and fried chicken.  Next time I'm back, I'll definitely give the hush puppies and fried cauliflower a try."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB! My friend and I ordered a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 1/2 a chicken, 3 sides (family style, so they're big), and dessert and the total bill was less than $70! Everything was so delicious, too! I would eat those smoked deviled eggs and Alabama white sauce every day of my life. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're at an upscale eatery but the bill doesn't. Win win."}
{"text":"So amazing. I literally love this place, the food, the cocktails, the decor, the service... EVERYTHING. Every time I come to Haberdish, I want to eat and drink everything. The only thing that is hard sometimes (and sucks) is that it gets so packed and busy. I wish it was a better kept secret."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience at Haberdish! The bar staff is top notch and the cocktail program they are executing is incredible. I remember walking past the space for years wondering when someone would do something with it and man have they blown it out of the water. The food was incredible as well, we ordered a bunch of things to try and taste as much as we could and we loved everything. The Trout was insanely good and so was the fried chicken. NoDa and Charlotte are blessed to have this gem."}
{"text":"All we had to have was The Gibson, an Old Fashioned, and the Ice Cream and Waffles to rate this place five stars. The cocktails were superb, but the waffles stole the show. This. Was. The. Best. Waffle. I. Have. Ever. Had.  But, in all seriousness, it's worth a trip here to try the waffle dessert.  I have full confidence in Haberdish and will return as often as I can."}
{"text":"God I wish I took photos of my food. This is my new happy place. We started with some biscuits with bacon jam and hush puppies. I've never had bacon jam before and I will dream about it for days to come. The biscuits were fluffy and the jam was abundant! The hush puppies were so soft and pillowy. I could eat basket after basket of them.  For dinner I had the cauliflower steak. I am obsessed with fried cauliflower and this did not disappoint. Some of the florets were a bit tough to cut into, but still delicious. I shared the fried chicken with my fiancé and it was to die for. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and not too greasy.   Oh, and the sweet potato dumplings!!! That is the definition of comfort food. They were tender and tasty and I want more.  I can't wait to go back! This is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim while visiting Charlotte and it was probably one of the best restaurants I've been to this year. The cocktails are crazy good and very unique. The bartenders were friendly and enthusiastic to explain all of their speciality cocktails.   Now the food. We ordered the chicken fried cauliflower and it was phenomenal. Yes, cauliflower. The chimichurri sauce that was drizzled all over was like bliss in your mouth. We also go the cornbread stuffing which I still dream about to this day. I completely recommend. Atmosphere was beautiful as well."}
{"text":"Winner Winner  Haberdish Dinner  I've been to Haberdish once and I fall in love right away. It really lives up to the hype, and it became one of my few favorite spots in Charlotte. If you haven't been yet, make haste! It's time to prepare your loose-fitting pants for an incredible Restaurant.  Some of Foodful info:  - HABERDISH: Haberdashery + Dish. - Great service (southern hospitality). Friendly and attentive waitress (shoutout to Jillian.)  - Bright, airy space and welcoming ambiance. - Deviled eggs, chicken tenders, mac & cheese and okra. One of the best (and interesting) brunches I've had in a while. -  The Waffel Sundae. Insanely delicious. Dessert for breakfast, anyone? - The ice. Oh, the ice. Fresh flower inside a perfect sphere of ice for your drink - selected drinks. - Closed on Mondays. Chicken & Biscuit Night on Fridays. Chicken & Waffles all day on Sundays. - Haberdish don't take advance reservations, however, you can see the current wait time with the \"Nowait app.\"  Five Yelps"}
{"text":"Good solid southern food! I especially love the atmosphere here, the designer did a bang-up job. We took my mother in law here (native southerner who basically invented fried chicken and clogged arteries), and even she adored it! It's actually pretty kid friendly too, depending on when you come. This is a great solid addition to NODA!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about a year now, & I absolutely love it! Unfortunately the prices did go up after the New year but that's okay, I still enjoy the food and the atmosphere.  I really would recommend coming here! My all time favorite is the Fried Chicken and the macaroni & cheese!"}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken here. The hushpuppies and sweet tea butter. The pimento cheese and crackers. The tater tots. The banana pudding.....need I go on? I also love they are open for lunch daily but wish it was more tailored to lunch and not a brunch menu during the weekday. Weekends that's acceptable."}
{"text":"Note: this restaurant was extremely busy on Fridays; check-in via app in advance to reduce your wait.  Appetizers - we ordered smoked deviled eggs and hushpuppies; hushpuppies and tea butter was tasty, the smoke on the deviled eggs was too pronounced for my wife but she loves traditional southern deviled eggs.  Entree - the fried chicken is a can't miss; white meat was crispy, not dry and not greasy. The pork shank was tender and delicious; the sauce had a bit of tang that help cut the richness of the dish. The mac and cheese with fried chicken skin bits was good but not outstanding. We both loved the chicken bits but the mac and cheese is average, creamy but not particularly cheesy in taste - a little on the bland side. The corn bread pudding was ok but not great; we felt the bread served no real purpose to the dish.  Dessert - Lemon meringue pie. We love the meringue and the lemon but the crust was hard and added nothing to this dish - so we left the crust.  Restaurant - waitress was very pleasant and accommodating. The restaurant itself is a bit loud so if you are looking for a quiet evening this is not your place.   We would certainly return again."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times and think it's one of the best restaurants in CLT. Good atmosphere, food, service and drinks. I would recommend using No Wait to book a table on Friday and Saturday night."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place but the food took forever to arrive. Our group got chicken fingers and got bunch of large sides and did it family style which I recommend. Chicken finger was good and so were most of the sides but certainly not worth the wait. Probably wouldn't go back. Fairly pricey for southern food"}
{"text":"Deliciousness definitely a spot to check out! We tried...Mac & cheese with crispy chicken skinSweet Potato dumplingsCauliflower Steak with chimichurri (may fav)Warm Potato Salad with baconFried ChickenKale Salad  The Cauliflower Steak with chimichurri sauce makes me want to become a vegetarian! Do yourself a favor and try it. Just wish parking wasn't so difficult."}
{"text":"I decided to come here with some friends on a whim, and I didn't regret.  The hushpuppies are absolutely delicious, the drinks are good, the atmosphere is even better, and that tea butter they have is amazing.  The only thing on the menu that I tried that I didn't like were the sweet potato dumplings--they were too savory and didn't have a good flavor profile.  But other than that, it's an awesome place."}
{"text":"Yet another nicely designed, trendy place in NoDa with a cool atmosphere, great drinks and awesome vibe.  Me and seven of my friends and family decided we give give this, relatively new, joint a shot on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks.  Given that they don't take reservations and my party was rather large, I was worried we would have a horrific wait.  Haberdish uses the Nowait app making the wait, well a little less.  Not no wait like the name would suggest.  Regardless, there's many other places to grab a drink while you wait, or no wait, or whatever...  We started off with a few craft cocktails.  Habiscus this, Moscow that.  I can't remember all of the names but everything we tried was really good and mildly flavored.  Nothing has a punch in the face, over bearing flavor of anything.  Well done bar gang!  Shortly after drinks, we had some apps. An assortment of pickles, cheese straws, smoked deviled eggs and hush puppies.  Nothing crazy or out of this world. Everything tastes good but nothing popped.  Entrees came out shortly after we cleared the app plates.  Entrees are healthy portions and sides can be ordered single or family style.  I ordered the pork shank which was very well cooked, very tender.  I wasn't a fan of the house BBQ sauce that was on the pork.  It was almost like a sweet Asian sauce mixed with BBQ.  My table also had some of the chicken and cauliflower steaks.  Chicken was a little dry and tough but the cauliflower steaks were amazing.   The assortment of sides was plentiful and unique.  Kale grits (grits with creamed kale), sweet potato dumplings, Mac and cheese and corn bread pudding.  They were all good but I was pretty aggravated when we had two corn bread pudding's and one came out completely burnt.  The bottom was jet black.  We weren't charged for it but how that came out to the table was sloppy.  Overall, service was nice, not super but nice.  Food was different, enjoyable and moderately priced.  Atmosphere was fun and hip.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is all hype, food was ok. Service was terrible!  Came here on a Sunday for brunch and had an extremely rude hipster who thought it was too much to have to deal with us. As the hostess was seating us, he came by and asked us what we wanted to drink - BEFORE BUTTS WERE IN SEATS. We said we obviously needed a few minutes and he took that to mean I'll come back in 20. And from there, his attitude just got worse, not sure why he's working in hospitality if he hates people.  As for the food, the fried chicken was good but nothing special, lacked seasoning and flavor. The bacon jam biscuits are to be avoided! Biscuits are good but smothered with the terrible bacon jam, I mean just covered to the point you can't even see the biscuits. The mac and cheese side tastes like there's only flour in the roux, way too starchy. The only standout dish for us were the hush puppies and kale grits, and if that's the star of the show, then it says a lot about this place as we ordered a ton of food!"}
{"text":"The prices for what you get didn't seem reasonable. The biscuit was very hard. Service was incredible, very funny and sweet. Our server David accommodated all our needs. The maple honey butter was a syrup but I though it would be a whipped butter. My brother loved the chicken drum soup, but my chicken and waffles was sub par."}
{"text":"Stumbled by Haberdish on its debut night! Wonderfully diverse cocktail menu, I had a smoky mint julep that was beautifully presented with shaved ice in a copper cup. We ordered fried chicken and a smattering of most of the sides. Everything was delicious! We especially loved the savory corn bread pudding and the hush puppies were really well done. I loved that we could order small plates and try a ton without spending a ton! Warm and polished atmosphere. Lovely attentive server. Impressed everything was going so smoothly on opening night!!! We will be back next time we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This has to be my all time favorite restaurant. I've came here enough times to make a well rounded review.  What to get: Fried Chicken, Sweet Potato Dumplings, Tater Tots, Fried Okra, Deviled Eggs - in that order.   Mixed Drinks, my two favorites is the Cotton Gin -$10 and the viral, Honey Bee and the Buzzing Monk - $18  The food is CONSISTENT - which helps keep me coming back.  and the decor and ambiance is southern with a modern twist. They do not take reservations, but they are on an app called \"No Wait\" where you can put your name in line and you can receive a text when your table is ready.   The Food SURPASSES the service. All times but 1, have we had a terrible server. Drinks refilled maybe once during our dining experience.  I make it a point to be very kind and make eye contact and thank the server for everything they do for the table. I was a server and I understand rude tables.   My most recent experience- had me disgusted. She actually asked in a rude tone \"Are You Happy Now?\"  When food came out. In reality no one at our table was upset we were all happy and having a good time while waiting for our food. She did an excellent job of consistently rolling her eyes and not returning to our table. She also proceeded to question us on our order, saying \"are you really sure you want this much food?\"  \"Are you actually going to eat this?\" With an attitude. Our table ate everything but the BBQ Glazed Carrots.   If I continue to get rude service I cannot see my self recommending this restaurant any more. I've referred so many of my friends here."}
{"text":"Haberdish is a pretty cool spot and was the main venue for my last night in Charlotte. I'll qualify this review in that I only had drinks. From reading other Yelp reviews, the menu looks pretty fantastic but I didn't indulge. If you are coming for dinner on a weekend, be ready to wait. The restaurant was pretty much packed the entire time we were there.   The drinks delivered. They have an interesting menu consisting of craft cocktails which is what I stuck with. If you're looking for something lighter, they also have beer and wine. If you're just trying to get your drink on, they have a long bar as well as a patio in the front of the restaurant. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Amazingly southern American. In every way. For those of us who can't eat fried food and dairy, there are other options. Just ask. The grilled chicken is amazing, probably just as good as fried. Love the vibe here. But you definitely gotta eat early or late cause the wait is long. People love this place."}
{"text":"Smoked chicken was great and the mac and cheese came with friend chicken skins on top!"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. It kind of reminded me of being back in Chicago at one of the trendy restaurants in River North. Cool vibe with great craft cocktails. They don't take reservations but the no wait app helps a lot (or you can use Yelp). You just have to try and time it right. And if you have to wait still (which we did), enjoy a cocktail from their robust list. The fried chicken (we had dark meat) and chicken tenders were quite good. I especially liked the Alabama white sauce. Best items we had were the hush puppies, which were the best I've ever had and the homemade tots. I also really like the sweet potato dumplings. Cool experience with good food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It took me way too long to try this place. The wait always scared me off, but that was just stupid - it's more than worth a 90+ minute wait.  I came here with my boyfriend and my parents, who were in town to visit. We each picked a few different items and I could never tell you what was the most delicious. Everything was exceptional.  We actually ordered the fried chicken but ended up receiving the baked. The waitress noticed about halfway through our meal and offered to bring the fried, but we (especially me - I don't eat gluten) were so happy with the baked that we didn't care!  Also, side note - I've noticed a few lesser-star reviews that mention the food being heavy and greasy. As I already mentioned, I don't eat gluten or any fried food whatsoever, and I had no problem finding plenty to eat. The menu has a ton of variety.  So good. Truly a gem in this city."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, HABERDISH!! Sorry to yell, but I'm just THAT EXCITED about this new spot in NoDa. We went at 7pm on a Friday night and were greeted with a 70-90 minute wait. Sounded pretty awful until we realized a) they use a cool app called waitlist that told us where in line we were/how many parties were in front of us and b) we were only a few doors down from Salud! So, off we went for some beers while we waited for a table. We left Salud and headed back with 2 parties in front of us. Within 60-seconds of walking back in, our table was ready! Happy day!! Time to stuff our faces!!!  Now, I'm going to tell you that we ordered almost everything on the menu and you're probably not going to believe me. But seriously, check out this list and our photographic evidence below:    - Livermush - Deviled eggs - House pickles    - Hushpuppies - Chicken Tenders - 1/4 fried chicken, dark - Cauliflower steak  - Sweet potato dumplings - Broccolini  - Cornbread pudding  - Tater tots  - Mac 'n cheese - Banana pudding  - House made coffee, chocolate cake ice cream   We tried to order the kale grits but they were out. And that doesn't even include our drinks! (The mint juleps are the jam, y'all!)    Every single bite of every single dish was perfect! It's hard to pick favorites, but if I must... I loved the cauliflower steak and sweet potato dumplings. Ted's favorites were the livermush toast and pickles.   Our server, Marnie, was a dream! Just attentive and friendly enough without being over bearing or too \"in your face.\" We had a little bit of business to do with our friend over dinner (we're planning a wedding here, people!!) and Marnie was happy to let us take over the table with notebooks and a laptop for a couple hours.   The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. I loved the simple hostess \"stand\" at the front - a tablet mounted to the wall - and the bar area is big and warmly welcoming. The cutlery is a rose, copper color and just gorgeous! All the food is served on pretty platters, family style. And, their tasteful, restrained use of mason jars is strong!   So, I say again, WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, HABERDISH! Your upscale Southern food served with a smile is a welcome addition to the Queen City's restaurant scene. We can't wait to visit again and often!"}
{"text":"I really liked this new NODA spot!  It's not very big inside, but it has a beautiful layout and bar area, which i'm told is inspired by it's textile mill heritage. Good spot for dinner or to have some hand made cocktails and small plates!   The menu is fairly simple and not very expensive compared to the atmosphere it displays.  Two of us shared the half chicken, two starters and two sides and one beer for less than $30.    On to the food!  4/5 of the food items we ordered were delicious!  We got the pimento cheese ball, which comes like a standard cheese ball, covered with toasted spiced Pecans.  The special crackers they serve with it, makes for a delicious combination.  We also ordered the smoked deviled eggs, which were very solid.  For our entree we split the half chicken (two decent sized breasts, one leg and one wing)  the skin on this chicken was some of the best i've ever had! We ordered the mac and cheese as a side.  It was white cheddar mac and it was delicious.  You can order it with crumbled fried chicken skin on top, which i highly recommend!    The one thing we didn't like was the Sweet Potato Dumplings.  I was really excited for them, but the taste didn't do it for me or my wife.  Maybe it was a bad batch, but the waitress was kind enough to take it off."}
{"text":"They have hit the mark every time. Service is great, food is great and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Cannot even describe how blown away I was at how good the food was. The flavors here are something special that you will not get anywhere else. I can't think of a better place in North Carolina."}
{"text":"For my birthday weekend, we went to Brunch at the Haberdish in Noda. It is a cute little restaurant, that giver off a modern farm/rustic feel. They don't take reservations so get there at a decent time because the line can get long. Everything from Haberdish is locally grown, even their chicken! For brunch (at the time) they offer a limited menu. The most breakfasty item they had was chicken and waffles. Probably the best I have ever had. The waffles have little pearl sugar in them which create a sweater waffle. Their honey butter syrup is to die for too, honestly goes so well over the chicken. Their sides are family style and I 10/10 recommend the mac & cheese. I had also tried their Blonde Bloody Mary, which is cathead vodka, yellow tomato Bloody Mary mix, lime, and olives. I personally wasn't a huge fan of this because I am really into spicy Bloody Mary's and this was on the sweeter side with an odd after taste. Next time I would like to go for dinner and I hear that they have a bigger variety of a brunch menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, enjoyed the fried chicken- it was crispy, hot and juicy!  Two things- (1) we were told that the small sides were enough to share for 2 people- they were except for the coleslaw which was inexplicably half the size of the other sides and (2) this restaurant really needs to up its Mac n cheese game - it came out dry, cold and tasteless.  Just avoid it. Saw other reviews of it and decided to try anyway. My mistake. That being said it was a nice evening with great chicken!"}
{"text":"Holy Haberdish Batman, this place definitely lives up to the hype and then some.  Originally I had come here the other week with a large group (16 peeps) and they were able to seat us all at one table because we arrived for an early dinner [had a show to attend later].  I was so occupied with getting everyone there on time, I really missed out on trying the food.  Never-the-less, I came back with a smaller group this time.  A Thursday evening, and the wait for a table was an hour... so we braved it on their heated patio (which I had no idea they had when I came here the first time).  It actually worked out and we had a great dinner.  This patio space is going to be amazing once the weather gets warmer... they have these large sliding barn doors (naturally closed for the winter) but I could see the space really opening up and bringing the outside in.  Haberdish doesn't take reservations, but you can use the NoWait App to see how long the wait is also put your name down and see yourself move up in the queue... once you get called/texted, you have 10min to claim your table.  I was with other yelpers and we totally over ordered, but the food was super good.  And it was a fun evening taking photos of all the dishes:  tenders, mac & cheese with chicken skins, glazed carrots, kale grits, tots, okra, butter pickles, hush puppies, sweet potato dumplings, cornbread pudding, and coleslaw.  The real gems that stood out were the carrots and kale grits which totally blew us away and were nice unexpected treats in comparison to everything else that was super tasty.  Cocktails are Haberdish's thing as well.  I tried the Xmas Mule which was delicious and super photogenic.  Despite being super slammed, we were still greeted very warmly and even greeted on our way out...our server did a great job splitting our check since we shared everything and she did tempt us with dessert, but we were all full to the brim with food and drink."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally go to Haberdish because I've heard so many great things about it and I have to say it mostly lived up to the hype. My husband and I went on a Thursday night and still had to wait at least 45 minutes, so pretty safe to say no matter when you go, be prepared to wait. Even with a packed house, our waitress was very attentive and gave great service.   We started with the pimento cheese ball and the house pickles for appetizers. I wasn't wowed by either of these, neither were bad but I've definitely had better pimento cheese in charlotte. The cheese ball was covered in pecans and had a chipotle taste to it, just wasn't my style. For dinner I got the two piece fried  chicken (all white meat) and my husband got the chicken fingers. The chicken was fantastic! It had great seasoning and the tenders were so big that two were more than enough for a meal. For sides we got mac and cheese and the pickled coleslaw which were both also amazing. The coleslaw was so different from anywhere else I have had before.   Overall the food was great, so don't let the long wait deter you."}
{"text":"Nice place, rlly nice atmosphere, great cocktail menu. Fried chicken wasn't the best in my opinion, kinda bland but still a solid place worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great food- limited menu though.  Service is always fast and friendly. Limited parking. Wished the has more to offer food wise. Desserts are really good- would recommend the banana pudding."}
{"text":"We walked in for table of 6. Stated it was a 45 minute wait. Okay. So we go to the bar. Within 25 minutes we have our table and our drinks. Great! The service was SO slow. I have to say that our food came out hot but took us forever to order. At least 30 minutes for ordering. The deviled eggs were okay. A little under seasoned. The livermash was dry. My husband ordered two IPAs his second was severed in this small 8 oz rinky dink glass possibly a 6 oz. who knows?!. The service was just unbelievably slow with mediocre food. We probably won't come back. Also a very small menu. So I hope you like what's on it!"}
{"text":"Fast becoming a NoDa staple and why not?  The Instagram pictures are enough to get me in the door.  The decor is casual, rustic.  I like the touches of pressed glass pieces along the wall and the spindle taps from local mills.  The bar stools are comfy enough.  I tried my very first chicken and waffles!  I've never really gotten the concept of this dish, but I'm glad I tried it here.  The portion size is a perfect appetizer or light meal.    I was given the option of breast or thigh de-boned.  I chose the thigh.  The crisp on the chicken was, for me, perfect.  Dark, but not burned, flour-dusted, not breaded... juicy meat.  I love that type of fried chicken.    The waffle was large with a slightly sweet batter that was more creamy cake than fluffy, which again, I like with a normal press on the waffle.  I had the choice of maple syrup or their own honey syrup which was fabulous... great orange blossom honey and spun sugar taste.  Yum.  It all went together so well and the portions were perfect down the last bite of chicken and waffle.  Why did I wait so long?"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Charlotte so far. The mac and cheese was remarkable!"}
{"text":"Haberdish Classic Old Fashioned   Of course it rained while I was sitting outside waiting 4 my food. So I opted to sit inside at the bar. The staff members were super friendly.   The cocktail menu makes it hard to choose a drink because they all seem tasty!!! I ordered the Haberdish Classic Old Fashioned. The frozen rose in the middle of the earthy Bourbon ~~~DELICIOUS!!!!!   I ate the 2pc Dark meat & Mac. The food was perfectly seasoned. No salt\pepper needed. The house hot sauce was amazing!!!   Last but not least ~ I read other reviews prior to visiting Haberdish & the deviled eggs seemed to be a hit. I can now vouch Haberdish Deviled Eggs!!!! The smoked paprika gave it a homestyle taste.   I'll definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"The food and service is really good, I got the 2 piece White with tots and kale salad. Also the rum punch is really good! I've been 3 times since they have opened and haven't been disappointed"}
{"text":"To start, I had the wrong attitude coming to this place.  I've eaten at 'Dish' on Central, several times, and it's just common.  I heard these restaurants are related.  Dish is your typical southern food that tastes like what your grandmother makes. Haberdish, is that, but with an amazing culinary expansion.  Everything we are was fantastic.  I wasn't raised in the south, so the typical southern fare isn't familiar to me and doesn't strike that childhood chord, but this place blew me away. I was caught off guard to say the least.   The biscuit with bacon jam is one of the best dishes in Charlotte.  And the fried chicken, forget about it."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 5 stars, but there were a few issues. The service wasn't the best (our initial server inexplicably didn't return even though she was still on shift, food arrived and we didn't have utensils, extra condiments never arrived etc) and the kitchen was out of the only vegetarian meal on the menu at lunch time. We got a few side dishes to share which were mostly very good - the hushpuppies, savory bread pudding, and mac&cheese were great. The tots were good but a bit too oily, which sounds like the fryer oil wasn't hot enough and they got saturated. The cocktail I got was very good and they didn't skimp on the alcohol, though it was just a bit overpriced. I will definitely return, though I may call ahead to see if the cauliflower entree is available!"}
{"text":"Came here on St Paty's and fell in love with the mac and cheese. Chicken fingers are delicious too (crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside). Next time I'm in Charlotte, I'll definitely go back! Loved the ambience and decor as well-- fancy but cozy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is incredible, the service is bad. The hostess was rude and snarky, and the waiter was super awkward and seemed annoyed.   Also, it's weird how they serve brunch but NOT on Sundays! That's the most popular brunch day!"}
{"text":"Wow, it's tough for me to give 5-stars, but I almost want to for Haberdish -- great atmosphere, great food, good drinks, very good service. We left wanting to go back, and that's actually a nice thing these days. (When we do, if our experience is as good the 2nd time, I'll likely change this to a 5-star review.) Was definitely a nice evening, and glad we went!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. First time there and couldn't be happier. They felt they took too long to bring us our drinks (didn't say a word) but brought them and apologized for the wait. First time that has ever happened to me at a restaurant (been lucky?) As a native here I felt like it was just southern hospitality to go along with my delicious chicken and waffles (thigh of course) and the buttery syrup. Do yourself a favor and stop reading reviews and just go get some damn good food and drinks"}
{"text":"This is a newer trendy spot in Noda.  The wait can be really long!  Lucky for me we went on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately.    We ordered the hush puppies and pimento cheese for appetizers.  The pimento cheese is different than normal pimento cheese.  I'm torn on how I feel about it because it has nuts in it.  For dinner I ordered two chicken tenders and split a large mac and cheese.  They were both really good.  Our service was incredible.  This is definitely a place you go for unique drinks and southern food!"}
{"text":"Punch of the day was on point - tart and bubbly. Pimento cheese ball was not quite right - maybe it needed some sharper cheddar to round it out.  I went with my family and we did it right - two big chicken dishes and a bunch of small sides for sharing.  We were thrilled with the fried chicken but not so sure about the white sauce on the smoked chicken. Seems like you can't go wrong with the sides, but **do not even think about skipping the mac n cheese with crispy fried chicken skin**.  Maybe I'll have it for dinner next time.  Get the family size.  You won't regret it. And don't forget the booze - no real southerner would.  The drinks here can't be missed."}
{"text":"Welcome to NoDa! First of all, the space is modern and clean. The waitstaff is friendly. Now the food... There are some serious hits here. The fried chicken is delicious and that habanero hot sauce is a must try if you like spicy food. Don't let \"habanero\" scare you away though, it's not that spicy. The batter on the chicken has great seasoning and a slight touch of sweetness. The kale grits were creamy and perfectly cooked -- tender but not seized. Now, there was a miss, the smoked deviled eggs -- those were not my favorite. By the time they are boiled and deviled then smoked, the egg white was rubbery and unpleasant. However, if you like pickles, they seem to always have at least a couple types on their menu at any given time. I always order them both. My friends really loved the pimento cheese - I wasn't wowed by it, I thought it was a bit under-seasoned, but I thought it was still pretty good. Now for the drinks -- I find they make a very nice drink, but their cocktail menu hangs out on the sugary side of the spectrum."}
{"text":"We had a decent experience here. We didn't wait long for a table. The restaurant is beautiful. We ordered a few cocktails. They were good and pretty! We ordered a few appetizers- Deviled eggs and the biscuit with bacon jam. I liked both of them but could do away with the biscuit. It was good but just really heavy. We ordered a few side items and some of us got fried chicken and the others got chicken tenders. We didn't get a side item that we ordered. Not a biggie but would of been nice to try. By the time our server came, we already started eating our food so there was no point of asking and waiting for it. My husband also ordered a dipping sauce with his chicken tenders and he didn't get it. So we had to wait on our server and ask for it.   Overall, the experience was ok. I can't think of anything that was very memorable other than how pretty my drink was. The fried chicken was good, just not great or that special. My husband thought his chicken tenders were just ok because the breading was very thick and crumbly."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is AMAZING! The drinks are magical & the food is SO good. They put fried chicken crumbles on mac & cheese. Omg! I didn't know that I needed that in my life but I'm happy that it happened because it's the most amazing thing ever"}
{"text":"I'm writing an update to add: go on Wednesday night! We had absolutely no wait at 630p and we could've chosen to sit at the bar, at a table inside or on the patio. We sat out on the patio, where it was comfortable at first but colder and colder as our meal went on. By dessert, we were ready to bolt! I'm sure they'll get heat lamps for next fall, considering they just opened and knew summer was coming. If you're going to sit outside, it's on you to bring a jacket. Don't be like us!   We shared Tenders, Macncheese, Hushpuppies, Dill pickles and each ordered a biscuit. I would recommend getting the full size Macncheese over the half portion because it's definitely more than double. We each took home a portion as leftovers. Everything we ordered was just as delicious and consistent as on my first visit. The pickles come as spears and could've used a little more time in the pickle but they were still crisp and sour. I ordered the lemon tartlet to try after seeing it featured on their Instagram page. Thin tart shell, light on the lemon curd and heavy on the whipped cream. Good ending to our meal but not your typical 1/2 in of curd in a traditional lemon tart.   Cheers go out to our waitress who realized we were going to take enough food home to make a plate and brought us a box for our chicken and biscuit, a container for our mac, parchment to wrap our pickles in so they don't get everything else soggy and bags since we had two containers each. Super thoughtful and way more attention to detail than I've seen anywhere for a to go box.   Haberdish, I'm in trouble, twice in one week. Who knows what's to come!"}
{"text":"Wide array of tasty cocktails, friendly knowledgeable staff, and great comfort food.  The flavors in food you can get from this place are all over the place, so it's perfect for families or groups of friends with picky tastes.  What they do with okra and fried chicken is awesome."}
{"text":"Y'all. Do yourselves a favor and just GO.   If there are any negative reviews on Yelp about Haberdish, I'll never understand why (to the man complaining about the types of people dining at Haberdish, specifically complaining about the mean wearing pocket tshirts, broaden your horizons and please get over yourself).   This place has some of the best friend chicken I've ever put in my mouth. The breading used for the chicken is out of this world. Haberdish takes \"tater tots\" to a new level. Rather than your standard fried tot, this tater tot actually tastes like a baked potato in tot form. It's absolutely incredible. They have a kale salad which is an amazing app that is served with goat cheese and mandarin oranges.  I've tried nearly all their apps, and apart from the tots, the sweet potato dumplings and the hushpuppies are incredible.   Their brunch menu is out of this world, and is so much better than most brunch spots you can find in CLT - OH and brunch i served on the weekdays here...find me a place other than Tupelo Honey that serves brunch on weekdays.   Oh...and that only covers the food. The specialty cocktails and the atmosphere are awesome. If you're wanting to go somewhere and have a full-on dining experience, Haberdish is your place. They have the culture, the food, the drinks, and the service to create a really one-of-a-kind place. Don't believe me? Southern Living just voted them #2 Restaurant of the South."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelpers, we decided to come to Noda and see the area. Came on Sunday Superbowl Sunday around 12. There was no wait and got seated immediately. It was a rough night so we couldn't wait to fill up on fried chicken. Ordered half, Mac n cheese with the skin, kale salad and the corn bread pudding. Fried chicken had lots of flavors, meat was still juicy. I loved the kale salad. I had it all to myself. Mac n cheese was good. We could have gone without the corn bread. It was on the drier side. The price was very reasonable.   I love the decor. It reminded of fixer upper of HGTV. The serving dishes are a bit vintage and they have these amazing barn doors. Southern chic at its finest."}
{"text":"One of my fave places in Charlotte! I love the southern food with a fun, creative twist. The chicken tenders and charred okra are must trys! The service has always been great and the ambiance is super cute. Their cocktails are also amazing. You can't go wrong with a cocktail punch bowl which is perfect for 3-4 people."}
{"text":"Amazing meal!!! We went to Tender City and had a blast. Macaroni & cheese with the chicken skins, pickled cole slaw and tots were amazing side kicks to the meal. Franky enjoyed the trout and the wine flowed in abundance. Now time to start our New Years resolutions...."}
{"text":"Southern meets swanky. The hype is real, y'all.   I have been so excited for Haberdish to join the Charlotte culinary scene and it was worth the wait. Real talk: this is the only restaurant where I will ever order chicken tenders. You win #alltheawards for chicken tenders.   Before I talk about the rest of the food, here's an important life hack for this place: get on your Yelp app and use the wait list option. Yes, you can literally put yourself on the waitlist. It's always going to be busy. Don't act surprised, don't bitch about it, just deal with it. And if you don't feel like waiting (or talking to human beings), you can get on the Haberdish website and place to go orders.   Our visit here we got: cheese straws (the only thing we didn't love), dill house pickles (bread & butter and a daily option as available), biscuits & bacon jam (the winner of the apps), deviled eggs (a very close runner up), chicken tenders, smoked chicken (Alabama White Sauce is what made this dish), sweet potato dumplings, mac n cheese with crispy chicken skins, broccolini, charred okra, tots, and the waffle for dessert. Before you plan an eating intervention for me, please note that this was all split among four people. I thought everything was delicious. I love their homemade hot sauce. The table as a whole did not love the sweet potato dumplings. They are different. I liked them, though I may not order them every time because there are so many delicious side options. On Sundays, they do chicken and waffles. Tuesdays, chicken and biscuits.   I didn't do a cocktail this visit, just a glass of rosè. Colleen was just named Charlotte's best bartender by Thrillist. I have no doubt you can't go wrong with a drink here.   The most surprising thing for me was how affordable a meal can be. I paid for my rosè, an app, couple chicken tenders, couple sides, part of the dessert and spent less than $30 (before tip).   If you're not familiar with NoDa, a warning that parking completely blows in this neighborhood. Be patient, drive around, pay attention to signs, and don't block anyone's driveway."}
{"text":"The hush puppies with tea butter was crispy outside and fluffy inside and delicious. Unfortunately everything else was average you can get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the infamous Haberdish! Goose got off work around 6pm on a Friday and we headed straight there. We were able to be seated right away, so I recommend going for early dinner!  We got to sit on their gorgeous side patio in the lovely spring weather. There's much more space inside and on the patio than I thought! We started off with their extensive cocktail list and weren't disappointed. My spring fever was original and refreshing, and the Goose loved his take on an old fashioned. Unfortunately our luck with cocktails ran out, and the second round wasn't quite as good. I give all the props to the Goose for finishing his Gibson - it was pretty potent. Drinkers beware.  As for the food, there were some huge hits and a couple of misses. The fried chicken is everything you could want and more, but the fried cauliflower was a bit of a miss. The extra greasy, crunchy coating just wasn't doing it for me. The hushpuppies are a must-try, as well as the corn bread pudding. The mac n cheese was also pretty delicious (but when is it not?).   We were a little bummed because we were told they were out of the sweet potato dumplings, but then we saw them get served to a table that arrived after us. I also still find it frustrating that it's so difficult to get a table! We went back the next night at 8:30pm to get dessert and was told there would be an hour wait - yet there were plenty of empty tables. Wish they took reservations."}
{"text":"I loved this experience! I did so much researching before we came to Charlotte on the best spots to go and this one was at the top of many lists. I LOVED the vibe here, both the indoor and outdoor seating were nice and it just felt so trendy. We came early and were second in a long line and by noon this place was packed.  Cocktails: I got the spiked pineapple cocktail, which could be skipped, go for the instagram worthy mint julep instead. If something is supposed to have jalapeños I want to taste that spice and this one lacked (just tasted of pineapples and no cool flower in my drink either).  Food: We split a bunch of stuff which I thought was the way to go. You can skip the deviled eggs, they were good but nothing out of this world. I would definitely order the hush puppies and the biscuits, but the stars of the entire meal were the chicken tenders and the corn bread pudding. That fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had and the corn bread pudding was such an unexpected pleasant surprise. It had a perfect char and the combination with the gruyere cheese was amazing. Awesome spot in NoDa! I'm coming back for that mint julep!"}
{"text":"Food is heavy and fried, which you want sometimes. I like the cauliflower steak with chimichurri sauce.  Cocktails are pretty good."}
{"text":"Hard to give this place 3 stars but I just couldn't get down with all the hype. Was extremely excited to try this place out after all the positive reviews, however the food just didn't spark the fire for me. While yes it was good nothing was over the top delicious especially for the prices. Service was okay. Didn't really care that we were there it seemed. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes Sir! Folks finally another restaurant decided to show up in Charlotte!!! Haberdish is not joking by any stretch. One try and it's now in my top five for Charlotte (of which in this town five great restaurants is VERY difficult to find). I tried to come here once before and it was an hour wait so I left. I understand the hype completely. This place had awesome food and the portions, even for a small was a good size for sharing. We had four items and three drinks and the price? $55. I would have gladly paid more without a blink!  Go!!!  I repeat, Haberdish shows up!!"}
{"text":"Their Mac and cheese was very good!!! I would have given them 5 stars if they didn't charge you per chicken finger lol. All in all a great atmosphere, perfect food and even better location. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Loved Haberdish! My husband and I went last Friday night and used the No Wait app to figure out our arrival time so we wouldn't have to wait for 2 hours. Once we checked in, we sat at the bar for about 10 minutes, and our table was ready.  Our server was very informative, friendly, and patient. Drinks: We shared the Kentucky Hello Bourbon Punch and it was incredible. Almost too pretty to drink, and tasted even better.  Apps: We ordered the smoked deviled eggs - so so so good. As long as you are a fan of the smoked flavor, you will love these. Sweet potato dumplings - We were extremely disappointed after reading so many raving reviews about these. The dumplings were very bland. We were expecting an intense sweet potato flavor, and there was very little sweet potato taste, if any at all. To us, the dumplings tasted like dough topped with butter, salt, and pepper. Maybe my palette isn't advanced enough for these, but I just do not understand the hype. Main: Chicken tenders with honey mustard - oh my gosh. Delicious!! The chicken is so tender and moist (sorry for all who hate that word) and the skin is so crispy. The honey mustard has a little wasabi kick to it - pairs perfectly! Side: Mac n cheese - thick and creamy, just the way we like it. However, it came out lukewarm. That didn't stop us from devouring it, though! We will absolutely return to Haberdish but instead of the dumplings order the hushpuppies or biscuits. :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Haberdish for dinner, and can say it was very much worth it!  Everything was delicious. They always have a wait and I hate lines which is why it has taken me so long to visit this fine establishment, but I think that speaks well to the quality of their food and friendly waitstaff.   We ordered a medium punch bowl as our drink of choice - the hibiscus one and it was wonderful and refreshing!  For apps/snacks we got both the pimento cheese ball (comes with crackers and apples!) and the hush puppies, which come with sweet tea butter, and omg are those good!  I recommend treating it like tapas and sharing a bunch of things.  We each ordered two of the chicken strips and then split a bunch of slides. Do make sure you try the fried chicken or chicken strips because they are worth it! For sides, we shared mac and cheese of course, a daily special of hot kale and bacon with goat cheese (so good), and the okra - and I don't usually like okra but these were so great, and not fried!   Definitely need to give this place a try if you haven't and brave the lines, or call ahead for a seat! Next, I need to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"The food was the bomb!!! I wasn't expecting it to be that great. I pass it by quite often but never stopped in until tonight. I was just so thankful for every bite I took of their food.   The menu is simple and straight to the point. I went with a friend and we ordered tenders and a side of Mac N Cheese with the chicken skins and hot sauce along with the cornbread pudding. We were able to split our sides and still get full. I have never had a cornbread pudding that was so delicious in all my life.   The customer service was great and I will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Have only heard good things, and since we were in town for the weekend - we thought we'd check it out! Haberdish is very southern food - but very good food and lots of it.  Would definitely recommend it, the service is good and the food is yummy and quite filling as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and drinks.  Really cool decor inside.  Artistic take on southern food.  The menu is limited but what they do have is tasty with only a few misses on my visit.  Tried the livermush app - it was burnt so very disappointing.  Smoked deviled eggs tasted okay-smoke gave it new twist, but the yolk portion was bland.  The smoked chicken was super yummy and fall off the bone tender. Okra, cheese straws, and kale grits were very good also.  Tasted fried chicken it was also good but heavily breaded compared to light at crispy.  This place will be good for a quick bite and i can see it being a hot spot as it warms up and they open up the patio. The drinks were the best part- mixed just right and new and intresting combos of ingredients."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience!  Haberdish hits the mark...family friendly, great cocktail selection and delicious food!   The staff is diverse and well trained. The musical selection is a great backdrop, truly enhances the space and is a seemless blend of neo-soul, r&b and old school soul classics. The owners definitely put forth a lot thought and planning into the interior design (color scheme, floor plan, fixtures and furniture).  I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. Go for the weekday brunch!! They serve the best cinnamon roll that you will eve taste. Love the atmosphere. The chicken tenders are some of the best ever. Cocktails are on point. They make a great old fashioned. Again, I like to go for brunch. Cinnamon roll and coffee to start. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. One of my favorite Charlotte spots!"}
{"text":"I wish, I wish, upon a star, to be eating here for dinner on a day, not too far!   Bring it on. Bring it all on. I'm trying to rationalize going out to eat again (okay, look, it's hard to get to uptown when you live at the lake.)   I'm impressed, and presently salivating at the memory of my dinner.   For starters...they use Springer Mountain Farms chickens which are vegetarian fed and pesticide/antibiotic/hormone free. The quality starts in the ingredients, I'm sure we can all agree.   The entrees are served a la carte which allows for some flexibility in your dinner plate!   I ordered a biscuit, one chicken tender, sweet potato dumplings, mac and cheese, cauliflower steak and a kale salad. I'm going to break this down for you, mostly because each item rocked my socks.   Biscuit- unique, flaky, buttery, and must have had an egg wash on top for the glossy finish it had. Served with a butter so tasty-so sweet that they must have churned it while whispering it sweet nothings.   Chicken tender-meaty, moist, juicy, and the breading was flavorful and actually stuck to it. I don't know about you, but when the breading falls off, it makes me sad. High-fives!   Mac and cheese- cheesy and delicious. Not the best I've had, though. Probably would pass on this one going forward.   Kale salad- this salad was stupid good. It could have been the candied benne mixed with the oranges and goat cheese, maybe it was the pomegranate molasses dressing. I don't know. But I was nursing this salad like it had no tomorrow. So. Good.   Cauliflower steak- since when do you swoon over cauliflower? Oh yea, since eating here. The flavor profile is so complex and tasty! The serving size was huge! You never know with vegetable steaks the size you're getting, and they didn't disappoint. It was delicious! Crispy edges, just what you need.   Sweet potato dumplings- brown butter, sage, and parm. Say it with me (in your best southern woman voice) \"Lawwwwwd have mercy!!!\" These dumplings brought me to my knees. It was a religious experience. You think I'm kidding? I literally thanked God then and there for the genius minds that concocted this heavenly dish. I have never had sweet potato dumplings before, and now I can say I need no other. They kind of taste like gnocchi in regards to their texture, which makes sense because it's potato based.   When you're willing to go back to a restaurant for their SIDE DISHES (and that's in no way a slam to their entrees which are amazing) that is a testament to the genius in the kitchen here.   They had a nice variety on their drink menu. I was a little unbalanced when my brut sparkling wine was sweet, but it was still good. The Tannat red wine was so smooth and even bodied! Definitely the best wine I've ordered at a restaurant--great item on the wine list.  We also utilized the NoWait app which allowed us to grab drinks somewhere else and be notified when our table was ready. Very nice!   True southern cuisine, my friends. I'm looking forward to a brunch here!"}
{"text":"We ordered a whole fried chicken to go with biscuits, okra, and slaw. I thought the chicken was good. I had a breast and a drum stick. It was very seasoned and tasted a bit smoked. I  really liked the biscuits.  They were heavy and buttery, a perfect companion for the chicken. The crunch of the chicken was tasty. My husband didn't care for the okra and said he wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"So good! Food is so good...sweet tea butter is mouth watering! Chicken so crispy...Mac and cheese so creamy...okra so okra-ey! Cocktails made me tipsy"}
{"text":"Came here for my bday dinner last month. Food was pretty good, particularly the main dishes. Fried chicken was on point. Tasted lile bojangles fried chicken. And let me tell you, bojangles is dank! Their smoke chicken was even better. We ordered a bunch of sides too but i can't remember what all we got except that they were good for the most part. Everything was famoly style. Cocktails were a bit on the expensive side, but they were well made. Service was decent. There's typically a ridiculous wait if you come during busy dinner hours. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great ambiance drink and chicken! Yum yum yum... the patio area is awesome and the bar is always packed with good conversation. Defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and cocktails were also very tasty. Only gave it 4/5 because the food menu was very small - 4 entrees to pick from! I just wish there was more selection."}
{"text":"This place was an incredible find. We were walking to Cabo and saw this place and went 'wth let's go here instead'. Such a great decision!   1. Food: we ate the biscuits and bacon jam, the pork shank, the fried chicken and the mojito icecream. I really really enjoyed everything we ate! we sort of expected something to not be up to the mark (cause you know, how can everything be great), but everything was amazing  2. Service: the service is really good. The food came within minutes, the servers were nice and helpful.   Overall, very happy with the place and the $$ you pay for things. Will surely return.   If you have a wait time to get your table, remember to not go across the street to Whiskey and Wine- those guys are crooks."}
{"text":"Overall really liked this place! We did order way too much, portion sizes are pretty big. Appetizers the hush puppies are good but need to be served with some sort of sipping sauce, I had to lather on the butter so they weren't too dry. Butter was really good though. Pimento cheese, it was ok. I felt it was a little bland and the simple saltine crackers were underwhelming. Biscuits good but need to be served with that awesome butter or once again super dry. Meals! Got the breast and wing and OMG the chicken was huge. Literally two ppl could have split it. But the fried chicken was really awesome, crispy, juicy and lots of flavor. Mac and cheese was ok, it had a gritty texture. Didn't like the sweet potato gnocchi, just had an overwhelming flavor I didn't care for and would not order again. Tater tots were our favorite for sure! Clearly we ordered too much but wanted to try a little bit of everything so tons of food to take home. As for service used the no wait app and timing was spot on! Server was good at first but once our food was served never came back to check in. Finally got boxes and again had to wait so long for check my husband just went tracked her down to pay. I knocked off a star for service unfortunately. Especially because we came at 9pm so wasn't like we wanted to have a long drawn out dinner. Overall would come again and now know what I like but not sure if it's worth the 90min wait."}
{"text":"Amazing. We arrived with a large party of 7 and checked in about 645 on their app, arrived at 7, and were seated around 745. I think if we had 6 or less people we wouldn't have waited half as long. Our group grabbed drinks at the bar and hung out on the porch until we were seated and it wasn't a problem.   We ordered most of the menu between our group and it was overall really delicious.   Price point is great. We tried as hard as we could to 'ball out' because it was my birthday and our bill for just food no drinks for my husband and I was only $55 after tax and tip and i have a full box of leftovers. You could easily get out of here for less than $40 for a couple and be stuffed, which isn't common for restaurants of this quality in Charlotte.  Highlights:  fried chicken - best I've had cauliflower steak - GET THIS. its covered in chimichurri and its amazing. sweet potato dumplings - more like gnocchi, and GOOD. cornbread pudding - RICH, you dont need a big portion hushpuppies - the sweet butter on the side, yum.  Wouldnt get again:  house dill pickles - perfectly good but plain, next time ill try the special. mac and cheese - More of a saucy style, i prefer baked. kale salad - I love kale salads and this one was just okay to me, dressing lacked flavor.  Smoked potato salad: smoke was really strong  Kind waitstaff and bartenders, beautiful interiors (I especially love the vanity in the womens bathroom - beautiful!), worth a visit!"}
{"text":"First things first, use the no wait app to avoid lines when you arrive. The restaurant is super cute and their plating dishes are so cute! The mint julep was amazing but the best food was the fried chicken (perfect amount of crisp), their special hot sauce, and the mac and cheese. They have small plates for sides and larger plates so our group got the larger plates and decided to share everything.   Parking in NODA is a pain so we decided to uber which made our experience very pleasant since we already had a reservation via the app."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went on a Thursday to celebrate his birthday. The food was amazing! But the service was slow; could be that there were a number of people being trained that night, idk. We had the smoked deviled eggs, which I highly recommend. He tried the smoked chicken and I had the fried; both were great. The blackened okra is also worth trying. For the recored, I am jot an okra fan but these were pretty tasty. The desserts...oh mylanta! We had the banana pudding -- huge portion and delicious -- and the sheet cake -- also large and super delicious. My new fav dessert spot, actually. Overall, the portions are ample and the atmosphere is great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and I can't believe I hadn't been sooner! Joined two of my friends for dinner and drinks - first off the spiced pineapple rum punch was DELICIOUS - had I not driven, I probably would have had 2-3. With the jalapeño, it's not actually as spicy as I expected.   We started with the pimento cheese ball which was so flavorful and I loved the thin crackers it's served with! Definitely a great starter. Next I had the two piece white fried chicken which had the most beautiful, flavorful, somewhat spiced crunchy exterior. The meat was juicy and flavorful. I got the sweet potato dumplings as my side which really just tasted like sweet potato gnocchi. -I wish they had some type of dipping sauce on the side with these. Something like brown sugary...   Loved the food and the atmosphere, I'd definitely come back with a group and share more dishes/sides to try more."}
{"text":"While still sitting at our table, waiting for the check and enjoying our last round of mimosas I will go ahead and say, WOW. This place is phenomenal. From the food to the staff to the atmosphere to even the story on the menu this place is amazing. Stumbled across it today when Heist was packed and I am so thrilled we did. Amazing chicken, grits, okra and even bacon jam!!! Thanks for a fabulous meal and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Use the no wait app to beat a normal 2 hour wait. Hush puppies are 10 per order, and wonderful. The fried chicken is a don't miss.  The biscuits are tasty too! The atmosphere is perfect not to loud but upbeat, great service."}
{"text":"Here on vacation and loved it. Great service and amazing food! The food is fresh and you can tell it's not Sysco, meaning farm fed and fresh! The environment is a great setting with indoor and outdoor setting, perfect any occasion."}
{"text":"Haberdish is one of my favorite restaurants! I love all of their sides! The okra and kale salad are my top 2!"}
{"text":"Tuesday evening for dinner, walked right in..no wait (everyone was down the street for taco Tuesday I'm sure).  The server greeted me and honestly she was the best part of my experience here.  She was the greatest at explaining the menu. She was patient and very personable.  I really appreciate the time she took with me while I waited on my friend.   I ordered the Love Potion 10, with a flower ice cube...because I had to.  It was really delicious.   -Deviled eggs: very smoky..not my favorite  -Hush puppies w/sweet tea butter: good -Cauliflower: either my smoky egg got on them, or they were smoked up themselves..I'm not sure..did not care for -Tender: good, BBQ sauce for the win..honey mustard was wasabi-ish, the vinegar based white sauce...awful! -Sweet potato dumpling: what on earth is everyone raving about?!  I literally couldn't stand them. NOT what I expected or hoped.  No sweetness at all. -Mac&Cheese w/skins: good, spicy and filling  I expected more and was sort of let down.  I was initially so excited to come here.    Thanks to my waitress for all your help!"}
{"text":"When in Charlotte on business I enjoyed my trip Haberdish. When you come you really have to expect Carolina southern cooking. I enjoyed biscuits covered in bacon jam, fried chicken, hush puppies, cheese straws, brussel sprouts, and sweet potato dumplings. I would most recommend the fried chicken, hush puppies, and brussels sprouts.   I also liked the drink selection here and the way it was described by our server. Specifically how strong the drinks were, what kind of flavor I can expect, etc. You should visit you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Drinks are fun. Food was great. Fried chicken was perfect. Mac n Cheese with chicken skins is as good as it sounds."}
{"text":"So after a few months, I decided to come back and give this place another try. They've definitely improved and I'm a fan now.  Both their fried chicken and chicken tenders were a lot juicier. We also ended up ordering the pimento cheese ball, okra, and mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok but everything else was fantastic. Looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"The wait was about an hour longer than we were quoted. Took the waitress about 15 minutes to get to our table. food is good.  Definitely not worth the hype, wait, or lack of customer service"}
{"text":"I greatly enjoyed my experience at Haberdish! Five of us went in for a working brunch on Friday, and it was the perfect location for our needs. At 10am, only a few tables were occupied, so we opted to sit in the semi-outdoors patio area off the main dining room.   Our server (I think her name was Carolina!) was beyond sweet and accommodating to our many beverage and food requests. I started with a classic bloody mary and later enjoyed a smoked mint julep, both of which I'd highly recommend. I love that the coffee is served in a thermos, which keeps it pretty hot for a while.   We shared a few plates to start, including pickles, hushpuppies and a cinnamon roll. I can't speak to the cinnamon roll (though it looked delicious) but I can definitely say that the hushpuppies were the best I've ever had. Haberdish serves theirs with sweet tea butter, which was phenomenal, and even more so with a dash of the housemade hot sauce.   My main plate consisted of the egg biscuit sandwich, a chicken tender, mac and cheese with spicy/crispy chicken skins, and some kale salad. Delicious! This was the southern meal I showed up for!   I had to practically roll myself to the airport after our brunch. I'll be eating clean all week to make amends, but it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow. So delicious. The fried chicken and waffles are amazing. All of the appetizers and cocktails are great too. It's like a fancier, more delicious version of bojangles with more options on the menu. I mean that as the highest compliment. Please try this place out in NoDa because they are amazing! I would recommend going earlier in the evening or trying to get in on a waiting app because the wait can be pretty long on the weekends. I can't wait to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Haberdish is solid restaurant, but I don't think it's worth a two hour wait. I used Yelp to make a reservation and was told 2 hours. Ended up walking in and sitting at the bar immediately. Problem solved.  I had the 2 piece fried chicken with white meat w/ Alabama white sauce and a side kale salad. The fried chick was well seasoned. The white sauce ended up being a combination of ranch and horseradish. Take from that what you will. The kale salad was delightful and unexpected. It had the creative flavor.... sweet moments and texture from seedlike elements.   Service was great and the bar tenders worked as a team. Nice place. However, there wasn't anything that I'll be craving to rush back for."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, friendly staff. Had the fried chicken which was very good , the Mac and cheese was awesome and a corn bread casserole which was very good also. Couldn't make up my mind on a drink because the list of speciality drinks was long and they all had ingredients I never heard,  so I settled on the holiday punch which was awesome . I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Felt compelled to review because it's been a while since every bite of my meal (and the other's at my table) was excellent. Had the chicken tenders, pickles, deviled eggs, and cast iron okra. The hostess wasn't the warmest, but our server was kind and helpful. If I could have, I'd have bought a whole jar of the pickles."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place since it opened because I have only heard good things and this past weekend I finally got my chance. My dad and I were wrapping up some Christmas shopping and noticed there was no line for lunch!   My dad and I popped in and were instantly hungry by all the amazing smells filling the restaurant. Most note worthy were the multiple plates of fried chicken leaving the kitchen.   The menu is on the smaller side, but everything on it they are doing right!. We ordered the mac and cheese (with the hot sauce and fried chicken skins on top), the hot side of the day - collard greens, fried chicken, and ribs. Yes our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. Everything we ordered was the definition of comfort food. The mac and cheese was delightful with the kick from the hot sauce and the crunch from the chicken skins, the collard greens were in my dad's opinion the best EVER, and the ribs were smoky and fall off the bone. But the STAR of the event was the fried chicken! Crispy, salty outside and juicy, tender on the inside, some of the best fried chicken I have ever had and I was raised in the South.   In addition to the delicious food, they have craft cocktails and beers on tap. My dad got the founder's stout which was aged in oak barrels and so creamy smooth and I got the holiday Moscow mule which was a fun twist on one of my favorite cocktails.   We are looking forward to going back when my brother is in town!"}
{"text":"My all-time favorite restaurant in Charlotte! This restaurant is doing everything right. -Great bar -Great handcrafted cocktails -Great food - small plates and family style.. get the mac&cheese and sweet potato dumplings My go to spot for a fun dinner. Great for date night, girls night, family night, anything!"}
{"text":"I really want this place to be good. Have tried it several times and it is always disappointing. It's southern done way wrong. Stop trying to be quite so fancy and get some advice from true southern cooks. Please stop over complicating liver mush. Learn how to make cheese straws the right way and get some help with that Mac and cheese. I will however give credit for the kale salad, it is very good."}
{"text":"So I've had a lot of friends recommend Haberdish and today we decided to take the plunge. We got the chicken and waffles, two chicken tenders, the pimento cheese, and biscuits with bacon jam. If you go here, you have to try the fried chicken! I usually don't eat fried food, but this is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The biscuits with bacon jam were a little off putting-we didn't really get the bacon flavor so much as a upscale sloppy Joe taste, but everything else more than made up for it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Best fried chicken I've ever had and the macaroni and cheese is amazing. The cocktails are quality and always changing. Excellent customer service aside from one turd that took over for our waiter at the end of our meal. Love it"}
{"text":"Holy Haberdish Batman, that's some good f%$#&^ fried chicken! Very impressed! Had the opportunity to stop in last week with my wife and daughter to check out this place. We were not disappointed. First off, it has a cool vibe and cold beers! We tried a few side items to go along with the fried chicken. We went with the sweet potato dumplings (I'd get them again), one of their specials for the day, brussel sprout cesar salad, and the mac & cheese with spicy, crispy chicken skins on top. Everything was fantastic!! The staff was friendly and helpful too! Can't wait to get back over there and try some of their signature cocktails!"}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed a meal here. Love the fried chicken and Mac and cheese!! Always a casual chill atmosphere for a date night."}
{"text":"Really surprised to see the 3 star reviews. The food was great and the cocktails were even better!   Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5  The pros: the vibe of this place is awesome! From the brick to the light fixtures to the cocktail glasses, no detail was missed! Our drinks were awesome and our waitress (Marty, I believe) was wonderful. They were super friendly and I have zero complaints. The serving size of our food was great. We each ordered an entree and shared two single serving sides. We couldn't finish it all.   Decent: the food.  I had chicken tenders -- they were huge and served hot. I asked to try all of the sauces and they happily brought them. Overall, the tenders were a little short on flavor but good none the less. My fiancé had the fried chicken (white meat) -- I didn't have any but he described it as good and crispy. He said it had good flavor and wasn't greasy. Not the best he's ever had but solid. The mac and cheese with chicken skin -- I only had a few bites of it (cheese is not always my friend) and thought it was okay. My fiancé and I both felt that the mac and cheese would've been better baked (but that's a matter of personal preference).  The sweet potato dumplings -- these were tasty, other than the fact that they were a bit too salty for me. Other than that, I loved the flavor and the texture of them.   Not my #1 spot in Charlotte but a solid choice that I am sure we will visit again."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is absolutely delicious and rivals that of the gas station on east/south Blvd! The staff is helpful and the drinks are amazing (a little on the pricey side but absolutely worth it). The appetizers are creative and tasty. When it comes to main dishes, however, we'd love a couple more options! Oh....and they have tater tots!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but drinks were horribly expensive. We tried 3 of their specialty drinks which cost $14 each which were served in the old fashioned style champagne glasses. Not worth the price.   Good for one time but doubt I'll be back ."}
{"text":"Fry chicken banging, okra amazing however the waitress forgot to put both mine and my husband's order in.  The only reason we did not leave is because we were super hungry. New folks sat next to us got there food and left and we still didn't get ours."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken house, low country, southern, a la carte selection I have EVER been too. I'm a chef in Charleston, SC; there are more southern restaurants than I could describe; I am from Charlotte originally and I knew after I read the menu, I just had to go. How proud I was to see Haberdish, rep Anson Mills!   I seriously have no idea what the comment is about \"don't get the Mac and cheese\" I had the chorizo Mac and cheese and it was, simply amazing. I got the livermush toast, (OMG the cornbread pudding!!!!!) the deviled eggs and the beignet like hush puppies that were awesome, the collards with what seemed to be osso boco broth, because of the delicious pork jus like liquid in those collards were out of this world. Everything was amazing, I wanted to cry in Joy, so proud to be a southerner and a chef and get completely blown away by the passion and simplicity of the restaurant, $12 for a half chicken!!!!!? The fried chicken made anything I've ever eaten before, seem like a pile of mud. In other words, the BEST fried chicken I have ever had. Thank you, thank you, please don't open another store, haha, crown and jewel! Simply.... AWEsome!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp. It was in a great neighborhood, and luckily when we arrived there was no line to get in. Wow! The cocktails here looked amazing; however, after a weekend of wedding celebrations I was in no mood. We arrived during late brunch and decided to sample quite a few items.  Tater tots: Delicious Chicken Tender: To die for... wow! Kale grits: Oh so good Grits on Special: meh. The service was great, but do not come here if you are in a rush or have a flight to catch because you may start to panic at the end when you can't pay your bill because the waitress if having a full on convo with another table. Go when you need an Easy like Sunday morning sort of meal.  Alrighty, that's it. Hit this place up, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker on a quick trip to NC---  We ran the table with our order so we got to sample a lot.  The Brined Chicken was delightful and moist, drenched in sauce. My only knock is that it's a bit hard to eat since you can't use your hands to eat it, but the only reason you can't use your hands is that it is DRENCHED in delicious Alabama White Sauce! So in the scheme of things, yeah it could be easier to eat but this isn't really something to complain about.  The Chicken tender is truly spectacular. And for $2.50 per it's a steal considering how good it is. If you haven't ordered at least one you're doing it wrong. Almost tastes like the best corn dog you ever had growing up with delicious moist chicken meat. Seriously YUM.  Whatever you get, couple it with a chicken tender so you can experience it. Man, was this good.  Kale salad was a light and tasty balance to the rest of the meal.  Mac and cheese creamy but could use additional components... a bit simple for my palate but still good.  The hash browns were good but not amazing, but if you're looking for hash browns they get the job done!  Kale grits are totally unique but definitely satisfying... wasn't expecting to be wowed but I am so happy I got to try this!  To drink, the Smoked mint julep is not too sweet and definitely smoky if that's your thing... can't beat the presentation! It's not quite MY drink but it is definitely worth trying!  Truly if you get the chicken tenders and go with your gut you will land on something you're satisfied with. We sat one table over from one of the owners and it was clear she has invested considerable thought and emotion into this place and boy has it paid off. Definitely coming back and definitely recommended for anyone coming to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Haberdish since I first moved to Charlotte! I had read such great reviews and wanted to try things out for myself! I got the chicken tenders which were huge, so I could only eat 2! I also got the small size of the charred okra which was probably my favorite part of the meal. You have to get the bacon jam on top! I also ordered the Mac and cheese with the spicy chicken skins on top! The Macaroni was very good but the chicken skins definitely bring some heat to the dish so be aware of that! The small size of the sides is definitely enough to feed 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are and the tenders are big so 2 were plenty! I also got a biscuit to go with the meal and it came with their sweet tea butter which was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back! Next time I want to go for brunch! I follow them on Instagram which makes my mouth water every time they post a picture!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Haberdish. Unfortunately I want to give this restaurant more than four stars.   Most of the food was actually really good! We went for brunch and I got the chicken and waffles, devil eggs, and cheese straws. The chicken was a great choice because it was moist and very tender. You could cut through it with no problem. I really enjoyed their homemade hot sauce as well.   However, The service was not the best. I believe we got a interesting server who was awkward and not very personable. Is common nature to approach people and have open body language and not stand behind them and ask for their order. I am sure other servers are much more attentive.   I guess I was expecting food that would make me want to come back to this place over and over again but I honestly can't say I'm rushing back to go here for brunch . Nevertheless , I will definitely give it another try but not for brunch. I think I will stick with lunch or dinner here.   I believe that the side items on their brunch menu actually would have been fantastic. I believe the menu is too limited for brunch and they need more traditional brunch items."}
{"text":"food tasted all alike \"grease\". wasn't pleased with the food, but service was excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious fried chicken!!!! BEST TATER TOTS I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! Ranch was delicious. Mac and cheese was awesome. Service was great:) everything was amazing we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and it was Amazing! TRY ALL THE SIDES! The kale grits, corn bread pudding and sweet potato dumplings! I had the cauliflower steak and I can't believe how incredibly seasoned it was! Chicken and waffles were yummy as well! Hubby loves the fancy drinks"}
{"text":"We were there for the Sunday brunch hour, and even though they didn't really have a brunch menu, they did have chicken & waffles available and they were fantastic. This my favorite restaurant in Charlotte at the moment."}
{"text":"Finally got in to try Haberdish (H) since they've opened. Being a NODA resident we try to support local businesses to keep NODA thriving. The typical wait is 45 mins but on a bad day it's 2hrs believe me we've tried a few times and the wait for a table is crazy.   Now on to the beers. H has a small craft beer selection but they make up for it with their awesome specialty cocktails. Looking for something strong try the Rooted in 28205, it's honestly straight alcohol but a good balance of bourbon and gin. Looking for something a little light but with a kick, try the Gin Smash.  H is known for their chicken so do yourself a favor and try chicken for your first time. The chicken and waffles are great. It comes with a spicy syrup and the waffle has a varying supply of tiny sugar pieces that compliments the syrup.   Looking for an interesting side, try the kale grits won't say anymore .  Overall a great spot to try. The only issue I had was with my server who was a little introverted. Didn't provide his name and no personality but could have been his first day. Maybe a smile or a how are you guys, welcome to H, is this your first time, try the \"insert here\". Just some hints H."}
{"text":"Seriously in the running for best fried chicken in the city.. But that's just one of the best parts of Haberdish. I absolutely love the ambience of the whole restaurant. The lighting and rustic wood really goes great with what I think the restaurant is trying to establish.   Make sure to fire up the Yelp app and check the wait list and put your name in early! They have quite the extensive cocktail list so you've got to try one! They are handcrafted and almost look to good to drink.   Their menu is set up so that's easy to share with friends or also easy to get just want you need. Their chicken comes in 4 different varieties. 2 piece white or dark or half or whole chicken. It is cooked so well it blew me away. I had heard about how good it was before I arrived but was still amazed.   What an awesome restaurant in the heart of NoDa. If you haven't you need to stop and try this place out. They have plenty of sides that you can't all try at once and will leave you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Amazing craft cocktails. Just what CLT needs. Wishing you would open a Huntersville location. love the bartenders!!"}
{"text":"If you are not on a diet and love Southern food, then this place is PERFECT! We had hush puppies as an appetizer which were delicious. I had the traditional bone in chicken with sides of mac n cheese and cornbread pudding. The chicken and mac n cheese were good, but not as unique as I was hoping for. Cornbread pudding was so good and had melted gruyere cheese in some bites. I'll be needing some extra time at the gym for this meal, but SO WORTH!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Haberdashery since they opened and I finally made it out. We went for a team lunch on Friday and they were serving their brunch menu.   I just got the fried chicken thighs and I thought it was the best fried chicken I've ever had (way better than Price's Chicken Coop). I also sampled hush puppies, mac and cheese, the cinnamon roll, and the waffle. The hush puppies with the sweet tea butter were also the best I've ever had. The mac and cheese was just ok. The cinnamon roll was pretty good, but it's was more of a dry crumbly biscuit and I prefer doughy. The caramel sauce served with it was incredibly good though. The waffle was also very good.   The decor of the restaurant is really well done. It's probably one of my favorite in Charlotte.   This is definitely the place to come if you're looking for some amazing fried chicken and all around good Southern food!"}
{"text":"Chicken was good. Sides were excellent. Really like the atmosphere?. Music is good too. Chicken was good but I might have to try it again to make a solid review."}
{"text":"Okay, okay you win everyone. Haberdish is just as excellent as you described.  I decided to go alone one night and tried a bunch of small plates. I sat at the bar. FYI you can save your place on yelp, which is amazing because they usually have a long wait.  I began with a cocktail the bartender recommended. It was the BBQ apple milk punch. It was delicious. I followed this with a black Manhattan, which I was also very happy with.   I ordered Pickled asparagus, deviled eggs, biscuits with bacon jam, and 2 chicken tenders. I love that there is the option to order a bunch of small things. I loved the deviled eggs and the chicken tenders. They have a lot of flavor and I love that they give you a sauce of your choice to go with it. $2.50 chicken tenders is nice, especially if you want to just go have a nice cocktail and want a quick snack. I wish the bacon jam was more jam-like.   Our second time here they forgot our order (not sure how because we were sitting at the bar and hopefully they noticed how long we had been sitting there without food), but they took all the food off of our bill and we were able to sip great cocktails, so I was happy they took care of it so quickly. I was just surprised we had to ask where our food was and they didn't notice it had been a while.   All in all, I like this place. I love the option to get a big entree or be able to just order some snacks. The cocktails are really my favorite part of this place."}
{"text":"I think my expectation were too high. There is so much hype following this place I expected to be floored. I liked their apps and desserts, the entrees were just meh (there is better fried chicken in Charlotte).  Also I got a real Portland vibe which is no way a bad thing, but in true Portland fashion it took 2 1/2 hours to eat. On a Saturday afternoon. When there was basically no one there, it was st Patty's day so everyone was a brewery's. And they weren't understaffed, there seemed to be 1000 people there bustling about trying to look busy."}
{"text":"I like this place and the pretty drinks. Fried chicken strips rock. Nice atmosphere to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Food seemed salty. We had four small plate they were all over salted. Drinks over priced but taste good but with all the options in clt prob won't go back."}
{"text":"This review is based on the appetizers and some drinks. The venue itself is beautiful and has a candle lit dim to it.   The bloody Mary's were so good had a great kick to it! If you love bloody Mary's you'll love theirs  The 2nd drink I got was the spritzer; really light and refreshing.. definitely enjoyed it   We ordered the house fried dill pickles but they were out of it so the lady that took our order suggested the spears. We didn't know they would be deep fried. They were still amazing! Loved it and even better that it saved me the calories. They tasted like those cucumbers soaked in vinegar (how funny) that you eat at cookouts or that childhood snack.  Mac n cheese with chicken skins- I'm very picky with mac n cheese, I'm more of that baked crusted type of gal. So I was intrigued with this one. Not so bad it was good, definitely thick and not runny and the chicken skins did give it some flavor but it wouldn't hurt if they revamped it. The chicken skins as toppings didn't do it for me.   Hush puppies- OH-M-G were so good, best I ever had. They're just hush puppies though right? But the best. And the spread they had to go along with it was the right amount of sweetness to compliment it"}
{"text":"Amazing!! You definitely need to be hungry thought. We left so full, I don't even remember the last time I felt that full. Very hearty foods, don't expect a light meal but if you're looking for fried chicken in Charlotte it's the best I have tried."}
{"text":"Haberdish, after only one visit, has already blown me away. I want to take my parents here, I want to go here with my friends, I want to order more menu items, I just want Haberdish to continue.  Nikki said it best when she said southern meets swanky. This is real southern food with a definite upscale twist. Using yelp's waitlist app, The Lady and I came here on a Friday night. Expect a wait, anywhere from 45 minutes to an 1:15. You can go somewhere else to get apps or drinks before, you'll survive ;)  We were seated outside, which was our preference because it was a nice night. The outside corridor is lit from the top and has bug screens, making it actually pretty cozy. There's a small open patio at the back end with couches and cushions and all the things you need if you're just grabbing a drink there. However, we were serious about the food.  The cocktail list is seriously extensive and well crafted, so we had to think about it a bit. We ended up with a punch, and a spicy drink that I unfortunately can't remember. Minus 10 points to Haberdish for not having their drink menu online. Anyways, for dinner, we started off with the biscuits with bacon jam, which was insane. Even the semi-vegetarian Lady loved it.  For the main meal, I ordered the Half Smoked Chicken (4 pcs) with the Alabama White Sauce (idk what that is but it was damn amazing) and the lady ordered the Cauliflower Steak with the Chimichurri sauce. I've never had cauliflower taste so good. You could easily taste the smoke in the chicken, and that's what made it so memorable.  For sides, we got the sweet potato dumplings, which were alright, and the mac and cheese, which was rich and delicious. Awesome.  Service was on point, and I can't wait to come back and try more drinks, as well as more food. And honestly, even with so much food and cocktails, it wasn't a bad bill considering. Haberdish has won me over just from one visit. Can't *wait* to come back."}
{"text":"Three of us went to have a lunch on Sunday. As expected, there were people waiting outside(They don't take any reservations)   Even I saw a couple of tables available for new customers while waiting, customers were not seated right away. I am not sure if it is part of marketing to show some customers waiting on a line or something, anyway we were seated at the right exact table that was empty an hour ago.   Finally after seated, we ordered hush puppies, chicken and waffle, biscuit and potato salad(cold side dish). Hush puppies were so great with sweet tea butter that comes with. The chicken was very crispy and tender inside. The waffle was mediocre. I enjoyed potato salad. Pickled onion and bacon was balanced well in the salad. Generally the food was great but it took so long for the food to be served.   If you are patient enough to wait for 3 hours meal(1hour table waiting, 1hour food waiting, 1 hour eating), it will be worthy to try!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!! Amazing chicken, Mac n cheese, okra, drinks, EVERYTHING!!!!"}
{"text":"I understand why the wait was over an hour. The drinks are amazing, and the food is even better. I had a mint julep and hubs had an old fashioned to start. We were told about a 90 minute wait but ended up snagging bar seats after about 30 ish so we ate there. We split the dark meat, chicken tenders, mac and cheese and kale grits. I'm usually not huge on fried chicken but I will absolutely be back for theirs! So get there early and hungry!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one I will always go back to! Their portion sizes are perfect for sharing. Their food is great and their cocktails are great! Their seating is perfect for small to large parties. I will always pick this place for a girls night to date night."}
{"text":"Good service! Very fun spin on some southern classic dishes. It isn't my all time top restaurant but it's a good one. Service was on point and they knew their menu which is always a plus. They have yummy cocktails. We have been back!"}
{"text":"DDelicious food and great service, warmly inviting atmospheric artwork for sale on the wall and some of the best chicken fried rice and shrimp I know I have had. my girlfriend had a coconut mushroom soup and it was definitely delightful!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This place rocks! It's so good that I'm actually writing this review from my desk at work 4 days after I visited. Why? Because I was starving and my mind immediately revisited the awesome, trendy place with amazing food that is Haberdish. They have delicious chicken tenders (for $2.50 ea., and they're large!) And the mac & cheese is to die for. They also have an awesome cocktail menu, and if you go during the week, there is no wait and the service is super fast! If you haven't gone, go!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed an impromptu anniversary dinner here this past Saturday. The decor was very beautiful, nice ambiance. Our waiter was very polite and helpful. Although our order was incorrect - the food was great. We will be back soon! We are ordering the Fried chicken strips, waffles, & Mac/cheese with the skins!! Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Wanted to come back and update my review because I went back a second time and my experience was completely different. By complete chance (and irony) I got the same server, but she was courteous and nice- so I am thinking my first experience was probably a day when I caught both her and the cook on an off day. The food was great the second time around- we had fried chicken, appetizers, the kale grits were to die for! I would come back based on my second experience and I am glad I gave Haberdish a second try!"}
{"text":"Can't understand what all the good reviews are about.  Chicken was good but the batter was meh.  The tator tots were terrible; cold slaw was good.  my biggest complaints were really crappy service and the lemon tart desert was pitifully small, especially for $7.00.  I don't live here but I would not come back."}
{"text":"Tried Haberdish for the first time last night and it was knock-your-socks-off good! Attentive and personable staff and modern/rustic feel makes for a seriously warm and comfortable environment. The menu is simple and so well done - I shared six or seven things with the table and thoroughly enjoyed every dish. The cocktail menu has a stellar mix of classic and creative choices - do *not* miss the Black Manhattan.   Such a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Looking forward to many more meals here!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner with some friends and their new born at Haberdish, on Saturday and we were pleasantly surprised. The place has a nice atmosphere with a nice decor, and good mood music. The menu was a little small not much a selection, we ordered the ribs and it was a little disappointing it was dry, but everything else was good."}
{"text":"I had such a fantastic dinner experience here last night with the bartender Christina. She was sooooooo passionate about the menu and her favorite items and drinks. We were really blown away with our entrees (trout and ribs which were both delectable) and loved the small details like flowers in the ice cubes in our drinks. The ribs were the best i have tasted and soooo meaty. The sweet potato dumplings were DELISH. Unlike the other bartender who was blah and unenthusiastic when we asked questions and tried to make conversation (maybe she was sleepy), Christina sold us on everything and had excellent rapport and knowledge. Which is vital as a bartender!  There are TONS of restaurants/bars in Charlotte but service like hers and great food sets you apart. She is excellent and i appreciate the great dining experience."}
{"text":"Had heard great things about Haberdish, but was even better than expected! I have grown wary of overpriced hipster \"share plates\" style dining (I.e. less food for more money), which seem to be most new trendy places in Charlotte. However, the prices here were reasonable, and the food was good, southern food (not a disappointing fusion). I had the hushpuppies, Mac and cheese, green bean casserole (special of the day), and, of course, the fried chicken. All but the Mac and cheese totally blew me away! The chicken was super flavorful, and crispy not greasy. The space and homage to the mill town heritage which NoDa came from is interesting and cool as well. I will definitely be back, and will try cocktails next time which I hear are great as well."}
{"text":"Stumbled across the place walking thru NODA on Friday around 5pm. Very limited menu. The chicken tenders were good. We also ordered the mac & cheese, carrots and tots. Tots were good, the other two were served warm. The chicken was nice and hot and I am guessing the sides sat out waiting on the chicken. Service started ok, but fell off as the place got busy.  Three stars is all I could give the place. The inside of the place was nice. Funny thing, the receipt and credit card bill both had nothing about the place. No name, address, nothing."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in the world!! I loved my meal so much that whenever I get to choose where to dine, this is my choice. My husband got the ranch chicken and didn't like his at all. You can't go wrong with the fried chicken though and the biscuits are so delicious too!"}
{"text":"Exploring NODA and liked what I saw from the outside of Haberdish so I went in.     Sat at the bar.  Very nice ambience and it appears that they know how to make cocktails as they had a wide variety of bitters and other accoutrements for cocktail makings.  This night however, I ordered a pale ale from their beer menu.  My order consisted of a hushpuppy starter which is served with a \"sweet tea\" butter.  Interesting mild flavor.  Nice.  My main was a 1/2 fried chicken which I was told they are known for.  It was good.  It's fried chicken but it hit the spot and was very reasonably priced.  As a side a had a collard greens special.  Tasty and went well with the fried chicken and as a follow on the hush puppies.     All in all, a nice place, with good atmosphere, food, beer or drinks.  Worthy of a return visit.  :)"}
{"text":"Haberdish was a bit underwhelming.  Everything is ala carte, and the bill can get high quick.  Unfortunately, you don't walk out feeling like you spent you money wisely.  My wife and I went with another couple while we were in Charlotte for a show.  Seemed nice enough, and the staff was great.  We started with some appetizers.  Cheese Straws (my favorite thing we ordered), deviled eggs (I didn't have any not a fan), and hush puppies.  My wife ordered the two piece chicken and Mac n Cheese.  I odored like a child (partially because nothing jumped out at me on the menu) $10 meal of Chicken tenders and tater tots... Our friends ordered cauliflower steak, kale grits, charred okra and corn pudding.  None of us finished our meals. They were prepared well, but none of it was good enough to stuff ourselves.  Other than the cheese straws my favorite was their house made habanero hot sauce.  Everything was just a bit underwhelming except for the bill.  You can see by my review's I'm not afraid to spend money on good food, but I've had way better meals in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing family dinner! my parents were in town celebrating Christmas early and we wanted a southern family meal without the hassle of cooking or cleaning up. we couldn't have chosen a better place...from the house made pickles to the fried chicken and banana pudding, everything was absolutely delicious! the charred okra with bacon jam is to die for, and the black Manhatten cocktail was so smooth! service was great too, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best dish in NODA.  The smoked chicken with the Alabama white sauce is absolutely wonderful.  Every last bite was amazing.  The chicken is perfectly smoked, the white sauce, a blend of creamy, tangy and magic, compliments the chicken so well.  They hand make their tater tots to give you an idea of how good their sides are.  The cauliflower steak is my favorite vegetarian dish in the city.  The cocktails are inventive and play off the menu really well too.  The prices are lower than expected for what you get.  What they do they do really well.    The only knock on the place is the small menu.  After coming in a handful of times I feel like I've tried everything (but I still want the smoked chicken anyway).  The outdoor seating is nice and should make the wait times better in the warmer months than the colder.  If they expand the menu or change it up once in a while it would be a five star place.      This is another offering from the owner of Growlers and Crepe Cellar down the street.  All of them are doing it right.  ***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***"}
{"text":"I was excited when my Yelp search turned up this highly-rated restaurant in NoDa.  How could we go wrong?? We were able to visit before the lunch crowd on a Friday. A quick look at the daily specials and menu warranted that I try the Daily Fruit special consisting of Macerated Strawberries over Carolina Gold Rice with benne seeds. Fruit over rice? The waitress shared that it was a breakfast bowl so I had to have it. I was NOT disappointed. Oh,? my! The warmth of this dish filled my soul with joy! I also ordered the Kale Salad (half size) which was tastefully? prepared with halo-type oranges, benne (sesame seeds), goat cheese, and pomegranate? molasses dressing. Delicious! Both dishes were tapas style but without the cocktail. After my meal, I was a happy camper the rest of the day.  The restaurant has an extensive cocktail menu that will let you get your weekend started off right!  Overall, a great meal with great service.  Oh, they have a nice outdoor patio area as well (see photo). Can't wait to return for more delectable dishes."}
{"text":"I had their chicken and biscuits yesterday.  It. Was. Amazing.  I would eat it every single day if I could.  I also tried their deviled eggs.  Different from traditional, but equally as good.  I would recommend my meal to anyone."}
{"text":"Cute little spot that could REALLY benefit from learning how to take reservations. The \"wait in line\" app is so annoying. It's inaccurate and not much different from a reservation.  However, the food was really good! We got the smoked deviled eggs and biscuits with bacon jam to start.   Then we both got a single chicken tender and shared the sweet potato dumplings and kale salad. Must be the best chicken tender I've ever had. MUST BE! I wanted everything on the menu, but my stomach wouldn't allow."}
{"text":"Haberdish has been on my list to try, and I am so glad I finally made it! First off, the decor and atmosphere are really cool. I would describe it as southern chic; I also love the outdoor patio area.  We ordered hushpuppies to start, and they were so good. They were really crispy on the outside and really soft on the inside. They're made with a different dough than typical hush puppies, and they were delicious. The tea butter was unique and added great flavor.  For dinner, I ordered 2 chicken fingers (you can order them a la carte!) and my fiance and I shared two sides -- the okra and kale grits. My chicken tenders were excellent -- juicy and crispy at the same time. The kale grits were fabulous and made me feel like I was eating something healthy. The grits has great consistency - not rubbery but not soupy.   For dessert, we tried the lemon tart and the buttermilk icecream. Both were excellent -- great flavor! The buttermilk ice cream was definitely unique, but I liked it.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sari A recommended this place for dinner and I was up for it since I love southern food. We came on a Sat night and were seated immediately. Thank goodness because it filled up very quickly afterward.   Our server was new but he was extremely friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. We ordered a larger portion of one of the cocktails with a flower in the ice, and split it when it arrived. It was very good!  For apps, we split the hush puppies (oh my god, to die for) and the deviled eggs.   For dinner, I ordered two fried chicken tenders and the creamy kale grits. The batter on the chicken tenders was perfectly salty and flavorful. The grits were a little on the saltier side but still delicious. The saddest part of the meal was that I couldn't eat all of my chicken tenders, I was so stuffed.   Ugh, it was all so good...."}
{"text":"It was really the perfect setting. A beautiful restaurant, with even the tiniest details being pretty darn adorable. Tea comes in mason jars, rose gold cutlery, and reclaimed wood everywhere. Unfortunately my dish just fell flat.   I ordered the egg tartine. It sounded like an interesting dish, with a soft boiled egg over arugula, beet spread, pickled red onion, with a sage honey vinaigrette. I believe the main culprit was the amount of beet spread that just overwhelmed what should have been a light dish. I just couldn't get into it.  I will say the service was super friendly considering me and my coworkers parked it there for hours. I know that's not the most ideal situation for a server, so kudos to her for refilling our waters and being patient with us. I would absolutely give this place another shot, as I really feel like maybe this is one of the misses on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the waitress was bothered that we had questions since it was our first time, I will give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she was just having a bad day. Both the food and coffee made up for it! Very small menu but we came for the famous fried chicken and did not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"In a search of good food we read reviews and came here. Not sure if we came here on the wrong day or time but our experience here wasn't all that great.   Food:  We ordered fried chicken. It was ok. hUGEst chicken I've ever encountered which mean huge portion which was great.  It was very salty.  My husband said the white meat was juicy but the dark meats (drums and wing) were very very dry.  The hush puppies were mediocre but the butter was out of this world.  Pickles were good condiment to cut the richness. All other apps were very mediocre.   Service:   This part was the part I wasn't too happy with.  It was a mission to get a servers attention to save my life.  Some walking by staffs met eye contact yet looked away.  It was just really unacceptable.  Not coming back nor would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"So we finally ate atHaberdish. And I hate to admit it but the food was not that good. Yes the Ambiance is great and the service is remarkable but the food is barely mediocre.   I had the chicken and waffles with the honey maple some kind of syrup that was a little spicy but definitely not good. For the chicken and waffles I should have stuck with the traditional syrup. Chicken tenderloins were tasty but the breading again just wasn't that good.  For dessert we split a space banana pudding which was good but it was more like a banana pudding mousse I'm a traditionalist when it comes to banana pudding.  After all of the hype I was expecting it to be much better. I doubt we'll return here."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant, awesome dishes, and even better cocktails it is always a fun time when I come here. Only negative thing I have to say is I wish they offered more veggie friendly options."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to visit with some friends over in the area last week and we made the decision to try Haberdish out, and man wasni happy with our decision. Our service was great and the smoked chicken?! To die for, absolutely delicious. The staff was quietly attentive and our server, very easy to talk to and communicated to us very well what to expect with each if our dishes and sidea. Well be back for sure"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, the deviled eggs were amazing and the mac n cheese is delicious! I also love the look of the place it's got a great vibe and nice decorations."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and tried a few things on the menu. The restaurant is pretty. The staff are helpful and friendly. Would I go again? Maybe. The food was just OK."}
{"text":"Y'all.   I don't even say y'all and this place will make you want to say it.   The vibe is classy southern dishes in a trendy cocktail lounge. I love it. It's located right in the heart of NoDa which is perfect for walking to anything else before or after. They have a big patio space, and the inside is light an airy. Very inviting.   The drink menu is extensive and intricate with beer, wine and signature cocktails. The drinks are fantastic--the bloody mary is amazing (I know how silly that sounds, but trust me)!  THE FOOD. I don't even know where to start. The hush puppies with honey butter are a must. Please order these. The dill house pickles...if you're a fan of pickles, they do a daily preparation as well as the dill and bread and butter, they are fantastic. The mac n' cheese and fried chickens are delicious. You can order the sides in small or large orders--the large is LARGE, it's great if you want to order a few and serve it up family style."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Charlotte. Go now. You won't regret it! I love all of the food they have to offer, and the environment is fabulous and leads to fun conversation with superb food and drink."}
{"text":"Lots of hype here for Haberdish, which wasn't a huge surprise because it's in Noda and everyone Plaza and Noda adds a .5-1 stars because these are 'cool/hip' spots. We went here for dinner on a Saturday and used the NoWait app....Good news we were 78th in line! (With this kind of wait, this place must be giving away free biscuits) A mere 3.5 hrs later we made it to a table.  Unfortunately no free biscuits...but we soldiered on.  The place was jam packed but had a pretty cool look and feel.  I would probably enjoy the bar area on a lower key night and grab some apps and drinks.    We ordered some apps and eventually some friend chicken.  The food was fine/good.  The theme with this place is 'fried'.  Everything is heavy and you will feel it.  (Side note: In general people rave about fried chicken, but no matter how 'great' it is, it still a max 5/10 good in terms of food).  As long as you are good with fried and heavy food, then you will be a fan of Haberdish."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Chicken fingers are best value in Charlotte. Sides are all amazing. Mac and cheese, potato dumplings, slaw are all delicous. Service is great and the food is always consistent. Always bring guests from out if town here and they love it"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try this place out, but I think when my friends and I had dinner here we did not get a very nice waitress so our experience was not the greatest. I will definitely come back and try it out again as the food was good, but our service was horrible. We weren't informed how the dishes would come out or how big they would be; and for a table of 4 we ordered way too much food. We all got different cocktails and they were amazing. For food, we ordered: the house pickles to try out, two orders of the cauliflower steak (loved it, but definitely too much for us), fried chicken white (which was great), tenders (waitress did not help us figure out how many would be good for one person, so he ended up getting a few), small tots, large dumplings-so many came in this size and they were so filling we could only eat a few of them, an order of the kale grits-different texture, they were pretty tasty, definitely worth trying out, large mac & cheese, and large okra. Food was okay, but I was expecting a little more. I will definitely give them another try since our first experience was so bad and the amount of food will have to be adjusted! Great location and love the vibe and atmosphere, I'm sure the patio will be great once it warms up more."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Haberdish after all the reviews and raves I've heard about it. But I didn't.  The building itself was fantastic! Lots of brick, light, and a really open feeling. I would be happy to go there over and over if it were a coffee shop or someplace really cool to hang out with friends and enjoy yourself.  The people were nice and attentive. The server was quick and polite and happy.  The food was not as good as either the building or the staff. Very pretentious for chicken parts and mac and cheese doused in bbq sauce and fried chicken skin.  And if it were possible (which it was that day) the people are even more pretentious than the food. Starting with the 3 guys sitting next to us eating chicken waffles and sipping champagne at 2 o'clock on a Monday. (Not to mention the not 1, not 2, but 3 sets of glasses in the shirt pocket of the guy facing me).  We won't be back but I'm sure people will continue to pour into Haberdish and be very satisfied.  We weren't."}
{"text":"As I am from the Midwest, I wanted a true southern dish and MAN this was the place to go! It is the CUTEST place in Noda (a cute little strip of bars, shops, restaurants and breweries in Charlotte).   The moment you walked in, you were greeted with a smile and we sat down at the bar. They had creative and delicious different drinks (a bit spendy I must say). But the food was even better! I split a side of macaroni and cheese with fried chicken skin (this could easily be a meal). Tip - you HAVE to get the fried chicken skin, great taste and crunch! Then we ordered a fried chicken sandwich drizzled with homemade honey mustard and sandwiched between a homemade biscuit. I am already started to drool as I remember how amazing it was. You will be extremely full after, but it will be so worth it!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Wow, wow!  Had a great experience tonight. The food was spectacular!  Items had:  Kale grits - perfectly creamy but not overwhelming. It was surprisingly light for a creamy grits.   Charred okra with bacon jam - to die for! I could have had this dish all to myself. Next time I most definitely will.  Smoked deviled eggs - more please!  Subtle but statement making smoke flavors surrounded the egg whites, filled with velvety smooth yolk deliciousness.  Washed it down with a cocktail called Bésame! Items I didn't have but Hubby had were: the fried chicken which he said is quite possible the best he's had. He also ordered the Mac n cheese with the crispy chicken skin and enjoyed it plenty.  But his favorite item of the night goes to (drumroll) the hush puppies with sweet tea butter. He washed his meal down with a mint julep which I did taste and it was delish.  That charred okra will haunt my dreams until we meet again. Until then...."}
{"text":"The best chicken tenders I've ever had,  yummy. The biscuits are so rich and moist, also yummy. The mac n cheese very good, but I know it would have been much better with the chicken on top. My husband had the kale and grits and that was also excellent. The atmosphere is the best."}
{"text":"I have been to Haberdish so many times since it opened! It is one of our favorite places to take out- of-town guests, so of course I brought my mom on Mother's Day. When we walked in I quickly realized that there was no A/C. I had requested inside because it was close to 90 degrees outside. We had drinks at the bar and the service was great! We were seated in the back part of the restaurant. There was absolutely no breeze or fan. It was very warm. When we ordered, we found that they were out of okra, ribs, and a few other things. Our food was good, but the temperature made the experience difficult to enjoy. We ate quickly, so we could get outside for some get relief. There was no mention that the A/C broken, so I don't know what the issue was. It was a bummer for sure!"}
{"text":"Cool feel in a cool area. Haberdish is dead smack in the heart of noda area. I took my granny here for brunch. To my surprise the menu didn't consist of very many brunch items at all. I ordered the waffle and chicken. I was expecting actual chicken not chicken tender style chicken but they were actually very good. For my 98 year old grandmother I ordered her the grits and chicken, shocked when they brought them out because my god the grits were green , come to find out they were kale grits. I was not expecting that and my granny is super picky about her food and doesn't like change at all. So me being me trying to disguise the fact that they are green I'm trying to distract her while she's eating them so she will not have a cow about them being green. Well the distraction only lasted but so long , she actually liked them so hey what do u know maybe she is starting to like change. Yaye for granny. To top things off my pretty super girly drink with a rose ice cube in it was very refreshing to bad I can't quite remember the name of it."}
{"text":"We stopped into Haberdish on July 30th for dinner.  It was pretty inside and it's obvious that someone went to great lengths to achieve a modern southern vibe.  My husband loved his food and mine was okay too.  My husband had the dark chicken and it was slightly overcooked.  I had the chicken tenders, which were also overcooked, but the breading was great.  The sides (mac 'n cheese, grits and okra) were good.  We chose to sit outside on the covered patio and I wish that we hadn't because there was a cloud of flies that we were swatting away our entire time there.  I would have enjoyed myself much more if we weren't constantly battling swatting flies off of our food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere and food! Really great breakfast and dinner option! Would suggest people to visit at anytime"}
{"text":"Seriously the best chicken i have ever had! I wish I didn't live so far! I would eat here all the time. I love the hipster atmosphere and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Such a warm inviting atmosphere with great food! Try the kale grits, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING ... WAS ... AMAZING!!! I'd heard positive things about this place and wanted to check it out for myself. So I asked a colleague  to meet me there to cap off a stressful work week. The drink menu was very interesting. If you enjoy craft cocktails then you will enjoy the offerings. It was not easy to decide; however I ended up ordering The Apothecary Cocktail and it was worth it -  a bit pricey but definitely worth it!  As my meal I ordered a variety of sides (carrots, corn pudding, deviled eggs, pimento cheese)... EVERYTHING ... WAS... AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I've managed to visit here twice in the past few weeks and enjoyed both visits very much. They have some excellent and unique bar drinks. I've had the Mint Julep which is very good. They also have several local craft beers. The speciality here appears to be Fried Chicken which is outstanding. My wife also got a cauliflower streak, which was amazing. Don't be fooled here though, there isn't any meat, its all cauliflower. And, they have Okra as a side item, which you should not miss. Friendly staff, good food, good drink. An excellent all around experience for just the 2 of you, or a larger group and even bring the kids along."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Everything from the appetizers to the main course to the craft made cocktails! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Haberdish came highly recommended, but I found the brunch to be just good. I got the special, a rhubarb waffle with their signature honey butter. The rhubarb's consistency left much to be desired, but the actual waffle was very good. I was a bit put off by the honey butter, as they add hot sauce to it, which isn't for me. I've heard the lunch and dinner menu is very good, so I'd be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"After a great lunch at Crepe Cellar we decided to try their new place Haberdish for a few cocktails!! So glad we did, had a lovely table on the patio and a great server Cat, who let us go at our own pace, which is always nice. We love to dine outdoors so this will be a new place to frequent for sure. Can't wait to return to try more of what is offered on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service & always such a great atmosphere. Love their drink menu & their Mac & Cheese! This place is so stunning on warm summer nights!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, Kid Friendly, unique soulful appetizers.  Deviled eggs are seasoned to perfection, hush puppies with the flavored butter is a must try.  The fried chicken and pork shank are to die for. This is my husband and my second visit to Haberdish and the food was just as good as the first visit."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday brunch on Sunday. The décor is very hip with a southern twist on modern industrial and I really loved the ambiance of the place. Ordered a few drinks to start with - didn't like the yellow bloody mary or the pedialyte cocktail. The flavors were off in both. For the meal, I enjoyed the fried chicken. It was moist and the skin crispy - all around good flavor. The sides were pretty good too (mac n cheese, charred okra w/bacon jam on the side). I did get a side salad that came with a strawberry vinaigrette that was kinda yuck but the salad was very fresh. Overall, nothing wowed me so I wouldn't pick this spot to come back to on my own but I wouldn't be disappointed if I was invited here again either."}
{"text":"Omg I want my last meal to be fried chicken here.  It's insanely good.  I tried some fried chicken mac & cheese and okra and that was also very good.  It's in Noda so make sure you call ahead of time for reservations."}
{"text":"Wow.  Enough said.  Is there a better restaurant in Charlotte?  We will have to be proven differently moving forward if there is.    The atmosphere here is excellent and the entire staff is as friendly as they come.  The time they take to explain the menu is great and their recommendations were spot on.   Start with the hushpuppies.  They are excellent and the butter with them make them to die for.  The fried chicken is excellent and so are the chicken tenders.  The breading makes them so delicious.  When it comes to picking sides I legit think they all are excellent.  We tried four, however our favorites were the sweet potatoes dumplings and Mac and cheese.  The cost is not bad for all his great food.  Go there and enjoy yourself because a food coma is coming soon"}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to appropriately fit in NoDa. The inside makes me think of California or the Northwest. Great vibe and friendly staff make the experience that much better. We started with the drinks Honeybee and the Mint Julep which were both really good. The Honeybee is a bit pricey and doesn't actually come with a piece of the flower that gives it the special tingle but it was still a good one-time experience.   We ordered an app of hush puppies, a whole fried chicken, sides of mac and cheese, and savory corn bread pudding. Everything was excellent. The fried chicken was some of the best in town. If I was to critique any of the food I could only say the mac and cheese was really good but nothing fantastic and the corn bread pudding was great but I would have preferred it to be a little more juicy or have a drizzle of some melted cheese or sauce. Grilling the corn bread pudding on the flat top dries it out and with no sauce it looses its \"bread pudding\" title.   Regardless of the little details, I loved the trip and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok food. Overpriced. Nice try though. Gentrified \"soul food\" It's a cool area to be in"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  service is good.  The cocktails (given the price) are good but not great.  Stick with the house mint julep.  I like the smoked chicken even more than the fried."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot for southern cooking. Their tenders, Mac and cheese, and banana bread pudding are absolutely delicious and consistent every single time I've eaten there! It's my go-to restaurant !"}
{"text":"Another bookmark checked off the list last weekend.  We had some errands to do in and around NoDa so seemed like the right time for Saturday brunch at Haberdish and it wound up being a good decision.  There wasn't a chance that I was not going to try the fried chicken so my wife and I split half a bird with her wing/breast Yin matching up with my leg/thigh Yang perfectly.  We also got a waffle which was served with both regular and slightly spicy maple syrup and a small shaker of their house made habenero hot sauce which is delicious with good flavor teamed with the heat.  It all came out hot and steamy with crunchy, perfectly juicy chicken and a fresh waffle.  It's not breaking news that chicken and waffles are a thing and Haberdish pulled off the iconic dish well.  We had a couple cocktails including my first ever blonde bloody Mary made with the mix made from yellow tomatoes.  Apparently they're known for a good and inventive cocktail program and I was happy with my choice.  Service was good and the entire meal set the stage for an easy  decision to get back there soon."}
{"text":"Kat and Amelia made certain this GF human had a FAB meal. Amazing. The entire experience amazing."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw a picture of the Mac and cheese, I knew I would be a patron at this restaurant. A few weeks ago I made the foolish last minute decision to go to the taco place across the street (which must have been having an off night) instead of Haberdish. I didn't make that mistake a second time.  My date and I were seated immediately, near the lovely barn doors. No one was seated out there when we went, but it looks like a great place to enjoy a meal. The cocktail list was unlike anything I see regularly. I had the Love Potion #10 after much pondering, and it tasted just as amazing as the description suggested.  First up was the fluffy hush puppies. This is unlike what you would eat at a fish camp, tough on the outside and inside. Certainly the best I've ever had, and the sweet tea butter (sounded frightful to me but I gave it a chance) was the icing on top, so to speak. My friend didn't want any initially, and after I harassed her to try one, she agreed that they were smashing, and we finished them all.  She ordered the chicken and waffles, I went with the Mac and cheese with skin- large portion. I will say that at other places, I've chosen to get the smaller size, only to be presented by an amount that could fit into a cup- so I told myself I'd just go large from here on out. Well.....this time, I should've sized down. The Mac and cheese was incredibly rich- and I'm no slouch when it come to m&c. I eat it regularly, no waiting for Thanksgiving over here! I couldn't even eat half of it at the table. No worries, I had some for a late snack and then for lunch the next day. So none of it went to waste.  I'm one of those weirdos that only eat chicken when  it's in wing form, so the fried chicken wasn't something I wanted for myself. My friend had me try hers, and it was extremely tasteful and moist.   Miles beyond some of the other establishments around town which seem to have an aversion to well seasoned chicken. Maybe some people think all the taste will come from the oil it's fried in, but what do I know? I'm just here to eat!  The waffle was pretty dry and not to her liking. She would've soldiered along and ate it all, but the syrup was not something either of us wanted to partake in. I'm not sure what the flavor was, it reminded me of prune juice, I guess our palettes weren't appreciative of the creativity behind the choice. All in all, we were pleased and I will be thrilled to return.  It's a great date place also, the environment is great, whether for drinks or eats."}
