{"text":"Truly the best Persian grill in North America, I've been to every Persian kabob grill place in California and Canada, This place is at another level. You'll get quality food"}
{"text":"Just had my first food at Pars Grill and loved it. Great quality, Nice staff and awesome service. Their Koobideh tastes great and one portion is big enough can serve two people easily."}
{"text":"Best Persian meal I have had.   It was busy when I walked in to do a takeout order and the staff still made time to give me a takeout menu, which I appreciated.   

While I waited for my food order, i observed to see what others ate.  The portions were massive and very neatly plated.  It was definitely a feast for the eyes!  The grilled chicken on skewer seemed popular.   

To my surprise, when my takeout order (koobideh dinner) was ready, it was placed neatly in a full aluminum tray as if I was eating-in!!  It tasted amazing too.

Will definitely come back.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Tried coming here during business hours.  Open sign was on but the lights were off and the door was locked."}
{"text":"I came here with family 
My spouse had koobideh plate I had s shish kabob sandwich and the kids had chicken sandwiches 
If you want the real Parsi grill - that is the place 
Portions are nice, plate come with rice and salad, sandwiches are 12\" sub size and above all - 
It's darn good !!!

Will make this a regular spot for lunch - awesome"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Rice is fragrant and fluffy. Chicken is nicely charred but moist. I had the vaziri which was delish! Highly rexommended"}
{"text":"We have never are \"at\" the restaurant but have had plenty of take-outs.
The food is ABSOLUTELY DELISCIOUS. It is authentic Persian cousine with outstanding taste. Try the Vaziri Kabob. It melts in your mouth and your left over will still taste fresh the next day."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great portion size.  Courteous service!  One of the best Persian food I had for a very long time!  Location is a bit small but can always order takeout.  Try the dish called VAZIRI (BBQ beef and chicken).  It is so good!!!!  Price is a bit on the higher end but it's so worth it!!  Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Great food everything is amazing!! Went twice. The hamburgers are great too! I would recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Best kabab in GTA for sure!  Excellent service and huge portions to match!  The barley soup is outstanding...  I can't get enough... Go!  Eat!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've come here and I have to say the cook has the memory of a goldfish. I called ahead and told them to please not put any bread with the rice/kebob dinner. I told the lady to plz tell the cook this, as we have a gluten allergy. I also told her that last time I was there, I mentioned this and they still put the bread which after taking the food home to Woodbridge, my wife couldn't eat it. The lady said I apologize but rest assure that this time I will personally make sure they don't put bread. 
Just came in now to pickup my food and surely -guess what?, bread again! She said sorry and called the cook who came and told me that he'll just remove the bread. I told him that wouldn't work as the bread has now been sitting under the meat and has come in contact with it. Soggy and stuck to the meat- They said they'll make it again and I say ok- but I'm not happy with 1) second time this has happened and 2) I called 2 hours earlier to have this ready and now I have to wait another half hour while hungry guest and kids wait at home. 
Inexcusable. Not coming back because there are so many other places that will actually listen to the customers requests. The only reason I came here is because it's the only Persian restaurant in Vaughan. Didn't feel like driving to Richmond hill. 
We need more Persian restaurants on the west end!"}
{"text":"Always amazing. Seems like a small family owned restaurant who know how to do it right...rare nowadays. The take out is huge and excellent quality. Price is right. Restaurant is very generous and is top quality. They use a charcoal grill and is a must-have whenever i am in the area. Surprised at the lack of reviews. This is my top 3 Persian restaurants. We always get the koobideh dinner. By far one of the best quality and you will always be left with leftovers . :)"}
{"text":"Good food quality, but the place is too small. More suitable for delivery and to go food.
The washroom is not clean. Tables and chairs are too old.

Again, food is great. This place should be catering mostly."}
{"text":"This little eatery is near my house and I gave it a try.  I don't know much about Iranian food but i do like central asian shashlik.  The Barg is by far my favourtite.   The beef was tender and well marinated, and most importantly full of beefy flavour, with a touch of the charcoal notes present.  The rice as others have noted was fluffy and flavourful, I guess the oil helps bigtime there.  Price though was a bit higher than what I think it would warrant, but not knowing how it ranks with similar fare, I thought it tasted very good nonetheless and the portions were quite large.  The inside doesn't look very inviting, but i usually just get take out."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Persian restaurants and this one I found to be quite average. 

For one, the chef uses far too much oil in the food and does not use gloves when he handles the meat which personally grossed me out. His hands were yellow from the turmeric.

Secondly, the prices are way too high for Persian food compared to other restaurants that are similar to Pars, such as Kish. I have also been to high-end Persian restaurants with similar pricing and this place is not high-end and more of a fast-food joint. We just had catering done from them last night and the food was very average. 

Additionally, they're understaffed. Wait times can vary at times from being very quick or lengthy. 

Lastly, parking can be an issue as well due to the restaurant being in the same location as a medical centre.

Bottom line, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I heard this restaurant from CBC news and went for pick up. We didn't regret and it is good."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner over the phone after a steller recommendation from a friend about the rice. She wasn't wrong. The rice, and everything else, was delicious.

4 stars because the place could really use an update to the decor."}
{"text":"By far the best Persian food in the GTA! Very welcoming staff. Complementary tea usually follows your delicious meal. I prefer quality over quantity but this restaurant nails both."}
{"text":"Pars is consistent and delicious every time.  The Vaziri kabob is great and cooked just right - definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I love Persian food! Its healthy and delicious! 

I always call at least 10 minutes in advance and my food is hot and ready when I get there. I usually order the \"Soltani\" (which includes a koobideh kabob, a very large piece of steak cut into small pieces on a bed of fluffy basmati rice, grilled tomato and a salad on the side. All for only $22.  It feeds 2 people easily. 

Best Persian food in Vaughan. Owners are very friendly, always say hello. They know me by now. 

Enjoy!

{"text":"The best kubideh Kabob in the city. I've tried probably most Persian restaurants in Toronto in the past so many years and this is by far the best."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place !
The best service, food, and selection.
It's quality grade truly ."}
{"text":"Pars grill was not my prototypical Iranian food experience. The prices here are a little higher but the quality and portions more than make up the difference. I found the chicken was far more flavorful than any other joojeh I've had, melt in you mouth koobideh, and super fluffy rice. Also sampled the grilled tongue sandwich, which is definitely a requisite here! Contender for my go-to Persian place."}
{"text":"Went in today at noon, and had the Koobideh sandwich for take-out.  The meat was very juicy and flavourful!  I will be back here to try out more items on the menu!"}
