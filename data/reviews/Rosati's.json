{"text":"Called in an order for delivery to my home, 2 miles from the shop.  Medium, 3-ingedient pizza and a small greek salad...$33 and change!  Add to that the five bucks I would give the delivery guy and I'm into it for just shy of $40.  Their pizza is o.k., but not even close to the quality that would command that price.  I know, delivery charge, taxes, blah blah blah...it's just a bottom line issue...waaay too much for an average pizza.  Sorry Rosati's, but we're done."}
{"text":"Eh.. it was okay.  I had the spaghetti with meatballs.  Sauce was good, and the garlic bread was good, but the meatballs tasted like Costco frozen meatballs.  Definitely not homemade.

We also got an order of garlic knots.  That's what knocked my rating down two stars.  The dough was fried, not baked.  They were greasy and gross.  Tasted like a garlic donut."}
{"text":"I like their pizza especially the Chicago style.  The staff has always been polite and helpful when we have gone there.  I like their iced tea at the drink station and that they have Stevia to add to it.  We have been going there and will continue to go there.  Good job!"}
{"text":"This corner has more then enough accidents without putting an obnoxious man there to distract oncoming traffic. I had to write this because, today he almost got in to a fist fight with a passerby for his behavior.  Your food should speak for itself and having this type of advertising should not be necessary."}
{"text":"I live a hop skip jump away..was in the mood for pizza n salad..just plain chz pizza was so good!! Salad gota have once a week..n they have a bar with gaming..Great bartenders!! Stop by when u have a chance:-)"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite pizza in Las Vegas.  The ONLY thing I don't like about Rosati's is that it takes away some of the enjoyment of grabbing pizza while in Chicago now that I've got great Chicago style pizza here at home!  

Great staff.  Great service.  You should be ashamed of yourself if you're wasting your time buying pizza at chain restaurants with a gem like this available!"}
{"text":"Do Not Buy The Deep Dish Pizza. They RIP you off by giving you 2 inches of puff bread and a smear of toppings which you have to pay for extra cheese or its invisible.. really sad."}
{"text":"Yelped Italian restaurants in the area that we were in this past Saturday and came across the jewel !!!! Everything about this pizza place is excellent. The manager was very helpful and nice. The cleanliness of the place was beyond average. We ordered a lil of everything. Pasta, salad, chicken wings and deep dish Chicago pizza which was soo delicious! Will definitely go back next time we are in Vegas !!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a regular pepperoni pizza and it came with thin crust.  We're not normally fans of thin crust pizza and although Rosatti's offers deep dish and thicker crusted pizza, we didn't specify so we ended up with their standard crust (thin).  That being said, the thin crust pizza was unique and quite good.  It was a round pizza cut into little 2-3\" squares, which turned out great for serving our little ones.  Also, the sauce was a very tasty marinara sauce with a bit of kick to it.  If you have picky kids, they may not like the spice in it, but we loved it.  I'll have to try a deeper dish pizza to give it 5 stars, but their thin crust was better than we anticipated."}
{"text":"We liked Rosati's food and would order from them very frequently.  Many of the orders we received from them, something would be missing from our PAID order.  We would call them and they would say we can bring it back out, now you have your partial order, we waited an hour or longer and you're freakin hungry.  We just wanted to eat our meals. All not partial. So they would say \" we owe you this. Or that next time\" well, they never remember and you never get it.  They just can't get it right at this location,  ok things happen but why so often? Tonight we ordered 2 sandwiches, how hard could this be? Well again they only brought one! First of all they won't even deliver unless it's a $20.00, no one there checks their work, how could one sandwich be 20 bones?  The driver should have known and checked the out going orders, and the cashier who staples the receipt to the bag should get new glasses.

Beware of this location!  If you want to eat alone or wait and have your food get cold to eat with everyone else then order .  They are over priced especially when you only receive 1/2 of your order.  I should probably just get all my back orders they have forgotten and eat free for the rest of 2014.  Won't go back and advise all of you not to either.  Yes, we are all human, we make mistakes, but where is the quality control! Come on, wake up and do your job people.  The name of the game is customer service, when so many choices are available."}
{"text":"born and raised in the chicago burbs, we always ate rosatis and lou malnatis. I love lous for deep.dish and rosatis for thin crust. the burb cut is squares, so all you folks, its east to eat and u think u are eatin more! I recommend a thin crust garbage pizza well done. I like it with giardinare on the side. its a hot pepper relish mix. I love you rosatis, I will be there in 2 days and ordering the love! ps amazing portions.of mozzarella and toppings, the room will.be silent....it is soooo goood!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved into area and decided to give them a try, I have ordered for delivery only, never a problem. They are always nice on the phone, even know call me by my name. The meatball pizza was yums, my 7 yr old lves the fingers and cheese pizza. My hubby loves the Cheef sandwich on garlic bread! Tons of meat, very tasty!"}
{"text":"After a week of traveling eating dry Sammie's and whatever else I could make from the passenger car seat we made it home and decided to have a really hearty meal. I called in an order for delivery and less than 45 minutes later we were siting at the table,  staring in awe at these beautiful enormous pizzas.

 We ordered a Chicago style pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, green and black olives, onions and green peppers. It was ahhhhmazing! The tomatoes were ripe and tangy. The green olives added the perfect twang. The sausage tasted fresh and juicy. Seriously the perfect slice of pie! Did I mention it was absolutely beautiful? It was!!

The kiddos wanted a pepperoni on double dough. It was cheesy, not too greasy, and the crust held up well even with the littles. The crust has a buttery cracker flavor that is so delicious. 

And because we were starving we added a spicy Italian calzone. The meat was tender and juicy with an excellent spicy flavor. When I tasted the giardiniera I was so impressed. It was tangy with the perfect vinegar and spice. I think I could eat it alone! I not so stealthily tried to swipe a chunk of cauliflower off my husbands plate. He was too quick and his fork promptly blocked mine. I actually started looking up recipes to try to replicate the giardiniera. yUMMY!
I think I'll add it to my next pizza too! 

We will certainly order pizza here again. Seriously wonderful, filling, and tasty pies!!!"}
{"text":"Recently had their Chicago style pizza due to a recommendation. What a good choice! My wife had the cheese ravioli, and reports a good review as well. If nothing else, got yourself a huge Chicago style pizza. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"As an out of town visitor I wanted a good thick crust Chicago style pizza. This restaurant met my every expectation! It was ready inside of 5 minutes when I arrived for pickup! I ordered sausage and pepperoni Thick crust! The cheese was good quality cheese! The sausage was phenomenal! Pepperoni was also excellent! The marinara was perfection! I will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas! And that's in a week and a half! I found a new Pizza place! And my niece and nephew who live in Vegas, were hooked also! The personnel were polite and fast! I just love this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from Rosati's Pizza on Silverado Ranch the pizza arrived cold and poor quality we called the management and they said they would replace the pizza on our next order. we just calIed to order pizza and they refused to honor thier word. I paid $30 for a bad pizza! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Update. Yo, kinda f this place. Totally ruined our Super Bowl party the other weekend. The crew had some coupons, called the day before to see if it was ok to use them on Super Bowl Sunday... because ya know, we're not dycks like that. Employee said yes, just have to do separate orders. No big deal, it was just three pizzas. Well, SB51 rolls around and the owner says we're \"pulling one over\" and proceeds to cancel our orders, and told us to \"take our business elsewhere\" and put us on a no sell list. Pretty douchetastic when you listen to the conversation that was recorded. It really sucks because I love the Italian beef and their ranch is bomb, son! Principals and solidarity won't let me patronize this business. No stuff, Costco pizza is better anyway. -1"}
{"text":"I have eaten here atleast a dozen times.  The pizza is consistently great and the wings are the best.  Using coupons makes the meal very affordable."}
{"text":"Love love love the pizza. Pepperoni, black olive, bacon, ham, extra cheese soooo good!  But sadly... way expensive!"}
{"text":"We ordered online said it would take 30 mins for pick up. We left 30 mins later. When we got there the food took another 30 mins to be ready. We ordered godfather pizza which has olives and jalapenos not mentioned in description.  We ordered double dough and got cracker tasting crust. Ordered half hot  Half mild wings.   Got all mild with no side of hot.  I called and requested they refund for service and wrong order on the wings.  Offered to remake the wings or 20 percent off next order.  We spent $45 in this service and food. SUNSET PIZZA WAY BETTER."}
{"text":"I see a lot of good reviews for the pizza here, which we have never tried. This review is for the sandwiches on their menu. First, it took 30 minutes for them to make two sandwiches; an Italian beef called the Cheef, and an Italian cold sub. The Cheef was soggy and did not taste good. It was also not very warm. The au jus served with it was like a pepper gravy, nothing like au jus. The Italian combo was barely mediocre. The meat was not fresh tasting, nor was the lettuce or tomato. The bread on both items was hard. Overall, we were not happy with the food quality. I should mention that we went to this same location a few years ago, and had a very similar experience. We decided to give it another shot last night, and we will not be back. The pizza may very well be great, we'll probably never know. They should focus on that and drop the sandwich category from their menu."}
{"text":"Zero stars based on the owner Ken! Myself and friends decided to order pizzas for the Super Bowl on Sunday. All of us have been regular cutomers on a weekly basis for years. Over the years we have collected the 50% off coupons that come on the pizza boxes (12 needed for one pizza). As a customer who worked in the service industry for over 15 years, I understand Super Bowl can be a very busy day. With this being known, I called the day before to make sure they were accepting coupons and they said \"yes!\" Again, knowing they were going to be busy, I called three hours in advance on Sunday to place my order. After a few of my neighbors placed similar orders using their 50% off coupons, the owner Ken told one of my neighbors that he didn't know what we were trying to pull but he didn't have time for half price pizzas and we could take our business elsewhere and hung up! Wow...so my neighbor called back and Ken said he was canceling all of our orders, that we were no longer welcome at Rosati's, to take our business elsewhere, and hung up again! As good repeat cutomers and trying to do the right thing with calling the day before as well as placing our order three hours in advance, this is how he treats his customers! With all this being said, I hope people take this into consideration when thinking about eating at Rosati's. I refuse to support a \"classless\" business owner who does not value his customers. I will gladly take my business elsewhere and hope everyone does as well!"}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish pizza online. I was quoted a 40 minute wait. Pizza was ready when I arrived. It was way bigger than I had expected! Had a good flavor and was reasonably priced too, with my $2 off coupon. I have so much left over that I'll be eating it for days!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER be eating at Rosati's on Durango/Grand Teton in Las Vegas.  My family and friends have spent literally thousands of dollars each per year at this place since it opened to have Ken the owner/manager completely disrespect us.  Rosati's has a 50% off coupon on their pizza boxes (which says nothing about not being able to use them on certain days or holidays) and when you collect 12 of them, you get a pizza for 50% off your next pizza.  Well 3 families in the neighborhood had 12 each and ordered pizza for the super bowl Let me remind you these were not free pizzas, they were 50% off! So we respectfully called a couple of days earlier to see if we could place this order and use the coupons we accumulated all year (which by the way every order was at least $50 x's the 36 coupons we had which that alone is $1,800.00) and was told there would be no problem.  So when we called to order Ken said \"I don't know what you are trying to pull but I don't have time to give pizzas away for half price\" and hung up! We called back to see what the problem was because one of the neighbors had already placed his order with another employee with no problem and he told us \"we were no longer welcome and to find another establishment\". So we will and I hope others do too.  He gave away an entire communities worth of business over 3 pizzas half off? The great part about this story is that one pizza which was \"approved\" to be delivered was (which was a $35.00 pizza) and we told the driver we were told by his boss we were no longer welcome and refused it. Our order between the 3 homes would have been around $40.00 and he had to throw away a $35.00 pizza? What an idiot. But \"he doesn't care\", he doesn't give one shit about your business. HORRIBLE customer service. There are many pizza places around Centennial Ken and none of us will EVER be back!"}
{"text":"The food was super good and the service was awesome.  We started with garlic cheese bread and cheese fries. Both were really good. The 12 inch rosatis pan pizza was massive. We ate 3 slices between the two of us and we were struggling at this point. The restaurant is nice with silverware and fountain drinks being in a do-it-yourself setup. Our server Ken was very friendly and consistently checked on us. Great experience."}
{"text":"Order a 18in combo and calzone. .... pizza is inedible. Regular crust is like a dried out cracker and pock marked with so many holes from docking the pizza skin it must have been ice cold when it went in the oven.  Toppings are marginal.  All in all refrence the pics posted and don't eat here.... I just threw away a 25$ pizza."}
{"text":"Service is always good, the food is about four stars. Sometimes its not consistent (sauce too watery, meatballs really small) but for the most part its yummy. Def Chicago style pizza!"}
{"text":"They have great pizza/wing specials and the food has always been good. Never once had any issues. Service and delivery is fast. Definitely should try out this place if you haven't yet!  They even cut the slices down into little squares for the kiddos"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice, the thin crust was terrific, the \"Chicago Style\" was weak.   

Overpriced for what you get.  Very unprofessional staff, neither time was the pizza ready for carryout at the time stated.  You get the feeling this is some sort of hobby and not a real business."}
{"text":"Good Chicago Deep Dish.  Tomatoes topping is delicious.  Crust is too doughy for my preferences, but still tasty.  I would have given 5 stars if crust was less bready  giving more room for the toppings, creating a real pie.  I look forward to trying their other types of pizza."}
{"text":"Good Chicago style, but needs more sauce. Thin crust is GREAT! That italian beef sandwich is to doe for. And my 10 yr. old son LOVED the huge bacon cheeseburger. A little higher priced, but worth it. Good stuff Rosatis!"}
{"text":"Their chicago style pizza is very good. fast delivery and friendly service."}
{"text":"Chicago style deep dish pizza  is the best. If your looking for cheap cookie cutter pizza, it's not here. But, if you think you like Chicago style deep dish, this is the place! We have found our home for pizza in Henderson."}
{"text":"They delivered the wrong pizza but said that the next time we order the pizza was on them.  their wings were good and the pizza was decent.  I would be willing to try them again."}
{"text":"I got a pizza with cold, stiff cheese and very few pepperoni's. Called to ask politely for a refund in exchange for the horrible pizza and got told by the manager, Mark, that he knows there's nothing wrong with it because he \"made it\". Next time I'll take my $30 to somewhere with good customer service and real pizza. Worst $30 pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday with my family everything was greatthe place was clean and staff was friendly and happy I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Rosattis chicken parmigiana is very good and the portion size is huge . I always have food delivered and my order is always early and accurate. The thin pizza is a little too crispy for my taste. The Rosattis salad is one of my favorites as well as the mild chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Tried placing an order online through their website earlier today for delivery. After an hour and a half, I called to check on the status of the order (the email confirmation said the order was to have taken an hour). The woman who answered the phone claimed to have no order under my name. I offered to give her the order confirmation number from the email that was and she said she was unable to use that number to help. She then offered to call someone else for help but hung up on me instead of putting me on hold. Very unprofessional company/location. I won't be calling them again."}
{"text":"No. Just no. Food is just bad and expensive. This place is safe from me from now on. Italian? Yeah right... The only good thing was the beer."}
{"text":"I am surprised it is only 3.5 stars.  I have had many, many people tell me they think Rosatis is the best in Vegas.  I agree.  I still have not found a truly great pizza in Las Vegas.  I have found several pretty good places.  I think Rosatis is very good.  Their thin crust and their deep dish are both very good.  Pizza is very subjective but for me Rosatis is the best I have found in Las Vegas.  I recommend eating it there because it is much better right out of the oven.  I have been to 4 Rosatis in town and the service here is better than the others.  The one on Cheyenne is also good.  It is definitely 4.5 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a nice bar with pretty good service... BUT, the pizza crust has a saltine cracker texture, very dry and flavorless!  (Unless you like saltine cracker crust). We ordered the double crust which had no flavor to it in our opinion, however the toppings are good and fairly plentiful.

We will not be going back for pizza, but to watch games and have drinks... yes!  Didn't try the other menu items, they may be great."}
{"text":"This place is great! The pizza is good and the chicken fingers are amazing. If you get the Chicago deep dish, which I recommend you do, one person is only able to eat about one slice so a large pizza will go a long way. We always get the zeppole too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Closest, I have come to PIZZA Since I moved here from Chicago! PERIOD!"}
{"text":"I called talk to the manager let me know that the driver was very rude hadn't looked at my pizza so I go in the box and I had ordered a pan pizza I paid $35 for it and when I open it I have to stop this in the box the other half is still on the pizza but it was also the door was wet and when I talk to you call back a customer in about it he had an attitude about it so I will never go there again I hope nobody else go"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food always on point, the employees are always friendly, and they always remember you when you come back. So glad they open the rainbow location, it's the only good pizza place by mountains edge."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that there are so many negative reviews.  This is the BEST PIZZA I have found  since moving here from the Chicago suburbs.  I pretty much stick to pepperoni/sausage or their classic combo which is a garbage pizza.  It's true that they are skimpy on the sauce so I simply order it with extra sauce and it comes out perfecto!  Yes, they are more expensive then pappa johns and pizza hut cause those pizza's suck a$$.   Plus, they always have coupons attached to the box so I always get $3 off.  I've even lied and said I have a coupon and they take it off and don't ask for it when I pick up the pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza all the way around! Would highly recommend the Chicago style deep dish! Thin crust is good as well and they have excellent wings!"}
{"text":"For a long time they have been my FAVORITE Italian delivery joint. But as of late, if you order MEAT SAUCE on your pasta, DRY SAUCE LESS NOODLES! BURNT MEATBALLS, and the normally AMAZING baked lasagna, has burnt edges and a soggy, goopy center. The fettuccine Alfredo, ALL CREAM, NO FLAVOR ANYMORE! THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO :-( :-( :-( 
Maybe there's a new chef in training at this location?
I'm not ready to give up on them yet, I am a regular customer and have loved them for years! But DAMN WTF is going on in that kitchen!?!? 
So, if it's GREAT ITALIAN you're looking for, it's usually Rosattis, but I'd try something else for now. Rosattis is too inconsistent"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  The staff already knows me and what I want.  Think crust pepperoni with pineapple if u haven't tried it you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big Pizza lover so I had my 19 year old son choose what to order. We got the Godfather pizza. The pizza was AMAZING!!! Such a great blend of flavors that smelled and tasted fantastic!!! We also got the BBQ wings and spicy wings. They were delicious!!! The restaurant is very pretty. ..much more than I'd  expect from a \"Pizza place\". It was also immaculately clean which is very important to me. The service was great! The lady at the bar and the server were super sweet and attentive. I would definitely recommend the Rosati's on Rainbow and Windmill. This place has made me realize I AM a pizza lover!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good sometimes and bad the next! I ordered a large thin crust it was the fabulous four with no bell pepper and also ordered chicken fingers medium so I get everything 43.00 later everything is cold the pizza hardly has any toppings and the fingers are so hot nobody could eat them! We were sick afterwords  I am never going back!"}
{"text":"We moved to Henderson six years ago and have ordered from Rosati's a lot.  We ordered last night (12/29/15) and were told twenty minutes.  We arrived there twenty minutes later, paid for our order and were told it would be eight minutes more.  So we were sitting there for twenty-three minutes more when I asked the young man if they had maybe forgotten our order.  He went to the back and a couple minutes later brought our pizza out.  I mentioned that it was very slow service (45 minutes) and he used the excuse that they were really busy.  We were there a total of 25 minutes and watched a total of four customers come in and get their orders.  FOUR people in 25 minutes.  That's how busy they were.  Also, the pizza was cold, so it was obviously sitting back there for a while.  Don't go there.  Go to Sunset Pizza or even little caesars or dominos or any place but rosati's.  We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Way better than the major pizza chains. The Chicago deep dish is amazing. If you order it you better love lots of cheese."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner. We have come here often because it is convenient, however, it seems as if the quality has diminished.  We think they switched the type of mozzerella that they use, maybe we are wrong, but the flavor of the cheese isn't as good. Also, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The mushrooms were canned. I appreciated that they put extra sauce on the pizza as I asked, however, we ordered Rosati's crust (a thicker crust although not Chicago style) they gave us thin crust. Which we took in stride because it is healthier, if there is such a thing with pizza, but not what we ordered. Also, took the server a long time to bring our initial drinks. Although, she was pleasant and did check on us several times. We would have appreciated clean plates between salad and pizza, however, she didn't offer to bring us out any clean plates so that was a negative.  So ultimately I would only return here since it is convenient however, if I have time or motivation I would gladly drive farther for a higher quality product.

I must say that ultimately I teetered between giving this restaurant a 2 or a 3 star but between the diminished quality and somewhat lacking service I opted for the two. If it was just the pizza I might place it at a three."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but don't expect more.  Normally, husband and I dine at S Rainbow location, but we were on this side of town and needed a quick bite.  Few hiccups such as rude lady at the front, incorrect order and manager (think name is Ken or Ben) not taking any accountability."}
{"text":"We have had their pizza delivery from here 3 times now.  Their Chicago style deep dish, is a winner at our house and have no complaints.  Unlike some of the reviews here, our pizza dough had been thoroughly cooked.  The only issue I tonight is that the gal the took my order over the phone - address me by my home address and hung up on me after I placed my order.   Customer service needs to be improved on."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. They have delivered to our home many times in the past. Thirty minutes after placing our delivery order tonight they called to say they could not deliver since we were \"out of the area.\"  We had hungry kids expecting pizza any minute!  They also said it would take a month and a half to refund the charge for the pizzas we did not receive!  Horrible customer service. If they couldn't deliver to us that would be one thing. But not alerting us and then keeping our money for over a month is what prompted me to leave this review. Sorry Rosati's, you've just lost a 4 year customer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza. They also have amazing salads and burgers. The most delicious around. They could use a bigger place, but still love delivery."}
{"text":"This was our second time & it was fabulous! The baked lasagna is delicious and one  of my favorites. Chicago style pizza was yummy and you get a lot of food at such great low prices. I would defiantly recommend this place :) the staff members are very nice and communicate on a professional proficient basis.
Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Finally open!  Tried the pizza the first time and it was great. 4 different crust options; thin, double dough, pan and Chicago style deep dish. Fantastic sauce with a nice bite and tasty fresh toppings. 

Tried the Beef Classico sandwich the second time. Thin sliced beef and that great red sauce. Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and value. We ordered for family size items party of about 20 guests, everyone loved it and we even had leftovers. Highly recommended for large groups or just an awesome Chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"Best chicago pizza in town. So far everything has been outstanding. Prices are reasonable and they send out coupons in the local value-pack. Highly recommended for anything you want on this menu."}
{"text":"Just ordered the lunch special meatball sandwich and mostaccioli. The food is overpriced for the quality! Okay I admit the meatball sandwich is decent but soggy, however the mostaccioli was a pretty pathetic..it was overcooked pasta with some sauce on it and they charge $.50 for cheese that they never put for $7.50. I can make my own poor excuse for pasta for less than half the price. When you order they try to up sell ur side for a salad for an extra $1.00 but they never tell u that getting cheese on your dish cost an extra $.50. Poor food quality!Never coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"First off I can get better pizza at many locations nearby. My next door neighbor got verbally abused by the owner of this crappy joint over an issue that never took place. Yet the owner was still very unprofessional and wouldn't have the balls to talk to her husband. Don't ever go in here."}
{"text":"Decent, nice area.  Food was good, I ordered a Calzone.  Food took a while to come out, everyone was nice."}
{"text":"ok the food wasn't have bad but the teenage staff were texting in the front and not payingmuch attention we had to wait a while for the bread we requested and they were a little careless dropping our first set of bread on the floor if you can ignore that though the food is not half bad  for the middle of town but it was worth it. I just wouldn't take a date there or anyone for a meeting just incase the girl in the front is too busy texting and forgets your order. make sure you not in a hurry or super hungry."}
{"text":"Only one here at first. 40min wait for one small pizza. Cashier coughs into hands and does not wash them after. Floor dirty. Had to wait 5 min to even be recognized. Cashier is now socializing with an older woman about \"personal\" issues. Very unprofessional. But the only reason they even got 2 stars is that their pizza is excellent. Just not the service."}
{"text":"Okay, so, I had passed by this place before and thought it seemed cool. Boy, was I in for a surprise. Absolutely everything about this place was amazing! The waiter was one of the best waiters I ever had and tipped him well, but that was only the tip of the iceberg! The pizza was absolutely delicious; now keep that in mind when I say that their buffalo wings were the absolute best wings I ever had in my life, completely DIVINE! And they completely made the pizza seem like nothing! I seriously have found my new favorite place!! 

P.S. their specialty lager was very smooth and good too, just had to let you beer enthusiasts know.

EDIT: 
In light of recent events, I had to make an update for everyone to know that this place has a happy hour between 4 and 6 for pizza that is 50% off, I had no idea and we luckily strolled in at 5! I took my girlfriend here for her to try it out and our waiter was even better than the last! He told us that if we collected 12 tabs from the sides of their pizza boxes, we could exchange them for a pizza that was 50% at any time. This place is a must go-to for amazing food that's easy on your wallet."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars because their thin crust pizza is actually delicious.

That being said, I am not likely to return. A few weeks back my husband and I stopped in to grab some food. We were 2 out of probably 10 people in the restaurant. No waitress of bartender to be seen anywhere. Waited for a good 15 minutes before I got up, went to the pizza pickup window and waiting another 5 minutes to even see anyone because they were all in the back and couldn't see me. Totally ridiculous considering there were 8 other people in the restaurant eating and drinking. Strike 1-

I call them to order delivery (as I'm only a few blocks away and have done this before) and they tell me it's weird my zip code says 8 miles away when my cross streets are right down the street. Instead of delivering anyway (as they can tell my cross streets are so close) they dismiss me since their gps is malfunctioning and tell me to come pick it up instead. Completely bizarre and what I consider awful customer service. Strike 2-

I hope this place can get it together as their food is pretty good, but just awful customer service that doesn't outweigh the food quality."}
{"text":"I have the best times when Dez and Ali work together. Prompt service with a smile and amazing food! I only come when they work together!!!"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and service are fantastic (did I mention how good the food was?). Don't miss out on this hidden gem of a local bar. Judd, Janeth, and Ali are awesome!!  Customer service at it's finest. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rosati's pizza is amazing!  Great food and great customer service!  I recently ordered Rosati's pizza for a group of 75 co-workers and everyone loved it. Mark really took great care of us.  The pizza was delicious, the salad was fresh, and the bread sticks tasted amazing.  Everything was delivered on time and the people that work at this location are super friendly, exactly what customer service is about! The JBES staff thanks you guys a ton!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town for sure!!!! Try their chicken Alfredo, BBQ chicken, or deep dish it all superb!!!  The owners are some of the best people around too. It's nice to support our local owner/operators."}
{"text":"Pizza's delicious and both ladies working the counter on the afternoon of July 24 were very pleasant. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for dinner, service was great, food was great, atmosphere was great- Id absolutely recommend this place to anyone. Cristina was our bartender/ server and was so sweet and so helpful. She seemed to know all the regulars in the joint and everyone seemed to love her. We'll be returning here for pizza in the near future!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I'm an ol' Chicago girl and I love pizza! Since leaving Chicago, I've had some great pie but none like \"home\". 

My hubby, boyfriend and I went to Rosati's in Lake Havasu City and I was transported back to Chicago. BUT this Rosati's deeply disappointed me! We got the Chicago crust and it was nothing like we got in Havasu. It's a take out place with the exception of two small tables outside. And don't even think about having a cold beer with your pie. 

Arggghhhh."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza is the best. Rosatis salad is excellent. There is a restaurant and bar side. Lots of tvs on the bar side."}
{"text":"COUPON USERS BEWARE...We went in for dinner tonight after receiving a coupon in the Valpak mailer earlier this week.  Coupon stated \"Happy Hour Special, 4pm-6pm Weekdays, 50% off Pizza, Dine-in only.\"  We ordered our food (x-large veggie and 2 very diluted iced teas & 1 lemonade) ate, then the server brings us our check w/out the discount.  I inquire about the happy hour pizza special and she says that it only applies for weekdays Mon-Thurs, so I break out w/ the Valpak mailer which states nothing of the Mon-Thurs and then she changes her response to, \"oh that was an old coupon that they are no longer honoring.\"  So I ask to speak w/ the manager or owner and she says they are not onsite today, but after repeating myself she changes her response and tells me the manager is in the back.  She comes back out and tells me the manager is busy at the oven and that she wouldn't be able to honor the happy hour special but would be able to give me $5 off.  At that point I'm beyond frustrated and demand to speak w/ the manager in person otherwise the police would be called.  I'm sorry I know this may be a little extreme but I refuse to let some fraudsters rip me off, no matter how insignificant the discount is, so I stood my ground.  The manager ends up coming out and then proceeds to blame Valpak advertising, stating she did not know why they were still printing the coupons since they were no longer honoring them.  I tell her that was not fair to their customers as that is false advertising and they could get sued & her exact words to me, \"I'll take my chances.\" She finally relents, begrudgingly and honors the 50% off happy hour special as advertised in the March 2016 Valpak mailers.  Perhaps I should've known this was going to be a bad night as we waited about 5-10 mins when we first came in before we were even greeted as there were no employees in the front, dining area or even at the bar.  I'm assuming this pizza joint is either one going out of business soon and do not give a rat's a** about their customers or two they truly lack the skills to run a business professionally and are in dire need of a refresher course in business basics & customer service."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports events if you have kids. This place is family friendly and since we have been (somewhat) frequent visitors, the servers and waitresses make it a personable experience - especially since we usually order the same things whenever we go. They used to have garlic knots which were my absolute fave, but unfortunately since switching management they've let them go - I'm secretly hoping this post helps bring them back - because the dough nuggets aren't even close to being comparable. Overall, this place had a good, family friendly atmosphere.... and a perfect alternative to watching sports at a bar!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago style pizza in Las Vegas.
I have been going here for a few years and have yet to be disappointed. 
The Beef sandwich is one of my favorite items on the menu."}
{"text":"I  grew up in Chicago.  This is the best deep dish pizza in Las Vegas.  I ate there twice over a six month span and the quality was consistent.  Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  The staff is always friendly.  The pizza and sandwiches are definitely top notch."}
{"text":"Good and fast service. Usually get the food delivered and it comes hot all the time. Well prepared Chicago style dishes that are very filling. Whether you like thin style or prefer the thick deep dish the pizzas will not disappoint. The pasta is also tasty and hearty. It is nice to have a taste of Italian food from a major city on the west coast. I would recommend this for a try!"}
{"text":"We are new to the valley and used Yelp to find a good new pizza spot and WE FOUND IT!!! Rosati's food is delicious!!! From the pizza that's covered with extra cheese so the toppings don't fall off after each bite, to the yummy flavors of chicken wings, to the amazing pastas...they have it ALL!! We received great customer service from the girl that answered the phone for our delivery order, and we were given a time for our food to arrive and it arrived exactly at that time! We have introduced Rosati's to our family that has lived in the valley for years and never knew they were missing out! Eat here you won't be disappointed. 5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good like any other Rosati...low rating for the service.  I called in for a delivery...spoke with 4 or 5 different girls, 1 girl asks for my number, name and address then asks me to hold...another girl picks up and asks for name number and address...WTF? I told her the other girl just ask for all that already...she says last time I promise...gives her the info...something is not working right on her end..puts me on hold...SMDH...5 mins on hold and no one asks what would I like to order...hung up....the end...idgit"}
{"text":"I wrote a review a little while back about how grimaldi's was a bit better. Now after having grimaldi's a few more times, I do have to admit I was mistaken the quality is not consistent at all. Amount of toppings is a mystery every time...Rosatis has always been beyond delicious and CONSISTENT QUALITY every time!!! Sorry guys, I take back everything I said earlier."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but a place like this calls for one. I recently just moved here from LA and this has got to be the single greatest, and most evil discovery I have made yet! I ordered the Spaghetti Mostaccioli pasta and a side of meatballs and I literally just had a taste-gasm. To make matters even worse, THEY DELIVER! So thank you Rosati's in advance for the 10 pounds I will probably put on in the future. Sincerely, a future Rosati's addicted couch potato."}
{"text":"Only reason for the fifth star is that the carpet in the place is outdated !! That said the pizza was fantastic. Never had Chicago style and this was amazing... Got the baked mosttacholi (spelling) and it had a great taste. The cheese was amazing the sauce has a unique pleasant taste. Fried pickles can never be bad! Only thing besides ripping the carpet out that I would do is put a sign at the entrance that tells ya what to do... Example - seat yourself... Cause first timers don't know if their supposed to wait or seat themselves...,I will definitely be back!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time today. I had heard good things about the deep dish pizza.  Everything was delicious! Found our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! ***They won't accept coupons on their own website, and this one girl that always answers the phone has an attitude problem."}
{"text":"We had the Chicago Deep Dish Pepperoni and Sausage! It was delicious! I was quoted 45 mins for pick up. This is appropriate amount of time called for a Chicago Deep Dish. If you want something quicker I suggest ordering the thin. The serving sizes are huge! I can't wait to try the other items off of the menu, like the family spaghetti!"}
{"text":"The WORST SERVICE/ customer service!!! It took over an hour to get our pizza and it came COLD AND THE CHEESE was hard! I called back to speak to a manager and said \"technically you got your pizza, I will only give you 50% your next purchase!\" Why would I ever want to order from this place again, just to get a cold pizza? SAVE YOUR money and Oder from another place! Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow Rosati's what's happening here. I used to be in love but today was not that day and I can be fan of greasy pies. My toppings hydroplaned off in transit and it was so damp with oil and like someone forgot to drain the green peppers,mushrooms,and black olives before putting it together thinking what i guess it would evaporate.

Nope it didn't just made it soggy.

What to do call back? Is it really worth the time and effort for a $30 pizza? I said yes but from some of the reviews all I can think of is chalking it up as a learning experience and i'm not even going to post a picture. Not good guys not good at all. Sorry but this is my review."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good, the only think I can say is that we felt a little uncomfortable when 
a employee(I think) he was wearing a Rosati's t- shirt was laying in the booth behind us, 

Someone finally came out and told him there is no laying down in the booth, we will
not return to this location, thank you"}
{"text":"The pizza is great, staff is great, place is clean, good drinks, just wish the management would bring back some karaoke nights in the bar area. Overall Great place."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in the area & probably best bar happy hour in town for drinks. Did i says its a dive hahahah! Wings surprised the heck out of me. Staff is cool. Best kept secret in centennial hils"}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere in the bar sometimes I come here just for it the staff is very friendly answer and it feels like a family own place definitely a good recommendation kind of a hole in wall bar has that comfy feeling"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while, and surprisingly I never had the chance to try it. We went for the lunch special on a recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was pretty impressed by their pizzas. Service was ok, considering they had just one person taking the orders and serving the food, bar style, but it was better than I expected, although the prices were slightly more than I thought, which is why we went for the lunch special. If you want the pizza cut in traditional pie slices, make sure you mention it. Apparently you need to, or you will be served in those tiny squared slices \"chicago style\" (even though we did not even order a deep dish pizza...)"}
{"text":"As far as the food goes this is some of the best pizza you will be able to find in the Phoenix area if you like real Chicago style pizza. 

Having said that it is very expensive. The pizza is excellent though, so it may be worth the splurge. I recommend looking for a coupon before ordering, although do so with caution, because this place also needs to be criticized for being stingy with coupons. They need to lighten up and accept the deals they print out. We have had an issue or two in regards to that.

On the other hand, the delivery service was good and the delivery guy even made an effort to run the pizza to us, so it was nice to see that he was trying hard to get the pizza to us as quick as possible."}
{"text":"The only reason Me and my wife gave it one star is because it not allowed to give none. it was warm. Our bill came to $31.64 and $25 dollars of that must have been for bread. Its the perfect deep dish for people that don't know what a deep dish is. Absolutely HORRIBLE! It was like the owners there have forgotten what Deep Dish is. Way to much dough and not chessy at all. Just sad!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good pizza since moving here last Nov. Had our first thin crust pizza tonight from Rosati's. It was yummy, plenty of cheese and a great perfectly cooked thin crust, the last thin crust pizza we had here from another pizzeria was burned on the bottom. So we have finally found our pizza place. Loved it!"}
{"text":"We typically enjoy Rosati's food, once a week, and typically via delivery. Everyone is so nice and professional, from the owner to the delivery people. The food is always superb. We both are from The Chicago area, and there is nothing like Chicago style pizza. In our opinion of course. :-) So we were very happy when Rosati's came to the Northwest neighborhood years ago. Sometimes we have Sandwich night, sometimes Pizza night (especially during football season, we like to watch the Sunday night NFL football game with our pizza), sometimes Pasta. The common denominator: everything is from Rosati's. 
Our favorite dishes from each of the three categories are as follows. Sandwiches: The Italian beef for my husband (aka 'Big Al'), and the chicken sandwich for me. Pasta: baked Mostaciolli for Big Al, and Angel hair pasta with either Italian sausage or scrumptiously-spiced grilled chicken on the side, for me. Pizza: The large thin crust Fabulous Four for Al, and the Meat Lovers for me. In each case: thin crust and large. Sometimes, I like to go for the more exotic style pizza like having the pizza with spinach. It's all great. In all cases, we enjoy the large Caesar salad. I get to eat most of it; whereas Big Al  sticks with the croutons and some pieces of lettuce. Sometimes I'll get the chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert, while Big Al fancies a nice piece of cheesecake. To Rosati's: the best pizza, and service in town!"}
{"text":"Under new management?!?

This was the go to lunch spot for a few of my coworkers, probably ate here 2-3 times a month. Never had problems until today. 

We waited for 15 minutes after server took drink order for drinks (water plus a couple sodas) to arrive. Server took our food order after delivering drinks, and we waited 45 minutes for food to come out. Our group ordered standard lunch fare - a couple salads and sandwiches. Salads came out 10 minutes before other foods, and the folks who ordered sandwiches had to get them packed to go as we had to leave. 

Truly bad experience today, and this place will fall to the bottom of the list for quick work lunch spots."}
{"text":"Love the SOB pizza.  Just like in Chicago"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is tasty.  However, the garden salad is merely iceberg lettuce.  The wait staff is lacking, once the pizza was brought to the table,  the waitress did not return until she brought the check. So while the pizza is good,  hard to enjoy with no beverage."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great. They sell an amazingly thick pizza that is a meal in itself! It beats every chain store pizza! When visiting the store to pick up take-out pizzas, the employees are never all that friendly. The location sports a tiny seating area that I suppose could be seen as romantic or quaint, but when I've eaten there, I just thought it was dar, loud, and cold (the door kept opening for take-out guests).

On one occasion, they prepared a pizza with incorrect ingredients. They were very sorry about the error and gladly made a replacement, making appropriate amends (not stated here) for the time I had to wait. 

In addition to ordering pizza for take-out, I recently had a wonderful experience when having Rosatti's cater a dinner. For an astounding $169, we purchased the \"Rosatti's Budget Buster\" for 20-25 guests. It was so inexpensive that we ordered it even though we were only feeding 9 people. Purchasing each item individually, even in much smaller quantities, was going to be exorbitantly expensive. As a result, everyone took home leftovers to eat right away and more to freeze for later. It was the Christmas party that just kept giving! :-)

The service I received through catering was completely different than that experienced with my past pick-up orders. Alexia communicated kindly with me by phone and email several times and was eager to match my group's needs while making the experience easy. I really appreciated her dedication to her work and her desire to ensure my guests received the best experience possible. 


Tips:

--There is usually a $5 off coupon in the local ValPak. You must bring in the actual paper to get the discount.

--Each pizza box has a tab on the side worth one point. When you receive 12 points (12 pizza boxes), you can buy one pizza at half price. Eat-in customers... always be sure to take some home so you get the box."}
{"text":"Pizza was just okay, nothing too special. This place is really close to our home so I'm sure we will give it another chance. Next time I'll try the double dough instead of the Chicago style crust.
Breadsticks looked and tasted like they bought them from the grocery store and then put them in a freezer until ready. 
The restaurant itself was nice though. It looks like they have a pub/bar section that is separate from a family dining section. Great place to go eat dinner, I'll just have to try something different next time"}
{"text":"I am at a loss for words and that rarely happens. The Godfather pizza was probably one of the best(top 3) pizzas I have ever had in my life. The crust is definitely deep dish. They do not mess around here. We ordered a two pizzas, wings, and garlic rolls for the 6 of us and OMG we had enough food leftover for lunch the next day. The pizza is ridiculous! Do not be greedy and start with a small piece. I don't mess around so I went in for the largest slice and I was ready to pass out halfway thru. This is no Dominos. They aren't messing.."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery, great deep dish pizza"}
{"text":"Watched the UFC fight here and had amazing pizza for dinner tonight! Would highly recommend this place to watch future fights, not too crowded (looked like standing room only but they weren't turning people away like some other bars showing it) and no cover charge."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here we usually eat here twice a month or take out. They have a great bar/lounge area to have a beer and some wings and watch the game.  The staff is always upbeat and happy even though it is always busy.  Have to try there fried pickles"}
{"text":"When I was in Chicago 8-years ago, I stood in line to try the legendary deep dish pizza from Ginos East. Since then, I've tried to duplicate that experience. At this Rosati's location the pizza is very close to what I remember. 

The deep dish pizza has to be eaten with a fork and knife. At this location, I ate in the bar area where there are booths and TV's. The atmosphere was comfortable. The service was excellent. You are sure to enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was good but service was impecible. There was a young lady there that was so kind and professional to everyone that came in. Her customers all knew her and she knew them. She even offered to help an older gentleman to his car."}
{"text":"Update: .Update:  my son convinced me to have wings and pizza ordered by delivery and both the wings and the hand tossed pizza were really good! Maybe my previous issue with pizza was the thin crust and I should have ordered hand tossed...maybe I dined in on a bad day for the cook. I just know that this was a much better eating experience!!"}
{"text":"The Chicago style deep dish is awesome.  I got the small 12 inch, and I think it literally weighed 5 lbs.  Tons of toppings.  I was only able to eat one slice per meal.  I put the leftovers in the fridge then re-heated.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Disappointed!  From the reviews I was expecting great food.  However the small Cesar salad that they said would feed 2 people was not worth the price they charge for a bit of torn lettuce and store bought croutons.  The lasagna looked amazing and the first few bites were tasty but it was sooo salty I couldn't even finish it.  I don't know if I would pay the prices again to find out if it was just an off day for the cook."}
{"text":"Usually we are dine in customers here. However this evening we ordered delivery. The option to order online is not available at this store yet but that's no biggie. I called it in, super easy, arrived in the time frame promised (45 min; it's a Friday night so that's understandable). We still experienced the great customer  service here as a delivery customer like when do when dining in. 

When the food arrived it was piping hot. Like HOT! So hot I burned my tongue and the roof of my mouth. But ya know, I didn't mind, sure beats the heck out of getting cold pizza from the Dominos less than a mile from my house!! 

We got one large pepperoni on the double dough crust, 2 cannolis, and an order of cheese fries. All were delicious and flavorful. 

I feel that they are a bit on the expensive side but Rosatis never disappoints, I personally feel the food quality (big portions too) and customer service are certainly worth the extra buckaroos."}
{"text":"Came here for a different kind of pizza experience because I was tired of the other places in Centennial and wanted something new.  This pizza was good.
I ordered a Large Chicago-style pizza with just a bunch of meat and maybe some veggies, a real fat man's pizza.  My eyes were larger than my belly that night.  In addition to the pizza, I indulged on the fried mushrooms too, I highly recommend those too... Dip the mushrooms in their oil then dip it again in the sauce...
I sat in the bar area while waiting for the food to come out.  Beer was served in a chilled frosty mug, a touch of awesomeness in my book.  The crowd was small for Monday Night Football but the service was superior compared to other pizza/pasta places in Centennial."}
{"text":"Interesting that two days after leaving this review I was refunded my whole purchase amount. No sorry but I got my money back, it will go to the hundreds of dollars in medical bills from my wife's ER visit."}
{"text":"Service has gone way downhill over the last year. It wasn't great to begin with. I feel like I'm bothering the staff by being there. The owner is a joke. Last time I sat 30 minutes waiting for someone to allow me to pay. I was told they thought we had already and should've just walked out. Really, you are telling me I could've walked out on my bill??? 
I'm not sure about dress code but goodness, I am young, but I wouldn't wear shorts to work where my cheeks hang low or see through yoga pants. Not attractive at all. 
Pizza crust is cardboard. Pasta is okay if you don't mind paying too much. Salads are good if they can remember want dressing you asked for. 
It's a shame because I enjoyed going here several years back."}
{"text":"If I could put a zero rating on this place, I would. If you want your order to be wrong and get an attitude from the employees for them making a simple mistake, this is the place for you!

Customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. The kids working there are as immature as a 9 year old at a Kanye West concert. The managers are just as bad as they do nothing to correct an order that was made incorrectly. They take no accountability for their action.

I would seriously rather WALK 1,500 miles to Lou Malnati's Pizzaria in Chicago before I step foot in this poor excuse for a Chicago pizza establishment.

Never again!"}
{"text":"I may be Paleo, but in a past live I was a pizza hound. And to this day, I have a weakness. A willpower deficiency, you could call it. It is *possible*, but highly unlikely, that if you put pizza in front of me I will not eat it. 

Such was the case one day when the boss took a group of us to lunch and neglected to tell me -- purposefully -- that we were headed here. So I figured what the heck, go big or go home right?

The garlic bread knots are amazing. The chicken fingers are amazing. The pizzas are amazing. The garlic cheese bread is amazing. Even the ranch dressing here was amazing.

It's a tad expensive but I really don't care. For pizza this good, I'll pay the premium. Plus the company paid for lunch that day."}
{"text":"Food was perfect from the taste to the portion size Andy is the mastermind behind this delicious food and Maisy was really helpful and polite definitely a spot to enjoy good food and drinks."}
{"text":"The worst pizza in centennial hills . I ordered pizza tonight and it was terrible undercooked cheese falls off when you grab a slice. The sauce Taste like spaghetti o's . I do not know what happens to this place it use to be a lot better about a year ago . New management chefs ??? Anyway it's terrible . I will never order pizza again from them! It's bad when u would rather eat Pizza Hut over Rosati's .  Never again"}
{"text":"Service is the absolute worst. If the waitress would have stopped by our table at least one of the 4 times she walked by to take beer to the table behind us, she might have noticed our drinks were empty and we never got our food while the others we were with were all eating. When I asked about when we might get our food she was clueless. Food is good when you get it, but it's time to find good food and service together. Too many options in this town to deal with crappy service and attitude."}
{"text":"Just ordered my first ever Rosati's pizza. I haven't eaten the pizza or seen the establishment yet but the women on the phone definitely sounded bangable. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fried pickles are delicious, the cheesy garlic bread sub-par; not as golden brown as I would've hoped. The pizza was very large and tasty. Be sure to specify if you want it cut pie-style, it comes cut into squares. The zeppole were very delicious and plentiful. Besides the pickles, they were the best."}
{"text":"3 stars. Why?

It could be because I went to a Rosati's in Chicago and decided it was 10 times better.
It could be because the prices were raised WAY too much.

I ordered a pizza I usually get and found out the price was raised $10. In that case, I'd rather get a WHOLE pizza somewhere else for the difference. Cici's all-you-can-eat even sounded good at that point.

I could've bought a large pizza from Pizza Hut and added in 10 boneless flavored wings for less.

I hate to say it, but they're also lacking sauce most of the time. I don't know what it is. That pizza in Chicago will never be topped, even though it's the same chain/recipe.

The pizza wasn't as hot as I'd liked when the price was raised, too.   =[

Sad.
Don't get the wings. Go to Tony's Pizza for that."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago so yes I'm a pizza snub.  
It's the closest thing to Chi town pizza in Vegas (for now).  I would give it 5 stars but sometimes they overcook the deep dish pizza a tad - makes the crust dry/hard.
All of the following are great!
- Italian beef w mozzarella 
- Deep dish pizza
- Chicago style pizza
- Double Dough pizza
- Thin crust pizza
- Garlic cheese bread

Great place for great pizza! (Tell your cooks not to OVERCOOK!  Take it out a couple min earlier!)"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here and I truly have to say it won't be our last the pizza here is freaking Bom especially there Chicago style deep dish Pizza the best  and the service here is fast too! The only thing is there is very little seating inside and outside but the view from up here is awesome cus if u park next to wahoos tacos area your able to get a great view of the Las Vegas strip from up here which is Awesome if your into those kind of things but other than that I totally recommend this place to anyone who's looking 4 a good pizza"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here several times over the past couple of years.

Whether calling in the order or picking it up, the staff is always friendly and accommodating.

Pizza is a tad more pricey than the other retail pizza places, but the quality is also a tad better also.

In addition to the pizza's, they also serve sandwiches, salads and pasta dishes.

While the pizza is round it is chopped into smaller squares for consumption.  This technique justifies taking half the pizza and making pizza legos on your plate.  

Beware the center squares if not eaten right away will eventually turn into little cheese pucks that will slide right off the crust and onto the floor or your lap."}
{"text":"Best pizza n Vegas Hands Down!!!  I'm from Chicago and I am. HUGE fan of Chicago thin crust.  I appreciate the deep dish, but Chicago thin crust is the way to go!  I've been a loyal custom for years, and when I moved out of their delivery zone, they still deliver to me!  Great food, excellent service!  5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I lived in Las Vegas for forty four years before relocating to Salt Lake City and I really enjoy Salt Lake but man do I miss all of my favorite hangouts in Las Vegas.

Having said that, I had the opportunity to visit my daughter in Vegas last weekend and my son-in-law bought me Rosati's Pizza and I am not exaggerating when I say that I have not enjoyed a slice ..................... OK, OK, I ate the whole pizza and I am not exaggerating when I say that was the best pizza that I have ever eaten ........... ever!!!

While I was still a Las Vegas resident Rosati's Pizza was my go to place for Pizza, since moving to Salt Lake I have found a couple of places that I enjoy but none of them measure up to Rosati's.

At Rosati's you will enjoy the salads, the wings are above average, and the pizza is heaven scent ................................ nay, life changing!!

I am sitting here looking at a calendar wondering when I can get back to Vegas so I can get another pizza.

Do yourself a favor and give the crispy thin crust a try, it is pizza perfection, I am not sure what it is but they put some seasoning or spices or something awesome on the pizza that gives it the best taste in the world.

Until next time fellow Yelpers .............................. Be Local, Live Local, and whenever you can Buy Local!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the pizza at all. Got a large double dough pizza and double dough was right-hardly any sauce or toppings with mounds of dough. Very disappointed of the dry bland pizza. They seem to have a good staff and good prices on alcohol, but I will not be returning for the food."}
{"text":"Came here as a group after hiking. The staff was friendly and the waitress was so kind. As we were looking over the menu, we noticed this place is on the expensive side. We also noticed the decor could use a bit of a touch up. 
Anyways, we ordered our food (I ordered the meatball parmigiana, and my husband ordered The Cheef sandwich) We also ordered Cajun fries to share. The waitress came back in less than 20 minutes with our food. 
THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!
Definitely worth the price we paid. I'm from Chicago, so I'm pretty picky with Pizza, therefore I'm not sure how their Pizza taste. But judging by the food we just finished, I really think it would be tasty."}
{"text":"Expensive and poor customer service.  Food was terrible."}
{"text":"The most racist restaurant I've ever been to! Friend came back from deployment a few months ago & she wanted to eat at this restaurant. We went to sit down at a table after not being greeted & then after 15-20 mins had to ask a waiter by the bar if she can take our order. She took our drivers licenses to the back to \"get approval\" from her manager. She came back and said \"do we have a different ID?\" We then showed her our age on our CAC and she said \"my manager won't accept these.\" At that point I was livid, we can enter a military installation but can't eat at a restaurant near the bar! The whole time, the manager is in the corner grinning. We simply just walked out in disbelief. Never again will I step foot near this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I mean, have you had their Deep Dish? Absolutely delicious, fresh and fast! I love the friendly staff at Rosati's and their delivery driver Bobby is absolutely a character! I would recommend them to all of my Real Estate clients who need a quick and delicious meal in the chaos of moving!"}
{"text":"This rosatis is so good! I love their pizza, it's very authentic! We always order a large with giardenero (sp?) peppers and Italian sausage. It's reasonably priced, WAY better than any Pizza Hut, and delivery is quick!"}
{"text":"We were there the day this place opened. It was outstanding. Not sure what's going on, but the past year and a half it has really gone downhill. The pepperoni on the pizza is so thin you can read the paper through it, and there is barely enough to notice its on the pizza at all.  The same with the sausage,  very very sparse.  Will be some time before we try them again.  Shame, it was very very good pizza when they opened."}
{"text":"The pizza here is just OK for the price. We've ordered the thin crust cheese pizza on two different occasions and it seems like one was good, and the other was not. There's simply too many pizza joints around here to settle for mediocre pizza. 

Also, side note...we did not dine in either of the times so I can't speak to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've ever had Chicago style pizza, and this place lived up to my expectations. The service was friendly and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"I thought that any pizza, would be good pizza. I found I was wrong. 

We went here last night. The staff were very friendly and helpful. 

We had a small salad which was quite large and good. 

Then we got our pizza. I have never had a pizza crust like this. It was worse than a saltine cracker. I can not think of a comparable taste. It was just bad. 

Plus the toppings do not attach themselves to the crust, they just slide around on top. 

We brought some home, and today we tossed it. Why would you want to eat more of it?

Maybe their pasta is better?

I would rather have frozen pizza or any of the chains than this one."}
{"text":"We recently moved close to this location and constantly get flyers and ads in the mail for it. I had checked the reviews and they weren't so great but when I checked today they were better. Had a craving for spaghetti and meatballs. So I ordered the spaghetti and added 5 meatballs. The meatballs are an additional $.95 each which I thought was a little steep but they turned out to be really good. Their food hit the spot, exactly what I was wanting. Will be back again. Service was friendly and they were very fast."}
{"text":"I wanted a slice of pizza.   Unfortunately,  I was greeted at the counter by a woman who simply stated \"they didn't feel like making any today\"  I had a slice several months ago. 

Oh well, attitude can truly hurt a business."}
{"text":"The pizza is very large but cut into the small squares for its easy to eat.  They were pretty $$$, but it was pretty good.

We had the godfather and it was nice and spicy.  never had a pizza like that before.  The fried mushrooms were SO GOOD!!!!

all in all it was pretty good, but to be honest, i like Round Table much better, especially for the price, just too bad its so far from home!"}
{"text":"It's okay pizza but the fries are really good with the homemade ranch.  Other than that nothing really special, the pizza is thin and okay, it fits a perfect 3/5."}
{"text":"I've been to two of these places. This was the second location I went to. Horrible!!!!! Forgot the bacon and over cooked the pizza. It was chewy and burnt."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place! Cheesy Beef, pastas and the best pizza crust! Amazing food and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza in Vegas! They use good ingredients and put plenty of toppings on the pizza. Crust is really thin. Love it! They have a good wing specials. Meatball sandwiches also yummy. They have a family-style restaurant and a bar next-door. Look out for $5 off coupons in the mail. Coupons never expire even though they say they do, so hold on to them."}
{"text":"I used to love Rosatis until a few different bartenders started working on the days I come in. Ally was there all of those days which was one of the biggest reasons I even came to the establishment. Friday nights, or any night with her and Des were the nights to go and now its gone down hill. The younger bartender doesn't seem like she knows what she is doing like they just threw her behind the bar and only pays attention to her group of friends, another is either wasted all the time or crying in the corner complaining about her life to customers instead of serving them your lucky if you get a hello within the first 30 minutes your there...like really? who manages this place. Probably wont be back any time soon unfortunately I would go to see des but she's so busy picking up the slack of the other girls that she has no time to be how it used to be. The food is still amazing and because of that I give it one star."}
{"text":"I dunno.  You don't want to give bad reviews, but I have to say, this pizza was just not good at all and didn't satisfy my pizza hankering in any way.  They were nice.  And fast.  but the pizza just isn't good pizza."}
{"text":"Food: Fries, Parmesan garlic wings, deep dish Rosati's Monster. Food was delicious highly recommend.

Services: Very friendly, fast and overall awesome atmosphere. 

I would come back and recommend to others"}
{"text":"Love this bar!! I mean NO SMOKE. That's so awesome. The bartenders are really friendly and the drinks are more then reasonably priced. They have so many tv's for games and entertainment. This is the place to be for any sporting event."}
{"text":"Well the pizza is delicious, the service leaves a lot to be desired. I called in an order for pick up and was told 20 minutes and it would be ready. 50 minutes later I finally get my pizza. No apologies, nothing. They had one customer in the sitdown part. Staff were joking and laughing with each other quite a bit, but that did not get my pizza done faster."}
{"text":"Ordered hot chicken fingers to go, when I got home they were plain. The food is just alright."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fingers for the first time..very disappointed. they were not good. Very dry, hard, poor quality. I expected better from a place like Rosatie's. 6.00 for 4 strips..i wouldn't even had paid 2 bucks!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite location but if you know Rosati's then you know they make some pretty good pizza. I prefer to go to the one on warm Springs when I'm in that neighborhood. That one is just the best around to me at least in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Rosati's and Aurelio's are the only two pizza chains that actually come from Chicago.  I am a Rosati's fan but I am a north sider. My fiance is a south sider and prefers Aurelio's. In my opinion,  it's all about the thin crust (sausage), pass on the garlic parmesan wings."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews I was not sure If my family should try this place. I was very pleased that we did. Service was great. Called in a order and picked it up 25 min later. I was helped as soon as I walked in the door and with a smile! The place was busy. Every table was taken and still I felt Like I was well taken care of. Got home after carrying a pizza that felt like it weighed 10 lbs. The large Chicago style pizza is fantastic. Our family of 4 ate and still half is left and we are stuffed. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever...they are a confused disaster.  Give them 3 months before bankruptcy with this craptastic service."}
{"text":"I always order delivery from there and they always deliver fresh and fast pizzas! Today we went in with a few friends and had some fried dough, garlic Parmesan wings, habanero wings, and combo deep dish pizza! Everything was delicious. Our server was a very sweet and was on top of everything. So happy to have this little gem walking distance from my house."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time we actually ate at the place.  Met two friends and had dinner. We sat on the bar side - which was great!  Nice large booths, tv with football on, and even a jukebox.  No smoking - which we love.  Food was good.  Ravioli w/meat sauce, lasagna, spaghetti.  All were good.  Ranch fries are my favorite!  And we love their thin crust pizza with extra sausage.  Service was great.  Nice girl, Ali, was our waitress.  Very friendly, always coming to check on us, never rushed us, let us hang after dinner for a few more beers.  They treat you like friends - love that.  Just a great, casual hang out.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"Time for some pizza. This location is amazing. We are from Chicago and the Rosati name is synonymous with catering in Chi Town. Waitress was friendly and accurate in her knowledge of the Rosati products. Our cheese pizza was delicious!!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"I will never eat at this place due to the worst customer service they gave.  Not only did they mess up a delivery order, they were rude about their mistake.  They didn't offer to deliver the correct order.  They wanted me to pick up their mistake. When I said I wanted them to fix the order, all they could offer me was a mailed $5 gift certificate.  The worker said she was not able to refund me the difference.  

Few days later, I received the $5 gift certificate via mail that was address with my first name and a last name Fukoff.  I called the manager about this incident, Ken.  He didn't apologize but told me it was a mistake. He did mention that they did mail me the $5 gift certificate.  Seriously, have we lost the meaning of customer service?"}
{"text":"Even worst than last time , I decided to give them another chance and they were absolute garbage. This truly is one if the worst pizzerias in town. Don't spend a penny here"}
{"text":"In town on a business trip and went to visit Hoover Dam. A friend recommended this pizza shop and since it was on our way we decided to stop. Pizza was amazing. Was not eat in but there were two tables outside and we sat there. Thin crust was excellent."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but delivery took so long! By the time it got to my house it was cold! The Salad I ordered also had some pink lettuce in it (may have been old?)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Rosati's. Great food, great service, friendly environment. A couple weeks ago we had a promotion party in the bar area. Had the whole section just for our event. We had approximately 150 or so guests. The manager, Judd, helped to ensure we had plenty of food and drinks out throughout the night. The bar staff, Ali and Dez were awesome! This team is hard working and gave us an amazing night! Thanks Rosati's!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The kitchen was a little slow due to new cooks but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Been here for the last time at the price of $15 for a medium pizza I got barely any meat on my sausage and pepperoni it doesn't do any good to call the manager because they don't care"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, the sauce was fantastic. We also tried the garlic bread had a perfect crunch with a soft inside. Pizza was awesome."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new pizza spot, and $26 later for one pizza, I hoped it would be good. Nope. So bad we're throwing the rest away. The pizza was salty, and the sauce was tangy or something off. They also cut it into weird little squares... I don't get it. Save your money!"}
{"text":"This Rosati's store is pickup or delivery only, no dine in here. I called in an order for a small Chicago style pepperoni pizza, and an order of mild wings extra crispy. The girl on the phone said 35 minutes so I drove over after 30 had passed. Unfortunately for me my food was not ready yet. I waited about 20 minutes before I received anything. At least 6 other people came into the store to pickup food, and were all told that their order was not ready yet. Granted they were busy, but they should probably add an extra 20 minutes or longer to the suggested pickup/delivery time. It was almost an hour until I got my food from the time I called. Also I heard the girls telling people on the phone delivery time was 2 hours, yikes! No pizza is worth a two hour wait, just sayin'. 

Anyway I had asked for extra ranch before I paid and the guy who rang me up said no problem. When I got my food there was only one ranch so I asked for more and was charged $0.54 for one. I was a little bothered because the guy didn't charge me when I asked for it, and also since I waited an extra 20 minutes they should have thrown it in for free, but whatever. It cost me $30 for everything. 

The wings that I ordered were supposed to be mild were dry as hell. The pizza was okay but too doughy and not enough sauce. I like the concept of Chicago style deep dish, but whenever I order it I am always disappointed. It's just too doughy for me. I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is so good. They have a great beer happy hour. They're one of the only places that has the mother earth Cali creamé on draft. My only suggestion is not to have the TVs in the main dining room up so loud."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Thin crust pizza and Italian Beef are awesome! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yummola - that is what I have to say about their Italian Sausage Fettucine Alfredo. 

We also had the Chicago Deep Dish - cheese, tomatoes, basil, and sausage - reminded me of being in Chicago. 

We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"We travel to this location because the Rosati's nearest us is terrible.  The service is always great and the dining area is perfect for watching the game while you enjoy some real good grub."}
{"text":"Rosati's was  one of the first places I had pizza around here that I actually liked.  I had been worried, after moving here from NY, that I might really not be able to find good pizza so far from what I consider to be the pizza capitols of the world (NYC and Chicago).  Rosati's gave my my first glimmer of hope.

The pizza here is good.  A little too much sauce, a little too much flour, but not bad at all.  I think the only complaint is that is a little more expensive than I feel it's worth.  Maybe I'm being stingy, but I don't feel that their basic cheese pizza tastes like it's worth $12.

Still, if you're in the area and craving pizza, it's worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Super good Chicago Deep dish style."}
{"text":"Try the deep dish pizza it was amazing.  They have great happy hour deals that I plan on taking advantage of in the near future.  Also a good place to watch sports as they have tv screens and a bar you could sit at."}
{"text":"Used their delivery service as I decided I wanted a lazy night in. Girl on the phone was accommodating when I called a second time to change my order. Received the delivery within 30 minutes. Delivery guy was friendly. 

I ordered a Caesar salad and a small pizza with thin crust and toppings. The salad was quite good, but I am unfortunately not a fan of the pizza. 

There was hardly any pizza sauce, the cheese was a thick block and every time I picked up a slice the cheese w/ toppings would plop off. The crust was also burnt at the ends. 

TLDR; Service was decent. Delivery time was decent. Salad was decent. Pizza was not-so-decent."}
{"text":"This is a Meitz family staple.  We have been eating Rosati's for years and are rarely disappointed.  For us this is, next to Giordano's that just moved here two years ago, the closest you can get to authentic Chicago style pizza.  Whether you choose their deep dish or their thin, square-cut pizzas, you can't go wrong.  For us personally the best  of the best is their thin crust, sausage only and their Chicago style spinach deep dish (definitely think about adding sausage to this too).  

A lot of other places around town will have deep dish that are honestly not that deep but these slices come out hefty!  There surely is a lot of dough but that's what you are getting when you order a deep dish.  The dough has to be thick to support all of the toppings!  

I like that this place is close and convenient although it is a bit pricey, I will definitely pay it to have some of the best pizza in the valley.  I would take this any day over lower-priced chains, a la Domino's, Little Ceasars, Pizza Hut, etc.  I gorge myself way too much when we get this pizza and I'm not even embarrassed about it."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour Mon-Thursday, 4-6 PM (half price pizza, dine-in only).  We got a large Chicago style deep dish for only $9.  Pizza was very good and the bartender was friendly."}
{"text":"Just called to place a order and the guys was a jerk to my lady had to hang up. He cost rosati a new customer we love Italian food will never eat here. Have some respect jerk"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good ! I always get the cheif on garlic bread and extra sauce on the side. And they deliver ! The pizzas are amazing also."}
{"text":"This place was awful! We were wanting some pizza and have driven past it multiple times since we shop at Smiths.

The staff was kinda friendly, but it was mainly them being close by constantly because we were the only people there.  We ordered breadsticks with marinara as an appetizer and then a pizza as well.  The marinara sauce was so bland it tasted like it wasn't even store bought.  Basically, liquid that was chunky and red but added no flavor.  The pizza came out and it was even worse.  We both choked down one piece and then asked for the check and a to go box to avoid being rude.  We quickly tossed it when we got home."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing! I ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza. I love the sauce, it has enough cheese and pepperonis. I love their wings too, we order the medium in spicy which has a spicy tangy flavor. I also recommend their cheese bread with their marinara sauce! Portions are big. You get what you pay for. I love this place."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is the most immature business I have been to in Las Vegas. I used to LOVE Rosati's when it first opened. Since moving back to this part of town, and ordering from this location, my family has been insulted WAY too many times.

Incident #1. Call to order delivery. Ordered via phone. Kid on the phone is cussing at coworkers while punching in our order. Whatever. Ok.

Incident #2. Call to order delivery on a weekday. 1 hour later husband calls. \"Uhh.... I marked it as pick up\" *slaps forehead* YOU REPEATED THE ORDER KIDDO. Driver comes. Wow I cant believe this sat this long. Usually we throw it away by now\".. um you have my phone number... why wouldnt you just call?

Incident #3. Call to order pickup. Inform older man \"i would like the Rosati's family favorite, The Veggie\" he said, \"are you on the Rosati's or My Rosatis?\" I was looking at an online menu. But his tone was awkward. I said let me check (on my phone) I informed him of the address on the menu, which was this location, he said \"good job little girl, okay\". I scoffed. Okay I dont mind getting called a little girl. Im in my mid twenties and sound like I am 12. But it sounded smart as hell for 1 and for 2 if you knew it already, why were you wasting my time?

I said \"you know what sir, I dont appreciate your tone, please cancel the order\" I heard a rebuttle as I swiftly hung up the phone.


Come on guys. Teenagers I expect stuff. But at least teach them how to hold a good attitude with customers for the future. The adult I spoke to this evening, you should know better.

{"text":"Great place for Pizza and Wings and everyone there takes care of us all the time. 
And I want to thank them for the job they always do for us.."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a Chicago style pizza for the longest. So we decided to to order one for pick up since we live so close. We called and the person I spoke with was kind and professional and said the pizza would be ready in 30 mins. We got a large with sausage and pepperoni and a order of Cajun fries.  It cost about $30 for all ( which was steep I thought to myself). As we picked up the pizza it was so heavy and hot fresh from the oven and the fries were packaged nicely. We got home and opened the box, this pizza was massive. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought to myself okay the price is worth it. Now the taste, the crust was crispy in the outside and soft I the middle, and they did not skimp on the cheese and toppings. It was delicious, and we will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever the order took a long time it was wrong then when I got it! I called to let them know they gave us the wrong order the manager had an attitude arguing with me about the order saying we told her the wrong pizza. So rude she said that she wasn't going to \"give me a free pizza\" I would have gladly paid for it but she was such a jerk poor management and social skills I told her I'd never give them my business ever again! Sucks thanks a lot M Zulema you shouldn't ever deal with customers!"}
{"text":"The best Chicago style pizza I've had in Vegas and very close to the pizza a friend had delivered to me from Chicago's Giodarno's. It was huge, thick, and packed with cheese, toppings, and red sauce! Definitely worth the price! Omg I love their tomato sauce it is so tasty. The crust taste just like a pies. Best of all we ordered for pick up and when we got home it was still HOT!! When you take a bite it's all ooey gooey cheesy goodness!  We had one half pepperoni and the other pepperoni, mushroom, & spinach. Check out my picture of the pizza and you'll know I ain't lyin!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood and I'm very thankful that my hubby ventured outside the usual go to pizza chains that we are used to!

The crust was flavorful and the cheese was thick. My only complaint would be that the toppings were a little sparse but everything else was great so I'll give it a pass. I was really in the mood for wings so I was shocked that the pizza satisfied me so well. The wings were good, not great but I'd order them again, I prefer more meat on the bones and a little crispy the same way I like my men! Lol Also, next time I'll ask for extra sauce (I'm an excessive dipper and these were nearly naked).  

The last thing we ordered was chicken Alfredo pasta for my almost 2 year old and he loved it but it was bland for the adults. The baby was happy so that's all that matters. I look forward to trying the garlic knots and whatever else I can get my hands on. Keep in mind the 3 items were $50 but it was worth it for the quality of the pizza alone."}
{"text":"12/28/16- We called ahead and reserved a table for 12 people at that restaurant. They had no problems saying it was okay, but when we got there (15 minutes later), they had already given our table away to another party. And the table that we reserved had only 8 persons available. The host had the audacity to tell us that we could sit separately. We will never be back to this restautant! You may have good product, but you never treat a customer like that!"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is the best weve ever had!  You just have to try it.  I had a favorite but this ones beats it."}
{"text":"very tasty pizza, great red sauce! we ordered a thin crust sausage, extra cheese, onion. it was very good! good customer service upon my arrival for the pizza pick-up as well!"}
{"text":"It's not the best nor the worst pizza I've had. I ordered the thin crust pizza. It just tasted really average to me. Nothing stood out but it wasn't terrible either. The garlic knots were alright too."}
{"text":"''Great pizza'' ''My annual visit to Las Vegas 2017 and my first pizza in this town and probably the best in this town '[Las Vegas] Very handy and Just around the corner from where my son just bought his new digs [House]  Pepperoni with lots of cheese,About 2'' and not even deep dish? NO they didn't skimp? And the deep dish is even more liberal with the cheese or so I'm told?  ''Thank You''"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Las Vegas my husband has to have this, since we live in LA and hes from Chicago, he always looks forward to it. We ordered the peperoni classic on deep dish...it was meh, it was more dough than anything and more pricey, I prefer their thin crust. my husband of course loved it but Ive tried better deep dish in LA and of course Chicago...ill give you ONE more chance the next time I see you.."}
{"text":"Im from Chicago and love Chicago pizza; deep dish and thin crust.

This food taste like home!! I always order a deep dish with sausage and spinach (they dont overdo the dough) and a thin crust w pepperoni and sausage. They taste great and that is suprising bcs my superior Chicago taste buds are very picky lol,...kidding.

Either way, they're my pizza joint!!!

Oh and I really like a lady that works there; Kelly, I think she said her name is....great place!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this pizzeria! We are every Tuesday regulars as its their wing night. My husband and son rave over the buffalo and bbq wings. I like the thin and crispy crust meat lovers style pizza. Calling in is always a must because they stay busy but will have your order ready and fresh."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken deep dish pizza and everything came out really good the pizza  was extra large and very flavorful the lady who helped me at the front was very helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and love everything we get. They are always so nice on the phone and have great customer service. We won't be going anywhere else to get our weekly pizza and garlic knot fix!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the extra most bestest! It tastes great and has a lot of pepperoni but not as much cheese as the regular! Very disappointed! False advertisement!!"}
{"text":"Overall great place! That thick Chicago pizza is awesome, but still doesn't compare to the thin crust. Nicely toasted crust and tasty sauce, you can taste the quality. If you ever order the Meatball Sub, ask for a little extra sauce.."}
{"text":"Such amazing pizza.. the Chicago deep dish is to die for, and the spicy beef calzone  was so big and delicious. . The chicken parmigiano is so tasty. It was our first experience but definitely not our last... we will be coming back again and again.  I recommend this place to everyone. No wonder it was voted best in las vegas! The service was great too.. everyone smiling and helpful. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  Service is great and food is even better!  With so many restaurants to choose from and try, I have finally found one to stick with.  The family sized portions are awesome for groups, too, and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The menu posted on the website does not match the pricing they charge you. There is significant difference in the price. When questioned Alexia was very dismissive and insinuated I didn't have the correct website. I advised her the website and it was correct. She discounted the pizza but clearly was agitated. When I picked up my Pizza she was clearly unhappy with me pointing out this error. Alexia clearly needs some retraining in customer service."}
{"text":"I just called. I don't know what to think but I'm very disappointed. The prices they have in their website are not correct. When you call they give you crazy prices. Online the pizza is about $14 when you call. It's $22. Sounds shady to me!!!! I'll pass!!!!"}
{"text":"My mom lives in Black Mountain in Henderson.  I mean, literally IN the mountain.  They had to blow parts of the mountain away to build her neighborhood.  Now, naturally, once I get myself out to her house there are few things that can wrench me away.  The sweet promise of my bed or a well-oiled Johnny Depp poised to feed me grapes are two of those few things.  And although I loves me some food, sometimes not even food can persuade me to leave.  That is when the sweet, sweet promise of Rosati's whispers itself into my waiting, starving ear.

I guess this place is a chain, but it's new to me so I'll pretend that it's an authentic Italian place run by a cute little Italian family who scream adorable little Italian obscenities at each other whilst covered in flour and bits of pasta.    I've never actually had their pizza here, but I've had giant trays of their pasta delivered to me and they've always been so good.  Their sauces are hearty and flavorful, and if you decide to get meatballs, let me tell you, they're as big as my head.  And I have a GIANT head.  However, I bet they're a lot tastier than my noggin.  My carb lovin' self can't eat enough of their stupid garlic bread and their fried mushrooms just make the really big girl inside of me really, really happy.  If you're a lazy bum who can't be arsed to cook, but you still want an actual meal this is probably perfection."}
{"text":"Check my review on the second listing for the same address of this nasty \"restaurant\". Please do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"WORST customer service EVER! I am appalled on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. The last two times I have ordered from there have been nothing short of awful. Nothing against the food itself, but the incompetent staff that run the place should all go jump in a lake.You have no business having a job, especially in customer service. Seeing as it is my business to be in customer service, I know what I am talking about. There are ways to speak to people and the brunette with the glasses should take a few hundred hours on proper etiquette and customer service. I cannot believe I have to share this earth with you, and shame on your parents for bringing you into this world. Your future is DIM!!!
     That being said, I go to pick my food. It wasn't ready when I walked in. Two minutes later my food was placed in the window. The girl sees my food and proceeds to talk to her little blonde co-worker, because obviously their social life was way more important than me getting my food after a 10 hour work day. I patiently wait another 7 minutes as these two teenagers catch up on their social lives, before the brunette turns to the window, grabs my food, and hands it to me, saying \"have a good night.\" Seven minutes may be an underestimation of the time I wasted listening to these girls have a personal conversation, while my food sat dying in the window. Shame on you for hiring little bitches that have zero personal skills, and a basic understanding of customer service. You will lose my entire families business as well as my MANY, MANY, MANY friends, and their friends. Seemingly cute girls do not equal good employees. Did I mention how many friends I have? Word of mouth is everything!"}
{"text":"Ya'll be slipping. It has been a long while since i visited here and I was kinda let down in my last visit. My plan A spot closed early so i figured down the plaza is an ok joint i used to visit. Went in the store and waited 5mins to be seen even though there was no one in the shop. Had goofy mc doofus half ass take my order for a calzone. \"that'll be like 20 mins or so homie\" So i trusted is intelligence when it came to accurate time measurements. Walked to the chevron to go grab a soda, returned , again to an unmanned counter. Him and his pals are in back cursing,laughing and grab assing. Which isn't very good considering folks walk thru the door some with kids. He almost hands me the wrong order. I purchased a pepperoni calzone.  That was basically cheese and bread with 3 pepperoni's. It was uber greasy which is gnarly. I was really let down that I paid for a greasy slice of cheesy bread. Hope they up their game and ditch the scmucks, because there is a lot of unprofessional stuff that I witnessed.  I know it's not Dow Jones, but take some pride in work."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, however the lady that took my order (who I understand to be the manager) was VERY rude. I have never had such a bad experience over the phone while ordering food. She is very condescending... her attitude may have cost them my business. I only give 3 stars because the pizza quality and for the amazingly nice drivers."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Have eaten there many times and has always been yummy. I'm a huge fan of their thin cheese pizzas and their chicken wings are great! No issues ever with food orders or staff."}

{"text":"I ordered a deep dish pie and two orders of zucchini sticks, total price $45.00. I  received  8 zucchini circles and a lukewarm pie.  When I called back they told me they only had circles  and each order was weighed at 7 Oz for $7.00 . My double order weighs  5 oz. They said they would send me another 5oz order to  compensate. 
What bull!!!!
I will NEVER order from this disreputable cheat again.

Ever. 

Try the Hawaiian and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"REVIEW UPDATE:

We still eat here pretty often and love our pizza pie cut. However it is few and far between that we are ever seeing a pizza that is pie cut coming from this kitchen. We were in the other day to sit down for lunch. We ordered from the server, she repeated the order back (said pie cut) and the pizza still came out wrong and no correction offered. Looks like we will be finding another pizza join in the future to value customer experience. For the prices we pay here we feel we should be getting what we order, not tiny squares of pizza that are difficult and messy to eat without a fork, knife, and TONS of napkins. YIKES, not sure where things went wrong."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place.  Love the thin crust.  The godfather is a must if you like spicy.  We keep coming back for more.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It's honestly pretty good! The portions are really big so you'll have leftovers! Very friendly staff. You can take it either to go or dine in. There's outdoor seating and indoor seating! There's also a bar by the same owner but you have to go next door to drink! 

Inside is really cute. The front has a board full of menu items where you can take things to go. The tables have the old fashioned red and white checkered table cloths which I think is really adorable. It's lovely that you're able to fill up your own soda but the servers do it for you anyway! I think that's very nice. This place is very clean as well.

I got the fried mushrooms to start it off. They were pretty good! I wish it came with something else besides marinara sauce though. Maybe ranch? I can see that working more. It's still a good portioning size though so you do get a lot! My boyfriend got the cheesy garlic bread was amazing as well. I loved it! Perfect amount of cheese on it. I got the ravioli with meat sauce. The meat sauce was pretty good, but a little chunkier than I'd prefer (and no it's not from the meat.) The actual ravioli's are so good though! They're big too so you have to cut each in half. The plate is so big. It comes in a bowl but the bowl is really deep. It's a bigger portion than I can handle, but I'm not going to complain when I can actually take some home! My man got the Chicken Parm. The chicken was perfect, sauce was really good, portion was huge as well, the thing was it was too cheesy... Now literally two reviews ago, I said that there was no such thing as cheese.. God proved me wrong. I love cheese but it was too much. He wasn't able to finish it because of how thick it made the plate. It was still delicious, don't get me wrong. But just too much cheese. My roommate has also mentioned that they put too much cheese on their pizza, but I'll leave that to me next time I come here! They open from 11 AM to 12 AM."}
{"text":"ordered for delivery deep dish pizza. it was lousy!! crust lousy.sausage and vegetables not much taste. sauce nothing to write home about.ate their year ago and it was terrible gave it another chance.we will never eat their again.at $35 for a pizza it should be great.we're from chicago and love their pizzas.this ain't one of them.aurelio's is the place for great chicago pizza not rosatis"}
{"text":"CRAP, CRAP, CRAP....This place is crap.

The food is sub par, the staff is incompitant,  and their booths blow donkeys for quarters.  First off being a dego I pronounce c's like g's when it comes to certain italian ingrediants, so when the pecker head, 4 eyed, pre pubecent manager continously trys to correct my pronunciation of the word riccota I just want to snatch that little bastard up and give him a swirly from hell.  Your level 53 troll shamen can't save you now punk.  The only pizza he should be tending to is the one on his face, here's some proactive now go back to band camp you tool.  Oh yeah and their cheap ass booths are the worst thing ever. You sit down and you can feel the person behind yous every move. God aweful."}
{"text":"Only reason I consider ordering from here is for the food. Always pick up. Never dine in. 

Tonight I walked in to pick up an order, and wasn't greeted. The young girls at the front counter were busy with their personal conversation. Told brunette that I was picking up and gave my name. She gave me my total, and as I held out my credit card, she blatantly ignored me. So there I am, arm stretched out, credit card in hand, waiting. She finally takes it, and I'm able to sign. She said it's going to be just a moment and that they're really backed up. Just as she's saying that, a male waiter throws a crumpled up receipt at her. It misses, comes over the counter, and lands at my feet. Unamused I continue to wait. I asked for an estimated time, and she says something about she can ask but isn't sure they can give her a time. 

So she goes in the back, doesn't ask any of the cooks about my food, but proceeds to talk about me with the male employee. \"Oh my god! Did you see her face?\" Mocking me.... that's definitely how business should be conducted. *note sarcasm* My food comes out moments later. She sets it on the counter and walks away... so is this my food? I take it, tell her to have a good night and leave. 

Come on guys! Get it together! No one wants to feel like that when they pick up food!"}
{"text":"All I can say is....this place officially sucks!!!!  We ordered spaghetti & a large antipasto salad.  The salad was absolutely disgusting!!!!  It was small....had a little bit of lunch meat on it, some grated cheese & SPOILED BLACK & GREEN OLIVES!  There were NO pepper's & No tomato!  The lettuce was wilted old bitter romaine with a tiny bit of ice burg.  AND the breadsticks....OMG....these things were like a rubber tire!  Burnt on top & clearly old & microwaved!  AND the spaghetti....well I prefer my noodles long....not broken into 2-3 inch pieces.  If I wanted goulash....I'd of went German!!!!  This place has gone DOWNHILL BIG TIME!!!!  Clearly management is poor....to say the least!!!  I'd love to see the Health Dept. come in this place!  They'd hit the jackpot with fines!!!  $37 later.....Never Again!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Rosati's in Vegas. Can never go wrong with their thin crust pizza, and their salads and wings are awesome too. Awesome service too. Only downside is that they don't have garlic parmesan wings like other locations."}
{"text":"We love your pizza it's such a treat. Always cooked up to perfection. The wings are very tasty medium is what we like. I think we go there twice a week. We even order for lunch."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give a 5 star review because the food is so good, but the staff, consistency and cleanliness has much to be desired.

First the staff.  I normally call in to do pickup orders, so when I come in the \"pick up side\" there is usually no one at the counter.  I think there is a door buzzer, but it's next to the door, not in the kitchen where everybody apparently is, so when I come in I usually just stand there until someone happens to wander up front.  What's worse is sometimes there a waitress walking back and forth from the dining room and she of course can see me at the counter because we make eye contact, but again, nothing.  I don't even think she mentioned I was out there. On another occasion I ordered a SMALL deep dish pizza and when I came to pick it up the girl at the counter pulled out a large pizza box.  I said \"I ordered a small\" she said \"this is how they come, the order is right.  Like a dummy I believed her because I didn't want to be rude and open it in front of her, not to mention if it was right she would probably have another remark for me.  So of course I got home and it was totally wrong, a large thin crust pizza. However the manager did call me back to warn me I left my pizza there. I left my pizza there?  You gave me the wrong one!  I hate checking the food before I leave.  I'm not sure why that is put on me, they should be getting the order correct.

Next is just a small complaint, but they advertise the Chicago Bears (being a Chicago based food establishment), they even hand out Bears refrigerator magnets with all the dates of the Bears games.  There was even a sign that advertised \"come watch the Bears games here\".  However when I came one Sunday, the girl in the dining room said \"we only get the televised games\".  What a disappointment. So I just went to a sports bar down the street that had the game televised. If you are going to broadcast the Chicago Bears and their games, maybe invest in a Sunday Ticket with Direct TV so the Bears fans have a place to go.

Consistency.  Not too big of a deal, but every-time I order the Italian Beef Sandwich, its random if I will get hot gardenia, on the sandwich or on the side. Or if I will get Aj Jus at all. Also it doesn't feel like the staff is well versed on Chicago foods like Italian beef, when I asked for it \"dipped\" I sometimes have to explain that is when you dipped the entire sandwich in the Aj Jus. This also worries me that they might not have the right utensils to properly \"dip\" a sandwich. Which leads me to the 3rd issue:

Cleanliness... There's no excuse for this, and I've had some pretty gross issues.  Again, back to the Italian Beef. I brought the food home and started eating the sandwich about halfway through I end up pulling a 12 inch piece of hair out of my mouth. Probably the grossest thing to ever happened to me food wise. That is until the NEXT weekend I thought I would give it another chance. Again I brought the food home and halfway through the sandwich I pull a strand of stainless steel wool cleaning pad from my mouth! Now we are not talking just gross human hair, but potentially dangerous foreign OBJECTS in the food. It's almost like the Aj Jus sauce bin is used as a trash can.  I have yet to try the beef sandwich again. The thought of what is going on back there to allow steel wool and human hair in beef broth is beyond gross.  My assumption is the staff doesn't care (which I mentioned before).  The must be no pride taken with cleanliness. 

Here is the actual sad part, the food is excellent tasting! Well, that is before the mental stigma of gross objects being in the food happens. It bothers me because the is the closest thing to \"Chicago food\" within a few miles of my house.  I'm not saying this to be mean to Rosati's, I really want them to address these issues so I can come back. I just think they need to get the staff involved or get a staff that cares. Other than that this place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"This is one of if, not the best pizza places in Las Vegas.  I'm a fan of the thin crust version and their sauce.  I ordered the Italian beef and hot giardinara pizza not normally something you'd get outside of Chicago.  It was very good and I'll be back."}
{"text":"As native Chicagoans , we have eaten at some of the rosatis in Illinois and know our Chicago style pizza. Tonight we were not disappointed. We had a large thin crust with sausage and mushrooms. It was ready in less time than they said (30mins on a Friday night- cant get that in Chicago ) and was cut just like in the Windy City . Crust was perfect and the pie had just the right amount of cheese and sauce. We also ordered some mushrooms which were just ok- over cooked a bit- but overall we were pleased. We just moved down the street from this location so we will be back. If you like Chicago style or were a bit homesick like us- this is the place!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here, but here's why only 2 stars. We have been going here for years, also having it delivered to our house for years. This past Monday we ordered a pizza for delivery, 25 minutes later they called us saying they no longer deliver to our area and we could pick up our pizza, ( it was ready) I told her we have been getting delivery for years, then I heard some man in the background saying, we don't go that far anymore. I told her forget it. The issue I have is this,  I should have been told they won't deliver when I ordered OR deliver this and let me know it's the last time due to distance. Don't call me when my pizza is done and tell me to come get it. I understand things change and had they explained that to me when we ordered I would have made arrangements for pick up. Extremely bad service in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ordered deep dish, thin pizza and hot wings and they are all delicious. First time trying this pizza place and the family likes it a lot."}
{"text":"Sad that Rosati
s is a B rating,  Terrible music choice, too loud !  The carpet looked like it hadn't been swept in a very long time.  There was food debris all over it.  A few of the tables appeared to have been cleared off, but not washed.  On the bright side, the pizza is still soooo good. Our server was very good as well.  I just can't get past the B rating, the dirty carpet and the horrible loud music.  Guess we will have to find another Rosati's."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! I make sure to come here every time I'm in Vegas. The Chicago style pizza is bomb AF"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the phone lady is nice great service in that aspect. The pizza just was not good today. We have had it here before we wanted traditional crust we actually got thick crust, which I cannot stand! Reminds me off papa johns! Had no  flavor the pizza at all! The thinner crust which I thought was traditional because she explained over the phone has always been good and the pizza was pretty good to me in the past! We also ordered chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks forgot the Mariana sauce and fingers were over cooked. But not too bad. I was the most annoyed with the antipasto salad, horrible! Never had one that had pieces of parmesan cheese and the other cheese was the same cheese they top the pizza with. No rolled up meat and cheese just horrible pepperoni and maybe the smallest amount of ham you can imagine. I took a picture below I ate from it but I did not eat any ham or pepperoni being that I don't even like the two, the ham isn't the kind I prefer! No roasted red peppers either instead green bell peppers and spinach! Such a waste of 10$ and cold bland pizza. Still hungry!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a few different people and finally decided to give it a shot. The young lady who answered my phone call was very helpful and pleasant to talk to and when I arrived the food was hot and ready to go. The pizza was up there with some of the best I've ever had! Overall an excellent experience. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The worst pizza place I have ever come across.   This specific Arrowhead location delivered our family soggy pizza and when the driver called his store manager Scott to tell him that the pizza was in fact soggy the manager refused to deliver a new pizza and instead we had to call back and request that someone please puck up the pizza and refund our credit card the manager Scott left us on hold for 12 minutes before he would answer the phone and then he became very rude and told us that he would deliver us an new pizza but to just \"chew on it\" until we get the new pizza.   As a rule I don't return food and after that ordeal I asked the manager to  just to pick up his pizza and refund our card the manager became irrate and told me that there were parts of this pizza that we could eat.  After my husband heard the way this person spoke to me he took the pizza back to the restaurant and demanded our money back.  While my husband was there he over heard three more upset customers demanding their money back as well and Scott the manager trying to give them free pizza instead.  Scott agreed to credit our card back, but never did and gave my husband a free pizza of which he did not order.   I will never return to this location again and would highly recommend that the store owners reconsider who they put in charge of their business..."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Deep dish pizza is to die for. Sad thing is I'm technically too far for delivery which is up horizon on racetrack but I'd drive for this pizza. It's great!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! We ordered wings and two pizzas on Sunday and ended up with FOOD POISONING for 2 days, thanks for the tainted food! Will never come here again!!!"}
{"text":"How have I not posted a review yet??? I've been ordering takeout from this location for years now. The same woman takes my order every-time and she is always super polite. She always knows exactly how I like my special ordered salad. I feel like a jerk because she knows my name and I don't know hers. The receipt says Zulema. Anyhow tonight I ordered takeout again and everything was amazing. Thank you for always taking care of me so well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Omg love this place. Try to go every week.  Love their pizza and fried pickles. Lol. Live the staff, always great!"}
{"text":"Food is sub par. Bar service is slow and genuinely rude.  Waitresses depending on who you get is fair. Pizza is ok but if you want quality go to Streets of NY.  You'll pay more but the food is better!"}
{"text":"I had Rosati's once about 2 years ago when I lived in a different area of town. Honestly, I wasn't overly impressed. I was going to wait to try it a second time before reviewing it, but that just never happened. 

Well, since moving to a different neighborhood, I noticed there was a Rosati's less than a mile from where I type this. It took a minute, but tonight I finally got to give them a second chance.

    ....and I am really glad I did!

Located on the northeast corner of Windmill and Rainbow, you will spot Rosati's Pizza Pub in the Smith's shopping center. It is much easier to find off of Windmill Road just east of the Smith's gas station.

I haven't had a chance to enjoy the actual pub its self since we just grabbed our pie to go tonight. That will just have to wait for an updated review.  

That pie however was tasty as hell! Two things that stood out for me were the crust and the sauce. The crust wasn't too thin (which I can't stand) or too doughy  but nice and crispy! Just right! The sauce was lightly seasoned and had a unique taste in it's own right. 

The employees were all very friendly and engaging and were fun to chat with as well. Definitely no complaints as far as service goes!

The only reasons I can't give it 5 stars is...

- it is a bit on the pricey side. $20 for a pizza isn't the most I've paid for a pie but it certainly isn't the cheapest either! Sometimes you have to pay for quality I guess..

- I am not a big fan of the square slices. Not a huge deal but I definitely prefer the traditional slices..

I live so close to Rosati's and love the taste of their pizza so it is almost a guaranteed certainty I'll be back. After all I still have to try their garlic knots, wings, and have a brew in their Pub! 

4 stars."}
{"text":"Had a fundraiser for my nieces baseball team I thought take a long time to get our food since it was packed but no less then 10 minutes . Awesome place"}
{"text":"Would never ever go back ... the rude ass bartender with the blonde long hair was to busy socializing then tending to playing and eating customers.. $80 in machine and still charged for a domestic beer !! Unbelievable 
The wings sucked !! Horrible !!! 
Oh did I mention the bartender spraying perfume on herself behind the bar.. 
Would of been 0 stars if I was allowed !!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened to this restaurant... 
The food used to be better the service was amazing but now they put you on hold for five minutes minimum the ranch is watered down the service is horrible I'm very disappointed I  used to love this place.
No more. Will not order from them again ever. The owner has his head in the clouds and has no idea what's going on with his employees. I've heard of the service going down but today I am done."}
{"text":"I found Rosati's on GrubHub when I was trying to find something other than Chinese food. I found this place and decided to order from here. I got the baked Mostaccioli, fried mushrooms, and a cannoli. It came to me pretty quickly (I ordered delivery).

The Mostaccioli was super delicious and there was so much of it! I was able to have some for lunch the next day. The fried mushrooms were so good! The were huge and there wasn't an overkill of the breading. The cannoli was okay but it could have been better.

I would probably order from here again because the food was pretty delicious. I wouldn't mind actually going to the restaurant and trying more of their food there."}
{"text":"There is only 2 places that deliver to my house and this is one of them so I used them often. Staff is always super friendly and great. I usually order the chicken Alfredo and depending on the day and who is making it. It can be a 10 or a 3."}
{"text":"I've had a big challenge finding pizza in Vegas worth coming back to, until I came to Rosati's.  The style is Chicago deep dish and they do a pretty good job of replicating it.  My friend and I split a large for about $18 and we had plenty of left overs for the next day.

The cool thing here is the dining area having self-service drinks so you never go thirsty.  As with any normal Chicago style place, the pizza takes a long time to cook, but it is well worth the wait.  A normal person will be full after one or two slices, but it was so good I had about 4 or 5... Whoops!"}
{"text":"Health Dept downgraded to B grade.
Thin crust Italian sausage pizza was lacking everything! Sausage, cheese etc.
This place used to be very good.
So disappointed.
We visit from out of state."}
{"text":"The dough nuggets come with such a large portion that I almost got full off of them, but they are sooooo good! And honestly, the dough nuggets were probably the show stealer. The pizza just wasn't our cup of tea. My friend was craving pizza so we decided on the closest place to where I live, and it was a let down. We ordered a thin crust, 12in pizza with mushrooms, olives, banana peppers, and spinach. It was such an okay pizza. Maybe I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"They took away their coupon deals and give you smaller pizzas for a higher price. Been coming to Rosati's for years and feel like their quality has greatly depreciated and they still hound you at the counter for a tip. I ordered a large pizza, chicken fingers and french fries which came out to be $40, which I got for $35 for having their coupon and when I got home and ate a chicken finger, they tasted like DAWN SOAP! I called and got my chicken fingers replaced but they still taste like crap! Will not be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"I'm from New England. My dad was a pizza maker for 17 years. I make my own dough and prefer thin New York style pizza. 

If all Rosati's made was deep dish Chicago Style pizza, I would give it 5 stars, and I don't usually give anyone 5 stars. The reason is because people on yelp 5 star places all the time, and you get ratings that are not accurate.

I love the deep dish. The pastry like crust,  savory sauce, high quality cheese and toppings are what I call lasagna on bread. It's a beautiful product and what I think is worthy of being with the top pizza's I've ever tried. 

So why the 3 stars? 

I have tried the double dough and the thin and crispy and they are not even in the same league as a wal-mart or sam's club take and bake pizza. 

SO DISSAPOINTING! 

I ordered a veggie doubledough on one occasion and it was tasteless, soft and watery from all the veggies. I don't remember what I paid because I also had a deep dish with it and that made me forget all about the money I wasted on the DD.

Whats with the square cut on a round pizza? Can someone comment as to why they would cut a pizza that way? You get all these weird pieces that don't have any toppings on them. Weird......

Today I ordered their monster pizza thin and crispy XL size (18'') I asked for the wedge cut because the square cut really annoyed me, and took away from the quality of the product. This is like a supreme pizza with meat and veggies.

It looked good, but that's as far as it went. I ate one piece and was so disappointed I threw it away. The crust wasn't bad. crispy yes, but not enough salt in the dough. Kind of like a breadstick. 

It had evidence of cornmeal which is a requirement for that style pizza. 

Thin watery tart sauce, I could not taste one topping from the other. it was literally tasteless. 

The sad part about this is I paid about $33 for this failure.

I have no problem paying 40 bucks for their large deep dish because it has proven itself every time I've ordered it. 

I have also tried the lasagna and their antipasti salad both of which were not really anything worth trying again. 

All in all I love Rosati's deep dish pizza, Please try it with your favorite bottle of wine and let the euphoria take over."}
{"text":"This place is the best pizza in Vegas!! I've never been to Chicago but I've been told the pizza is amazing and this is just like it!! I would recommend this place to anyone that's looking for a good pizza!"}

{"text":"I love every Rosati's location with the exception of this location. We just received our pizza and when we got home discovered that it was made improperly. My husband, who is very patient called and attempted to explain. The person that took his order proceeded to argue and raise his voice with him and basically say that it was our fault. Now I don't have any dinner to eat because there is pepperoni on our entire pizza and I don't eat pork. Terrible customer service, especially before the holidays. The pizza isn't worth the disrespect."}
{"text":"Ordered deep dish/Chicago style pizza - nothing but bread. This place is a waste of money. Only thing they got right was that delivery would take an hour.  Go or order from somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Their deep dish is DEEP. I love it. My family loves the thin crust. We've been ordering from then since they opened shop and have never messed up an order. Thanks guys and gals."}
{"text":"Double dough it delicious & so is the Chicago style! Best Pizza I've found in Nevada since I was in CHI Town. Go get yo grub on, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Went in the first week and ordered a cal zone. The dough was not cooked all the way and the beer taps were inop. I have stayed away from this place until my cousing ordered delivery. Thin crust pizza and extra crispy well done wings! Holy ass I dont think ive ever had better wings ANYWHERE else. The thin crust was the best i ever tried. Whether it was the cheese, sauce, or maybe even the hint of oregano but i could be wrong. The combination of the two had me sprung as soon as my teeth sunk in. Afraid of the deep dish since my first experience with thick layers of dough had me almost never coming back. The thin crust and well done wings will has me hooked though."}
{"text":"The Chicago deep dish pizza was good and maybe the only thing I liked. I got it with pepperoni. The spaghetti wasn't very good. It was very watery and a little sour. I really like the hot sauce that they make for their wings but I was quite peeved that for an order of 24 hot wings only 2 were drumettes. I was also sad that the tiramisu on the Photos page was misleading. What you actually get is a pre-packaged slice from Eli's. The only good part about it was the marscopone cheese. The rest of the tiramisu was very dry and crumbly, and it also comes frozen."}
{"text":"The chicago pizza was amazing missing a little filling compared to the pie in actual Chicago but still was a great piece. We also hot the fried pickles and bruschetta which were also very good. Over all definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Decided to start scouting out good pizza joints in the area since I can't always drive downtown to our favorite place, and I am happy to say I found one! Grabbed 2 slices to go yesterday after grocery shopping and it was super good! Good ratio of crust,sauce,and cheese. I took it to go, but loved the dark old school vibe in there, I can see my husband and I having a beer and pie there on a sunday. Good job to this place, and super friendly hostess/cashier, she was a sweetie."}
{"text":"Since moving to Glendale I have rarely encountered rude business owners, especially during economic downtimes. Apparently the owner (or at least who I'm guessing is the owner) of this establishment (stocky bald guy) doesn't care about his customers. We came in with some local med students, and being students we asked for the cashier to split up the bill. He came over apparently upset and made a snide comment. The pizza wasn't even close to Chicago style deep dish, but whatever enjoyment the food might have offered was soured by the poor management. Definitely do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I wanna start off by saying I live about 1 block away from the losee location. That being said, after all the bad reviews from recent customers it turned me off. So I decided to try this location. And let me tell u, it won't disappoint. The girls at the front were friendly and the service was fairly good. I didn't sit down, my order was to go. Pizza was great and now my new go to place if I'm craving good pizza. Cheese on pizza was great, dough used had good flavor and sauce was tasty. I would recommend this location to anyone. Pizza is to die for in my opinion."}
{"text":"Really underwhelming. Dined in and server seemed irritated we didn't know what we wanted as soon as we sat down. Ordered pepperoni deep dish. Pizza was honestly fantastic. Great ingredients, generous potions...until we found a giant hair in the middle of a slice. Figured it wasn't worth bringing up the hair after we watched our server refill my water glass with the contents of another previously used glass from the bar. Needless to say, likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Way too much bread in deep dish pizza!! I ordered a mushroom and garlic deep dish and the thing was huge and heavy. Took the first slice out and was very disappointed. I was expecting tons of cheese and mushrooms, all I got was bread. Couldn't even taste the garlic and the mushrooms were obsolete. Very few! Sauced smothered all over the top. It wasn't even hot. Had to heat in oven to crisp up bottom a little and make the tiny amount of cheese gooey. 
For $25 (we picked it up) I'd think it would have been loaded like other deep dishes I've had. 
The online menu said the large was 16.99. It was 18.95. Never again will I order from here. Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese double dough pizza, and a pepperoni pizza and I was super disappointed to say the pizza was not that good. The pizza really didn't have much flavor at all and for the price expected a lot more. We also ordered a desserts that was described as a turtle cookie brownie. So in my mind it was a brownie. Nope it was a slice of cheesecake that was incredibly small and cost $7.95, that I took two bites of because I didn't like it, So that was my next disappointment. Needless to say I won't be going back.  All in all the meal cost $45 before tip and was not worth the calories."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from here. First time they didn't give me my whole order and I was the problem... And I didn't get my whole order. This time my pizza was cut into squares.. Why? I ordered two pizzas. One is cut correctly. The other... I'm done."}
{"text":"I'm from California on way to hooverdam so we tried rosatis pizza and the pizza was the nastiest pizza on earth, the pizza was burned and too overpriced we got 3 boxes of pizza ate a quarter of it . Pls don't ever go here waste of money and waste of time !"}
{"text":"Been a consistent customer for over 4 years and finally had enough. The prices are getting higher but the quality has been lower. The prices on the web menu and hard copy menu don't match. When I question why the price is over $10 more than what I see on the menu, I'm always getting \"we've updated.\" Although I have an updated menu!!! Customer service is also low. Who wants to pay $27 for a sandwich and 12 wings??? When I asked the server on the phone about it and cancelled my order, she was like \"whatever.\" Rosati's you just lost a faithful customer of 4 years+!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I usually get the white pizza and it is so delicious.  The staff is always nice!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to be impressed over . Ordered a Hawaiian panned pizza tasted like garbage . The sauce was not marinara ! Won't be ordering again waste of money! Called and lady calls me sweetly telling me all these sauce is out of a can ! Yucky"}
{"text":"I enjoyer both their Chicago style and their thin... Sauce is just the right spices.. Good stuff"}
{"text":"We drove to this restaurant thinking it was a sitdown type... it's not, But that cannot stop us from putting our order and we got one order of the calzone, and one order of the lasagna. Both were delicious and we will definitely come back here again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great little place right down the street.  Wings, subs and pasta are great! Beer prices are a little steep but doable. Pizza is something I would actually skip... stick with the wings and subs!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice, and both times I ordered the 18\" Rosati's Monster with Deep Dish crust as carryout.  This pizza is so good!!!  The pizza is so humongous that I can only eat 1 slice.  Your pie is piled high with sausage, pepperoni, bacon, ground beef, mushroom, onion, green pepper, green and black olives.  I swear, eating 1 slice of this pizza is comparable to having half a large pizza at one of your big box pizza chains.  And this tastes much better!! 

As you eat your slice, toppings are piled so high that they will eventually fall off.  But there is so much that you won't even miss them.  Half of your pizza toppings could fall off and you wouldn't miss a beat.  There is just that much topping!!!  I do, however, recommend using a fork and knife.  It is much too daunting of a task to grab and eat a slice by hand.  

The dough is thick with a nice chew to it.  The bottom and crust is nice and crispy.  I find myself ripping off the crust and loading it with my \"man overboard\" toppings.  No topping left behind is what I say.  

You can debate over what is and isn't an authentic Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is.  What I can tell you without a doubt is this.  The Deep Dish from Rosati's is truly a deep dish pizza.  Toppings are piled high, the 18\" Monster has to be over 10lbs.  First thing you'll say when you lift the box is, whoa this is heavy!!  And above all, this is a supremely delicious pizza that you will thoroughly enjoy."}
{"text":"OMG the phone lady is rude... I have food allergies and needed to make sure what I was ordering did not contain nuts. She informed me that they were very busy because of the hockey game and then said \"HOLD\" and hung up on me. I called back and she said she doesnt have time to go over the entire menu with me and for me to call back when I knew what I wanted, then she hung up on me again. Grimaldis was more than accommodating."}
{"text":"I am a firm believer in customer service and my most recent experience at this particular Rosati's was the epitome of disrespectful.  I called to place an order for pick up  the person that answered seemed to be very bothered with me adding additional ingredients to a quarter of the pizza.  After he repeated the order I asked him if he could please add jalapeños. He yelled No I can't and hung up the phone.  After a few minutes I called back and requested the manager only to find out that the person on the phone was the owner. I'll never spend my money at a place that treats their customers that way."}
{"text":"Being from the Chicago suburbs I had pretty much given up on finding good pizza in Vegas. Rosatti's changed that. We have ordered from them 3 times now and have not been disappointed. We tried the deep dish and it's very good, crust not quite as buttery and flaky like back home but a solid effort. The Italian beef sandwich is very tasty too, love the hot giardinara on it. The au jus is a tad too salty for me but this sandwich satisfies my beef cravings quite nicely. My favorite is the thin crust. Tasted just like what we used to eat back home. Crispy, cut into squares. Like a thin crust should be and slathered with an amazing tomato and topped with the freshest. Toppings and gooey cheese. Was pleased to see they use real Italian sausage and not pork breakfasty tasting stuff other pizza joints try to pass off as sausage. 

Rosatti's has made me a believer and I have them on speed dial. :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the monster, deep dish pizza. It was great! I'm from Chicago so I know great pizza when I taste it.  A little more sauce would have made it even better. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"If you're from Vegas, you know there are run-of-the mill pizza places on practically every corner and most of them are of similar quality: filling, but boring.  But there are a few in town that are upper echelon establishments.  Grimaldi's and Metro come to mind, and there are others like Sammy's that specialize  in woodfired pizzas... But Rosati's is just an incredible, real deal pizza shop that has a great traditional feel!  You get checkered table cloths, pitchers of draft beer, and amazingly qood quality ingredients at reasonable prices.  Yes, the Chicago deep dish is delicious, but they offer different crusts as well.  Their cheesy garlic bread is served oven hot and out of this world, as are their chicken wings - maybe the best buffalo sauce in town!  The owners obviously know that a good dining experience requires proper attention to detail as the food is served hot, fresh and flavorful.  I will be back again and again as long as this continues!"}
{"text":"It has good Pizza, my family and I have never been disappointed. The calzone is great, and the Antipasto salad never fails us! The taste is not of your average Dominoes, or Pizza hut, it has a special Chicago flavor, yum! 
I recommend it!"}
{"text":"all I am going to say is....

GO CHICAGO STYLE OR GO HOME! 

Their meat mania Chicago style is LIFE."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The wait is a little long for delivery sometimes but it is worth the wait.  The thin crust and Chicago Deep dish are both outstanding."}
{"text":"Order large pizza and wings for pickup. Pizza flavor is great. Rich in flavor, lack in ingredients. As you can see in the receipt. It says it's supposed to come with pepperoni. My pizza had no pepperoni. Possible mix up. But regardless. No what I ordered."}
{"text":"I am heart-broken to write this review, because we used to love ordering their pizza for delivery. However, I just called for delivery (which I have done at least 10 times before, they have our information saved in their system) and suddenly it is too far for them to deliver. I told them I just got in a car accident and my car was totaled so I can't do pick-up and they did not care. Good pizza, absolutely abysmal customer service. Will NEVER order again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty.  I've only tried Deep Dish pizza and chicken wings.

The deep dish is heavy and satisfying, and yes the crust is good, even though personally I still love Giordano's in Chicago, IL.  I remember their crust being a little flakier, almost like a crispier, buttery flaky biscuit.  

Rosati's has pretty good crust, toppings and pizza sauce.  We like the Honey BBQ chicken wings, they are large wings and usually there is plenty of sauce. One time we did order it and it seemed there wasn't enough sauce and it wasn't as good, but 3 out of 4 times they were delicious. I especially liked their ranch sauce."}
{"text":"I love Rosatis. Their pizza is delicious and whatever they put in their cheese makes it incredible. Also their wings are delicious. Can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"It was very good!
We started with the garlic bread tomato and spinach appetizer....DELISH!
I had the fantastic four minus the mushroom (I'm allergic) but added pepperoni...it was great....a little spice to it!
Only complaint was I asked for Pan and they made it on thin (I'm not a thin crust fan...tastes too much like a cracker. ...they offered to fix it but I was super hungry so I ate it anyway...it was good but I know on pan or deep dish it would be better.
Hubby had cheese ravioli and a side salad and he said both were great....the side salad add on was 2.00 but was very large!
We will be back...and they deliver.....score for us!"}
{"text":"Should have called pizza hut or gotten a frozen pizza. The pizza's the same but without the high price and they've got a pickup system in place that can handle a few orders. After ordering online, going to pick it up after 25 minutes and waiting another 30 minutes because it was only going to take '10 more minutes' each time I checked on the order... Needless to say, we were sent away with the soggy cheese sticks, a 2 liter of coke and 10 bucks. With a promise for the pizza to be delivered in 20 minutes. #wewillsee  #notafan #70dollarorder #eatingleftoverswhilewaiting"}
{"text":"I'm a pizza freak and order it all the time from all over my area. I have ordered here over a dozen times. I definitely prefer Rosati's to any of the major pizza chains. When I have the extra money I order from here."}
{"text":"This has been my third time here and I've been pleased with my meals every time. I'm always happy with the amount of sauce they put on the wings, and their pizzas are to die for. I haven't gotten to try their deep dish yet; on my to-do. 

Prices are a bit on the upper end, although for the size and quality of you meal, I say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Here's my bullet point so I don't waste anymore time with this place....
-Waited two hours for our pizza never to be delivered
-So... Finally my husband went in to pick one up, and he was accused of lying about not receiving the delivery from Eric
- Eric went on to call my husband whom wears glasses four eyes, he called him four eyes twice
- Eric delivered our pizza to another house who signed the receipt with a different surname
-Eric can't read because it was not our surname
-Eric got a tip from our credit card that we did not consent
-There was no management to deal with this situation, instead the whole employee staff ganged up on my husband accusing him of lying and making our family feel very exposed and unsafe with credit card information and our address at  the hand of strangers and thieves

Sadly we gave Rosati's a lot business for 2 years, but I guess they don't mind losing it:)

I'm updating my review an hour later.... The food poisoned us! Yep, throw up

And, within an hour (3 hours after originally ordering it) we were throwing up.... Wonder what they did to it

I'm updating a week later... So, the owner of Rosati's never contacted us to apologize or refund us. I spoke with the headquarters who can only do so much, as this is a franchise, they reassured us we would be safe by deleting our information from the Rosati's computer, banning us... Lol. 

... They were putting too much cheese on their pizzas anyways.... Trying to mask the bad everything else

I'd advise anyone reading this, Streets of New York is better pizza anyways!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and love the staff they're all so nice. And the food is always delicious :) I had my first Chicago style pizza and first cannoli from them and I loved it ! 

Big shoutout to Dan and Nick for being awesome and super friendly whenever I see them xD"}
{"text":"A quality pizza for sure and I really like most of it.
Seems their normal pizza is the very thin type and I know it has it's following, but we don't always like it like that. You can also order it as \"double dough\" which is much better, but it also costs you more of your hard earned cash \"dough\". I don't know why, but sometimes they cut their pizza like they are mad at you. The slices are chopped up into little chips and not the traditional triangles like most pizzas are often served. They also have a term that they use to load up the toppings, but once I ordered it that way and got the same amount of toppings as a normal order? I guess they are in a different league as far as the way pizza should be served? but I can't figure it out. Overall a great pizza if you don't mind some unusual presentation, and paying a little bit more too."}
{"text":"Rosati's is money.

Came here the other day to watch a World Cup game with some friends and I really dug this cozy little Chicago-style pizza joint. When I had walked in the place was jam packed and I headed to the bar area to meet some friends. Several large flat screens could be seen adorning the bar and several smaller ones hung in plain view of the bar tables against the far wall. Music-wise I noticed they had a Touch-Tunes system and it was playing at a moderate level. The bar was also equipped with the usual gambling machines. The bartender was extraordinarily slammed with the amount of tables she was having to take care of, so when she was finally able to take my order I made sure I was ready. I also asked her if she could put the sound of the soccer match on and she complied.

I had myself a couple $2.95 Miller Lites and saw they also had Amber Alaskan Ale on tap for $3.95. I splurged and ordered the Alaskan the rest of my time at the bar. The draft beers are all served inside a frozen mug, which to my understanding makes it a tad more difficult to taste the beer, but it was over 100 degrees and humid that day so I was all over those frozen mugs!

Our group ordered some food items at halftime which included a side of fries, HOT chicken tenders with ranch, mild wings, side garden salad, and a large deep-dish Chicago styled pizza with the works for toppings. The fries were crinkle-cut and at the bar they had your choice of regular ketchup or 'ketchupeño' which was simply a little spicier version of ketchup that had an enjoyable hint of jalapeño flavor. The HOT chicken tenders were exactly that, HOT! These little babies were smoking! The ranch dressing helped bate the heat slightly, but I was very surprised by the heat despite the warning from our bartender. Many times when I try something this hot I am not a big fan of the flavor, but these tenders were deliciously spicy. The pizza was tasty, big, doughy, and met all my expectations of what a good Chicago style pizza should be.

All in all, our visit was an enjoyable experience! I felt bad for the bartender as the place was clearly understaffed, but she had mentioned that an employee had called out sick that day. If she wasn't such a rock-star at her job, our experience would have went south real fast. Hats off to great customer service!"}
{"text":"To me the pizza and service has fallen off a lot since they opened... haven't really been back in years. Used to love the pizza and sandwiches, but other competition started beating them out to me And this place fell off. I still love the wing deal they do on Tuesday's for $.50, but other than that I have no reason to go there."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town...the crust, the cheese and toppings I order are of great quality. I am a frequent visitor...being from Chicago I have finally found satisfaction...plus they are very friendly too. It's worth the 15min drive..."}
{"text":"Came here because of reviews, gave it a try and won't be back.   Overpriced side salad was lacking;  crust was tough,  pizza was so-so, and waitress was below par.  When asked if everything was OK,  we answered negatively and she just smiled and said \"ok.\"  Pizza gets points for being hot though.  There are too many other good options in Vegas to settle for a repeat trip."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!! We get the meat lovers pizza which feeds 4 adults with ease on a regular basis.  The only negative is the sausage sometimes gets a little over cooked.  It cost more then the chain pizza places but a Mercedes is more then a  ford!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh. I have to give them a great rating. Exhibit A: they have a great product that is worthy of the Chicago name, I am from there and unfortunately I have not seen any claim as legit as Rosati's. Exhibit B: on a Saturday night, prime time they delivered in under the projected time frame! Unusual. The mozzarella sticks were omg...on point for chi. The pizza... very well done especially for delivery. Give them a shot...I am on board!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorites here are the thin crust pizza, Greek salad and garlic cheese bread. The pizza toppings are always plentiful."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pizza. I get the deep dish and it's so yummy. The crust is thick and tassssssty! They put an generous amount of cheese on the pizza so you've got some to put on the crust too! I've had the onion rings too and they are real good. Even delivered they were good. Service is always good too. It's cool if you eat there because they send you 2 doors down to Zaxby's, where they have leather couches. It's nice and relaxed. I also like the unsweetened ice tea at Zaxby's. I tried the Hulaipai location and their pizza was GROSS. This place is super far from me now, but it's worth the trip every so often."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE! Ordered a pizza and was told 45 minutes then 2 hours later it showed up cold. Called location and Manager owner Ken was so mad I asked for a refund I was told to never call again as they don't want to business with me anymore. Department of health has been notified that they send out cold unhealthy pizza. The franchise will also be notified of the failures of Ken and his staff"}
{"text":"I love rosati's pasta. The chicken fettuccine Alfredo is great and my husband loves the pizza.  Will keep ordering from here for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Called for carry out, lady said they don't have mostaccioli? All the signs say otherwise. Ok whatever, then go & pick up 40$ of food. Women ( sarcasm) had no customer service skills, never said anything ie thank you or sorry we offer so little but our menu clearly states we have backed mostaccioli? Last time I ever spend $ there! If these snobby asshats can't handle ? Stay home & play on your phone."}
{"text":"5 Star pizza in the Vegas Valley. Rosati's is a real treat for anyone looking for the right combination of crust and fresh ingredients. Rosati's is considered one of the best pizzas in town, but it comes with a relatively high price point. In our view it's worth every penny. More importantly, Rosati's gives you a unique pizza experience, unlike most of their competitors. There is having a pizza, and then there are a few unique pizza experiences - Rosati's is one of them and you need to try it to understand what we mean."}
{"text":"Management and Customer Service Both Responded to my questions about ingredients in a timely manner. They were very prompt and informative"}
{"text":"I tried the thin crust pizza (not a fan of thick, Chicago style) and it was pretty good but I wouldn't rush back to order it again. Service was good and it's in a good location. Maybe next time I'll order their specialty and see how that is."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza here! Specifically the double dough and canzone. The price is kinda high so only get it here and there but taste amazing. My husband loves the wings"}
{"text":"The waiter threatened to slap my friend, I had to fill up my own drink, the server Janet I didn't have her but love her!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly!!! Consistent food great dine in area and never any issues. They always have specials and awesome dining area setup.the owner is very friendly and nice and totally worth going and eating inside"}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff is awesome, except for the manager (Ken). When I placed an order on .60 wing night and this guy tells me he will no longer sale me wings unless I order something else and went on about his right to refuse service to anyone. There is no sign that mentions the requirement to order more food. Ken was acting like a complete ass hole in my opinion. Needless to say I will NEVER go back to this Rosati's again...."}
{"text":"So it's only my second stop on my quest for the best Chicago deep dish in Vegas and I think I'm ready to call it. 

Don't worry though, I'm gonna keep on looking because I love pizza and trying new places and writing about them.

Back to Rosatis...

This place is decorated very nice inside, really clean design with a brick wall for the bar. It's very well maintained and when we visited, it was pretty immaculate inside, with a very inviting fresh pizza smell.

There's plenty of comfortable seating, booths and high tables. It's not too tight in there at all, lots of room to get around, even when it's busy.  There's several TV screens, even a projector on the back wall. The game day deals make it an ideal place to watch sports if that's your thing.

I wasn't impressed with the beer selection. They had the usual suspects, along with blue moon and Stella. Kind of a disappointing selection, but that's okay.

We decided to order a few appetizers even though we knew we'd have plenty of pizza.  We got the cheese fries, and despite them being just boxed crinkle-cut fries covered in mozzarella, we rather enjoyed them.

We took the advice of so many Yelpers and got the garlic knots as well. These were an interesting and delicious take on the common breadstick. Warm, fluffy, covered lightly with butter and fresh minced garlic. With a side of marinara and ranch these apps went down easy.

We got the extra large Chicago style pepperoni deep dish pizza, thinking we'd have it again later in the week.  What a mistake. The pizza was beyond massive. My wife and my sister-in-law barely ate one slice. I'm a pretty big guy, and I eat a lot bigger than I seem like I would, but I struggled to get through my second slice. At the time of this review, there are still two King Kong slices in my fridge.

Not because the pizza wasn't delicious, it was.  It was served screaming hot, with plenty of bubbly mozzarella and pepperoni. When you remove a slice, the pan is bathed in melted cheese, which is always a sign of things being done right somewhere along the line. Rosatis strikes an awesome balance of thickness and toppings. There's a ton of toppings but they hold back just shy of making you feel like a jerk for finishing a whole slice, and I appreciate that. There's lots of cheese, but not so much that you question what you're doing with your life by eating there. The crust is deep, but not too thick. There's a certain thickness that lets you know you're dealing with a serious slice, but you know you're not getting a giant bready brick beneath your glorious toppings. There's a science to figuring out the proper ratio of crust to toppings in deep dish pizza-making, and I believe Rosatis has mastered it.

The crust itself is wonderfully flaky, not too hard, not too thick. Has a subtle buttery taste but it's not overpowering like other places I've tried in town, and I can tell the guys in the back know just when to take the pie out of the oven because it was perfect and golden all the way around.

There's a huge menu at this place: other styles of pizza, calzones, sandwiches. If I can somehow not order Chicago pizza when I come here, I think I'd definitely like to explore what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"The pizza is a slight better than Pizza Hut, but more expensive. The double dough is more like thin crust, don't get it, it sucks!!!!! My advice go somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to this area, and decided to give them a try. We ordered a medium Meat Mania, adding mushrooms, with double dough, a small xtra cheese, xtra sauce double dough, an order of chicken strips, and an order of fries. The pizza was tasty, but will try regular dough option next time. A little too doughy (it was double dough after all) for me. My son told me the chicken was really good, but fries were lacking in flavor. The fries were hot, and not soggy though. The total for all of the above was $51.00, and hubby picked up. I think they should include fries with the chicken, but the side was a very good size. The girl who took our order was friendly and knowledgeable. We would have their food again."}
{"text":"I love love love their Meatball Parm sandwich! I could describe this sandwich as the sexiest thing I've put in my mouth in a while! 
The bread was so crispy and delicious, the cheese and meatballs went together like PB and J or Ross and Rachel! It was filling and the texture was so satisfying. It satisfied every single one of my senses! 
Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Rosati's is supposed to be an authentic Italian place. But when Little Caesars taste better than this place, you know there's a problem. Not only was the food bad, but the service was even worse. I've had better service at McDonalds. My family and I waited for 20 minutes before even getting our order taken and an hour total waiting for food when we were the only ones there. No communication as to why there was a hold up. No one checked on us to see if we were okay. Honestly doubt they'd even notice if we walked out without paying. I'm a huge food guru and I know good food when I taste it. And if anyone asks me what I think of this place, I'd tell them I'd rather get a $5 hot new ready from little caesars. The pizza was terrible quality with burnt crust and bland taste. Overall, do not go. Wish I didn't even have to give them one star."}
{"text":"oh man this is great..got a thin crust sausage  pepperoni  and mushroom  pizza I will drive across town for this one AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"We have been at this location many times and never a bad experience.  The staff is always friendly and helpful. We always sit on the bar side so I can't speak for the dining room side.  Guessing it would be no difference.  Lots of TV's to choose from.in the bar.

We only order the thin crust.  I'm a huge fan of deep dish but since we enjoy the thin so much I don't want to be disappointed. Normally order one of the bigger combo's.  They use corn meal so the pizza's don't stick in the oven.  I like the taste personally but I could see how others do not.  It's priced much like other places like Metro, Grimaldi's etc.  

To me it feels like a nice neighborhood place that serves decent pizza and good cold beer.  What more can you ask for? :)"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the Chicago pizza that everyone keeps raving about, but I did stop here on a motorcycle ride. Their small size NY-style pizza is actually plenty for two if you don't want any leftovers. I definitely enjoyed the pizza, and I'm not even sure we were charged for soda. The waitress just gave us cups and pointed us toward the Pepsi dispenser lol.

Oh, and it was tough knowing whether they were open or closed. No cars in the parking lot, and most of the people were next door. I probably wouldn't have even approached the front door had I not asked the people outside if the restaurant was open."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago but moved to Henderson NV 25 years ago. I have been in search of a good pizza here. Rosatis has as close to home as I have had. Oh and their beef sandwich is pretty close too.  The only thing that is missing is a sit down restaurant. But still, it's my go to for that close to Chi Town Home as I can CJ d out here."}
{"text":"We have been faithful to Rosati's for sometime now and the last 2 times I have ordered from them, the quality that it once was just wasn't there. 
Either the person cooking has lost his appreciation for good quality or the person making the pizza was new but the last 2 times were just bad. Yesterday., ordered a 16\" deep dish. Sauce was like soup, as soon as we picked up a piece everything falls off the top. There almost seemed as if there was no cheese to hold it even close together. The onions were raw. Raw to the point of I felt like I had bitten into a whole onion.  Just not impressed Rosati's. Don't think we will be ordering again from this location. 2 times we have been let down after years of staying true customers"}
{"text":"This is a great place that falls somewhere between a take-out pizza joint and a candles and wine kind of place.  My wife and I are regulars, often dining on the patio in the evening.  The beer is cold, the service is good, and the food is tasty.  A good neighborhood pizza joint that won't break the bank. They recently added a full bar and gaming, but I have not patronized that part of the business."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and meatballs. I go here with my daughter and always have a good experience. Wasn't a fan of the wings but everything else I've tried has been great."}
{"text":"Yum! I was introduced to Rosati's by fellow yelper Vanessa N. It was so tasty! Deep dish with good crust and delicious thick tomato sauce. Pretty reasonable prices, too. Saxby's has closed, so it's now just a takeout place. They do have a counter and a couple tables outside if you do want to eat there. 

One word of warning--the deep dish does not reheat well. Just eat it all and don't think about saving it for a second meal. It was like reheated Pizza Hut with a soggy crust. But when it is fresh, it is spectacular! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly service and on time delivery. Wings were delicious. 
Cons: very High prices and poor quality pizza. 
I did not taste any flavor in either pizza we ordered. The crust was rather hard, also."}
{"text":"Usually when my in laws get Rosati's delivered; they're on point! Tonight was not the case. Between spending ten minutes on the phone with a trainee that shouldn't be solo to the pie not being ready at the promised pickup time to the greasy pizza we had by the time we got home. Just not impressed. This place used to be top notch! What a shame!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, Buffalo wings are ok never had an issue with service . More off a takeout place then sit down.  Very good sandwiches, like the chicken parmigiana sandwich."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here because we have Rosati's in my hometown in Illinois. I have also eaten at the one on Silverado ranch and Bermuda so I wanted to see how this one compares. First off nice bar area n tables somewhat friendly staff.  My and a friend ordered a pizza and drinks. I ordered a Diet Pepsi which the bartender swore up n down it was Diet.  I even asked him several times to make sure it's Diet because am a diabetic.  The pizza was not up to par with the other location less sauce n not as tasty, I guess each franchise location is different. 

Warning if your diabetic don't drink the diet soda here.  I got home from the place and checked my blood sugar it was well over 1100 which 80-90 my normal range is regular.  1100 is ridiculous one can slip into a coma if not careful.  I was furious had to shoot up over 30 units of insulin to bring it down to 150.  When I called to tell the lady at the place who when I was leaving said to me thanks for coming see you next time.  She told me hold on let me go check and  then she hung up on me.  Real nice customer service. I would not recommend this place and not return after the rudeness of my phone call.  And the fact the bartender swore it was Diet n turned out to be regular soda."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars, even though I'm probably never going back. I've been coming to this place every week for years with my family. They had a deal: half off any pizza if ordered before 6pm Monday - Thursday. For years Id bring my whole family every week. 
 
But in the past month or so the service got really bad, all the regular staff left. The pizza seemed to change too, tasted cheaper. Final nail in the coffin was when they ended the half off deal. 
 
We had a good run Rosati's. Have 5 stars even though you've lost my business."}
{"text":"Been eating Rosati's brand for years now, it's consistently good at this location. Always good service too. But I've narrowed down my favorites to the Rosati's Monster Pizza and pizza puffs!!! So good and delicious. Try em both."}
{"text":"Great service, we live in very rural area and no one delivers to our house....except Rosati's!!! We asked and they delivered, we now eat a lot of Rosati's. Everything is good the pasta, pizza and fingers.   Be careful though when they say hot fingers they mean spicy Hot!  They remember who you are and help with your order by suggesting from your past orders of what you did or didn't like.  We weren't crazy about the deep dish but that was just our taste, not the product. I would recommend them."}
{"text":"I've had mixed feelings about Rosati's  (other locations not dine-in) but this is by far one of my favorite pizza places in Vegas! Delicious crust, perfect sauce and super fresh and tasty toppings. They also have chicken/fries options when the littles arent in the mood for pizza, and crayons & coloring pages while they wait. Not to mention they've got a decent little selection of beers on tap, including an IPA. Place can get super crowded on weekends so... fair warning!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint in Las Vegas. I'm not from Vegas and have had a real hard time finding good pizza whether thin or thick crust and I've finally found a place that's consistently good. The Double Dough Pizza is delicious. Always top quality ingredients. I've Been going to Rosati's for years and now since the Rainbow location opened I can get delivery.  all around"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the area my wife and I were looking for a pizza joint for our Friday nite supper. Having enjoyed Rosatis previously we were happy to find not only a take out but a pub also. Things were looking good. Unfortunately, we decided to order take and our pizza got \"lost\".Yes that is what the young lady told me, \"I can't find your pizza, it's lost\" I immediately imagined a pizza wandering down South Rainbow looking  for a friendly face, then my wife called to check on the status of supper. As I related what happened she commented, \"How the F does somebody lose a pizza\"? I asked that question ( not using those terms ) of the counter chic and she said that my pizza was probably with the delivery guy. This made me smile as I imagined the dude who ordered the double cheese and pepperoni with sausage getting my ricotta cheese, spinach and mushroom pie. This same girl assured me that a new pizza would be all mine in 12 minuets. That 12 minuets seemed like 30, wait, it was! For my trouble I received 2 I'm sorries, 1 we don't know what happened, and an offer for 2dollars off, increased to 5 dollars after the clock hit the 30 min. mark. I also was the recipient of 12 coupons that were cut off of pizza boxes entitling me to 50% off my next order? As I cannot bear to be responsible for another lost pizza wondering aimlessly, or do I have 30 min to wait in a pizza joint I will not be back. ps the pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"pizza was great. good place to bring the whole family. looking forward to seeing more craft beer on tap. I hear it's coming..."}
{"text":"I am a native of Chicago and their Chicago style sucked!!! We got the biggest pepperoni. It tasted like tomatoes on top of crust. Could not taste the cheese or pepperoni. I ordered a water with lemon I got no lemon or refill.The menu prices, werent what we were charged. We were charged more on both pizzas The thin crust pizza was good. The roast beefs were good, nothing like Chicagos, and not worth  9.00 each, very small. When i asked for a doggie bag they had put the pizza in a white styrofoam container,all the pieces thrown on top of each other.We ate outside so when it was time to pay I went to the register handed the girl the bill and the $5.00 off coupon. The bill was 76.and change, not worth it. I gave her $80.00 and asked her to take the $5.00 off and give the rest to my waitress, who I couldnt find. She looked at me, like she had no clue, did not ring nothing in the register,just stood there and sent me on my way. I bet my server didnt get the $9.00 tip!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for pizza in Vegas.  Always delicious.  Staff is always courteous and professional.  Anyone that says anything differently is out of their goddamn minds."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our food and drinks at this place.  It had a cozy feel, and the menu was excellent.  There was a large bar in a separate room where we were going to initially sit, but the games playing on the TVs were uncomfortably loud, so we sat in the little dining area.  It would be nice if they converted some of the bar to dining because people were turned away while we were dining because they  did not have any available seating.  The food was good, so I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I expected nore cheese than crust what I got was not Chicago style but Sicilian. Not impressed."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!! There pies are amazing and i will never not call them again for pizza. Chicago style  with piles of meat is the way to go. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Happy hr 10pm till close
Best pizza,  multiple crust options and cheese options
today I ordered a great. Salad made. My own  not on the menu and you must see Ali in the bar she's the best."}
{"text":"I just had a bizarre experience. I called in to place an order for delivery. I was told that there was a note about me in the computer, that I was no longer allowed to have a delivery made. I have been ordering pizzas to be delivered from this place for eight years. In all that time there was only an issue once. They delivered the wrong pizza to me. When I called back to request they send the right pizza, they were a bit rude about it. They asked me to just keep it since it was \"close enough.\" I said no, that I wanted the pizza I had ordered and paid for. They did bring me the correct one and picked up the other. Now today, I'm listed as a person who has had multiple problems with deliveries. So, either one screw up of theirs was enough to put me on a \"naughty\" list or they just entered a notation in the wrong person's file. Either way, it's bad business on their part, and they just lost a good customer. What's even sillier is that I've had several deliveries since that incident."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for it being a chain.  I absolutely love the pizza, and think that it is the best in my area of town! The food is always really hot, and we always have it delivered! The delivery driver is always kind, and the person who takes our order is always very patient, and gets the order right every time.  One thing to remember is when you order fingers, make sure you say 'tossed' in the sauce, like mild or medium etc. The Godfather pizza is one of the best that is on the menu with lots of veggies! Onions and peppers etc. The plain cheese is also great.  KUDO's for getting it right and finally having a great pizza place with great service and great food!  The chicken Parmesan is fab as well!"}
{"text":"Italian Beef was Great! 

I had the Beef Classico w/ Red Meat Sauce, Onion, Green Pepper and Mozzarella.

Definately will go back."}
{"text":"Had chicken wings, garlic knots, and a BBQ chicken pizza. Very dissatisfied! Half of the order now sits in the bottom of my trash can! The lady who took our order was helpful.

Went back to give this place a second chance. Got the thin crust sausage and pepperoni pizza. Far better than the last time! They should really take the BBQ chicken pizza off the menu. It is the worst I have ever had. The other types of pizzas are better by far!"}
{"text":"Ummm, so I ordered from here religiously for months then all of a sudden the food was CRAP! Soggy sandwiches, cold pizza and TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"What type of stupidity does it take to put a hot, fresh from the oven pizza in front of an 8 month old as the mothers trying to reach for it to stop it!

Thank you for the burns! I have picture if anyone gives two shits.

Love the food, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Have ordered many times, usually very good. Tonight ordered 2 large pizzas with 3+ toppings each Both were soggy,cold, the boxes were wet and cheese slid off one completely. The cost for TWO pizzas was 70$.  They did give a credit,but for that cost I will get it from somewhere else from now on. Photos added."}
{"text":"My husband likes this place a lot!  Their pizza and sandwiches are good.  The girls working the phone and counter are always very nice.  I only wish that they made their own breadsticks fresh in the store but they buy them from their wholesaler and they are not that good.  Some of the other locations make their own breadsticks and they are soooo good!  Please fix this...  :)"}
{"text":"Really great pizza and pasta here.  Just moved to Vegas, so I'm still weighing the pizza options.  So far, these guys are my favorite in the area"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas. And I'm from Chicago. We order at least every week. Order is always correct, and the food is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!  Staff members are real friendly and helpful. Prices are great for the quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Las Vegas the one on Durango and Grand Teton the staff is amazing very friendly and I have to say never messed up on any of my orders and their delivery is outstanding and on time"}
{"text":"Sometimes having pizza and wings delivered to your doorstep is the ideal dinner. Last night was one of those nights. The last time we had pizza was at Villa Pizza's new location on Boulder Highway, so this time we decided to order from Rosati's. 

We decided to go with a large two topping pizza, and a dozen wings. I always order the wings extra crispy from Rosati's and they turn out delicious. Even with the $3 delivery fee, our total with tax (but before tip) was under $30. Yes, you can get cheaper pizzas. Doesn't make them better...

When I placed my order, the girl on the phone already knew my address based on the number that popped up on their caller id. I love when businesses have this system in place. I was told my food would be to me within the hour. It took 35 minutes. I love when business beat their deadlines too!

Rosati's also has a program where you can save a piece of the pizza box and after you get 12 you get 50% off your 13th pizza. Only downside to the program is that it does not apply to delivery."}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome.  I had real Chicago pizza in Chicago last year, but I still prefer this shop's pizza over at any time.  They are thick, cheezy with tons of flavor and melt in your mouth.  Choose the plain cheese and pepperoni, no fancy other types though.  The chicken wings were great too.  They are hot, crunchy and packed with goodness meat.  Those are the two that I always order every time I go there.  
You've gotta try this place out"}
{"text":"It's my favorite place to eat pizza. I've tried other locations but it's not the same. My uncle came to visit who lived in Chicago thought the pizza tasted just like Chicago's pizza. Even the chocolate cake and ice cream is amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Rosati's on Saturday. He is a big guy and LOVES pizza, considers himself a pizza snob because he's had it all and is very picky when it comes to pizza. The main reason we went here is because we were in the area and he had purchased a coupon book via a co-workers kid and the coupon was good for buy one get one pizza free. He did the original crust first- hand worked. The crust was awesome, both of us LOVED it and I didn't even order pizza I had the cheese ravioli. The second pizza (free pizza) was awesome as well. It was HUGE and probably could have lasted a normal person for 3 days straight 3 meals a day. What a great deal!! The cheese ravioli I do have to say was nothing to write home about but the pizza was. Both my boyfriend and I would recommend this place as a great date night place or a place to just come and watch a game at and have a good slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Chicago deep dish in the desert! Yes it's true it dose exist. Sure there's other places down town, but that's in the tourist trap. Rosati's brings the local home town service and taste to the Black mountain area. I'm a pizza snob, the taste is the same as it is in the Windy City."}
{"text":"Let's get down to it... This location sucks. The staff is questionable, alot of them look like disheveled homeless drunks/drug addicts (and smelled like booze once when the pizza delivery boy came to my door). Very rude and not interested in customer service. 
The pizza can range from very good to not cooked/too thick crust/sparse toppings. I once ordered a salad with grilled chicken and there was a bug in the salad.  

The pizza and food is pretty pricy compared to other places, not valued enough for the hit or miss service they supply. 
I've also ordered from the Rainbow location and the Summerlin location, both times service was nice and friendly, pizzas were hot and loaded with toppings. Not sure if it's just this location that didn't get the memo, but the other locations seem much more acceptable for the caliber of dining experience the owners have created here. 

Have you tried Rocco's? It's 2 miles away,  NY style pizza, not Chicago style, but the pizza is probably the best I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The dough nuggets are amazing! Great service every time. This is are go to for Pizza to eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Order on the regular from rosatis. Get it thin crust. Ranch on the side. With parm and peppers. Solid but you might eat a whole pizza. Wish it was little faster and cheaper."}
{"text":"I like the Hawaiian thin crust - sauce is good.  I could eat this stuff all day.  Their shortfall is in the customer service.  The kids working there last Friday were rude and more interested in their phones than paying attention to anyone else.  As good as the pizza is - there is good pizza at other places with friendlier staff.  My husband was so disgusted - we won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"While we have been very loyal to this place for about 3 years now, we sadly are saying goodbye after verbally being assaulted by the manager! We called to place an order for a pizza, with special accommodations which have been fulfilled several times previously, however, the manager started giving a lot of grief and complaints and speaking incredibly rude to the point of calling my husband a jerk when my husband got sick of it and said we didn't want any pizza from there tonight due to the service. We asked for the employees name, the man refused to give it and then proceeded to yell and say he is refusing service to us. All over asking for half no cheese pizza. We love the food here but the service has been really terrible lately. They also have hired a bunch of teens who last time we walked in, seemed stoned out of his mind calling and announcing out loud that my husband was a dragon slayer\" when we picked up our pizza. We also had to wait an addition 29 minutes while they attempted to look up our order on a seperate occasion because that same kid put the order under that account, so needless to say the ownership is bad, and the service is bad. Bartenders are great! Food is decent but pretty over priced."}
{"text":"Been here 2x. Recently with my Hubz. Stopped in to watch the game-But, they don't get any extra in big games. Our waitress was a little funky. She wasn't attentive at all and kept complaining about her eyes being dilated. Food is good. Nothing spectacular. Just regular bar food."}
{"text":"Realizing I bashed Rosati's for CRAMMING the Au Jus container into my sandwich, I wanted to qualify my review by saying my family LOVES their food!   The sauce is perfect and the thin-crust pizza is some of the best I've ever had (having lived in Chicago and S. Florida).   Do yourself a favor and order from the S. Rainbow location.

Just make sure to request that the Au Jus is NOT placed (hammered then squashed) into the samich container.   =]

Oh yeah....LOVE tavern sliced pie!!!!!

'Murica!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love Rosati's pizza. Unfortunately whoever answered the phone tonight was very rude and condescending. It's 9:00 on Friday 02/16. I was speaking clearly and loud enough for my entire neighborhood to hear me. She kept saying \"I can't hear you\" so I had to speak even louder and slowly hoping she could hear better. She was very sarcastic. I then ask for a large sausage pizza. \"What kind of crust \"...I say regular (I didn't say thin, didn't say pan). She rudely says \"we don't have regular \". After being talked to like a child since the female answered the phone I hung up and told my husband we will not be giving our business to Rosati's. I called Marcos pizza which has great pizza. Marcos took our order with enthusiasm and great phone etiquette."}
{"text":"Yummy local neighborhood pizza place. Thin pizza so its not too much crust and fast friendly delivery. We will for your order pizza from here again. The only issue i had was we got half pepperoni and half cheese and they put the pepperoni underneath the cheese so you cant tell which piece is what. That was kind of a pain with some kids that were eating cause some didnt like pepperoni and accidentally picked it up. But the flavor was yummy. :-)"}
{"text":"I called in an order a few months ago. My total seemed high so 5 minutes later I had to cancel because after checking there prices it didn't match there online prices. The owner answered the phone when I called to cancel. He was very upset that I was cancelling the order since it had already been started. He told me never to call back again. Hah!! I got a coupon in the mail and today decided I'd let that incident go, I mean I've lived in the area for 14 years and have been a faithful customer since they opened. So I called today to place the order and when the employee asked for my number she apologized and continued to tell me that the notes stated not to take any orders from me. She said it didn't say why just that they were notes entered by the owner and she had to comply. Omg I was floored. After reading previous comments regarding the owners behavior I get that he has issues. I told my son about what happened and he told me that his friend applied for a job there and when the owner interviewed her he told her that she could not wear make up because he wanted employees to look \"All-American\" apparently he only hires Caucasians that look \"All-American\" on the frontline. Wow, just wow"}
{"text":"Awesome place. My favorite place to go! Great wings and garlic knots! The atmosphere in the place is comfortable and the service is always on point."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and everything was awesome! My wife had the personal thin crust pizza lunch special and it was great.  Thin crispy crust and top quality Italian sausage.  One of our friends had the pasta carbonara that was loaded with bacon and a tasty cream sauce the other had the masttacholi with meat sauce and I had the lunch special,  Italian beef w/giardinare and crinkle cut fries.  I'm originally from Chicago and know what Italian beef is all about and this sandwich was huge and the real deal! The service was excellent and the whole staff was as friendly and professional as could be and the restaurant was super clean.  I don't live in Vegas but I'll definitely be coming back the next time we're in town! Oh, almost forgot, we also split an order if hot wings as an appetizer. Perfectly cooked and sauced!"}
{"text":"very very unprofessional standards.


If you are anyone that values good customer service and great pizza i would highly recommend staying away from this place.

Time after time again picking up uber orders from this place im continuously  disrespected by the owner and his employees.

Tonight i walked in to pick up another uber order,  upon walking in i see the older man that runs the place and owns this particular rosatis which is the worst one in town by far. 
Instead of reaching out to me to fix the issues he absolutely just made them worse. 
Im telling you right now this is one of those establishments where you will be treated very very poorly if your part of the LGBTQ community.

Upon walking in he says nada. Two girls standing on each side of him giving me the most sarcastic shitty welcome because hes standing there and as the they do so hes sitting there histarically laughing.  Hmmm i wonder whats so funny. Maybe the fact that everyones adults there but cant seem to approach me like a normal business owner and fix his out of control business. Clearly im not the only one who thinks so every single one of his one star reviews on here all HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. 

I would AVOID this place at all cost dont waste  your money. Just go to metro or streets of new york,  hell youd be better off going to presto calzone or papa murphys for take out. 

The only people who hang out here are the regular alcoholics and people who do the same old shit theyve been doing for years. Stay away from this place.


If this were any other customer im pretty sure this would end up being settled in court. Constant harrasment from this place."}
{"text":"Place is amazing! 
Food is great and you can't beat the awesome service! 
 Try garlic knots and deep a dish pizza!"}
{"text":"We get take-out because the in-restaurant dining area is small and cheap looking. We have ordered several times (more than two dozen) and have ordered a variety of menu items, to include single entrees and the family sizes spaghetti, lasagna, and salads. We have also had the beef sandwiches, mozzarella sticks, french fries, breadsticks, and of course, pizza - both regular and Chicago style pan.  

So, here's the catch...service is always great but the preparation of the food has never been consistent. We have had wonderful items such as the juicy, hearty, beefy, melty provolone cheese, in a golden toasted bun with savory, nicely seasoned au jus Italian beef.   But the next time we ordered it, the portion size noticeably shrank...is that a word?  Now, I know that is not about the food itself, but it was disappointing even so.

We have also had spaghetti that was too far beyond al dente and was just plain mushy. Sooo disappointing. Italian restaurants are judged on their pasta preparation because what else is there??  Then another time we ordered pasta, it was fine. I would estimate 50/50.  

The meat sauce and the marinara are both fine. I prefer marinara and theirs was nicely tomatoey and not too sweet. Just enough seasoning to enhance the plump, chunky sauce natural flavors. 

My husband prefers meat sauce, which he did like, but their meatballs, which are huge, were somewhat bland for his taste.  

The lasagna was just average (kinda too much sauce and could have more layers) as well as their breadsticks and salad-pretty mundane items. 

If I was going to recommend something from here, it would be their specialty Chicago-style deep dish pizza. It is thick, cheesy, hearty, saucy, with whatever toppings you want to have shoved in.  We ordered a medium for 4 adults and had a half pie leftover. Even my husband, whose appetite is legendary, could only manage one and a half slices (or chunks as they should be called).  It was yummy.

Overall, we will continue to roll the dice with this restaurant because it is close and does deliver fairly quickly. It would not be my first choice Italian restaurant because of the iffy pasta prep, but on a good day, it's not bad."}
{"text":"We have ordered the Chicago deep dish pizza from the Henderson Location many times at it was always fantastic. We were at a friends house up this way and ordered a deep dish pizza and could not believe this was a Rosati's. The bottom crust was as thick as the sides, we ordered a sausage & mushroom, but barely got any mushrooms. Who ever made this pizza should really go to the Rosati's on Pecos & Wigwam to see what a Chicago deep dish pizza should taste like. We also got a thin crust pizza for the kids and that was really bad. The crust taste like cardboard and had hardly any sauce on it. The cheese was the only good part. Next time we go by our friends house we are going to bring them a deep dish from the Henderson Rosati's to show them what good pizza really tastes like."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. The lady who took my order over the phone was fantastic. I had a very complicated order and she ensured that it would be done properly and it was delivered quickly and correctly!

I take one star away for the price. Prices are high and would prevent me from eating here more often."}
{"text":"This is based off a walk-in order to-go. The lady in the check out area was very unpleasant. No greetings nor acknowledgement. She seemed to be very agitated before I could say a word. I almost turned around and left right then, but I was starving and was really craving for a calzone. I have been wanting to give this place a try so I thought I should try the quality of the food at least since service sucked so bad. Fail. Just failed all around. Soon after I paid, Ms. Attitude tells me \"30 mins!\". 30 freaking minutes for a Calzone. Wow. Guess what? My calzone had SOUP inside. Literally dripping out of a calzone. Here I was stuck with a ginormous calzone that cost me nearly $20 + Horrible witch of a cashier that took my order. UN-Freakin-REAL. Never coming back to this place. Lose the attitude! Better customer service will definitely make up for any bad food quality."}
{"text":"Good food, the only reason I drop them to 3 stars is they always forget something on my delivery order.  Either the soft drink, or dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night and were seated right away, well that's not entirely true as we had 4 people in our party and they sat us at a table that only had 3 seats. To solve this issue they brought an outside chair indoors so my poor son was lower than the table. He's an awesome kid so he muddled through it! Ordered a large Caesar salad, fried pickles and a thin crust. Had to send the salad back due to all the brown lettuce- not sure they even use Romaine lettuce and the croutons were pathetic. Kids seemed to enjoy the pickles and the pizza was great. Wait staff appeared dysfunctional and unorganized. Good pizza, but I'll stick to pizza only and take out."}
{"text":"This is (seriously heavy) deep dish Chicago-style pizza. We went over to my father-in-law's to watch a game and he ordered this monstrous pizza to go- it was so heavy- he had my husband grab it- on purpose, he wanted to show him how serious this pizza was! Can I emphasize that enough? It was so heavy we each had one slice and called it a night. One slice was enough- loaded with numerous toppings like pepperoni, peppers and cheese. It was good, but because it was so heavy, you really don't need appetizers (you know, at pizza places, they give you a bread basket?), maybe dessert- an hour and a half later (if your stomach recovers). My husband liked it and so did my fil- but would I get it again? Maybe only if I had a light lunch...maybe I'm too used to New York style pizza."}
{"text":"By far the best chicago style pizza you will find in Las Vegas.  I'm morbidly obese and can only eat 2 slices at a time.  For about $30 I can feed myself for an entire weekend.

No dining in.  Take out / delivery only.

Pro tip: You can usually find coupons on their website."}
{"text":"I had never been to Rosatis in person, always delivery...but last night was awesome..they had live acoustic music with HaleAmanO, what...this could be a thing Rosatis...Acoustic Tuesdays with HaleAmanO...just saying..."}
{"text":"If you want to spend $20 on a big puffed up piece of bread, with some tomatoes on it, then get the Chicago deep dish pizza from here... What a waste..."}
{"text":"This past weekend we ordered delivery from this particular Rosati's location. We have had Rosati's before, but not from this location. This review then is about the delivery and quality of the food. 
We ordered a large deep dish cheese pizza. The price was a bit high - about $20 (including delivery), but I've read a lot about their deep dish, so we had to get that. They said it would take 45 minutes to get the pizza. It took about 35 which was great. I can't say there have been many times when I've gotten a pizza delivered early! The pizza was massive, and just one and a half pieces each satisfied 4 adults (plus some side items). The crust was thick on the bottom and crunchy and a bit buttery on the side. The cheese was perfect, and the amount of sauce was really good. Overall, the pizza was one of the better deep dish pizza's I've had in Vegas, and I dig the crust much more than the stuffed pizza at Metro's (my other favorite \"deep dish\"). 

Definitely will be trying Rosati's again..."}
{"text":"I have ordered many times from this restaurant because we love the pizza. Tonight we decided we wanted meat lasagnae. I ordered two meat lasagnae and used a $5 coupon that we get in the mail. We got home and realized one of the lasagnae had no meat. I called to get a new one and asked for them to take care of it since I had to go back out again with my baby and it was their mistake. The girl on the phone asked owner and he said he would give a side of meat sauce. I told them I wanted a fresh new one and comp. I could overhear the owner say \"she used a 5.00 coupon and now she wants a comp?\" He said he would give me another five back. I told him I needed the whole thing taken care of cause that's the right thing to do and now he made me mad with that comment. He said I could just come back and give all the food back and he would give all the money. I explained it's not about the money and I just want what I ordered. He said fine he will replace and refund but then we can \"go our seperate ways\". What kind of owner says something like that in customer service? I understand he had something else going on because I saw the cop car and him out there talking to them when I picked up the first time. But he is really going to treat customers like that? I don't want to put any money in that man's pocket. And if you don't want people to use $5 coupon, then don't give it out. I can choose a different place for pizza easily."}
{"text":"This place was great before.

Customer service sucks now and everything takes too long.  Haven't been here in awhile and it has changed so much. Last time here."}
{"text":"Just got a 26$ pizza from here and will never be back got a classic combo which on there online menu says it come with black olives get it all the way home and wow no black olives so we call them back and they say this location doesnt put black olives on there classic combo all rocrapys are different, isn't the point of a chain store to have uniformity? If you differ in any way from all other stores maybe say something when the customer orders like we cheat you out of a topping on this pizza would you like to pay even more for the standard at our other locations?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town. Have never had anything but good experiences and delicious food. Getting hungry right now thinking about the food! I always recommend them to my friends."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza here. I don't eat much pizza but this I will not hesitate to have. I also catered my daughters grad party which included their Italian beef sandwiches which are yummy! Only thing I'm never happy about when I do dine in is that the music is so loud I can barely have a conversation with my family. That's almost a deal breaker!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza tonight around 8pm after trick or treating. We were told it was a busy night & it would be about an hour. Ok no biggie understandable since it is Halloween. Well our pizza finally arrives around 9:30pm & it's ice cold. The dough is not even cooked fully in some places. So I call Rosattis back & talk to a girl named Christy I believe. (Not sure of the spelling) she is the one who took our order in the first place. I told her everything & she said they can remake the pizza & deliver it again & we can return the old ones. Well at this point it's almost 10pm & we are not going to wait another hour & eat at 11pm at night. So she said that the only thing she can do is give me 20% off my next order. Screw that, I spent almost $70 on pizza & that's all you can do??? Christy was also very nice when she took the order & a total Bi**h when I called to complain. They can keep their 20% because that's the last time we will ever order pizza from them."}
{"text":"The Best Chicago style Pizza. The servers are awesome and the quality of food are amazing. Strongly recommended..."}
{"text":"The food is good, and delivery super fast (got our food in 30mins after ordering)! 

I got three large Chicago style pizza, the garlic knots, and garlic cheese bread for the office. The pizza and knots were AMAZING. However, I was a bit disappointed in the bread, not only did they forget the cheese it was only two pieces... For $5 I expected more than two. 

Overall, this place is really good, kind service and fast delivery guys."}
{"text":"***** PLEASE READ***** Have been into this location several times & absolutely loved the place. The servers as well were absolutely great. Went in tonight to order take out, we sat down & overheard the owner of this place yelling at the servers calling everyone \"fucking stupid\", pinpointing out one girl going on & on for about 20 minutes, customers walked in & he continued to drill them as they were crying. Finally, as other customers noticed we went to explain to him he should not be talking to these girls the way he is and he needs to take them to the back, he continued to tell us he doesn't give a shit about us or what we think, to go somewhere else & he doesn't care about our business & we need to leave to never come back again. I have NEVER EVER been to a restaurant and felt so uncomfortable for those poor girls. I hope they realize there is SO many other places that will treat them how they are supposed to be treated."}
{"text":"I live up the street from Rosati's and have found their food to be consistently good. We are from NY and have high standards for pizza. Rosati's Chicago deep dish and double dough crust are awesome choices. Love their Hawaiian-style pizza! One slice of their thick-crust is enough for a meal. I highly recommend Rosati's."}
{"text":"Quality and ingredients have gone downhill. It used to be good but has changed for the worse. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Don't want to cook, kids have a last minute sleep over, impromptu game night, treat friends who helped your in-laws move...these are all the reasons we order from Rosati's.
I would rather order Rosati's over Domino's or Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.
Let's start with the way they cut their pizza...into small squares...brilliant! I don't always want to eat a whole slice and their portions make it easy not to gorge.
I love the thin crispy crust that stays dry & crunchy. Their toppings are generous and overall good delivery pizza. Enough ratio of cheese to toppings to crust.
If you save your pizza box stubs, you get a discount off your next order. Be sure to ask about their specials when you call."}
{"text":"Yuck!  the pizza we got was terrible. I read all these good reviews and was excited to try it.  The pizza was just gross, and tasted slightly undercooked.  I was super disappointed.   And to top it off, it wasn't cheap.  I would have been MUCH happier ordering Papa Johns for cheaper and better pizza.  

Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Been looking for some meatballs in the Mountains Edge area and boy did we find it. It was soooo yummy. Raviolis were also delicious. And a tall glass of Arnold Palmer on hot Vegas day! Will definitely eat there again and again."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza with extra sauce and cheese sticks were very good. The place was clean, staff were prompt, and the smell of pizza filled the air. The music in the place was deep and pleasant as well. I'll be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Goodness this place is tasty and not just the pizza!  So it will take a little while to get your food I mean they are small and busy but wow really worth it! And the wings are cooked perfect really love this place and the friendly staff who will joke around with you while you wait."}
{"text":"Ordered some chicken fingers on Saturday & they were burned & hard.  My son & I didn't even finish eating them so we threw them away.  Total waste and very disappointed after hearing good things about this place."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened.  Now that i have moved to California we still make sure we stop by to have some pizza and wings. They have just added a bar as well. The owner is there most of the time. He puts in work there so if you call in and ask for delivery he might be the one dropping off you food. For the most part they are fast at getting your food to you but remember on Tuesday and weekends they are so busy.  And are favorite things to order are there wings and pizza with extra ranch and wing sauce one the side."}
{"text":"Rudest management I have ever heard of... Do not go to this restaurant and complain about anything. Prices posted on the web are different than in store. When you mention this to the management, they get snooty and rude. They are happy to lose customers over complaints. When (I believe) the owner was told guests would no longer be customers, they responded with \"We'll survive\"... Would NEVER dream of talking to a customer this way. Good luck surviving with an attitude like that..."}
{"text":"If you want pizza to feed the masses, Rosati's is your joint.

We ordered take out as we packed up our RV for our road trip this past summer, and BOY was it filling.  We decided on large pan pizza (sausage, as to satisfy all palates), and it was ready in about 15-20 minutes.  I'm not sure if we received the right order, but our pizza seemed more like a deeeeeeep dish dough loaded pie than a pan pizza.  All good though, because it was delicious!  The slices were ginormous and a large easily fed 5 adults.

I didn't do the ordering or the pick up so I can't speak for the service and ambiance of the restaurant, but I will definitely tell you that their pizza is scrumptious.  The salad we ordered was fresh, and the cheese bread was a great addition to our meal.  Surround yourself with pizza, not negativity people."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Chicago style deep dish pizza. Not to bad!  I'm usually a fan of thin crust, but the crust here was crisp on the outside and very tasty. The sauce was decent, but the cheese was yummy. My son had the spaghetti and it was kinda bland. Breadstick was devoured in a matter of a minute :)"}
{"text":"Lettuce not washed came across 2 flies in my salad  very disappointing but overall food was good !"}
{"text":"Awesome pan pizza! Fast, hot delivery. A bit pricey but worth it. Never ate in restaurant so I can't speak to the service in-house."}
{"text":"12.21.16

9:05pm: We ordered a veggie pizza godfather style with the garlic bread. Tina who took the order, did not confirm the order. I asked for a veggie pizza... paused and said godfather and garlic bread. The whole time she was rushing the order and had a tone with me because I was trying to figure out the order. I give it to her, they were closing in an hour at 10:00pm. 

9:52 pm: When the order was delivered, I took a bite of the pizza and it was a beef pizza with jalapeños. I  called back and said we just received the order. Tina went ahead and cut me off and said \"he should be there any minute\" I said \"no I'm actually calling because the pizza is not veggie. \" she said that the \"godfather\" was what I ordered. I said no I ordered a veggie godfather style. 

Boyfriend took the phone and said that he is from Chicago and that the godfather is actually a style of pizza. He told her he did not want to argue with her. She proceeded on telling him to bring back the pizza. (When we brought the pizza back they even opened it to see if it was intact). 

He drove there and asked to speak to management. She threw the business card and said he can call
Mark tomorrow and to wait for the pizza.  She kept saying
how I messed up the order. But he let her know if she heard me say veggie pizza and godfather then shouldn't we have two pizzas? She did not say a word. He kept telling her that he was not receiving good customer service.  

While the pizza was being made, boyfriend heard the men giggle in the back and heard them say \"spit.\" 

He asked Tina if they were going to spit on the food. She said they would never do that. He then said ok well give me the pizza and I'll get it tested for bodily fluids. She then went back to check with the staff if they did that. Customers were watching and were telling her and boyfriend to calm down it's the holidays. 

Some dude came from the back and told boyfriend to calm down.  

Long story short, my boyfriend has been coming here for three years and loves the pizza but it looks like it is under new management. 

We won't be coming back.

Opened this account just to write the review. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I'm so aggravated!  Ordered delivery tonight from here.  Ordered a Med Pepperoni pizza, side salad which was $6.50!! Chicken Fingers that I asked to have hot sauce on the side, and a Cheese sandwich..  Bill was $49 and EVERYTHING was horrible.  Seriously my worst pizza experience ever..  There was almost no sauce on the pizza and the crust was flavorless, the chicken fingers were half the size of a normal pizzeria's and they had something equivalent to Mc Donalds chicken nuggets type of meat, so GROSS!  The salad was rust colored and old and the chicken fingers had the hot sauce on them so my kids couldn't eat them..  I'm so disappointed and wish I had my $49 back!"}
{"text":"Went to Rosatti's and had lunch the other day after a photo shoot. The employees were fabulous and the chicken fingers were perfect...the fried pickles were to die for! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"We had been loyal Rosati's customers. Pizza is great. wings are so so. We ordered an extra large pizza. As usual they said we would have it within an hour.  We cancelled the order an hour and a half later because it had still not arrived. When told why we were canceling  she seemed irritated at me and did not apologize (let alone offer any concessions). 
Hard to believe they remain in business when treating their customers so poorly."}
{"text":"When I get a craving for calzones or my son wants raviolis, Rosati's is one of my fail safe go to choices to get it. I've been going to this Rosati's location for 6 years now and I haven't had a bad calzone yet. 

Rosati's is a Chicago style pizzeria. You'll notice the difference as the tomato sauce is thick and flavorful. This is not low-calorie food. In other words don't order from here if you're not really hungry as you'll end up wasting good food. 

Price: Mid-Tier. It's higher than Pizza Hut / Papa Johns but not as expensive as Grimaldi's. Sunset Pizzeria would fall in the same price range, but Sunset has messed up our orders and sent us excessively greasy pizza. I've never had a complaint about grease from Rosati's and their pizza / calzones don't hurt my stomach either like many places do. 
Menu choices: Not everyone wants pizza and Rosati's has Calzones and several other offerings that please everyone here from a finicky 7 year old to those of us who are used to having the legendary BeauJo's calzones in Colorado. Rosati's ain't BeauJo's but for Vegas, we haven't found any calzones that are better.And when you open up their pasta dishes, you can see they took the time to make it right, you can see and smell the spices, and it's hard not to steal a bite for myself!
Service: Sometimes I get annoyed in how long it takes to call in my order. By the time I drive over to get it I still have to wait. And that's after running into Vons, getting gas, getting a car wash, and it's still not ready sometimes. Yeah, that annoys me. But they don't have the attitude that you get at Bistro Pizza which is why I quit going there and Rosati's gets my business. 
Quirks: This is one of those places that makes you show ID to use a credit card. Which if you travel to other places you know there are many places that don't require it. And if you hand them a $20 they check it to make sure it's real. Seriously, if they are that concerned about the cash go buy a scanning machine and be done with it. 

Overall if you want Calzones, or pasta that the kids will eat and doesn't end up in the trash you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Rosati's is right on the corner where I live, I wanted to try them and finally did. I was not impressed at all! The pizza was cut into squares which is weird but not a huge problem. I just didn't like it, my expectations are way too high when it comes to pizza but Rosati is not the pizza place for me."}
{"text":"Today, I decided to stop over to the Rosati's that we normally have pizza delivered from when we order. Well, I ordered cajun fries w/cheese, topped with hot giardiniera peppers. Well, got home, opened the nice neat packages of food and, lo-and-behold, NO peppers on my fries. Called them to let them know what happened and was kindly offered a gift certificate or a new order of fries to be delivered. Took the $10 certificate. Thanks for trying to make the situation right, Rosati's."}
{"text":"Their pizza may actually be delicious but I can't get past the slicing. Every time I order, I ask for pie slicing but they always cut it into squares. The flavor is good but if I can't fold my crust east coast style, the experience is ruined. When I ask for pie slicing, the girl always has an attitude. It may sound petty but I'm not in kindergarten. I want my pizza to be right. They're not cheap so my slicing matters. My children won't even eat it. Every time, it's wrong."}
{"text":"This Rosati's has been headed downhill lately. I've stopped here probably once or so a month over the last few years. The last few times the pizza has been only okay. Today it was nonexistent. I called in an order for two pizzas. When I got there about 10 minutes after they were supposed to be ready I got the confused look from the counter help plus a long story how someone accidentally voided out my order. They had my name and telephone number but somehow only had 1/2 the order. No offer to do anything for the inconvenience and wasn't in the mood to wait 25 minutes plus pay for their mistakes. Plenty of equally good pizza choices in the area plus other Rosati's if you really want their pizza. I'm done here."}
{"text":"This was my family's and I first time here. Saturday night after a movie. It wasn't crowded and our waiter was excellent. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms, habanero boneless wings, and Chicago style pepperoni pizza. 

Everything tasted amazing. The service was excellent. Next time I'm in Vegas and in the mood for pizza I will definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Great food ordered Chicago style pizza and it was amazing. The prices are reasonable and the staff was so nice and make my experience one to remember. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Love Roast's pizza! Thick or thin, they're all fantastic. The salads are ok too, not fabulous, but good enough. They deliver, which is nice, but normally I can't wait that long and have to get it myself!"}
{"text":"I love the Rosati's in Centennial Hills! However, I do have one complaint. I ordered a glass of house wine and they charged me $7.50! For one glass? Really?"}
{"text":"Just a side salad for me tonight... But I'm here all the time.  Their pizza is soooo good!  Their thin crust is my favorite... and although I normally don't really like Chicago style, theirs is delish!  They recently expanded their business and took over the space next-door to add a bar.  Pretty laid-back atmosphere, beer specials,... All that good stuff."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. Thick dough and lots of cheese. My son is allergic to tomatoes and anything with tomato. They helped us and we got a pizza made with Alfredo sauce."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan. 
Myself and my boyfriend have gone there a few times.
The first time we went they didn't know how to make the mixed drink I wanted and the waitress told us to go down the street to the lodge and try there (they didn't make it there either).
The second time we stayed and ate. 
I didn't like their Pasta sauce that was on the meal I ordered. I wish I had.
The third and most recent time we went, we didn't get acknowledged for ten or so minutes, even though business was slow, so we left."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food specials.  Have a great deep dish pizza that is fully loaded.  We order the small for 2 people and still have some to take home.  The garlic knots are a great appetizer.  Great friendly staff"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, fresh ingredients, good service.  Disappointed in their \"pub\" beer selection.  Wings are large which is a pleasant surprise in las vegas!  Like a couple of other pizza places better, but servicable.  Would go back"}
{"text":"Too expensive for what they offer. The food was greasy and without any flavor. I'm not coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I have always loved Rosati's - we have been coming here for years. After a brief break - we got on a Metro Pizza kick for a while - we came back and the pizza was nowhere near as good as it used to be. The sauce was bland! Toppings were sparse. And the pizza box was missing the 50% off coupon (when you save 12). Its a shame because we still have 8 coupons that we are not sure what to do with (assuming they quit doing that promotion). 

On another note the chicken fingers were still as delicious as ever."}
{"text":"Disappointed... This place is never consistent!  . 1 out of 4 times it was good.  Double crust was hard like cardboard and Alfredo was all butter separation on about half inch of the container.  Just see the picture.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I love Rosati's for pizza. My family and I typically get the Chicago Style Pan Pizza. Let me tell you, this pizza is WHAT'S UP!! The sauce is on! The crust is poppin and the flavors..oohhh my!"}
{"text":"It's expensive but worth the money. Don't necessarily like the owner, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"I won't waste much time writing this review.  Not like the time I wasted driving back to have them correct a takeout order.
Loved this place.  Not now.  Bad service, screw up orders, bad attitude from counter help, too loud, mediocre pizza for $40 and only offered a $15 discount for an incorrect order.  I understand making a mistake and my bad for not checking before driving all the way home.  But $15?  Not worth the time.  Noticed it started to go downhill when they opened the bar.  Not sure that is the reason but it pains me to say we will never come back.  Addio."}
{"text":"clean and friendly. what more can you ask for? oh yeah, the food is awesome! rosati's is almost like a women's sports bar...very sporty but not rowdy at all. 

there are little things that i really appreciated, one of those things being that the pan the pizza was being served on had spaces to ensure that the pizza did not get soggy. the unlv memorabilia was also a nice touch to those unlv alumni!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this pizza place twice & was very disappointed both times. The first time we ordered the Chicago style pizza and the lasagna. The lasagna with meat sauce was over cooked and taste like it was make a week ago. The pizza was good though. So we ordered pizza from them again the same Chicago style pizza and this time we added chicken fingers. The pizza was very dry and overcooked the bottom of it was a little burnt and the chicken fingers were processed chicken meat like cheap chicken nuggets but in chicken finger shaped. I don't know about you but if I'm paying $12.95 for chicken fingers I expect it to be real whole chicken meat not minced meat. The taste of the chicken was horrible. No one would eat them. I called to complain about the chicken & they told me  the manager would call me back because they can't authorize a credit for the chicken. I waited a few hours and then call back because the manager never called. He wasn't there. I never received a call back."}
{"text":"Hands down the WORST customer service I've ever experienced! I called my order in ahead of time to be ready for pick up, got there and had to wait 20 minutes after my ready time. What's the point of calling in advanced? No point with this place. When my order was finally done, I hurried home to eat. Come to find out my order was incorrect..big time! I called down to the restaurant asking to speak to a manager, who announced herself as Bri. She told me they'd remake my order and I can come back, but to make sure I bring the food back with me...that was a bit more than odd to say the least. So I drive all the way back to the location to get my correct order. Having to wait, yet again. When the corrected order was finally done, I went up to the counter to get it, and Bri, the so called \"manager\", asks for the garlic bread back from the incorrect order. Telling me it's their company policy to take back wrong orders of food. What are you going to do with it? Resell it? Gross. I refused to give it back, due to the fact that I wouldn't want them to sell me someone else's food. As I'm walking out the door, Bri yells at me \"don't ever come back!\". Seriously?! What kind of \"manager\" says that to a customer??? None. I go back in asking to speak to an actual manager. She then rolls her eyes, yells \"FINE\" and goes to the back, to come right back out front to tell me that her manager isn't available and that I can call tomorrow to speak to the owner, by the name of Ken. I'm an baffled that anyone in customer service would treat a guest this way. Bri is beyond rude and immature. Watch your back with this location! Not sure how the rest are..hopefully nothing like this one!!!"}
{"text":"Placed an over for delivery for 2 sandwiches and garlic bread and also had a $5 coupon. The estimated delivery time was said to be 1 hour!! The total seemed a little off and I thought maybe the cashier forgot to put in my $5 coupon. Nope, they apparently raised all their prices by a $1 each and would not honor the online menu price even though it was the right location. So I just cancelled my entire order. They failed to do a small adjustment so they lost a customer."}
{"text":"Little Caesars was getting old decided to try Rosati's. Not normally a fan of Chicago style pizza,  but consider my self a changed man. Awesome pizza, staff was great, no complaints from me."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot. Great great pizza and hot sandwiches. Way better than a nearby metro location. Nice ambience, great for sports games. Tuesday is wing night!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing! Service sucked! We were the only people in the place when we walked in and we ordered apps,drinks and lunch with a pizza to take home to our family. The mozzarella sticks came out fast, the wings took another 20 minutes to come out. Lunch came another 20 minutes after that, once we finished our food we got to go boxes and the check. We were told the pizza would be right out. An hour later we asked and the waitress comes back and says oh it's been done for 5 minutes but it was under a heat lamp. Pizza was colder than ice! We were so pissed we just left. 60 bucks on amazing food but customer service needs to be addressed!"}
{"text":"Take FYI.

We recently moved here from CA and ordered pizza for some people helping us move.  I didn't realize it at first but this is a chain and we had one a couple miles from our house in CA which we had been to a coupld of times.  

The delivery person had made an error and did not bring the garlic knots, so I called them and let them know about it.  Without hesitation or offering to give them to us next time we came in or something they made a special trip out.  Delivery is usually faster than they quote too.

The pizza here is good and reasonably priced for Chicago pizza places I have been to.  The deep dish is good but very heavy (duh) and the thin crust has a cornmeal feel to it with some good flake also but not crispy.  I would go back and probably will since we are so close."}
{"text":"Ordered 6 medium wings and a medium Chicago style.  

Wings were surprisingly good and the ranch was so good I wanted to drink it.  Yum!  

Pizza was good too.

Employees leave something to be desired and the girls at the counter are not very bright.  

Would order again."}
{"text":"I always order delivery from there and they always deliver fresh and fast pizzas! Today we went in with a few friends and had some fried dough, garlic Parmesan wings, habanero wings, and combo deep dish pizza! Everything was delicious. Our server was a very sweet and was on top of everything."}
{"text":"We called this after a rude response from another pizza business. We asked for delivery, and the girl who took my order was friendly and knowledgeable-yay. We went with a 12\" cheese pizza, chicken wings and cannolis. The delivery took about 35 minutes- not bad. The pizza was tasty and cut up differently- almost like it was for kids ( see pic ). It didn't bother me but it was worth the mention. The chicken was tasty, and we ordered plain so nothing fancy. The cannolis were creamy and yummy. We don't do much delivery, but I was pleased and full."}
{"text":"Ive always ordered from Rosati's for pizza. Now the price will throw you off if you are not used to paying for GOOD pizza but it's all worth it!! a lot of the ingredients come from the east/mid-west so you are getting the REAL cheese and dough and that makes the difference. I also love the roast beef sandwiches!!! Giardiniera  peppers!! yummmm! over all excellent food and services!!! Been there thousands of times and will go back even more!!"}
{"text":"I think there pizza's are delicious.  We have ordered a couple and have always picked up for home.   They are big, filling, and delicious.  Ordered the double crust pizzas and they were great"}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni \"deep dish\" pizza. It was quite sad - 90% dough, 10% filling. Wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Went here on a date and Christina was our server. Not only was the food amazing, but her service was outstanding. The pizza might be a little different in how they slice it, but when you see how much toppings are in it, you will get why. Amazing and totally worth everything!!! Great place!"}
{"text":"It was Joel's birthday and of course he wanted pizza! We didn't feel like driving downtown so we ordered from Rosati's.

Thanks to Yelp we used their website to place our order. The birthday boy had the Calzone and added pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and onions. I ordered the large Antipasto salad with Italian dressing. We also ordered 6 wings in their BBQ sauce. The wait time was 30 minutes not bad at all. I got there about 5 minutes before the time. I paid and had to wait a little, but not to long. 


When I got home we dug in! Joel's calzone was huge and filled. He said it was ok and I tried it too. But we both felt the sauce was off. I'm not sure if it was old or what. ( I've had their pizza before and loved their sauce.) Maybe it's a different sauce? The salad although I ordered a large was kinda small and lacked in toppings and was mainly ice berg lettuce. I did really enjoy the sliced Peperoncinis in the salad and the Italian dressing as very tasty. Now the wings! They sure saved the day. Perfectly cooked and perfectly sauced! Very large and meaty wings that left me wishing I had ordered more then 6! 


Overall I would go back and try the pizza instead of the Calzone. I'd for sure get those wings again! The salad had potential, but missed the mark this time. If I could give 3 1/2 stars I would."}
{"text":"Food was awesome
 Ordered rigatoni and sausage and my boyfriend ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo. Very filling the family seating section wasn't much and could use a remodeling. But the bear seemed like the main attraction to this place. Decent place. Would order take out next time."}
{"text":"Rosati's was decent but not my favorite. I have been to Chicago and had pizza while there. Rosati's does not come close. The pizza was okay and the sauce had an interesting flavor that I was not too fond of. One positive was the crust which was pretty good. The service was just okay. There were too members of the wait staff and both waited on us. One was pretty good and the other told us she was going to bring things and then never did. The other one seemed to be picking up the slack for the other one. My wife did enjoy her calzone and my son enjoyed his spaghetti, hence two stars instead of one. But overall I have had much better experiences and pizza. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza here was great, and the wings were yummmm.....the service was superb- thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for dinner tonight. Food arrived on time and was still hot. I wish I would have taken pictures but, we gobbled the food so fast that I didn't get a chance too! We ordered a small Chicago Style Classic Combo pizza. Perfect size. 2 people split that and they still didn't finish it! We also ordered a thin crust pepperoni. Perfectly cooked, great amount of sauce and cheese ratio. I also ordered a small Greek salad which was so fresh and delicious. I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Deep Dish Pizza for pickup to bring home to watch Monday Night Football and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked to a light golden brown with perfect amount of cheese."}
{"text":"I am VERY pregnant so pretty much all food sounds/tastes good to me right now. I decided to try this place because i wanted a Philly cheesesteak and my kids wanted pizza. They had an awesome deal where you got a medium pizza, zeppoli, and garlic knots for $13.99. I ordered that and a Philly cheesesteak. After I ordered I got a call that they were out of the steak.... bummer.... I settled for my second favorite- a meatball sandwich. 

My kids seemed to enjoy the pizza but I thought it was a little bland. The meatball sub was super dry- I am used to a little more sauce on a meatball sub. All my garlic knots were burnt! I am not sure what zeppoli is supposed to taste like since I am a first timer, but, I think it is supposed to be fluffy? It was a little crispy but the flavor was alright. It's served with chocolate so that part made me happy. 

Everyone has their own tastes so I normally don't go by the reviews of others but I wish I would have listened to these reviews this time around. Maybe this was just a bad cook night but I can say I will not be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"The pizza is okay. Customer service is horrible. As bad as their customer service is the fact they charge $2 per topping on a pizza is absurd. You're better off taking the trip down to pizza rock."}
{"text":"Yes folks, a five star review! The best Chicago style deep dish pizza you can get anywhere (including Chicago). i'll save you the trouble of reading a lengthy review, the whole place is awesome."}
{"text":"Talk about crap everything. Try the pizza at Costco $10 pie cooked there much better. Yo Pizza help  what are you taking the cheese and the sauce home give some to the paying customers. The freaking heroes are tiny barely any cheese barely any sauce you don't even use authentic Italian bread and the bread that is used is soaking wet like a sponge. Shame on you shouldn't even use an Italian name. 

 This place is way overrated I'm disgusted. It should be closed down."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!  We have been coming here consistently for about a year and a half.  We love this place!  Not only is their food always on point, the service is exceptional!   The wings are some of the best in town.  The pizza is wonderful as is everything we have had on the menu.  The main reason we come back is because of our server, Maizy.  When we walk through the door, we are greeted with a smile and immediately she brings over kid cups with lids to start our dining experience.  It's nice to be treated like family here!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on a Saturday for a fettuccine Alfredo with spinach, and got one with chicken instead. The first order took over an hour to get to me and I was hungry so I just picked out the chicken, but it was really unsettling. If I order again, I would ask the person on the phone to read my order back to me. It's extremely frustrating as a vegetarian that I can't order food and be relatively certain I can eat what I get if they make a mistake.

The fettuccine itself was delicious, though small for the $13.95 price tag. The slice of garlic bread was soggy from being in the box with the hot pasta but tasted fine after I popped it in the toaster oven for five minutes.

My roommate also ordered a deep dish pizza and a sandwich, which he enjoyed. My experience would had been perfect if they didn't get my order wrong."}
{"text":"Tasty as hell. It's a good spot if everyone wants beer and pizza. Just go over the bar section and get a table. Watch a football game or something. I would recommend the thin pizza over deep dish. Just because I actually want to finish what I bought. I haven't had a bad pizza here yet."}
{"text":"This is real Chicago style pizza.  Maybe not quite as good as Giordano's, but pretty darn close and better than you're likely to find around here.  If you're lucky enough to be within the delivery zone, this is the place to get your pizza."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm originally from Chicago and have been a loyal Rosatis customer for years.  The food at this location started going down hill a few months ago and they have been forgetting stuff in my delivery order so I haven't ordered in a while.
Tonight I decided to give it another shot.  And again, not only did they forget 1/2 my order then they delivered me this burnt cold pizza (see picture).  I called and spoke with the assistant manager and she refused to take money off my order if I wanted it remade and brought to me, because that's their policy.  Are you kidding me??? I have to wait another hour for my food and pay full price??? Now I remember why I stopped ordering here.  It's one thing to make a mistake but when you don't value your customers that's a shame."}
{"text":"Delicious food and prepared when ordered. A bit too much bread on the crust but maybe that's their style. Overall, it's yummy!"}
{"text":"I will definitely commend them on their delivery and food. The food arrived hot enough where it almost burned my hand taking it out of the bag and I am a good 10-15 drive from the restaurant. Delivery man was very nice and the food was great like always."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago this place is the closest we can get back home style food. Love their deep dish and da beef samiches!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago, and we had a Rosati's right around the corner from my house.  

I've lived in Las Vegas for 10 years, and haven't had Rosati's till this weekend.

My parents are headed back to Chicago for Christmas, so we decided to do our Christmas together this weekend, and instead of a traditional dinner, we opted to order Rosati's.

Oh.  My.  God.

I cried after my first bite.  I've missed pizza this good for ten years.

I've had decent pizza, but nothing compares to this.  The pizza was just like back home!

I really wish I lived closer to this location, but I'm going to see if there is a Rosati's close to my house so I can have it more often.  

Great job guys.  You all made me very homesick. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, juicy meatballs. Good service, a good neighborhood restaurant and is quiet (most business are take out) which I kinda enjoy it"}
{"text":"This place has some great pizza!!!! Staff could use a little work , they're always friendly but could use better direction fr m management. Good food , fair prices"}
{"text":"I got the pizza and it's not good there is no way this just came out of the oven.  The crust is chewy and doughy .. Probably my last order here.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"Rosati's makes a pretty mean Chicago style pie.  The quality blows away all of the other chain pizza shops.  The only downside is that it is almost twice as expensive as a Papa Johns or a Pizza Hut.  That being said, given the choice of where to order from, Rosati's is the place (unless of course I'm visiting the family in NJ in which case, all bets are off."}
{"text":"I have been eating Rosati's Pizza since I was a kid back in Chicago. Now that we live over the the southwest, we always order from the Rosati's off Rainbow. Not sure why I tried something different, when I always love their pizza. We placed an order for delivery. Ordered the Chicken Parmesan Pasta Entree, and a bit disappointed. There was a very small piece of chicken pretty grilled, breaded and almost burnt. It was cut into 3 small stripes. It came with a huge heap of pasta, that could have used more sauce and cheese. Felt like we got a spaghetti dish with a side of Chicken. And the bread that came with it, was so hard, it hurt my teeth to finish it, so it was thrown away. Definitely not worth $13.95. The Chicken Alfredo was very well received by the person who ordered it. As always, no complaints about our Medium Thin Crust Cheese Pizza. We also asked for some ranch on the side. Came with two decent sized containers, but charged an extra $1.00 for them. Wished they would have mentioned the extra charge when we ordered. Next time we will just stick with the Pizza that we know and love."}
{"text":"We use to love a Rosati's but last time we went with a big group the waitress was not friendly and she refused to split the ticket even thought every other visit ticket splitting wasn't a problem. We use to do many dinners after baseball here but after being treated like we were an inconvenience, we won't be back.  

The Amazing pizza and friendly service.  We have never found Chicago style pizza in Vegas that can compare to Chicago. Also the salads are great and the fried pickles can't be beat.  Best pizza place in our area by far."}
{"text":"Pizza was too grease for me. Sauce had no flavor. Was disappointed in the final product."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve to even have 1 star. WORST customer service ever...  Lady who's taking the order was very rude, when I asked for the manager she rolled her eyes... i didnt drive all the way here to get this kind of treatment... They need to re-train their employees and even the manager, Ken!"}
{"text":"Just watched the Golden Knights game here and Marcus and Andrew were ABOVE AND BEYOND!!! They took care of a house full of people and still kept a positive attitude and excellent customer service. With almost every seat in the house being taken up, you would have thought we had a server for each individual table. They made us feel like we were in a friends house. The two of them were a dynamic team and I will definitely be back with my family to watch the game Thursday...you two killed it, you couldn't have been more on point. Food was excellent as well shout out to the chef!!!! This Rosatis always does us good!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, only one other person in the restaurant , service was good but it took FOREVER to get a salad and a sandwich, food was nothing special. employees were very nice, but won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fried zucchini: I'm a fan. I ordered to-go, and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food, as well as the amount of dipping sauce I was provided (I was also given a choice of sauces, which I appreciate). So far, so good."}
{"text":"Incredible!! Chicago deep dish is to die for and very HEAVY. The flavors that explode in your mouth and the melted cheese, can't get any better than that. Had it delivered, I was told it was going to be an hour and it took 40 min which was awesome because I was starving. Definitely ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great..... I thought it was a little pricey for pizza 
Great Atmosphere:-)"}
{"text":"This pizza was a pleasant surprise!  For some reason I didn't think I'd like it so I've been putting off having it for months.  But tonight we were looking for something quick and close to home, and we had a coupon.  

Service was friendly and the pizza was ready when we arrived.  The prices seem a little steep but with the coupons that come in the coupon mailers they're more reasonable.  

We had the thin crust and it was actually very good!  Didn't expect the pizza to be cut in small squares but it was fun to eat like that :)  The bottom of the crust had a cool texture, like \"crust crumbs\", so-to-speak.  Next time I'll try the deep dish pie.  And I can't wait to try the zeppoles.  Any place that has those is OK in my book! 

Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The Chicago pizza is the most delicious pizza that I've ever had.  I am still drooling over it.  I didn't know they have  hamburger too until I saw someone else had it next to my table.  I ordered the hamburger with mushrooms on my 2nd visit there.  Very tasty and moist.  My kids had the chicken wings and in love with them.  They want chicken wings every Tuesday now.  My hubby had the spaghetti meat balls but wasn't as impressed as I was.
For desserts, the tiramisu was pretty decent.
It's a great stop for family dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place the Cajun fries and wings are best in Las Vegas. I live the service me and my girlfriend usually go on a Friday night for the late night happy hour and we always get great service from Ally (Pretty sure I spelled it wrong) she already knows what we are going to order each time makes you feel welcomed and a part of the family."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  The friendly atmosphere, the knowledge of the staff, the quality of the food is always consistent. This is all, in my opinion, because of the management. They are on top of things and ensure the product is made right every time. I never have had a problem. Jess is the best!!  Knowledgeable, driven, bubbly, always smiling and makes sure her staff works like rockstars!!  10 stars to them and Jess!!  And it's an added bonus if Shelly is there!  Her smile and bubbly personality will keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza! One of the best in town. Plus, after 10p beers are $4. We enjoy coming here for a fun Friday night pizza and drinks - almost feels like a family in the bar area. Take out and delivery don't disappoint either! We continue to recommend this location to friends."}
{"text":"Hands down Rosatti's has the best pizza in Henderson/Las Vegas. I absolutely love their deep dish pizza with pepperoni's and mushrooms (plus a side of ranch!). On the weekends, make sure to order an hour before you want to eat as it usually takes that long to have your menu selections created and delivered. Another really good menu item is the garlic knots. They are so warm and gooey----just delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Ordered deep dish AND stuffed crust pizza with onions anchovies spinach and pineapple. 

After eating a slice, I realize there is no stuffed crust. I called them to clarify why its missing the stuffed crust and clarified that their version is crust inside the ingredients. This isn't exactly what I ordered. Stuffed crust is usually tge crust stuffed with cheese. They told me that should have been removed from their menu and the person taking my order should have explained that but did not. So I asked for reimbursement of some sort and rhey told me manager will contact me in a few days. 

I did enjoy the food and the taste. The only things to make this place better is making each ingredient worth the cost. For $1.80 for add'l ingredient, I expect to have each ingredient in each bite,  but I didnt. Also, make sure to give customers what they are actually ordering."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my boss. I got the thin crust pizza with cheese. The sauce wasn't too heavy and the pizza was cooked well done. My friends enjoyed it as well. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This little pizza place is unbelievably good. They have a friendly staff and good service. They opened up a new bar area, which my wife and I love. In my opinion the pizza is much better than some of the other pizza places in town. Don't go to the Streets of New York for pizza, come to Rosatis and enjoy a good pizza cold beer and friendly staff."}
{"text":"You don't get a chain feeling from this location. The female staff is  cute and the food is consistent, as a Italian style food guru I would return for a easy comfort meal."}
{"text":"New to town and we were looking for a great new pizza place and we found it. Great pizza. The dough is not tough or chewy like most fast chain pizza places. Delicious Caesar salad and cannoli for dessert. We will be coming back weekly!!"}
{"text":"Hum this place has no Antipasto salid or eggplant parmigiano but a selection of burgers so we had a pizza and chicken Alfredo.  Overall its ok."}
{"text":"Deep Dish Meat Mania & BBQ Chicken pizzza absolutely good...but my kids/ young adults wanted the BBQ its not that great definitely will continue 2 eat here every other week..."}
{"text":"This joint brags about their thin-crust pizza being Chicago style - a well-deserved title. My mom (a Chicago native) and I got two pizzas for take-out the other evening. Service was friendly and the pizzas were ready in the quoted time period. Prices were totally reasonable ($23 for two 12\" pizzas). They even cut their pizza in squares and put the little plastic white table/box holder in the middle, just like in Chicago. So good that both me and my mom ate our whole pizzas in one sitting. Would order next time with \"extra cheese\" though."}
{"text":"Food is always great tasting & consistent each time I order. Definitely authentic tasting."}
{"text":"My parents had a coupon for this place, so we decided to stop by and check it out.  We ordered the mozzarella sticks and a thin crust of The Godfather (hot giardiniera = yum!).

The mozzarella sticks were crisp and the cheese was gooey.  Pretty basic and what I would expect of mozz sticks.  As for the pizza, the crust was light and crispy, and the sauce and toppings were on point.  Let's just say this was a pretty damn good pizza.

Next time, I definitely want to give the deep dish a try and see how it stacks up against the real thing in Chicago."}
{"text":"Horrible , ordered delivery online over 70 dollars worth of food. Called them an hour later to confirm, they said it was an 1 1/2 deliver. Ok ordered it at 6:30. Then 2 hours later no food. Called again, oh we tried to delivered it an hour ago And no one answered. Find out they went to old address not the order address. And when we called an hour after we placed the order,  they said it was even done yet, and hour later no food and said it was delivered an hour ago. Hello you said an hour ago it was still a half hour out. It's only a 70 dollar order, Really!!!  Oh totally bs. Don't not order from this place. Wasted 2 hours. Ridiculous. It was never delivered to us, plus your time fame of when it left your building, to what you told us was off by a lot!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place, pizza is excellent.  Service has always been good to me. I've read a couple of reviews that stated that the service was lacking. Well these are high school kids and their learning. But their courteous and the most important thing is that the pizza is great. I always have a thin crust extra sausage and cheese. Haven't had a deep dish yet. It's going to happen soon! Plus I was born a raised in Chicago so I know good pizza this place has a product that is very tasteful. You can see and taste that Rosati's cares about the presentation of the food their selling. Cheese is fresh sausage is seasoned just right. I haven't used condiments yet don't need to. Great price the Buffalo Wings are great and I've also had the Fried Mushrooms also great."}
{"text":"Yikes. Wings were not good at all. Pizza was ok. They have a guy playing the guitar, he was pretty good. Beer was good ;). 
Next time: make own pizza, grill some wings, drink some water."}
{"text":"I don't mean to complain at all. The food was great. Service was great besides the young lady on the phone repeatedly telling me that prices were managed by the owner. Which I totally get! But this little container of pasta was damn near $12 lol. Twelve dollars for this small portion. I could have got me something bigger at a dine in restaurant lol. Lord have mercy. 

I'm just saying. Very pricey. 
But it is what it is. Thought I would share so other customers knew what to look for."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and so happy it opened near my home. We come here to watch football games and eat AMAZING food at least once a week. It is so nice to enjoy it all in a totally smoke free place! The staff is awesome, attentive and remember their regulars. Definitely try the double dough pizza, which we now get every time. The Chicago deep dish is authentic and can feed an army! The subs are huge and good for two meals for me. Again, I love them and so happy to have them in the neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"I love the new cannolis keep them maybe add choc. chips again but soo much better and creamier. Good Job Rainbow and Windmill."}
{"text":"My Chicago Deep Dish Meat Mania was made to perfection! Right on time, great service awesome spot! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I have had their pizza and salads! Finally a good fast place to pick up a salad in a hurry."}
{"text":"EW!!!!!!!! The mgr. is a teenage kid who is extremely obnoxious. Food took about an hour & there was a hair in the pizza. The kid/manager joked \"whats the big deal, i washed my hair!\" DISGUSTING! I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy! Horrible service, horrible food."}
{"text":"Came here on a quick dinner decision . It's a cute little family setting . There's a bar and a few booths , tv's for the game and a side for To go orders. The server there was extremely nice and she worked the room without anyone complaining . I ordered a deep dish and it was SURELY enough to feed two ! It was pretty great . 

The wings were delicious! Will come here agai"}
{"text":"Omg!! Really oily/ buttery food
I order fettuccine Alfredo for to go  and you could really see thick layer of butter on it , couldn't eat it
Pizzas are expensive for the size 
Wouldn't do to go again or visit the place"}
{"text":"Chicago deep dish pizza im a midwesterner and this is what fridays are all about back home excellent"}
{"text":"It seems that Chi-town has come to me even though I just moved away from there! There's a few Rosatis in Chi-town that I've had pizza in. Now, it's no Pizzano's in downtown but it will suffice for being 1,500 miles away from good pizza. :D"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that if I receive exceptional service, I ensure everyone knows about it; same goes for when I receive terrible service.

My friends and I have ordered from this Rosati's location several times.  It is truly hit & miss.

Last month, we placed an order for a pizza, fried mushrooms & stuffed jalapenos.  The pizza was fantastic.  The mushrooms & jalapenos were terrible.  Half of them were still cold, to the point where they didn't seem like they were cooked/fried all the way through.  We called Rosati's to see if we could get new mushrooms & jalapenos.  The manager got lippy & told my friend \"fried food isn't meant for delivery or carry out\".  Then why is it on the menu & why do you offer to deliver it?  After 10 minutes on the phone, the manager begrudgingly agreed to bring another order of each out.

Today took the cake, however.  I order the same pizza every time from Rosati's.  I stress \"extra sauce\" every single time, to the point where the person taking the order tells me \"a ton of sauce\", no problem!

Rosati's brought the pizza out & unfortunately it didn't have extra sauce, at all.  My girlfriend called to see if they'd be willing bring out a pizza to our liking.  The smartass punk manager tells her \"the pizza does have extra sauce, I know because I made it, so you're wrong\".  Managerial maturity at it's finest. He proceeds to tell her he'll give her a \"$5 credit for next time\".  Normally I'd be OK w/this, but after the manager decided to be a dick about the entire issue, we told him that wasn't acceptable & another pizza needs to get sent out.

Again, after back & forth with this degenerate, he agreed to bring one out \"only if you exchange your current pizza with the new one.\"  Fine by me, we haven't touched the original pizza.

Needless to say, the customer experience at this place is substandard, and even that is a stretch.  Very disappointed & I'll be taking my business elsewhere moving forward."}
{"text":"Strayed away from the usual and I was sorely dissapointed. I splurged this time and ordered $50 worth of food for myself...I couldn't decide :-/ 

Ordered The Works pizza. Small for about $18. There are too many toppings on this thin crust pizza. The crust never even had a chance to get crispy and have a nice char. Way too many olives as well. I really like margherita pizzas with fresh tomatoes and basil on top. But the fresh tomatoes atop this pizza did absolutely nothing to add to the flavor. 

Had a hankering for Chicken parmesan and ordered that. Mediocre at best. The breadstick tasted like those premade frozen ones.

 Ceasar salad was good and cheesy garlic bread was great!"}
{"text":"Love this local pizza shop! Our family has ordered here for several years, always great service and consistent food.

The hot sauce tends to be on the hotter side so we only choose the \"mild\" sauce and it's warm enough.

I would recommend this pizza shop."}
{"text":"I've never had a disappointing experience here! (Reason for the 4 star is price, though it is still delicious, it is a little overpriced in my opinion.) I have tried pizza, salad, bread sticks, pasta, and wings from here on separate occasions and they have all been outstanding.

 The wings are really delicious and fresh, the Anti-pasti salad is a definite must try. 

My favorite pizza from them has been the Super Stuffed Classic Combo. I tried it the other night and it was to die for.  Definitely a pizza to share, it's about 3 inches thick and pretty heavy in the box! I had to eat it the forbidden way with a knife and fork but I'll forgive them ;). One slice had me full, but that was fine because even as a left-over it was delicious (of course not as delicious as when it was fresh out of the oven).

The staff is always really friendly and easy to talk to, really great with suggestions as well! I'm happy that I live so close to this gem."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Chicago pizza pub. Conveniently located within walking distance of several major 300+ unit apartment villages in the southwest neighborhood of Enterprise. Most Mountain's Edgies can count on the Chicago pie being better than the coupon stuffing national chain delivery places, but hey if you want Heatza-Phut, Little Pizza! Pizza!, or that Papa more power to you. This restaurant offers dine-in, pickup, and delivery. 

The pub has several great beers on tap and a selection of drinkable wines and huge televisions playing all manner of popular sporting events. Seating is limited because of the immense popularity of the business from surrounding renters looking for a chill sports bar with good food. This location is conveniently located within Smith's Shopping Center at the corner of Rainbow and Windmill and is a big draw for the hugely popular neighborhood.

The pizza comes in several delicious varieties: thin, double-dough, pan, and Chicago style deep dish and even calzone. Pastas, wings, and salads available.

Stable, friendly crew with charisma and charm. Only minor drawbacks: wayyyyy busy , nicely crowded because of popularity ( brainstorm: buy out the comic book store next door and expand!! #dreamingon ) , no hard alcohol (#drats), not open 24 hours, no gaming. Aw, heck... these all sound like advantages instead of disadvantages.

Give these cool peeps a try when you are around the neighborhood. You might like 'em!"}
{"text":"I just ordered 2 separate orders of 6 wings with fries, and a cheeseburger with fries.. I waited an hour and 15 minutes for it to be delivered... and when It was delivered, there was only 1 order of fries for three meals. (Mind you these were NOT meals, more like APPETIZERS) The boneless wings I had were smaller than chicken nuggets... we paid $40 for what we thought was 3 meals and ended up disappointed when we realized they were all the size of a kids meal. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I love the food here, especially the deep dish pizza.  The delivery drivers have always been courteous and fast. They are a bit more expensive, but the quality is so good, it's worth it."}
{"text":"What do you call  raw pizza dough? ROSATI'S!
What do you call sauce so thin it barely covers the pizza? ROSATI'S
What do you call so few ingredients on the top of a pizza that an ant would starve walking between them? ROSATI'S!!!!

We ordered and they gave our pizza to another house! They called and said they were sorry and did we still want to order a Pizza? SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! Are you kidding? It was after 8 and now we have no dinner! So they said if we wanted  them to remake, we could get 50% off...NEXT TIME WE ORDERED! Earth to Rosati's: WHAT NEXT TIME? I suggested a discount RIGHT NOW! They gave 50% with a promise of 30 minutes. Over an hour later they came... with cold pizza. The pizza was extra cheese, black olives, mushrooms and tomatoes with bacon and peperoni on top of that for one half. You couldn't find more than five mushrooms on the 18\" pizza. Cheese was very thin and only covered the middle with at least a two inch ribbon of the flat part of the dough with no cheese, very little sauce and not other ingredients on it...then the crust of another inch and a half wide. It was undercooked dough and cold. So they clearly took the 50% off the bill and also off the ingredients! It was the worst pizza I have ever had, made even worse by their absolute ineptness.  

They said their double dough was like hand tossed. WRONG!! It was so thick it didn't even COOK! It was like most pan Pizza would be. The dough was rubbery and raw and tasteless. The sauce sooooo thin it was pink instead of red. The cheese was also barely noticeable...and remember, I ordered EXTRA CHEESE! Do yourself and your family a big favor NEVER ORDER FROM THIS FAILURE OF A PIZZA PARLOR! If you have hated, despised, awful people in your life, send them to ROSATI'S for the worst pizza they will ever eat. I am surprised people who take their kids their don't lose the kids for abuse! This is not suitable for my dogs. Italians the world over are crying that this place even calls itself a Pizza joint. BTW This hunk of vulture crap was originally 40 bucks. That is in US money. FOUR OH 40! Papa Murphy does a better job. Creaser's Pizza Pizza does a better job. Totino's 88 cent store bought pizza is better than this. As I look at the pictures below it is as clear as the nose on your face that they skimped on all the ingredients after effing up our order. These guys are laughing all the way to the bank while pizza disappointment blankets the valley. Don't give these fakes another dime!"}
{"text":"Was in the area wanted pizza so I Yelped and there it was I am a pizza connoisseur I was surprise how good  this pizza is good quality !! I will definitely be back when in town great pie !!"}
{"text":"Not all Rosati's have the same owner.

59th Ave. location serves some of the best pan and Chicago stuffed pizza in the Valley.  Cheese, sauce, and crust all come together beautifully and remind me of Giordano's and other pizzarias in Chicago when I lived there.

Service is great.  Order is ready when indicated.  This location is take-out only."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, and that's why they get 2 stars.  Ordered delivery, and found that they charge $3 to deliver.  Why does this upset me?  Because now instead of tipping the driver $4-$5, he/she gets nothing.  I refuse to order from this place ever again knowing they are charging me to buy their over priced pizza (if you compare it to others, it's far more) and charging me, essentially having the consumer pay for their delivery drivers.  You can't have both.  Will I pay extra for your pizza but not have to pay your drivers salary?  Yes.  Will I pay extra and pay extra again?  No.  You better have phenomenal pizza to try to pull this off, and they don't.   Have you ever had COSTCO pizza?  $10, and it's just as good, if not better."}
{"text":"After a day of grocery shopping just wanted to relax with some delivery.  Being a Illinois native, I'm pretty picky about my deep dish. This is as good as being back home.  Highly recommend this place.  Great customer service, fantastic delivery service."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS PLACE...unless you want to enjoy a cold pizza an hour late. This has happened twice now in the past month. I will admit that the pizza is actually good, but when you have to wait two hours when the stated max time is an hour and you must reheat it once it Finally arrives, it just isn't as tasty. We live eight minutes from the location and called after waiting an hour and a half and the response was, \"it's on the way!\"  no reason as to why it's been so long, and then we continued to wait for 30 more minutes. **We also really enjoyed having ranch dressing with our GREEK salads... 

There are PLENTY of other pizza places and even if this pizza was actually the \"best\" (which it's not), it is  worth the time OR getting the wrong order."}
{"text":"Can't say enough nice things about this place 
Amazing food and great staff!! 
Thank you Mark and Shelly!!"}
{"text":"I've gotten pizza delivered from this place 100's of times and have never had a problem. I went and ate at the restaurant, and can honestly say, I will never order from them again. Sarah, our waitress, is the most unprofessional person I have ever met. Working in the restaurant business, I'm glad I don't have any employees like her. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Rosatis is apparently not the place to go on a sat night. Got a Chicago pizza that we seemed to wait forever for. Usually so good, this time was super doughy, minimal sauce, and somehow managed to be overcooked on the bottom. Baked mostaccioli and the one breadstick (like an old stale Olive Garden stick) were  just all around a thumbs down.  
The Caesar salad  was good... 
Would give 2.5 of half stars were available
While we waited an order was brought back in and a table was having some sort of issue with their order too"}
{"text":"This place is very good. My favorite pizza is the Chicago deep dish. Very filling. I go there at least once a week. The wings and fingers are also very good."}
{"text":"Horrible. Italian beef sandwich which on the menu says piles high with meat, had a few slices. Only filled a quarter of the sandwich. I took the beef from one side of the bread to the other and it still wasn't sticking out of the bread. Ordered baked ravioli got regular ravioli. Beer was hit or miss on warm or cold. Best part, up at 3am with shooting pain in my stomach."}
