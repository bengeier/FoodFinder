{"text":"Found this place with the help of Yelp while traveling. It's a place you'd easily overlook. It was great. Tiny little hole in the wall and was packed.  Great food! I had the beef Manhattan and the mashed potatoes were real- REAL!  The service was friendly and speedy despite the crowd. The atmosphere wasn't much to look at, but don't be deterred. Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Kids love coming here. Love the diner atmosphere. Good burgers. Crunchy onion rings. As for the last post, no its not fancy, but it's not supposed to be."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  I hate franchise restaurants and will search out any privately owned everywhere I go.  This place is awesome.  The daily specials are special, you have to get there early or they are sold out.  My favorite Roast beef manhattan and BBQ Ribs.   The place when you first walk in is a little strange, it's a little gift shop and you kind of wonder if there is a dining area. It's a local favorite and you'll see why after you have dined there."}
{"text":"Mikes Grill is a hit with the locals. It's simple, the staff is nice, and you never get a bad meal. There is a nice variety to choose from with daily specials. Price is comparable to most chain fast food restaurants but the quality is way better here. A local business that sponsors many of the areas sports teams. What more can you ask for? It's not supposed to be fancy, it's a lunch diner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to Madison to \"get away\" as often as we can. We love to look for little hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop type places to eat. This one was very clean, workers were friendly, but the food was not great. We tried  the chili, which was bland and a little strange with pieces of spaghetti floating in it? He had a fish sandwich and I had a cheeseburger.  Both  were just frozen, processed-type sandwiches.  Nothing special... prices were very reasonable. Oh, and bring cash. No credit cards."}
{"text":"My four brothers and I stopped by Madison to see where one of them lived years ago. It was lunch time, and we wanted to eat at a local Madison restaurant. We chose Mike's Grill based on Yelp reviews. We've been on a four day road trip, and we were looking for good food and friendly service. Mike's food and everyone who worked there were awesome! If you want a great meal with friendly service in Madison, Mike's Grill is the place to go!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good home cooked breakfast and lunch this is the place locally owned and always great service"}
{"text":"Mike's is in a tired strip mall on Route 62.  When you walk in, you are not sure there is a restaurant there.  The front of the shop is sparsely stocked with cloth purses, some resale stuff and a lot of empty shelf space.  It is just... odd.  The grill is in the back of the store and offers standard breakfast fare.  I ordered biscuits and gravy.  I don't know if it was good by B&G standards because I have never had it before.  The biscuit was raw or something.  I liked the gravy and it had a lot of black pepper.  An order of bacon was $1.75 and said it was 4 pieces.  It was more like 8 and while paper thin, tasty.  Steve had eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns.  He said they were good.  The bill with 2 beverages was $11.00.  Mike's is an... interesting experience."}
{"text":"Good is pretty standard American breakfast but the service was super quick. Tasty and cheap breakfast."}
