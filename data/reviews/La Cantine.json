{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for Sunday brunch after finding out that the wait at Lawrence would be 25 minutes (they called an hour later saying a table was ready. An hour.) 

I had always heard good things about La Cantine and was eager to try it out. There wasn't much of a wait, however the staff seemed really disorganized- 2 separate servers came to ask how many people we were, and 3 different servers came to ask us for a drink order. 

The food itself was good. It seemed like a mish-mash of random food thrown together, but it's all good. We had the scrambled eggs-stuffed croissant and the eggs benedict on toasted pistachio and nut bread (unfortunately, very burnt). Both dishes were served with fruit, a scoop of mashed potatoes (a nice change from the usual roasted potatoes) and some leafy greens.

The tables are well-spaced apart and the music is at a tolerable level (vs. L'Avenue where the tables are claustrophobically close and the music deafeningly loud). 

All in all, a good experience, it's just frustrating to have to repeat the same thing to 3 different servers."}
{"text":"I went there last night and was greeted by a very sweet waitress. The service is good an the atmosphere is very nice. I ordered a hamburger steak with extra foie gras. After around twenty minutes wait the waitress apologies for the waiting because the foie gras need extra time to cook. And the wait is well worth it: the foie grad is nicely cooked it is so juicy and full of favor. The gravy is amazing too. The other thing that really impress me is the onion ring and the gravy. Too bad the hamburger streak itself is a bit dry."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant during our trip to Montreal over Thanksgiving.  We went for brunch and highly recommend others do the same.  It's got a great, neighborhood-y vibe and was the only restaurant we visited that had a line (albeit one that moved fairly quickly).  You can tell that this is a place that locals love!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good brunch place, so I decided to give this one a try. Service was ok, but we had to remind the waiter of a few things he forgot to bring, plus the eggs benny were overcooked (supposed to have a liquid yoke) and we had to send them back twice before they got it right. Otherwise, the menu is very original, reasonably priced and tasty. It gets very crowded for brunch, make sure you get there before 11h30. I recommend trying their evening menu, which offers a fresh twist on french-canadian cooking, the stuff i used to eat when i was a kid, but grown up version, such as a club sandwich, but instead of chicken you get duck confit... And great cocktails too! Overall a fun place to go for drinks with friends, but not for a quiet romantic evening."}
{"text":"Good original brunch, bit expensive but fun plates and good tastes. 

You might consider waiting a good time if you are more than 2 on the weekend mornings. Also the service is some time a bit slow and some find it a bit expensive compared to any normal breakfast restaurant. But it's worth it and I like it.

Like we say in french. Quand tu es lendemain de veille, ça change le mal de place!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Tried many of the dishes. The concept is interesting, but sometimes the flavours were missing. The ribs were definitely not ginger and garlic. The service was good but not stellar. Nice decor and an interesting menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sandwich I've had from an Establishment. I was looking for a good Vegetarian sandwich being my spot I usually go to was closed permanently. I yelped and this place popped up I read some good reviews decided why not. I got the Veggie Sandwich, . Everything complimented each other I added pesto with a extra charge but it was worth it. The spot serves gourmet style sandwiches but reasonable prices. 5 stars. Check them out if your tired of the mundane sandwich shops."}
{"text":"A great brunch. We arrived about noon, and were seated at the bar within 10 minuntes. We ordered the LA CHAMPIGNONNE (Mushroom Lovers on the English menu) , and the MANGE TES CROUTES. The Pear and rinded goat cheese on fancy pistachio bread. I loved how the Mange was served with a brûlée yogurt. A very nice touch. It was also nice to have something sweet, without being too sweet. The Mushroom Lovers however did not have many mushrooms on it! What a shame. Quel domage! Large servings (which is a plus), and fresh tasting ingredients. 

The service was good, and friendly, although you could tell they were busy. But I didn't go to chat with the servers, so that was ok with me!

$46 for brunch for two with a coffee and a tea including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Just thinking of the brunch we had here makes me want to get in the car and drive to Montreal! If you are visiting Montreal and want a good brunch, you must head here. My husband's breakfast was more like dessert! He had the Ultra Chocolat and I really think I wouldn't have been able to finish it for breakfast if I had ordered it. I had the Croissant de Soleil. The croissant was huge and amazing!

Each of our meals also came with a citrus juice shooter which was amazing in and of itself. The mixed fruit is not like what you get in America which is usually cantaloupe, honey dew, and another melon or other random fruit thrown in. This was pineapple, orange, grapes, pears, strawberries, and grapefruit. I love fresh fruit with breakfast so that made the meal complete for me.

Let me repeat myself. If you are in the Montreal area, eat brunch here!!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch, huge portions, great service

We arrived at Noon, expecting a huge line and was surprised to only wait 5 mins for them to clean up a table. 

I got the Disco Duck Omelet- duck confit with caramelized onions and cheese in a HUGE (HUGE) omelet with caramezlied grapefruit and an apple argula salad, and almost mashed potatoes. It kept me full until dinner time.  
I could NOT believe how huge the plate was. there were at least 6 eggs in the omelet...i'm not even kidding. 

The sevice was great- they weren't warm or super friendly but they were nice, efficient and didn't pull a Parisian attitude (like other places did). 

My friends had the pistachio croque and mish mash which they both loved. Their plates looked gorgeous and huge as well.

When we left, the line was about 12 ppl deep...lucky us!

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Saw this new place on Yelp and thought I would give it a try. I just wanted something easy to order since I didn't feel like cooking. Ordered the veggie sandwich and it def hit the spot!! I was full after that! Delivery was super fast too! I'll def be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I knew I had to come here the minute I looked at the menu. It made me drool. 

Anytime I would be in Montreal, I would head straight to L'Avenue, but this is just a few blocks down the street, and it was amazing. 

The crowd in here is older, 30 somethings with families, or just a gathering of friends. I brought my mom here, and although it was cramped a little, she felt comfortable. It's like all the 20 somethings go to L'Avenue. 

The decor is orange and brown, retro and funky. The people are hip, and friendly. 

The food, look at the descriptions on the menu!

($13.95) CROISSANT DE SOLEIL
Croissant avec ufs brouillés, notre jambon 
effiloché, cheddar vieilli,  sauce aux épinards, 
patates presque pilées, câline de bines et fruits

($13.95) LA CHAMPIGNONNE
2 ufs pochés sur un pouding au pain noix et 
poireaux, sauce crémeuse aux champignons, 
patates presque pilées, fruits, pancakes, 
tomate au chèvre, baguette grillée

MANGE TES CROUTES
Croûte de pain aux pistaches, poires pochées,  
chèvre La Bûche,  miel infusé au gingembre, 
patates presque pilées, fruits, 
mini crème brûlée au yogour

YUM.
I got La Champignonne, and I got a plate full of fruit and covered in a mushroom cream sauce. It even came with two little pancakes. 
My mom got the Croissant De Soleil. The croissant was flaky and fresh and it was covered in a spinach cream sauce. 

Looking around, everyone else got amazing foods as well, and, like usual Montreal fashion, they do not skimp on the fixings. 

Will be back next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Unique, creative, delicious sandwiches. I can't wait to come back and try out a new sub. That crunch bread is tasty!"}
{"text":"Avis aux amoureux de la cuisine Québécoise : la Cantine est « ze place to be »! Ou plutôt « to go ».  Pierre-Luc Chevalier y cuisine avec amour et malice toutes les recettes de son enfance et les partage avec nous que ce soit pour le dîner vite-vite sur le pouce, pour un souper plus tranquille ou même pour le brunch des fins de semaine. Vous connaissiez le pudding chômeur? Eh bien venez donc goûter son « Pain perdu et retrouvé »! Et il en a d'autres comme ça! Moi, j'aime particulièrement le « mange tes croûtes », une tartine de pain chèvre et poire qu'on mange pendant un brunch. 
Côté déco on est dans le funky-vintage : un vrai retour dans les 70's. mais pour autant, ne croyez pas que vous serez assailli par le bruit et le monde, car la Cantine c'est aussi un endroit paisible où on peut venir pour se détendre. Choisissez votre côté : bistrot ou café? L'un et l'autre sont à tester.
Attention, si vous voulez venir bruncher à plus de 6, il faut absolument réserver!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, Québec has its own traditional flavors and meals, such as Pâté Chinois (Chinese Paté - which was the meal - beef, potatoes, corn, with ketchup - eaten by Chinese train workers back in the days), Tourtière (Meat pie), and, of course, poutine. Think about comfort food, and you'll know how I feel when I sit in front of my plate of Pâté Chinois.

The problem with it is that is has a small gastronomic potential. Not anymore: Cantine revisits these classics of Québécoise cuisine, by adding the magic touch that makes it being interesting to people who didn't grow up eating a weird mixture of beef-potatoes-corn. 

I went for brunch last Sunday, and ordered a nut french-toast, covered with local goat cheese, caramelized pears and ginger infused honey, which was served with a mini-crème brûlée, fruits and homemade jams. It was just fantastic! The design of the place makes the experience even more enjoyable.

On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend to order the plain bacon and egg: the plate was too small and had nothing special to it. For the price, you should order something more special. And also, the coffee was wack.  

You can also go to their boutique to bring back home some local flavor..."}
{"text":"Having brunch in Montreal is our last to-do before we headed back to Manhattan. We relied on Yelp to give us guidance and we ended up in La Cantine. It was Sunday afternoon and there was a line although not as terrible as it could get in West Village here. 

We waited about twenty minutes before we finally got seated in the back room where there is comfy sofa. I ordered the Aunt Baby's Club which has bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes and mayo and eggs inside a soft and tender bun. It also comes with mashed potato and fresh sliced fruit. I really like my sandwich and it is just very buttery and cheesy at the same time. 

I got to try my husband's La Totale and it is definitely the best on the menu if you are a meat lover. The ham is so fresh and and bacon is juicy and fatty. I think we all felt food coma after the meal. The price is about $14 a plate without any juice or coffee. So it is about $20 a person if you order an entree and a coffee. Glad we ended our brunch lovely and full!"}
{"text":"I've been to La Cantine twice now in one week. Any time a new restaurant opens in this part of town I'm pretty excited and La Cantine didn't disappoint. 

For my first visit I got the Le Montagne which is prosciutto, raclette, pickles and mustard on a baguette. Sort of like a French/Swiss/Cuban sandwich? The baguette was awesome and I appreciate how easy it was to handle and eat (compared to the Americana.. which we will get to). The pickles were sliced up sweet pickles which is different and heartier than chips. The raclette cheese is a mild, soft cheese similar to Brie but usually served warm. As my sandwich sat the cheese got firmer but I actually liked it better because it gave me something more to bite into. I know I'm weird. They definitely pile on the prosciutto and I actually could have used a bit less of it. Again, I'm weird. 

For my second visit I tried the Americana because I've been wanting to try Dutch Crunch bread forever. This is a wayy bigger and messier sandwich filled with flavors. I thought it was chunky mayo falling out of the sandwich then I remembered it has cream cheese in it. Flame sauce was similar to a chipotle and it was good, but by the end of the meal I was just trying to keep my fingers clean. Dutch Crunch is so good and so unusual. It was nice to get a crunchy bite every so often in the middle of the sauce fest. I got the potato salad side which had a nice golden appearance so you know there's lots of mustard (yay). 

I'd be all down to eat at La Cantine every week but it does get a little spendy quickly, especially when you want to tip. I'm sure I'll be back to try the Buddha Bowls, gelato and macarons though. When you want to splurge on a quality sandwich, La Cantine is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich spot in Vegas. Now this place has changed its name and taken this sandwich off menu. So now it's a secret menu. Item. Winston copper with psycho sauce! 9/10.
Le gargantu 9/10. Just a different flavor profile. But a solid great sandwich with alot of meat. This ain't your subway. You will eat half and probably be full but wont wanna stop."}
{"text":"Stopped by this cute looking spot for brunch- there was another group in front of us, but we were seated right away. The restaurant was bustling, and had we been just a tad later, we would have had quite the wait. The decor was fun- orange and brown- modern with a 70s throwback. 

Everything was in French, but we could make out enough to feel confident about our order. We got the 'croissant de soleil' (croissant, eggs, cheddar, jamon, spinach sandwich) and the 'la totale' (eggs, bacon, jamon, pancakes, and mini toasted baguette). Each entree came with a fruit salad, seasoned mashed potatoes, baked beans, mixed greens, and a basil and pear shooter. An incredible amount of food which was all very tasty, no salt or pepper needed.

Brunch for two ran us $32 - but given the quantity, we got our money's worth. Needless to say we walked out in a slight food coma. I would absolutely recommend this and would head back for brunch next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to get some of the French touch. I m French and very picky with food and I can guarantee if you want discover some of the French food or if you miss home stop by this place. 
And the crew working there are terrific and so friendly. 
I definitely will come back!!!"}
{"text":"La Cantine formerly The Sandwich Spot became even better.
My review will closely echo Jessi R.'s but that just proves it is true.
This was our family's favorite sandwich restaurant and we were sad to see it go, HOWEVER it has proved to be improvements in every way! The food is so fresh and full of flavor, from the savory meats and the tangy sauces to the sweet desserts. 
The customer service is beyond excellent!!! They always welcome customers with a warm greating. Alissa new our order after just one visit and since my daughter and I have to eat gluten free this is very comforting. I highly recommend this restaurant,  whether you used to go to the old spot or have never been...come try it now!"}
{"text":"Great French  Restaurant with amazing food .
They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ...
The food was delivered extremely fast on 9 miles from the restaurant !
Definitely will   Order again !!
Thanks La Cantine"}
{"text":"I was super bummed to see my favorite sandwich leaving, but once I tried the new menu, I was amazed. The high end sandwich concept with the same inexpensive cost is brilliant! Who doesn't love cleaner, fresher food, fast easy and convenient! 

The gelato! Must try the gelato, with the heat rolling in fast, I was thrilled to see there was a one stop shop for both my love of sandwiches and gelato! 

Super family friendly. The remodel seems almost complete, and through it all they have managed to still create the \"taste bud popping\" food made to perfection, and an enjoyable environment. 

Love the ownership change, and so excited to see this place grow!"}
{"text":"Friend made me go 30 minutes out of the way to eat here, which I didn't really didn't feel like doing. I not only would have went 30 minutes , but probably an hour to have their amazing sandwich. Everything was soooo tasty.  We had their roast beef, pastrami and salami with some spreads that the worker said we would like. He was right. One of the best , if not the best sandwiches I ever eaten.  Amazing!!"}
{"text":"When 2 of your friends tell you there is a new cool sandwich place who opened 3 days ago in the corner of 95 and Cheyenne, I had to go on my Saturday lunch.
I was glad to get a warm welcome as soon as I came in from the girl behind the counters. 
I ordered from the Chef selection board \"Le Veggie\"  ($10)The girl told me they were out of grill eggplant and they replaced it with zucchini.  From the Other Yummi Stuff board I ordered a build your own Veggies bowl ($8). 
The Sandwich came as a panini who made me very happy. Absolutly delicious and my surprise came from the little spice on the tapenade spread. By the taste of the entire combination, you understand very fast there is a famous culinary chef behind the project. 
They bowl was good and I was happy it came with only 3 veggies who force me to not eat to much. The curry vinaigrette was exceptional and such a nice touch to add extra vinaigrette on the side.
On the desserts bord I see all this Gelato flavors, but since I am Vegan and I don't see any sorbet, maybe not for me... I decide to ask just in case... and YES they have sorbet !!!! Coconut is my winner ($3).To be honest, maybe the best sorbet I ever had and this is definitely a 5 stars winning for the place.
I just fall in love with this place and I will be back very soon. Thank you \"La Cantine\" !"}
{"text":"Exhausted and depressed by the number of overrated, mundane, and often questionable restaurants in Montreal, I was astonished by this gem. Every little bit of the decor, atmosphere, music and food was personalized and original without being over the top. I had their: 

MUSHROOM LOVER 
2 poached eggs on a leek bread-pudding, 
creamy mushroom béchamel, pancakes, 
almost mashed potatoes, fruit cup, 
goat cheese tomato, baguette 
CAN 13.95 

Subtle and interesting flavors with great presentation. It is not haute cuisine, but it is convincing and authentic. 

The service lacked any of the belligerent retro-attitude towards serving an English speaker, and was competent and attentive. 

The value for money of La Cantine's pricing cannot be topped. 

A recommendation without a singular reservation. Almost unimaginable."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place n town... Previously known as \"The Sandwich Spot\" still has great sammies, bomb sauces made from scratch and nothing but fresh ingredients all day! Dutch crunch all the way. Same faces same place!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff but the quality of the food is no longer what it used to be. Not even close! No more complimentary fruit shots or purées. Quality of the dishes as a whole have diminished unfortunately."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. Cool too because you can build your own sandwich or bowl.  They also have macaroons... could it get any better???"}
{"text":"A tasty little French sandwich shop. They have a new menu, but the Americana stayed on the menu. They mentioned that they can make any sandwich that was on The Sandwich Spot menu. The service was awesome, I appreciated the suggestions and ultimately went with the Americana ($9.50). Other popular options are Cordon Bleu, French Dip, Le BBQ.  The Dutch crunch bread was superb, definitely high quality and delicious. The spicy ranch was fantastic as well. Overall a very fresh and tasty creation. The prices are reasonable considering the quality and service. Will definitely be back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"We had such a good time here for Sunday brunch! The only awkwardness is that there's nowhere to wait for a table, so you have to stand in the vestibule and peer in, but otherwise everything was great. The menu is creative and amazing, and all the portions are enormous. The smashed potatoes and baked beans that come with a lot of brunch entrees were so great. And the entrees all come with fresh sliced fruit.

I think the \"Mange Tes Croutes\" (pistachio bread with poached pears, goat cheese, and ginger honey) was the best, but my Croque du Soleil was also good, and the chocolate croissant was better than expected. Would totally come back.

We did have to kind of wave our hands around for a while in order to get the check, because the young waitresses were gossiping and giggling loudly back in their own corner, but that's okay because this place is so cute and the food is so tasty."}
{"text":"Great French spot, delicious sandwiches!
Went there for lunch, tried a few items that made me wanna go back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The lady lives right next door and it took me ~1-2 years to convince her to actually try brunch at Cantine. We'd pass by every week-end, I'd nag, she'd say it looks too pretentious and then we'd end up at either Senzala  or Rapido.

Last week-end, because we were short on time, we decided to take the plunge and see what Cantine is made of. We were very pleasantly surprised! She had what \"Christine R.\" got - the goat-cheese and pear covered nutty bread and that was simply delicious. The (vanilla?) mini creme brule was outstanding and refreshing.

I had the \"champignonne\" option, which is basically two poached eggs with a mushroom sauce, toasted baguette a bowl of fruits and a side of pear puree. My choice was more classical, but excellent nevertheless. In either case, the presentation was exquisite and it was not your typical and standard brunch fare.

For $30, including tax and coffee, but not tip, it's not a bad deal, but certainly not the cheapest around the area. It is, however, a great brunch bistro, where one can relax and savour the food in a 70s style decor."}
{"text":"So bomb. Le Gargantua is the best sandwich is Las Vegas. The Dutch crunch bread is perfect. Really friendly staff. Great desserts too. Cookie ice cream sandwich woooo! So good. Definitely check this out if you want a great meal."}
{"text":"Avez-vous déjà essayer d'expliquer des expressions comme \"Caline de bine\" à des étrangers?

En fin de semaine, alors qu'on essayait de décider quoi commander pour le brunch et que je traduissais le menu au fur à mesure pour ma famille australienne, je me suis fait demander: \"Qu'est-ce que c'est un Caline de bine? Est-ce que c'est un animal local?\"

La lecture du menu a donc menée à une longue discussion par rapport aux expressions québécoises et le fait que plusieurs des items de La cantine font référence à des mots de chez nous.

Le service a été bien même s'il était un peu lent. Au début il n'y avait qu'une serveuse pour la salle au complet donc c'est comprennable. Juste comme on se disait qu'il était temps pour un réchaud de café puisque nos tasses était vides, un deuxième serveur est arrivé avec un caraffe pleine.

L'endroit est à la fois chic et décontracté, ce qui est super pour un brunch relax en famille ou en amoureux. On s'entend jaser même s'il y a de la musique de fond.

Et la bouffe....que de belles assiettes! On n'a pas pu résister et prendre des photos de nos choix tellement on a trouvé ça beau. En plus, ça goûtait aussi bon que ça en avait l'air. On a essayé le Calice de yogurt, la Champignone et le p'tit déjeuner ordinaire (2 zeux, toasts, patates presque pilées, etc.) Tout le monde était bien plein après le brunch, excuse parfaite pour passer le reste de la matinée à se promener dans les rues du quartier."}
{"text":"If you want a first class delicious French sandwich then this is the place you want to go.  The chicken cordon bleu was amazing.  They have creative Chef's specials as well as build your own.  Different breads with different spreads.  Gr8 vegetarian, Reuben, roast beef, ham and other selections.  Best sandwiches in the northwest.  Prices are right and service is super. Although I resisted the desserts looked irresistible."}
{"text":"OMG... I love brunch food and I have never been to a brunch place as amazing as this place! The place was small, but man oh man, was it packed.  We were there for a sunday brunch at around 12:30 and we didn't get a seat until 1pm and we didn't get our food until almost 2pm.  (Apparently the place was busiest at 1pm!)  But it was totally worth the wait!
The decorate was bright and colourful and we got to sit right by the windows in comfy chair...  the only downside about this place is that the space is very limited...
I ordered a mushroom lover (a weekend special) and my friend got the total with some wild boar sausage.  When the food arrived the serving was way more than enough and the taste was amazing!
I am definitely coming back here for more brunch when I am in Montreal again!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the Beuh (Roast Beef) sandwich.  One of the best I've had likely on this continent.

Great vibe, very friendly staff.  They have free wifi, and a few small tables out front (mini-patio).  

Stumbled upon this place on a frigid -25 degree day last winter, and will now likely make a visit every time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"My friend and I, who are only in Montreal for a few days, were SO excited to check this place out, ONLY TO FIND OUT IT WAS CLOSED. DO NOT GO HERE, it's CLOSED."}
