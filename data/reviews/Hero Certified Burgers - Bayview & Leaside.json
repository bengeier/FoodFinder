{"text":"The taste was good, but size, price it was not really good. They do not offer mayo and if you want any sauce for the fries you have to pay."}
{"text":"Sorry, I can't give this place a good review??  I find it hard to give a bad review for a burger?  I've eaten at Hero burger before and found it to be very good, but this time the burger tasted like someone had microwaved it??  Very tough burger and it tasted microwaved? As a kid I microwaved burgers at home and it tasted very similar??  If I had eaten in the restaurant, I would have taken it back, but I took it home.  What a disappointment! the fries were good though, so something good came out of the $14, I spent!"}
{"text":"Gross burger. Weird service. Never again. I repeat..never again. But their soft drinks selection is a plenty. So there's that."}
{"text":"Had a burger. It was great. Service: great. What I want to know is: why is the washroom reserved only for paying customers? Seems archaic and un-neighbourly. In Amsterdam, I was made to pay to use the toilet in McDonald's! When a child came in to Hero Burgers to ask to use the washroom, and was turned away, I thought: I'm a paying customer. I don't need to use the washroom. Can I defer my washroom privileges to the child? Something about this policy does not sit well for me."}
