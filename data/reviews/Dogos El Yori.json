{"text":"Great hot dogs! The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they don't make champurrado anymore. I'm holding the 5th star ransom until they make it again."}
{"text":"El Chipilon esta sabroso. El pan dorado le da buen sabor. El Regular tiene buen sabor pero el pan esta un poco denso/masudo."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, I am from Sonora Mexico where these doggos originated from and let's just say I feel like I'm in Mexico when I'm eating this hot dogs. 
They are the real deal, we've been here multiple times and we plan on going back."}
{"text":"Love these Mexican hot dogs! Great variety of different styles of Sonoran-style hot dogs to choose from as well as plenty of toppings you can add yourself for no extra cost. I have been to El Yori multiple times and have invited friends and family to eat there as well. 

The other hot dog vendors in Mesa don't even come close to the quality and deliciousness of these hot dogs. My favorite is combining the \"chipil√≥n\" with the \"el embarazado\" for a super tasty treat."}
{"text":"Excellent Sonoran hot dog with great toppings and flavor! Thank you for the experience of the specialty stuffed cream cheese. On another level."}
{"text":"Great selection of condiments for a hotdog!!! Not sure if this is standard for a Sonoran hot dog spot... nacho cheese, chorizo, cheddar ruffles remnants, guacamole, parmesan, mushrooms, all the good stuff and more! We ordered the El Chile (the regular with chile) and the El Regular. Loaded them up and enjoyed. Heads up, the parking was a little awkward. It shares the lot with a gas station that closed for renovations."}
{"text":"You might come here for the hot dog but you'll return for their tacos. Hands down the best I've had this side of the U.S. I know you might be thinking \"What does this asian girl know about tacos?\" but a delicious taco transcends race. Please eat here. For the sake of your tastebuds."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in Phoenix/Mesa area. I know my dogos estilo sonora (Hermosillo) to be exact. These are by far the closest thing to Mexico. I love that they have chorizo and melted, warm, cheese as toppings! That's a true Sonoran dogo. Pretty sad that they didn't have fries, maybe next time. A bit pricier than other dogos, but I mean come on all toppings?! I don't mind paying more for a real dogo estilo Hermosillo."}
