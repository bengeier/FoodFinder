{"text":"We ordered a total of 7 dishes. I really enjoyed the Singapore noodles - there was a very nice heat to it and one of the better versions I've sampled. I liked the generous amount of shrimp and thinly sliced red peppers. The salt and pepper shrimp were really good - crisp batter and large size of shrimp. The salt and pepper squid was good too. The house chowmein and house special rice were pretty average - I don't think I would order it again. The tofu and vegetable dish was tasty, but I prefer cubed firm tofu over the type they served (pre-deep fried you get in packages). The vegetables were still crisp and very fresh. Ginger beef was one of the better versions in the city. The portions are generous and the food arrived hot and fresh. No complaints. Pearl Express is our new Chinese take-out spot.  Update -  new year's eve dinner. We ordered a bunch of items. My new favourite items include chicken or shrimp cashews with vegetables. Pearl Express forgot 3 orders of ginger beef but brought it over less than 15 minutes after calling them. It would have been nice if they threw in a little extra something as a gesture but at least they didn't deny we didn't receive everything that we ordered. Didn't care for the fried rice."}
