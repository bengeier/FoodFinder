{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday and liked what I saw and had. We tried coriander dosa, paper masala doesa, Patiala idly (was ok as it had more of butter chicken flavor, not a personal choice) and vagar idly (loved it). All were really good. 
I must add that food is little on a spicy side and is a bit of a fusion of north and south spices.

I look forward to trying other items on the menu and bring my friends and family.

Ambiance: 3 stars. The location has a lot of potential to trendy and vibrant.
Service: 4 stars
Food: 4 stars"}
{"text":"I am writing this review after purchasing chaat items from their stall in the Bollywood Monster Mashup event in Celebration square on 7th August 2015..laughable small portions of aloo masala were served in one plate of pani puri (they were clearly trying to avoid refilling their stocks which is shameful..one should not open a stall for such a crowded event if one is not willing to come prepared to handle the rush!) and mediocre masala pani or flavoured water (there was no tamarind or hint of sweet to counterbalance the pungency of the flavored water)..highly disappointing."}
{"text":"We ordered 5 different dosas, patiala idli (yummy )paneer sizzler.  All the items were so tasty and were surprised with quality of food. Definitely will come back and recommend to family and friends and everyone ...:)"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend and wasn't busy at all so service was good. My husband had the chilli cheese dosa which was delicious however mine wasn't that great. I had the butter garlic dosa and it was so flaky the dosa just kept falling apart in tiny brittle pieces. I've had butter garlic dosa from other dosa restaurants and have had a much better experience. The decor of the restaurant is very bland. When we walked in it looked a bit like a cafeteria layout. Overall I probably would not come here again if I am craving dosas."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!!! I'm so happy about finding this place. 
If you want dosa, this is the place to come to. You'll find everything here from the traditional flavours to unique dishes like dosa with noddles! (might try that next time). 
The service is great. I believe it was the owner who served us when we went. He was kind, friendly and helpful. He got to know what we liked and made some recommendations accordingly. All four of us were very happy with all the dishes we got.
To start, my husband and I got the bhel and spinach vada. The bhel was perfectly seasoned - just the right amount of tang and spice. The spinach vada were light and crispy. The sambhar and chutneys served with the vada were equally delightful :) The tomato chutney is my favourite.
I was so full from my apps that for the main i decided to get something light. So I got the paper dosa. It was soooooo big and thin and crispy!!! It was just perfect... i'm salivating just thinking about it.
I'm going to go back soon so I can try more of their menu. Oh did I mention that everything is made fresh?!! :D"}
{"text":"We had Mysore masala dosa.  It was very very nice.  I went with my wife and 2 kids.  All of them liked the food."}
{"text":"Kalpataru is now our number one spot for dosas! Better than places we have tried in Mississauga, downtown Toronto and on Gerrard St. 

We ordered the Paper Masala Dosa, a gigantic, thin, crispy lentil crepe filled with spiced potatoes and that comes with sides of sambhar, coconut chutney, tomato chutney and sweetened plain yogurt to dunk your dosa into. 

The potato filling was perfectly spiced and flavourful. We were impressed by the dosa itself - evenly thin, perfectly crispy and not greasy! It could not have been better. The sambhar was delicious, flavourful and not too spicy. I particularly loved the sweet yogurt which gave this already amazing dish an unexpected and lovely balance between savoury, spicy and sweet. 

We polished off our dosa and took two more home for breakfast the next day! It was epic even after reheating! 

You know a good dosa when you can eat it without chutney or sambhar. That's what we found. We didn't need any but we certainly scarfed all of it down. 

We'll be back with friends next time!"}
{"text":"This is a family run nice restaurant offering South Indian and Indo-Chinese fusion food.
We ordered Mysore dosa, Hakka noodles and Veg Manchurian.
The food came hot and fresh. I loved the dosa and veg manchurian. I would like to try more of their dosas in future."}
{"text":"We went to this location during the dinner hour. The service was good and the server was friendly. 

We ordered a Pav baji and Butter Paneer dosas. The food was average, nothing special and decent for the price."}
{"text":"The food was extremely delicious. Very authentic!  The service was excellent. Loved the decor as well. It was a bit on the expensive side but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great Variety here ... 

The dosas are out of the world, mixed veg utthapam pizza is a must try here and patiala idly is just awesome ..."}
{"text":"For my first time at this Dosa Resto I was quite impressed with the following:  The service.
-the staff was informative and patiently explained the answers to all of our question.
The Dining Room.
-it doesn't look this big from the outside, but they van accommodate a lot of people.
The Dosas.
-now I can not qualify myself as a Dosa expert, but I enjoyed what ate.  I had the extra spicy crispy dosa with onions, chilli and potato and loved it.  They even refilled the Sambar.  Pretty nice!  A massive selection of all sorts of Dosas.  

Now this was my first scouting mission here and it will not be my last.  The verdict is still not out.  
 
Peace out Yelpers."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant for fresh dosas!  My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant.  We were warmly greeted by the owner, and he made recommendations based on our preferences.  The dosas were freshly made and tasted delicious.  

I have been to Guru Lukshmi many times, and I must say that the dosas at Kalpataru were superior!  

Strongly recommend that you visit this restaurant, and try the dosas!  The lassi drinks are delicious too.  

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Average quality of food !
Connoisseurs avoid buy if u r getting desperate to relieve ur taste buds of South Indian taste , try it !"}
{"text":"Very good dosa, excellent service!!
We had Karamura Paper Masala Dosa, stuffed with mashed potato, dusted with spices, and yes... it's really \"large\". The Dosa was prepared with perfection... not greasy or oily but made nicely crispy!! Had Kadai Paneer, full of spices and aroma.

And must mention... they have excellent customer service, and the place is much larger than it looks from outside."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Very accommodating staff. We were a big group and tried a lot of different varieties of dosa. And pretty much liked all of them. 
Try chocolate dosa it makes a great dessert. 
Will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"We went to this place during lunch hour yesterday and they were closed @ 12:30 Pm. As per their website they said they were open. Also, no one ever answers the phone calls so even though I never got to eat the food I don't think I care to go there anymore."}
{"text":"Good food, but it takes a while to arrive to table.  I believe it's a family business and both the younger male and older male were professional and sweet.

Food took 30-35mins to arrive after ordering, including chai...which arrived after the dosas.

Interior is dim and a bit rundown.  Banquet seating is worn out.  When I arrived, there were empty/dirty trays on half of the tables.  No one was in a hurry to clear the tables, so not the best impression.  The bench I was sitting on was not secured to the wall, so it could've easily tipped over.  Ladies restrooms needed some attending.  Restroom was ice cold, paper towels on the floor, and 1 stall had no toilet paper.

Both dosas were very good though!  Although, I've never had \"terrible\" dosas.  All have been tasty!

I'd recommend this place if you are in the area, but do not go hungry and expecting a spic and span interior.  There were quite a few people who came in for takeout though, so perhaps that's a better option."}
{"text":"Dosa restaurant located on the Misssissauga and Brampton border. Food is good and the service is good. I found that the potatoes were not enough in the Dosa. Flavor-wise, it's good but not the best that I have had."}
{"text":"Got a taste of their food at the Bollywood Mashup at Mississauga Celebration Square.
The Masala Dosa was excellent! I don't do well with spice, but I ate the entire thing (which was a huge serving btw)
Also tried the faloota & it was good too. A bit warm, but that might have been from being in a cooler outside for the entire day.
The line up for their booth was extremely long but they burned through it pretty quickly! I was really impressed with the service; they were extremely friendly despite having 1001 people demanding food from them.
10/10 would recommend to a friend, if you're ever craving dosa go check them out!"}
{"text":"Great Dosas. Although I'm not a big fan of their chutneys, Sambhar is very authentic and tastes like it's home made. Definitely recommend everyone to try their South Indian food (especially Dosa)."}
