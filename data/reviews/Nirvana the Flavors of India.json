{"text":"Very slow service, poor customer service and bad attitude by staff.  We got appetizers, took waiter 45 mins to come back and take dinner order.  When he came back 45 mins later he denied that we had placed the order!  Didn't even apologize.  And in the 1.5 hours we sat there (and we left without having dinner) no one came and offered to refill our drinks or water.  I will never eat here again nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice restaurant interior, okay service.  It's one of those places where it's better to order several dishes and share them, as opposed to ordering your own meal individually. If you don't eat meat, there's a separate vegetarian menu and they have a pretty wide selection. We ordered the curry chicken, lamb vindaloo, chicken kadai, and chicken biryani. Note that you order the rice separately, so it's always a good idea to order a biryani. Make sure to tell them if you want mild because the food is pretty spicy for the average joe. We also got five orders of naan ($2 each order) and a side of basmati rice ($4).  We split the bill for our party of five, and it came to around $20 per person, tips included, which was pretty good.   For the birthday celebrant in our party, we asked if they could do something special and they brought in mango kulfi with a candle on top! I would come here again, just for the curry chicken."}
{"text":"Terrible. I would be humiliated to bring my Indian family here. Will never return.  Many other places to choose from in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Overall: We were lied to and then denied food at the so called buffet. Service was lacking and the food was subpar.   We went to this buffet based on YELP ratings, however we were sorely disappointed with the results. We arrived at about 2:35pm, however the restaurant was closing at 3pm so we asked if we could still have the buffet even though they would be closing soon, and the host (?) assured us that it would be fine and we would still have access to food.  This turned out to be UNTRUE ... as when we tried to re-order food they wouldn't let us. They said the kitchen was closed and that they were closing but just waiting on us to finish ... if they couldn't accommodate us, they should have told us from the beginning.  Had we known that the BUFFET wouldn't really be a buffet, we probably would have gotten take out, eaten a la carte or gone somewhere else!   We felt cheated and lied to! The food was ALRIGHT, but for the price we paid we could've had MORE selection, MORE food and better service!! It was $13.99 for a piddly salad, one serving of everything and a miniature dessert. The best part of the meal was their palak paneer (spinach cottage cheese dish) ... the rest was bland and nothing special. Oh and the \"buffet\" consisted of 2 appetizers, 4 mains, naan and rice....   It felt like a cash grab, with the service staff rushing us to leave. In fact, before we even paid the bill the staff were already jacketed and ready to go ... nice!   AGAIN -- if we knew they couldn't accommodate us they should have told us and we would have been fine going some place else."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Wasn't the greatest but wasn't bad either. After I left our stomachs started to hurt with their food. I doubt I would ever come back. Also the service isn't the greatest. The girls working there don't know how to serve in a professional manner."}
{"text":"The food used to be exceptional. Wednesday was disatrous. Butter chicken was watery and straight out of a bottle sauce. Chicken was so scarce. One waiter for 8 tables Definately time to move on"}
{"text":"Best Indian in Mississauga. Good selection from tikka to korma right to vindaloo. My favorite is the fish tikka. Service has always been excellent and staff are accommodating."}
{"text":"From outside, look old place but interior was nice. Due to long weekend, could not book table but owner/manager was helpful to accommodate big group while we walked in.  Food looks good and fresh. We ordered few entrees, naan, appetizer and rice.  Hara bhara kebab was good but the chutney, specially green was ok...more mint flavour than any other ingredient.  Paneer tikka masala and Baingan bharta was good. Beans in Kadai vegitable taste uncooked or undercooked.  Dum veg beriyani was great.  Garlic naan disappointed as can see garlic on naan but no garlic taste.  Sweet lassi was good.   Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Been here once. Food was good quality, made well good taste.  Want to try the buffet, but they had at least when I went a system where you have to keep asking for more food. Would be better to just have self-serve.  If you're in the area I would recommend."}
{"text":"Got take out last night- usually dine in. We've been here about 6 times and haven't had an issue with service. We usually get the same stuff and live it- Nirvana dal, Bingham Bartha and chicken hariyala ... I find it's full of really good spice and some of the best Indian I've had. Veggie Samosas are actually pretty good too, good amount of heat to them. So this is our go to place when we think of Indian in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This place always has the best Indian food, hands down. The flavours are always vibrant and the sauce is never watered down.  It's thick and hearty.  The menu has a large variety of items, including many you don't see at other Indian restaurants.  I never leave reviews on Yelp, but this was enough to compel me.  Only downside is the decor is a bit outdated."}
{"text":"This is a review about Nirvana's catering services.  I hired Nirvana to cater my wedding reception as well as a pre-party (sangeet) two days before.  The wedding was this past July, but it's taken me this long to write a review because I was so upset with my experience and wanted to put it out of my mind. However, I thought it was important for me to do it so other people don't find themselves in a similar predicament.  I found Nirvana's service to be 1) unprofessional, and 2) utterly dishonest.  Here's why:  a) The manager I dealt with, Chandan Gulati, refused to sign a formal contract.  I overlooked this as the food was good and the price was right plus I essentially had a contract in the form of a very detailed menu containing dates, times, prices and included services.  However, of all my vendors, he was the only one to refuse this basic item.     b) On the day of the sangeet, they arrived two hours later than the time agreed upon.  At the time when they should already have arrived at the venue, I got a call from Chandan in a panic complaining that I hadn't provided him with the venue address.  This was not the case.  We had spoken by phone the week prior and I had also sent him an email.  When he checked his email he was able to confirm this was the case.   At no point in the evening did they ever apologize for their tardiness.    c) The lack of professionalism continued through out the night.  Only one of caterers was dressed appropriately in black pants and a shirt, the other was in a t-shirt and jeans;  d) It was a hot night and one of our desserts was kulfi (a frozen dessert).  Instead of bringing it out in waves as the tray emptied they put it all out at once.  In about 10 minutes the dish was melted soup;  e) We were a server short during that night, and we asked if they might help out with collecting some of the dishes.  Of course we would have compensated them for their help, but they refused saying that was not their job.  Certainly, if they had, it might have gone a long way in making up for their tardiness.  After the event, they had the nerve to tell Chandan that they had helped to clear and wash dishes and that they should be payed for this service.  f) However, the icing on the cake was the reception itself.  I had designated someone to pay the caterer at the end of the dinner.  She later came to me a bit confused.  The caterer had told me that he would not supply additional staff to clear the dishes from the tables.  Thus I had had to hire additional servers separately.  On the night of the reception, knowing that he was dealing with someone not as familiar with the situation as myself, he told her that he had brought the servers, and that their money should go to him.  He also claimed additional fees for the \"dishwashing\" that his staff had done at the sangeet.  In total, he walked away with quite a bit more than we had agreed upon.  I called him right away, and immediately he apologized and agreed to return the money.  This to me, sent a clear signal that he knew he wasn't entitled to the money, and that this had not simply been a misunderstanding.    I was livid.  I couldn't believe he was so blatantly trying to take advantage of me on my wedding day!  There I was, at 11pm, in my wedding finery, standing outside the venue yelling into my cell phone at this liar trying to take advantage of the fact that I was busy, and hoping that I wouldn't notice his actions.  I have to say, all my vendors did their best to make my wedding go as smoothly as possible and Nirvana did the exact opposite.  It really left me with negative feelings and a terrible smudge on what should have been a wonderful night.  I would not trust this business to take care of any of your special events.  I wouldn't be surprised if this manager, Chandan, has done this to other families in the past.  I really think the owner should be looking into his actions.  He has given the whole business a reputation for dishonesty and lack of professionalism.  Certainly everyone at my wedding has been made aware of it and will not be using them in the future."}
{"text":"My favourite dish is the Shrimp Sherdil, jumbo shrimp cooked with Indian spices in a tandoori oven. It's a unique and very different way to eat seafood. I highly recommend it, along with the whole menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Mississauga. It's bit expensive, but it's totally worth the experience. Great food for special occasions. I don't usually do Indian, but when I do, I do Nirvana."}
{"text":"I like their served-on-table buffet concept .. I am sure it isn't a new concept but very few Indian restaurants offer this kinda facility .. I've been here twice with my friends and all of us ordered the buffet but with different choices in curries (veg/non-veg). The non-veg curries are not that great .. I mean the curry itself was alright but the meat didn't really taste that good. On the other hand, the veg curries were too good. Naan was soft and tasted good.   Their servers are very well organized and attentive and they do offer a good range in drinks. So, overall I can give this place another try and just hope that the non-veg dishes improve in taste."}
{"text":"We went to Nirvana with friends today (we were a group of 6).   Ambience:(4.5/5) It looks so ordinary from the outside, but once you enter, its like a totally different place.Very Indian, very desi! The interior is awesome. Great ambience.  Food: (4/5) The food was pretty good. We had Hot & Sour soup, which was ok. Then for starters we had chat papri and dahi bhalla. Both of them were really good. Next we had veg manchurian, achari paneer, nirvana dal with roti. The achari paneer was super yummy. Then we also had veg biryani. Overall their food is good, nice Indian flavours.  Service: (3.5/5) Our waitress was friendly and nice. Service was good.  Overall, it is a good place to go with friends or family for some tasty Indian food!! Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years.  Things aren't the same anymore.  Food tastes bland, nothing special.   Service is slower than you'd expect.  Staff is friendly however.  Appetizers were the best part of the meal.  And definitely on the pricier side for an Indian restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"We ordered the butter chicken, palak paneer, and khat mith (paneer). The khat mith was delicious and I would order it again if I ever go back to Nirvana. The two curries were so, so salty. The butter chicken was described on the UberEats as having marinated chicken breast but my butter chicken had chicken thighs, which was not at all what I wanted. The food was so salty I couldn't even eat much of it.  What a shame. I ate here about a year ago and had a much more positive experience."}
{"text":"Food is hot...service is not.  Which is too bad because the food is great!  I was surprised, the restaurant was huge with lovely decor and pretty artwork.  Hostess: \"Do you have a reservation?\" Me: \"Buh?\"  ...I guess I don't usually go to Indian restaurants that require a reservation. For a Sunday night, the restaurant was full. Apparently, the trick is to get there before 7pm or else be prepared to wait..and wait we did.  We waited for a table. We waited to order. We kept waiting. More waiting. Wait, wait, wait. ...But it's worth it.  We ordered a bunch of different items. My only issue with the food was that they saw we weren't Indian and didn't make anything spicy.  I'd ask for spicy next time, for sure.  The highlights were: * Mushroom masala - Who knew mushrooms could be so freaking tasty. * Chicken tikka - Hot chicken on a sizzling platter. * Lamb biryani - It's interesting, they make it in a small pot covered with naan.  It's hard to not love it.  The lamb was nice and tender. * We had chicken and fish curries, all good....  Ok, I'm totally hungry right now. I want roti."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines Day dinner and was dissapointed in the food. Order the fish tikka which was undercooked and sent back. Also ordered chicken dum biryani and lamb vindaloo. The biryani was dry along with the chicken pieces in it, with some fatty pieces on the chicken. The Lamb vindaloo was sweet. First time I had a vindaloo that was sweet... (?)  Very disappointed as it was our first time out since having our baby at thw beginning of December."}
{"text":"Extremely hungover and in the mood for an indian lunch buffet.  Let me say that I live in Toronto(High Park) and have a zillion indian food buffet options in the downtown core.  My friend doesn't want to find parking.  Nope he wants a restaurant with its own parking lot and he's sticking to his guns.  Mississauga makes me miserable but whatever.  He's driving and I'm starving.  I sleuth google and find Sahara and on the way we go. Were driving 25 minutes to Mississauga just for a restaurant with it's own bloody parking lot.  Now unfortunately my phone dies before I get there and I forget the name of the restaurant.  This is a business park with a big row of restaurants and the bar My Apartment.  Which place is it?  Nirvana.  Ya, that's it I say with confidence to my lunch friend.  We arrive inside and the place looks nice.  Smelled great.  I look around and don't see a buffet but see a signboard that states Executive Lunch Buffet.  It must be in a section that I can't visibly see.  We get seated and I am starting to worry.  At this point I'm sure there isn't anywhere else the buffet tables could be.  I tell my friend that I'm going to ask someone to make sure and away I go to flag down a waiter.  Finally a gentleman comes out the kitchen door and I ask ift there is indeed a buffet.  Yes, he answers \"A sit down buffet\".,  What????  Now my brain is not on point from yesterdays festivities and I retreat back to the table with the news.  A sit down buffet i tell my friend.  We are giggling like school girls because it doesn't make an ounce of sense.  I am a buffet addict.  I've eaten at hundreds of buffets through my zillion trips to Vegas.  I know what a buffet is and this is not it.  Now at this point I'm assuming that its all you can eat but we just order off the menu sort of like AYCE sushi.  Waiter arrives and his English is really difficult to understand but we make out that he is asking us if were eating a la carte or having the buffet(meat or veggie).  Meat buffet we reply and order some drinks. He begins to tell us about the food that would be arriving and i'm starting to get confused again.  I said to my friend this is a prix fixe menu not a freaking buffet.  This is trickery i'm thinking but my brain is trying to come up with a reason for all of this.  Perhaps its a prix fix menu but its all you can eat I say.  Were fine with that for some reason.  Sauces like raita, some chili sauce and coriander chutney arrive.  Shortly after Tandoori chicken wings arrive.  8 chicken wings.  They were quite good. Very flavorful.  Waiter comes back and lets us know that main course will be arriving soon.  Now I start asking the questions, the moron I am.  What is this buffet all about I ask?  Is it all you can eat?  I can go for about another 20 of these wings.  No he reply's.  He says something like \"It's for the business people.  So they dont have to decide what to eat\"  Haha.  What !  Now I'm getting irritated.  This is a fricking prix fixe lunch.  How the hell did I get duped like this.  Well I do know.   Hungover and stupid.  I say to my buddy.  We need to stop this.  I need a buffet.  I want variety.  I want 20 items to taste.  So we decide to bite the bullet and get up and leave paying for what we ate and drank so far.  $14.00 for the 8 chicken wings and $7.00 for a tea and a coke plus tax and meager tip.   This sucks.  We finally find the restaurant we initially were supposed to go to, \"Sahara\".  It delivered and was exactly what I was looking for in an indian \"buffet\" It's quite hidden in this business park.  Turned out to be an expensive lunch.  While the food looked and smelled quite good at Nirvana, its not what i was looking for.  STOP CALLING IT A BUFFET YOU JERKS!  ITS A PRIX FIXE LUNCH OPTION.  1 STAR FOR TRICKERY!                         +---"}
{"text":"The. Naan. Is. Great.  Been to Nirvana a few times, the first few as a last-minute decision to stop over.  Always, it's been a good experience.  These days, it's a go-to for us - as people that love Indian food, for our palates we've found Nirvana's offerings to be among the most flavorful. :)  The seating is spacious and the atmosphere is pretty nice.  Some nights can get pretty crowded, however, so if you're looking for a quieter experience try heading there at the start of their dinner service - 5:30PM or so.  Service has never disappointed, and their prices are affordable.    And again, the flavor of their naan is memorable :)  Made to order from a Tandoor oven (visible behind glass to the dining area), they offer some creative variations: Cheese filled naan (filled with paneer) and Chicken Keema Naan (filled with diced chicken) are among our favorites, along with the classic Nirvana (coriander and garlic) Naan.  They offer takeout and delivery within Mississauga as well!"}
{"text":"Extremely unprofessional management and service was garbage. Called in advance during the holiday to see if we can dine in. The manager on the phone said we can dine in when we get there in 15 minutes. But they forced auto gratuity on holidays for 2 people. ( which is illegal for table with less than 6 people).  When we walked in, the Indian server was rude and told me and my husband that they're closing soon and if dine in we have to pack up our food at exactly 10 pm and leave. I have never seen such terrible service at an Indian restaurant.  Me and my husband spoke to the manager as we are regular customers at nirvana and never encountered this before. The manager apologized and sent the server over to apologize. The Indian female server came over to the table and lied and said she never told us to pack our food at 10 pm.  Horrible dining experience. I hope the management improves their training here."}
{"text":"Real focus on authenticity  Passion can be seen in the product   Price justifies quality  ."}
{"text":"If you know the meaning of Nirvhana then the experience is almost there! A must. Food is very good. Different type of naan bread for thise who likes naan. Spices is at the rendezvous!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing. Definitely coming back. I read some negative reviews on here but after having lunch there and ordering the Shrimp, Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken I can definitely say that it was absolutely delicious.  Way better than I was expecting.  Also the mango drink is really good."}
{"text":"We simply loved the food... And it was a great experience! Starting from starters to desserts we enjoyed our food a lot! We ordered Hare Bhare Kebab and Paneer Tikka as starters then Dum Biryani and Malai Kofta as main courses but later we didn't bothered to eat Malai Kofta because Dum Biryani was yummy and enough for us so we boxed up the koftas. For dessert we ordered Kesari Thandai and Paan Kulfi... Kesari Thandai was just ok because I expected something more for a Thandai but it was not up to that level of Thandai BUT I LOVED PAAN KULFI!! It was just amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on 30th March 2018 and liked the Indian Punjabi food very much. The ambience is appealing, worth recommending."}
{"text":"Went to Nirvana with a couple of friends as we had not met for a long time. The place was nearly empty on a Thursday night. Have been here for three times, twice for an event - a corporate and a family event where they had a buffet. Once for lunch quite some time ago as they had what they called it as an Executive Lunch.   We were seated right away. The decor now seems dated. The chairs not comfortable enough. The service overall was not great and not bad as well. But the staff need to be more relaxed and jovial. When asked about a dish whether it had milk or butter, the reply seemed stoic. There was no assurance, that no it does and will make sure kitchen knows about it.   I had a Mushroom Masala and two rotis. The others ordered an Adraki Paneer and Butter Chicken, with a rice and naan.   The Mushroom Masala had all the right flavours and seasoned and spiced to my liking. The spice level a. It for others perhaps. The rotis cooked perfectly but served together with a butter naan. Would have preferred separate servings.   The price a bit on the high side for me for the quantity served."}
{"text":"On Valentine's day, dinner with family and friends at Nirvana.  Well it was over two years since we had been there. The ambience had not changed. It was still well maintained.  However the service had come down a notch. We had to wait for a glass of water for 20 minutes and despite two reminders, it never came!  food quality was not bad but it did not taste authentic indian.  Too mild."}
{"text":"Really liked the decor, service, and food The shahi paneer was too good. It was fresh and soft and gravy was rich and aromatic. For the first time I liked butter roti as it was crisp but also soft and tasty. The server asked us every few minutes how the food was so full points for service."}
{"text":"Went for the executive lunch buffet. Was very excited after seeing the menu before hand. As is well known, the décor of the restaurant is very regal. It was quite sad to see that the parking lot and the restaurant were nearly empty.  Food: Appetizers (hara bhara kabob, chicken shashlik) were lukewarm; hara bhara kabob (fried pea-filled patties) had a unique taste but were too sweet. the chicken shashlik was well-cooked, but was bland and was not hot enough to really bring out the taste. We also ordered mango shake, which tasted sweet and mango-y, but really it was simply a mix of milk, lots of sugar and mango pulp. The main course, chicken karhayi, paneer tikka masala and nirvana dal, was definitely very good. The curries, the dal and the naan were properly hot, seemed to be freshly made and were perfectly spiced. No disappointments there. Waitress was happy to bring us refills for any of the items.  I was so full from the food, that I basically did not touch the rasmalai, which seem to have the malai watered down (literally). Service was good."}
{"text":"Good decor, classy looks. Mediocre food. Nothing special. I think they couldn't make 5 star hotel food and while trying to make food like Sheraton or taj or oberois they missed the Punjabi dhaba food also. So good isn't bad. It's not great either. Full marks for decor. Too bad I can't eat decor."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Nirvana for the longest time and finally had the chance with co-workers after a run of various Indian buffets. Ordering off the menu seemed a bit different but the quality of the food was notably better. The rice, in particular, was probably some of the best rice I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Had lunch the other day like I do every month. You can't beat the quality & service. Excellent place."}
{"text":"Was craving saag paneer and this place delivered indeed!!!! Above expectations great price and generous portion sizes. My husband got the butter chicken and he was satisfied as well. Definitely gonna try to visit this place in person one day - I ordered delivery through SkipTheDishes"}
{"text":"Nirvana has become our go-to restaurant for a casual night out for Indian food. We used to go to Avani, but sometimes we'll switch it up with Nirvana. Nirvana was also recommended by our friends who definitely know what good Indian food is!   Highlights:  Sweet and sour crispy cauliflower - we typically wouldn't have gotten this, but it was recommended to us by a friend and it is delicious! Very crispy, sauce was not too overpowering, and it always comes out hot!  Shrimp tikka - one of our favorites, it comes out on a sizzling hot plate, the shrimp are large and juicy, and it goes so well with the cabbage and onions underneath!  Goat Curry - one of our favorites, it comes with some bone so it's softer than the other meats Eggplant Curry - The eggplant is in smaller pieces so it's a little pasty and a little salty, so we usually go for the okra if it's available"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Malai Koftas and Hara Bhara kebaab are to die for! The owners and managers are excellent! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 biryanis, 1 pop and 1 iced tea from this restaurant from SkiptheDishes last night.  We had company over, and thought I should add to the dish I made.  This restaurant charges almost double the price of biryanis from other restaurants at $15 per container.  The order came in a regular sized round container with small cubes of chicken (not even parts - thigh, or a leg or breast) ~ 3 small cubes in a container. Biryani is dry..there was a container of cucumber raita that came along with it - almost half the size of the biryani container.  They could have spared the raita..and just added value to the main dish order.  I also ordered pop and iced tea.  Overpriced at $2.00 each, but I sucked it up thinking that's what I get from ordering pop from a restaurant on SkiptheDishes.  Imagine my annoyance to see its fountain soda that is absolutely watered down and tasteless..and lukewarm.  I am NEVER ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend who raves about this restaurant. I really wanted to like this place. I think everything was just ok. My biggest beef is that every single dish we ordered was very spicy - even after asking for all of them to be extremely mild. The dishes were replaced and they were still way too spicy to eat. And I don't know about you but when food is so hot that you can't eat it, whatever your tolerance may be, it irritates the heck out of me - especially when I'm paying for it. That was pretty much the only memorable thing."}
{"text":"The best indian restaurant I hv been in Toronto and GTA... I come here again and again for their garlic naan and biryanis... Paneer tikka masala was also awesome. Unfortunately I didn't take any pics but would upload soon on my next visit. They have a great variety of drinks and cocktails  from which a drink with mango is my fav... The staff is always welcoming and has a knowledge of every items from the menu. We never have to wait for more than 20 for my entire order to arrive. Grt job Nirvana"}
{"text":"Went here for a group lunch at work.  The food was okay, standard Indian fare.  The atmpshere is pleasant enough but reminds one of a slightly institutional banquet hall.  We all ordered the \"executive\" lunch.  Not sure what was executive about it.  It was served family style and I got the distinct impression that the same size portions we shared for four people would have been served to a single individual.  The meat option, which I had, included some quite tasty chicken tikka, naan, rice, some fairly ordinary dal, a bowl of butter chicken (not bad) and a not very interesting vegetable curry along with chutneys and raita.   The dessert was the ovaloid gulab mentioned below.  Service was just so-so.  For the money, one could skip the fancier atmosphere and go any one of a number of excellent Indian eating places, buffet or not."}
{"text":"Was there for dinner with the fam. Seated in the \"private\" room, requested for the outside area (better ambiance in the main hall), took a few minutes before the waiter asked us to come out and \"to bring our glasses\" with us. Yea, I'm sure that can be done by you in a tray. It's a nice restaurant not a run of the mill fast food chain where I'd carry my tray around. The chairs were literally all wobbly. Seriously? I even asked the waiter to get me one that wasn't, the second one was just as wobbly as the first one. C'mon people, get it together. Sat down 1938, first time a server came in to ask for our order 1948. 10 min sitting, no one even asked for drinks or appetizers. 20 min before the first appetizers and 30 min prior for the dinner. That's pretty darn slow service if I say so myself. How was the ambience. Dated is the correct term. Very dated.   All in all comes down to the food. Ordered an assortment of stuff. Veggie platter and Lamb Kabab (Minced lamb wrapped with chicken, grilled), both were quite decent. Not exceptional, but quite decent. Dal Handi, Palak Kofta, Lamb Roganjosh, Chicken Jalfrezi were ordered for dinner with Garlic Naan and Rumali Roti. Dal (Yellow Lentils simmered in spices) Handi was sad. The palak (Spinach) was excellent albeit the Kofta part was decent. The Lamb Roganjosh (Lamb in a gravy) was barely edible. Too over done. The Chicken Jalfrezi was actually quite excellent. Tangy with ginger."}
{"text":"This was my 6th visit and quality of service and taste is downhill. Only reason I visit there is my counterparts being business professionals in the neighborhood.  Probably my last visit, though ordered chef's special vegetables, food tastes blend, cottage cheese felt stale..........I would recommend any other place but this one. Good Luck. A"}
{"text":"Visiting from the US, I was looking for a somewhat decent Indian dining experience for dinner in the Mississauga/Brampton area without walking to a hole in the wall place where you're served on a paper plate and given plastic utensils...and there are tons of those in the area.  It's difficult to scour for a nice place because there's tons of Indians in the area and Yelp reviews seem to dictate there's no satisfying them as they always have a gripe with a restaurant for one reason or another and there seems to be no sure bet go-to place for reliable food.  I dined at Nirvana last night and it fits the bill for a nice place where you can have dinner with friends or family.  None of the food overly impressed me, but there was nothing bad with it..I guess average is how everything can be described from the mango lassi to the naan to the main courses (ordered chicken and paneer dishes) to the dessert.  Why 4 stars instead of 3?  The decor is welcoming and seeing one of the chefs working at the tandoor oven behind a glass is a nice touch I haven't ever seen at another Indian dining establishment.  Lastly, the female servers who work there are adorably cute and always running around with smiles on their faces.  If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely be back here for a decent meal and friendly service."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd stop on my Butter Chicken tour, I got the lunch special by ordering using my phone. It was $14 for Butter Chicken, Rice, Naan and a pop.  The restaurant is tucked into a complex next to where the old My Apartment club used to be. I took my food to go but it looks like a pretty large restaurant and it looks nice and clean on the inside. The service I got for take out was good and using their mobile app to order worked seamlessly.  The butter chicken was great! Equal to other Butter chickens I've had at Bombay To Go except I'll say the Bombay To Go lunch special is a much better deal. That's the only reason Nirvana loses a star. The Naan was good as well maybe even tastier then Bombay's to Gos Naan.  All in all this place is a lot closer to were I work so if I'm craving butter chicken while I'm at work this will most likely be my go to place."}
{"text":"Go here only if you want to enjoy the decor and ambience and not food. And specially don't try biryani, they call it biryani but it is chicken mixed rice."}
{"text":"We ordered the butter chicken, lamb curry and chicken tikka.  Food was good but on the pricier side. Rice and naan need to be ordered separately and are not cheap."}
{"text":"We've been to nirvana a couple of times. The most recent one was on a saturday.   Plenty of space for parking. No reservations required. Plenty of seats and space. Good place for family or big party gatherings.   The food was okay. It was nothing special. It was relatively pricer than it should be. The server came to the table 3-4 times. And was very attentive."}
{"text":"I went to a staff lunch at Nirvana and I thought that the food was pretty great. Very traditional tasting, nice and warm, food brought based on need and most importantly - they were able to tell me what did/didn't contain gluten! I have been missing Indian food since I was diagnosed with celiac so I was very happy to be able to eat almost everything brought to the table. Unfortunately, I still suffered once I got home, likely from contamination. I would have preferred to have been told that they couldn't offer me anything that was guaranteed safe, rather than being told I would be fine and they knew there was no contamination.  I give the food and the service 4 stars, but the pain I felt all night deserves a 0."}
{"text":"Average food, great service, cozy ambiance and plenty of parking.  On a particularly hellish winter evening we decided to venture into unknown and arrived at Nirvana. We were promptly seated and waited a while for a host/hostess. It wasn't a exceedingly long wait but for the prices they charge I was expecting a better first impression.  Started off with soup. Hot & Sour vegetable soup and Tomato Soup. Standard affair. Nothing stood out.   We ordered appetizers which included Nargisi Seekh Kebab and Aloo Chana Chaat. Kebabs had flavour but we unexpectedly dry to the point where I needed water post bite. Aloo Chana Chaat was pretty bang on. Loved it.  Weirdly we felt full after soup and appetizers so decided to order rice and daal. Thankfully, a simple meal such as this one was up to mark.  Our hostess was nice and courteous. She packed the leftovers and greeted us goodbye.  Food didn't really leave an aftertaste and we aren't in a mad rush to go back which is disappointing considering their prices. We have a much better option in Milton for Indian food!"}
{"text":"they need a space for a buffet system but the food is reallly fast service they need to work on the buffet is unacceptable"}
{"text":"We went here a few times and though we've never been disappointed with the food, we weren't wowed either. We had the saag paneer, butter chicken, and their appetizer platter last time. All of it was fairly tasty. The spices weren't overwhelming and everything seemed fresh. The service is lacklustre. They weren't rude but it wasn't efficient. It felt pretty slow. It's an alright place but I'm sure there are better options in Mississauga"}
{"text":"\"just okay\" is how I would describe this place. Not horrible but not all that great - at least for the vegetarian dishes. Flavours are not quite right but edible. The naan is also \"okay\". I would not voluntarily go here but it seems to be popular with the omnivores in the family so I just go along with it."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the only two meat dishes that were good, the Goat biryani and the Lamb rogan Josh.   We went here for dinner. Two stars deducted for two rickety and shaker chairs on a table of four. One star for lack of knowledge of menu items of service staff, and pompous attitude of supervising lady.   Among other things we ordered:  Drinks: -Tea ( served in a nice pot) -Soup (came in a porcelain mug style cup) -Sweet lassi was small, thin and mediocre  -Salted lassi, ditto.  -Samosas (instead of potato fillings, had largely French beans, traces of other veges including potatoes- hmmm leftovers? Thoughts, anyone?)  -chaat paapri- relatively crisp, and passable but chutneys and curd sauces had added color and one could see the synthetic green..not very appetizing for a restaurant with upscale style decor, and decorative pieces, but then also rickety chairs.   MAINS:  - Goat biryani- certainly the star of the dinner, especially in terms of presentation. Baked in a cast iron pot, sealed with a roti  to keep it moist. Came with cucumber raita, with cucumbers grated thick and large, instead of fine.   - Lamb rogan josh- Excellently done and great flavors without dripping in oils.  - Lamb saag- the greens were TOO bitter and competing with the oils in quantity. More oils than lamb!   We ordered mission roti, came lathered in grease, not sure if it was butter or oil, but it was not ghee. Would have been nice if they had asked and we could have specified butter, or brought us butter on the side.   Paneer naan was fairly decent.   - Mattar paneer- the worst I have ever tasted. It came in a thick creamy sauce, with   a paucity of peas. The paneer was tasteless, the peas were underdone and very scarce, the sauce was pathetic.   Two people came around to ask how was the food. Told them about the lack of peas and showed them the almost untouched dish. The server was sorry that we did not like it, but the supervisor said, \"No, it is very good\" and went away. You could tell, the peas had not been cooked in the sauce, but separately parboiled and thrown in. They were still green in a yellow sauce.   Considering we ordered do generously, The courtesy of offering a replacement for the ONLY vegetarian item we ordered would have been appreciated, especially considering, that it was mostly untouched.  - DESSERTS-   -Ras Malai- this was the best of the three deserts we ordered, but serving size was SMALL.  - Malai Kulfi- serving size large, medium in taste.  - Gulab Jamun- serving size was large, and sugar content was extra large!   Will neither return not recommend. We had come for the rumali roti, but it is not offered everyday!"}
{"text":"I visited here with my immediate family and grandparents who are visiting from India. The GPs were immediately taken by the name, wondering what the liberation from samsara and attaining moksha had to do with buffets. \"Canadians throw around these terms carelessly,\" explained my parents.[1] They all snorted in a way that conveyed \"we hope this place doesn't suck\". Tough crowd.  Vedantically accurate or not, Nirvana is a spacious and well-decorated restaurant situated near Hurontario and Highway 401. It seems well-suited for groups; there were round tables that could easily accommodate eight or more people. And it's pretty opulent. There are sculptures and artwork galore. We snagged a circular table for six beneath a chandelier centred in a coffered octagonal ceiling. That's just how I roll.  We got the Executive Lunch Special ($13.99), which is simply malai kofta served in a briefcase. I'm kidding. Actually, the ELS is pitched as a \"buffet at your table\"; they bring you three dishes (specify vegetarian or meat), daal, raita (yogurt), a generous basket of naan, yellow rice, and galub jamun for dessert. This is perfect for the sedentary buffet-goer with poor decision-making skills. They just bring you some of their choices (which change frequently apparently), and it doesn't even take that long. Within minutes our table was covered with copper containers. To start there were vegetable fritters and boneless lime-chicken. The green-tinged chicken was a great start to the meal and there was a lot of it. I would recommend you try it with the brown chutney.   For the mains we got paneer makhni, aloo gobi, curry chicken as well as the aforementioned daal, rice (this was good), and naan. The consensus around the table was that everything was Fine. That's it. The dishes had a perceptible mix of flavours, but it wasn't a sensory explosion and certainly not an out-of-body religious experience. Spicy and mouth-watering this food most definitely was not.  Oh, and the galub jamuns were ovoid which is a dealbreaker for me.  That said, it's a pretty killer deal for a whackload of edibles and the service was very accommodating. I probably won't make a special trip out here, but if I happen to be in this (Godforsaken) portion of the GTA again, I'd stop by, especially with a group.  Obligatory Title Pun: Come as you are/as you were/as an ALOO GOBI.[2]  Menu Readability: I'm sure it's splendid, in that it's leather-bound and all that, but I actually forgot to look. (I was hungry, mkay?)  Need to mention: Even though it's not a buffet (more like a tonne of food at your table) they treat it as such and you cannot box any leftovers. Lame!  What this place teaches me about myself: I could be the brown Weird Al. (Weird Ali?)    _____ [1] I imagine it's the same as a Canadian finding a restaurant in India called Canuck T. McMapleSyrup's Hockey-Beer Em-pour-ium and Beaver Dam. [2] Or: \"Here we are now/entertain us/I want CHHOLE/and DAHI BARAS.\""}
{"text":"I was in Nirvana. . .   . . . while eating at Nirvana.   This place was great. It makes a really good impression as soon as you walk in, the inside décor is amazing. You feel like you are eating at an Indian palace or something.  And as a bonus the seats are well cushioned. I came here for lunch with a few of my co-workers and we ordered the executive lunch \"buffet\". It's sort of a different style buffet where they bring the food to you, and if you want more of anything, they bring more afterwards. It's actually a very smart strategy because it helps prevent a lot of waste, and the food is always fresh when it comes to you. To be honest, I had no idea what we were eating but it was delicious (and I don't use that word lightly). The food was very flavourful! The chicken was well cooked and not too dry or chewy.   My only complaint is that it was difficult to get the waiter's attention to refill our water glasses and for the bill afterwards but I didn't mind staying there a bit longer since I was so full afterwards. Oh, some of the food is spicy, so I guess watch out for those of you who can't handle the heat lol. They also offer vegetarian options.   Overall great experience, I would definitely come back here again.   Warning: the food will make you want to take a nap afterwards."}
{"text":"I went here for a going away party for a coworker.  Dealing with this place is like going through a contract a lot of ammendments.  * no bill splitting * gratuity is included with the price (so they can get away with bad service) * only one round for appetizer and dessert * different prices for vegetarian and non-vegetarian. * we bring the food to you rather than you picking it yourself in the portion we choose * we will bring the food whenever we feel like and make arbitrary choices like waiting for the full party to arrive without checking on whether the main bulk of the party is already ready anyway.  After what felt like forever which is about 30 minutes after arrival is when they started asking what we want to get.  I chose the non-vegetarian option, though they only had two dishes that are non-vegetarian and they're both chicken.  The appetizer which only had one round had some chicken dish which wasn't too bad.  The mains only had butter chicken (which is close but relatively of lower par than that of India Sweets).  In typical Indian style, most of their food had a bit of heat, but they were pretty tolerable even for myself so I did enjoy eating a few of their food.  Some of the veggie dishes were pretty good.  However, I don't normally get myself full, unless the food is bad or disagrees with me.  The food probably disagreed with me and a few of my colleagues.  It had the same feeling as a cheap Mandarin buffet which puts ingredients to make you feel full and leave ASAP.  I had to waste eating the left over dessert and I hate wasting food.  Near the end of the terrible service ordeal, the waitress says to the person who was coordinating the payments that we do not split the bills and we already tack on the gratuity as it to add insult to injury.  I only gave this a two star because some of the food made up for the minus 4 star service.  And I won't recommend this place to anyone.  How it even got those awards I can just speculate that they must've paid someone off or they knew the reviewer was arriving."}
{"text":"I've been to Nirvana twice - the first time was for a corporate event in their private room, the second time for a weekday dinner.  As the organizer for the event, I was very happy with how it ran. The food came out hot and our guests were pleased with the selection - I believe they had about 6 or 7 different veg & non-veg options.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive to our party of about 12. The audio/visual set up was also great.   For my second visit, we ordered samosas, butter chicken, and daal makhani. The butter chicken had this wonderful smokey flavour that I haven't tasted in butter chicken at other restaurants and I liked that the daal had kidney beans in it (which may be typical, but it's not how we usually make it at home, so a nice change). My bf was a little peaved when we had to pay $4 for onions - he's from India and (quite strongly) believes that onions accompany a meal and should be free... I'm not sure I agree, but something worth considering if you're an onion fanatic.   Our meal was about $50 for the two of us, which seems a little on the pricey side for Indian food, but overall, it was a good meal and I would definitely recommend for a work event."}
{"text":"We were a group of four who arrived at 9:00 PM for a quick bite after watching a movie nearby. We chose this restaurant primarily because of it's online reviews. I live in the east end of the city where there's not too much of a selection in terms of Indian restaurants, and I was excited. Unfortunately, this place was a disappointment.   As soon as we walked in, we were told that we absolutely had to order right away (within the next 5-10 minutes), or the kitchen would close, despite the restaurant closing at 10:00 PM. As soon as we were seated, the waitress kept pestering us to order, and we felt very rushed - part of me wishes that they would have just turned us away at the door rather than providing subpar service. Additionally, we were not provided with a drink or dessert menu. All the while we were being pressured to order, the main room was filled with families still enjoying their meals, and there were new customers being seated.  Once we received the food about twenty minutes later, the waitress completely disappeared. We were not provided with spoons, and no staff was in sight, otherwise I would have asked for them. We had to eat our meals with forks (try eating daal or curry with a fork - not easy!) Also, we had ordered four butter naan portions but only received three. At this point, I decided to go find an employee to see if we could obtain the missing portion, since after all, there were four of us and we were hungry. I found an employee near the bar, and as soon as he saw me he said, 'the washroom's over there, wrong way.' I explained that we were missing a portion of naan, and asked if we could order another as we had initially order three, and he raised his voice and told me, 'absolutely not madam, absolutely not.' Talk about rude!   Food wise - portions were small, and extremely overpriced. Though I have to admit the butter naan was delicious. Based on the food alone, I'd probably give this place two and a half stars, however the customer service was horrible and really dampened our moods that night. Unfortunately, we left hungry."}
