{"text":"I just tried Osteria Papavero for the first time last night and had a fantastic experience. The restaurant is small, but has a comfortable and intimate atmosphere. The service was really great. The portions are small, but it was fun for our group to order several different items and share them all. We ordered the burrata special, which was excellent and crostini appetizer, which was good. Then, I had the beef shank and my husband had the venison special. I was slighly disappointed there were no seafood options on the menu or specials, but I think that was reflective of seasonal and local fresh ingredients being utilized. Although the flavors on both our meat dishes were very similar, they were both delicious. The best part of the dining experience at Osteria Papavero is dessert. I know it sounds crazy (as our friends reiterated to us before we went), but the butterscotch pudding is to die for. Try it with their home made lemoncello and you will not be sorry. The prices are slightly high, but the quality is well worth the price.   I have one criticism of Osteria Papavero and it is that there are too many specials not documented on the menu. I am not complaining about them having so many specials, because what we tried of them were great. I'm more critical of the fact that the specials were not really documented anywhere, so it was hard to keep track of them. Our waitress spent at least 5 minutes at our table explaining the 7 specials. Although the items were listed with a one word description on a blackboard, it was on the other side of the restaurant from where we were seated, and no one at our table could read it. Even if we were able to read the board, there were no descriptions of the specials, so after the waitress left our table, we had forgotten some of what she described and had to ask her to repeat items when she returned. The waitress was more than pleasant and patient with our questions, but would it be so hard to print a daily menu with descriptions of the specials for each of the tables?"}
{"text":"Fabulous time here last night. Terrific dirty martini, but some of the off-the-beaten-path drinks were not as delicious--unless you are ready for adventure. Their antipasto appetizer featuring meats cured by the chef, Francisca(o?) were out of this world. Best I've ever eaten in Madison. All the bread was terrific, but the crunchy, slightly charred grilled bread was fantastic as was the salty, warm and thin fried bread. The deliciously light butterscotch pudding (I didn't note the formal name) was almost worth its $7 price tag. What's keeping this review from five stars is the furnishings. I don't care for the tables and chairs and the lack of fabric made the place sound hollow. I want something more rustic and comfortable than library tables and straight back chairs, but the food made it worth it. Nice location, lovely outdoor seating. Just burn those tables and the uncomfortable chairs! Since the place is so small, I'd rather be able to hang about a bit. Also, paper napkins? This food deserves cloth napkins."}
{"text":"This is a really good little italian place. What stands out for me is their butterscotch pudding. I want to take a bath in that delicious, velvety pudding! Their pasta dishes are delicious but I did not care for their gnocchi at all as the sauce was way too heavy and rich. They do not take reservations so I suggest this place when you are not in a hurry (i.e. not for lunch during a weekday)."}
{"text":"Great place, nice staff, great specials each day, went for a few app's highly recommended"}
{"text":"If you are not a party of more than 2 you dont get served well.  Waited forever for a chance to get waitress' attention.  Not many choices of meat. Pork pork and only pork or sone weird fishes .  However i mist admit mushroom stew was delicious."}
{"text":"Come here for dessert or lunch. They have the best sandwiches in madison. Their butterscotch pudding is exceptional (and is also the only regular item on the dessert menu) and so is their flan if they have it. Been here a couple times for dinner and I would not recommend it, but maybe I will try again. The interior is warm and cozy."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Not many dinner entree options. Definitely should be $$$ instead of $$. A bit over priced however great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I love papavero, but I'm admittedly biased. I worked in their kitchen 3 or 4 years ago, when cococliquot was right down the hallway (it's now muramoto), & was owned by some of the same people. I prepped for coco in papavero's kitchen. these guys are the real deal. their food is amazing, as is their wine/booze/beer/espresso selection. I refuse to go to madison w/o stopping here to eat. best italian restaurant in wisconsin. but, I have yet to go to steffano's."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but my whole family was so disappointed that I can't give it more than 3 stars. The entrees weren't properly seasoned, the tables are awkward with staff and patrons bumping around, and the drafts from the cold air outside made for a pretty unpleasant experience, and options for small children are quite limited. The meat and cheese plates are good, but expensive and insufficient to make up for the rest of the meal. At best, this place is just hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Small place but very cozy. Authentic Italian food and some really good cocktails. Haven't tried their wine list though yet!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just came back from Osteria Papavero for Winter Restaurant Week 2014. We had already had a phenomenal meal earlier in the week at Sardine, but we figured we'd end the week by trying somewhere new. Most users from Urban Spoon, Yelp, Google, etc, seem to have nothing but great things to say about this establishment, so we figured worst case would have an enjoyable meal, best case we'd love it and make it a weekly favorite. The interior is fairly cozy and has a nice ambiance for a romantic dinner, but that is about the only compliment I can give this restaurant. As an appetizer, my wife ordered the root vegetable gratin, which came out lukewarm, and I ordered the sliced roast beef (magatello) with arugula, which came out on a tiny plate and had, at most, 0.5 ounces of thinly sliced beef that was decent. With the appetizer we received a bread basket, which was comprised of three pieces of warm, yet incredibly salty traditional dinner breads, and one piece of deep fried flatbread that was almost completely dredged in salt. I salt almost everything, but this bread was almost hard to eat. I should mention here (before we come back to the bread later) that two of the three pieces of the regular bread were badly burnt. We both ordered the pappardelle al ragu di cervo for our entree, which was egg pappardelle with \"elk\" ragout. The presentation was fine, but there was no complexity to the flavor. The pappardelle was seemingly of good quality, but the sauce was quite greasy, and the \"elk\" tasted exactly like, and had the same fat content as 80/20 ground beef; elk is much leaner than what we had. Nearly finishing our entrees, our waitress had not even bothered to check on us for a good 25 minutes. When she finally came back, I asked for more bread, and it was nearly 15 minutes before she came back with more bread (to be fair, it wasn't burnt this time). The desserts were good, but not great; my wife ordered the butterscotch pudding and I ordered the pistachio cheesecake. When we received our bill, our total (including a glass of wine for both of us) was $73.00. The price for the sub-par food quality was dissatisfying to begin with, but what really rubbed me the wrong way was that we were charged for the extra bread. Four pieces of bread should not be extra, but it was the fact that the first batch was burnt and we got charged for the second batch anyway. This may be a petty complaint to some, but it was the final straw to a strikingly mediocre meal. My wife has been to Italy many times and laughed out loud at some of the reviews saying this was as good as authentic Italian food. We really wanted to like Osteria Papavero, but we most certainly will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite place these days. It really blows a lot of the downtown places in this price range out of the water. Fresh, inventive. My favorite things are the seafood and vege plates that change every day. I had the best octopus I have ever had on one of these plates.  Very nice wine list as well. My husband is in love with the butterscotch pudding. The service is friendly, helpful and unobtrusive.  This place is just plain great without the hype or pretension."}
{"text":"Went on a week night with some coworkers, had the Antipasto di Mare and Antipasto Misto di Verdure to share. Both were fantastic.   I had the Taglierini alla Norcina as a main, it was good but portion was on the small side. The sausage to noodle ratio was high compared to the average Italian restaurant. However it was salty. This and the portion size are the reason I took off 1 star.   Otherwise, service was quick and professional, cozy atmosphere, and good drinks selection. I especially enjoyed my mulled wine!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Short walk from the Hilton, reasonable prices, terrific staff and service, fantastic food!!!!  Highly recommend, will be back."}
{"text":"Four of us dined at Osteria Papavero last night.  We've all been there before and have been happy.  However, when we asked the waitress to substitute one starch for another (both of which  were on the menu) and she said that there would be an up-charge of $1.00, that really struck us as tacky especially when 4 adults were having dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is vastly overpriced especially for Madison. They are charging Chicago prices for pitiful portions. We came here for Valentine's and we had a reservation. Came at the reservation time and ended up having to wait awkwardly by the entrance for more than 15 minutes. When we did get our reserved seat at the bar, it was a spot cramped between two couples. I had a hard time getting on the seat and the servers didn't help at all. There was a lot of waiting throughout the meal because they were understaffed. Waiting to get water, waiting to make our order, waiting to get our food, waiting to get our check. Here is what was wrong with this restaurant in list form.  1) Inattentive wait staff. Our waitress was incredibly inattentive, was reciting the menu without really wanting to have a conversation with us. She also came across as a snob and maybe a little culturally incompetent. When we said water is just fine, her attitude shifted 180 degrees and she was less interested in engaging with us. We are still paying customers, please treat us with some respect.  2) Food was a big MEH. For this price and the item descriptions, I expected something great, similar to Porta Alba. I was sorely disappointed when I got my Rabbit Tortellini. It was like 15 pieces of tortellini in a generic cream sauce with truffle oil. There was zero presentation, just a lump of tortellini in sauce. There was way too much oil and taste was subpar to me. In fact I hated it so much I switched dishes with my SO who got a spicy seafood mix pasta. It was a-okay, not very spicy. They gave only a handful of shrimp and mussels, mostly just squid rings which are cheap. Plus, the shrimp and mussels that were in the dish were TINY! For the price we were paying, this is absolutely ridiculous. I can make a much better dish myself for less than half the price, without having to suffer through the bad service. I was so hungry after the tiny portions, I had to order a wild mushroom soup, which was the only good dish of the night. Still, not good enough for me to be a return customer. Also, the bread that came with the soup was badly burnt!   3) I didn't like the atmosphere at the bar area at all. It was terrible sitting at the exact area they put all their sauces, and mixers, etc. Plus, we were jam packed like sardines at the bar - my SO for a while was very uncomfortable bumping shoulders with the guy next to him, but it was better after I moved to the left a little. Also, for a V-Day date I want some personal space. This restaurant decided to cash in instead of giving their customers a good experience, thus overpacked the bar area with too many bar stools for the small space. Also I should say the curtains at the entrance really threw us off. It looked like a coat storage space, not a welcoming entrance. The whole set up of the restaurant leaves much to be desired for. Not classy at all. I would even call it pretentious - trying to be a five star restaurant but really more of a two star based on its food, service, decor, and music. I mean, heck, they use Pandora for their music. How cheap is that??  TL;DR - Disregard the five-star reviews. This restaurant is overpriced, has bad service, subpar food, and mediocre atmosphere. Instead, go to Muramoto down the road, Old-Fashioned or for good Italian, Greenbush Bar on Regent."}
{"text":"We first came here 2 years ago for the Cinghale wild boar ragu after enjoying the dish 3 times earlier that year in Tuscany. It really felt like I was in a local restaurant in Montalcino. We were in Madison this weekend and had another great night there. We agreed that our waitress was one of the all time greats - charming & knowledgeable. Seafood appetizer was amazing - so unique. I also had the wild mushroom stew - 4 different types, hearty and perfect with a bottle of red and their tasty bread. Oh the wines - like any restaurant with staying power, they offer a reserve list AND the lower price point list that they clearly work hard to populate with distinctive bottles. Our waitress displayed the skill of a sommelier in choosing  bottle #2 - a red from Puglia. All four of us had pastas (Cinghale for me) and loved them. I had a pistachio cake that I crave now. Cool and diverse crowd in this little gem - works for date night or group gatherings. I will be back this summer when I return to Madison."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique menu, attentive service, cozy ambiance, great wine. Fantastic all around."}
{"text":"Whoever runs this kitchen does not have concern or interest in their customer base. Instead, they have interest in their own ego. Service was okay, but portions were so incredibly small and overpriced; when we mentioned that we thought the food tasted good, but that the portions  were small, the waitress said that it was not her fault. My question is: do you really care what your customers think?My suggestion is --  GO TO LOMBARDINOS. They know that they are doing and their main courses are less expensive."}
{"text":"Oh Osteria Papavero. I am a fool. I  lived here for 5 year before trying this place. I always assumed that the menu is not the best for vegetarians.   But I was so wrong - unaware of the amazing specials highlighting this season's vegetables. So sad to think about all the amazing meals I could have had.   Recently we enjoyed the vegetarian antipasto (green beans cooked lightly with fresh tomatoes, sweet and sour eggplant, roasted fennel sprinkled with cheese), the mushroom soup (not really a soup, more like stewed mushrooms of all different types in a spicy tomato sauce), and the crespelle (an amazing take on baked cannelloni with a crepe instead of pasta).   The cocktails are wonderful and so-very Italian with lots of options including Campari.   And yes. Budino.  Looking forward to making up for lost time and returning to Osteria Papavero again soon!"}
{"text":"Not much to say except that after dining here twice this is one of the culinary bright spots in Madison.  Certainly better than Harvest or even the overrated Le Toile.  It gets bonus points for serving Italian and not sucking, a rare feat.  If I had one complaint it is that the specials list overwhelms both the diner and the waiter.  I forget what has already come and the waiter starts to get a dry mouth and both sides start to get uncomfortable.  Shorter verbal descriptions and a better wall mount of the specials might be better for everyone involved."}
{"text":"Best Italian I had in a long time. Knowledgable plesent staff, informal atmosphere, good chef and decent wine selection."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty fantastic. With extensive daily specials, amazing pastas, and giant chunks of creamy melty dairy there's nothing to stop you from coming back every day for the rest of your life. Except that they're closed on Sundays. I gave it five stars even though the meat plate tasted kind of like socks because I'm no meat plate connoisseur and because everything else I've ever tasted there was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have had several positive experiences at Osteria Papavero in the past but had a negative experience today! I took a long lunch so that I could share my favorite Madison restaurant with my family. My mom loves butterscotch pudding so I was very excited to have her try the budino.. Unfortunately the restaurant was very crowded and the server was incredibly rude. I have been served by her during my other visits to the restaurant and have never had a problem - this time she didn't offer to seat us, didn't want to answer a quick question, and when I realized that the menu I had viewed online didn't match the menu in the restaurant, she said that I must have messed it up somehow. We decided to leave. It was a huge disappointment but I'll probably be back in the future. I would recommend avoiding during peak times/restaurant week."}
{"text":"The Wild Mushroom soup and veal scaloppine was wonderful.  Great ambiance.  Enjoyed interacting with the people at the bar!  We'll be back with families and friends."}
{"text":"After a couple of meals here, this restaurant became our favorite in town. Don't come here looking for spaghetti and meatballs. Papavero's ever changing menu is full of inventive, home-style Italian food. House-cured meats and house-made foie gras, amazing seafood dishes (including several preparations of octopus that are the best I've had) and a great accessible wine list. Focus on the specials, which are plentiful. The servers are knowledgeable and always do a great job recommending a wine to go with your meal. Like the rest of the menu, Papavero's desserts are inventive and amazing. The budino (butterscotch pudding) will change the way you think about pudding and butterscotch.  Finally, bar manager, Kevin, has put together the finest restaurant bar in town. His house made spirits include fantastic limoncello and nocino, and his cocktails are out of this world. I could go on and on, but really, I just can't recommend this restaurant highly enough.  With the leisurely pacing and cozy, casual atmosphere, you'll feel like you're enjoying a elaborate, home-cooked meal in Northern Italy."}
{"text":"I love coming here and finding out that the menu has changed (always in a good way). It's kind of hidden and looks like it might be closed so you can almost always get a good table. The bread basket is one of the best in town too. The portions are a little smaller than most Italian restaurants, but that means you can try more dishes. Go here during farmer's market season for Saturday lunch. The paninis are awesome."}
{"text":"Longstanding favorite- great food and seasonal creativity. Fantastic cocktails and wine menu, reasonably priced and there is a sense of pride and enthusiasm for their work"}
{"text":"I have visited Osteria Papavero numerous times over the last several years, and I cannot say enough about this hidden gem.  Hidden is the operative word, as it is difficult to see from the street.  It is very small, and a great place for a date.  Go early, as they don't take reservations.  The food is Northern Italian with a Tuscan Style menu.  Every visit has provided excellent food and service  with never a disappointment!  You cannot be a Madison foodie without a visit to Osteria Papavero!"}
{"text":"I have gone twice since and have had an excellent  experience. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  Not sure if changes were made in the kitchen or if it is just me, but I continue to go to Osteria Papavero and am enjoying it immensely. What a relief!"}
{"text":"I picked this place based on the 4/5 star rating and it was only OK.  A bit pricey for what I got and the menu is very small. I was really hoping for a nice fish dish but everything on the menu including the specials were pretty eclectic especially given the rustic ambiance so I took the safe route and got the beef special. Will probably be starving by breakfast. The flavors were good but the food was highly over rated."}
{"text":"This place has great food for what you get...  My portion was very small. We sat outside and the service was really poor. It appeared as though they only had 2 waitresses for the whole place that day."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Osteria Papavero this weekend and it was good but not excellent. We had the large meat and cheese board for an appetizer and it was excellent. The best main dish we had was the Boar with Pappardelle pasta; also excellent! The crepes with truffles were found to be quite bland and cheesy and the pasta dish made with homemade sausage had a wonderful spicy flavor but the sausage was crumbly and dry.  The service was not terrible but not great either. We had to wait to get our wine glasses filled most of the time. They were busy.  All in all I would recommend this place but don't have super high expectations."}
{"text":"Dined outdoors on a pleasant evening. The service was pretty good, but not great. I think this was due to a breakdown of the team waiting system. For example, I ordered a vegetable antipasto misto from our server. Initially, another server brought a charcuterie plate by mistake, then dropped off the correct plate and ran off without telling us what we were being served. The restaurant was not busy, so what was the rush? Finally, the initial server arrived and cleared up the mystery. The antipasto were really very good: balsamic roasted baby onions, sweet corn flan, and brocolli rabe sformata; one would not be able to identify 2 of those items by sight (but the absolute essence of sweet corn was unmistakeable in the flan). My entree pasta (garganega with lamb ragu) was solidly good, but the sauce was a bit too greasy to properly coat the pasta and be great. The wine list offers some good reasonably priced Italian bottles that pair well with the food. Unfortunately, we did not have dessert because the philistines we were dining with wanted to leave. From what I read and heard about the butterscotch pudding, it might have lifted the score a little, but not quite to five stars."}
{"text":"Papavero is a fantastic, cozy spot for a nice romantic dinner. There are two A++ elements to a Papavero dinner that keep me coming back: the SERVICE (probably the most attentive, efficient, pleasant in town...only competition in that realm miiiiight be Forequarter) and the BUTTERSCOTCH BUDINO which is my favorite dessert in this entire city.  I don't eat pasta (though the boyfriend loves it) so minus one star since the only non-pasta entree on the regular menu continues to be the Grigliata- a mixed grill- that seems to have been around for at least a year. I've had it 3 times and have yet to be impressed.  The meat has always tasted too heavily of char to be delicious, and often gets tough. Also, the grigliata comes over potatoes- another thing I don't eat- though they are quite gracious about subbing in. I implore you, Osteria Papavero- bring back the delicious steak you used to have on the menu? Otherwise, I'll stick to my new go-to, a salad and a cheese plate, which is reliably delicious. Other times I have been really pleased with their special entrees (usually a fish and/or a red meat over polenta....) and all in all, since it's my own dietary concern I can't be too picky.  Great date night staple!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is traditional Italian (rather than the New Italian/American found in so many hip spots or the Italian American fare found in budget Italian places) so be prepared to push your boundaries a little bit.  Their menus are seasonal and there's always a board full of specials. It's got a European, amazing food, upscale cafe vibe.  The entrees/pastas can be a little meat heavy, but I've dined here with a vegetarian a couple times and they've never had trouble finding something they wanted to order.  I strongly recommend getting one of the trios (vegetable or seafood) and grabbing an entree or pasta off of the board.   The desserts are all amazing (most recently had a chocolate crepe, though the budino is great too.)  Anyway if you've got the $$$, are craving some incredible food, but want a less pretentious atmosphere than the main competition (Cento) run, don't walk, to Osteria Papavero."}
{"text":"So, I took a first date here on the recommendation of our CM - Mr. Corey D. Let's just say I was not disappointed!  Now, I didn't get to snap any photos because I wanted to focus on my date, and because of the fact that the wait-staff sat us back in the corner, we were mostly left to ourselves and got to have some great conversation over some great food!  Corey recommended that we go off of the specials, but there was nothing on there that my date was willing to try, and neither of us were that partial to the fish heavy specials. So, she gave me ideas of what she liked so I picked a couple appetizers, and an entree a choice for her. I got the Assaggio di Formaggi Freschi & the Salumi Misti - half plate. We both got the Pappardelle al Cinghiale for our entrées.  The cheese was so awesome - the Salumi Misti was great - who knew duck pate could taste so divine? Our entrées came long enough down the line that she was able to share multiple stories with me. It was great :)  To top it off was dessert... Corey, along with the entire Madison community, recommended the Budino di Caramello. Oh. My. God. It was heavenly! My date even suggested that if we come back, we should just order 3 of those and be done with it.  The whole evening went so well that when I suggested that we go see a movie (I was meaning for that evening after dinner), she said \"Yes, I had such a good time I think going to the movies for a 2nd date would be good\". So, thank you Corey & Papavero for getting me a 2nd date!"}
{"text":"Osteria is my favorite restaurant in Madison by a mile.  The food is always well executed,  seasonal and inventive. They dish up some pretty authentic, rustic Italian fare. They serve a pretty good lunch, but to get the full experience make sure to get there for dinner.   They have a regular printed menu, but make sure to order a few things off their list of daily specials; it's where the food really shines.  There are usually a few apps, mains and maybe a dessert. The specials tend to be crafted from whatever Francesco found at the market and I've never had a bad dish. Osteria also tends to be one of the few restaurants where I'll spring for dessert.    The restaurant is small, doesn't take reservations and can get packed early. Don't let that deter you, the wait is worth it. Otherwise, try to snag a seat at the bar for a delicious cocktail and some of the best charcuterie in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in last Saturday night and was seated right away. Small joint with a nice comfy feel about it; low lit and great for date night. We had the full salumi plate, which was excellent (lamb sausage, chorizo, 4 cured meats, etc.) And the entrees were a proper size and freshly prepared. The wild boar ragout was new to us and delicious, and the truffle, sausage, cream sauce pasta dish was equally impressive. Polite service and decent prices. We will return one day, which is saying something cuz we are food snobs"}
{"text":"I found this place while on vacation in Wisconsin and it's looked very good at first. We walked in and while we waited for our table...had a glass of wine. The bartender was actually very nice and knowledgable about the different types of wine they had. The food looked amazing as we sat there and watched it come out. Our waitress is the sole reason for the two stars. The special was this ravioli dish in a brown butter sauce. The waitress brings it out the dish and it had been completely changed. It was watered down and they added peas.... I do not like peas. The waitress didn't seem to care. She rarely checked in on us and didn't really care to bring us anything while we waited another 30 minutes for one damn dish. The food is mediocre and the service sucked. The water girl helped us more than our own waitress. We sat for almost 30 minutes for our bread basket even came out and they really weren't that busy. I would recommend this place only if you have alot of time to waste."}
{"text":"The hardest part is narrowing down what to order!  Almost always have a wonderful experience and enjoy the adventurous Italian food that is rarely seen elsewhere in Madison. We've dined here at least 20 times in the past 5 years and will keep going back.   Service is almost always attentive but don't expect them to paw all over you either. Once 4 years ago or so- they lost my credit card after running it and basically said \"it's gone\" without much concern for the significant inconvenience this would create for me. I had to lean in and explain that I had entrusted them with my card and the agreement was that they swipe the card and return with my card (don't worry- they managed to run my card- they just couldn't keep track of it after they got payment!). My card eventually appeared and that was fortunately by far the most disappointing service experience. Servers are generally down to earth, friendly and almost always very knowledgeable about their menu.   I enjoy the smaller space- though I wouldn't describe it as \"romantic.' I also probably would never go to a space deemed to be 'romantic' less I happen upon a couple proposing to one another  Several tasty speciality cocktails here- which are often changed- so if you love a particular drink- be sure to remember the name (they've always accommodated requests for restoring drinks for me).   With regards to food, my most recent experience last week didn't knock my sox off  but I don't think this is representative of our general experiences.   We've certainly had 5 star experiences here.   TIP: Go on a weekday night to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, this cozy little place was packed. However, they still were able to get my boyfriend and in after only sitting at the bar for a few minutes.  The place is very small and intimate, but cool!   They offer half bottles of wine, which is great if you want to sample a few. We shared an awesome merlot with our dinner that was $19 for the half bottle. I thought that was reasonable for Madison.  They had so so many specials that night to choose from. This made it hard to order. It also even seemed difficult for our waitress to make suggestions based on how many there were. She was great, but when we asked questions she kept looking to their specials board on the wall for reference. I am a firm believer in getting suggestions from wait staff for the best items to try on the menu when trying somewhere new. I didn't feel completely confident in my order from reading the menu and her suggestions.  We shared a small meat board (tasty!) and the softshell crab special (superb!) as appetizers. I had a stuffed pasta with walnuts it was very good, but I think I would not order it again. My boyfriend got the mixed grill which was lamb, blood sausage, steak and something else I can't remember. He was very happy with his meal, the best meat being the steak and least favorite...The lamb.  For all of that, our bill totalled just around $100. Worth it for sure. I would come back easily!"}
{"text":"We went again last night, but I just had to come back here and rave about the Gran Piatta!! They had iberico as a special appetizer for dinner, but we got it in our order for the Gran Piatta as an appetizer (was great/filling for 4 people). The meats are all so unique and delicious. I'm a huge fan of the olive jam! Cheese were great too, 1 hard/sharper cheese and another soft/mild cheese. I wouldve loved to have more of the bread that comes with the plate (buttered/oiled and toasted), but we only got 2 pieces of that and got their bread basket. Not the biggest fan of their bread basket.. Then I ordered the vitello (veal cheek) which was the dinner special last night. So tender and juicy - almost had a very similar texture with the mushrooms that came with it."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food. You can't go wrong with this menu. Just make sure you leave room for the butterscotch pudding, which is the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town. The ambience is fantastic - relaxing dim lights to prep you to enjoy a wonderful time.  The food, I am amazed and satisfied ALL the time!!! I love the bread baskets, you cannot get tastier bread anywhere else! The fried bread! its SO amazing!!!!! And all the other breads, no, don't even think about butter, olive oil or balsamic vinegar, its so satisfying on its own!  There are 5 to 6 daily specials, different ones for lunch and dinner. And they make such amazing dishes with the freshest ingredients! I definitely love the pastas, and I haven't been disappointed all the countless times I've visited.  I love their themed dinners! The valenswine dinner was awesome - 5 courses with wine pairings for only $55. It was definitely more than I expected.  The desserts! are wonderful. One of my favorite places in Madison for desserts!  The only things to note is that there is only street parking, and that it probably isn't the best place to fit group dinners of more than 4 people.   For a reasonably priced and out of the world experience, you have to visit Ostera papavero!!"}
{"text":"No doubt the best Italian dining experience in Madison. You can taste that everything there is made by hand--from the pastas, meats, breads--the flavors are so amazing, Papavero has been a wonderful experience all 4 times I have been there thus far. The menu offers traditional Bolognese dishes and display a bit of imagination and innovation necessary to make an Italian place stand out from the rest. The service has been knowledgeable and enjoyable every visit, and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. Intimate setting. Delicious cuisine. Don't look for spaghetti or pizza on the menu. Pricey but well worth it. Attentive and knowledgable wait staff. Great place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Where does one take their foodie Manhattan dwelling sister? Osteria Papavera, of course. Every detail was perfect. I have not one complaint or even suggestion for improvement.  We arrived on Saturday evening about 6:30. We weren't quite hungry so we sat at the bar. The bar was comfortable and the bartenders (both women) fabulous. They wait tables and are knowledgeable about the food as well as the impressive wine and cocktail list. After much consideration I ordered an Old Fashioned and my sister had a Kettle One Orange on the rocks. I had told the bartender of my recent experience with Luxardo cherries and she was kind enough to place two of those luscious delights directly in my drink. It was then I fell in love. My sis enjoyed her drink as well.  After finishing drink number one it was time to get some food in our bellies. We loved the bar experience and stayed put for the rest of the evening.  We decided to share all the dishes we ordered and it was exactly enough food for us both. We ordered that second drink and our dinner.  We started with the Riboletta, a Tuscan kale and bread soup. It was hearty and rich. It was clear the soup had not been rushed, as the flavors were developed and distinct. Next we had the burrata with arugula with white anchovies and oven roasted tomatoes. The burrata is a homemade mozzarella cheese which is firm on the outside and creamy within. Oh, yes. Swoon.....  For our main course, we shared the Pappardelle and Wild Boar. C'mon, when was the last time you had wild boar? I love eating things I never eat at home or have never eaten before. This dish filled both criteria. It was yummy beyond belief. Not heavy or greasy, just meaty and succulent. I couldn't believe how satisfying it was to eat such a meal right in the middle of the summer. I left feeling satiated but not uncomfortably full. The timing between courses was perfect!   I have thought about raising a boar in my condo but think it might not be okay with my neighbors. However,  I am planning a heist of a case of Luxardo cherries. They are pricey and maybe could earn me some bucks on the black market. If you are interested, let me know.  A girl has to support her habit....  By the way, the whole meal was about $65. Not bad when you think about the crappy food you ate for a similar price elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  The food us always delicious and inventive.  The service is friendly and knowledgable.  The daily specials are great, especially if you're like me and like variety in your meals.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I'll be honest, I wouldn't give their food 5 stars, but it is cosy and warm and romantic and smells like fresh baked bread and makes me feel like a cool Madisonite grown up (because the place was full of couples in their mid 40's with sweaters and cool glasses...I don't know what you people do in Madison but I really like you...also there were other young people who were bespeckled sweater-wearers in training) and what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Sometimes a girls just got to have some foie gras. When that craving arises, make the trip to Osteria. They are one of the few places in Madison that take a minimalist approach to preparing the protein. (And if you know of others, please advise me!!) The foie gras is pan seared, placed upon a toasted brioche triangle and topped with green apples, toasted hazelnuts, and an elderberry reduction. The tart and sweetness of the side players truly complement the liver, and the meat itself was every bit of the creamy melt-in-your-mouth experience I craved. Nutty, buttery, and not a trace of bitterness. Other notables about the restaurant: they are definitely better than what their restaurant week menu showcased, since I was pretty disappointed by what I had back then. My dinner mate and I shared a half salumi plate and it was fantastic. I couldn't tell you what any of the meats were but I can tell you I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. A picture is worth a thousand words! My hesitation from giving them 5 stars is that they may be a little too \"authentic\". As in they also adopted the Italian speed of service. But that's part of the charm too, just allowing yourself to relax and forget the rush to get to the next spot. Overall, I strongly suggest wondering away from the main Capitol square restaurants and trying out this gem, foie gras craving or not."}
{"text":"One of the top Italian restaurants in town. This is the real thing - Italian, not Italian-American. The menu describes the food simply, but the dishes are far from simple. The menu changes constantly- always fresh and seasonal with many daily specials. Must-try dishes include the boar ragu, tortelacci (Gorgonzola and black walnut pasta, like ravioli), mare (daily special fish appetizer), and the butterscotch pudding (budino).   Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, so wait times can vary greatly. But if you arrive before 6 pm or are willing to sit at the bar (which is good for one or two), you typically will be seated immediately.   Atmosphere is casual, but some people wear smart casual. Outdoor seating on the sidewalk is available.   If you save the receipt, you can show it at Maduro (a cigar bar just around the block on East Main) for 25% off your first round of drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was under seasoned, and my boyfriend found a tiny bone in the Scottiglia (braised meat stew with 4 different kinds of meats in it) that we assume was a rabbit bone.  Very unappetizing.  I ordered Cavolo Nero which featured kale and \"guanciale\" which I had googled prior to going to the restaurant, and was excited to eat it as it looks kind of like bacon.  The dish was so bland and overrun with kale, and I did not taste any sort of bacon or meaty flavor.  Our server was snobby and clearly was not concerned when I left most of my meal uneaten and declined to take the uneaten part home in a take-home box.  Definitely skip this place, there are so many better places to get Italian food in Madison where the food is actually tasty and the waitstaff doesn't sneer at you for mispronouncing menu items."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Madison, which is not an award I give out easily. All of the pastas I have had are amazing. Really fresh tasting and good flavor combinations. Great cheese plate and wine selection as well. I also just love the atmosphere- romantic, authentic Italian feeling.   They don't take reservations which is a bit annoying, so I would recommend calling ahead to hear the wait and going on the later side. Small space so not good for groups, but really good quality food."}
{"text":"We got a table for two on a Friday night with no wait. The service was good and it was a nice atmosphere -- my partner and I appreciated getting a table sized for four so we could sit catty-corner to each rather than across from one another. We liked the bread, especially the fried one. The food I ordered (something spaghetti-like with pork jowls in it) was extremely salty. The butterscotch pudding was great!"}
{"text":"I ate here about a month ago but never got around to yelping, so it's a little hazy.  Went here on a Monday night with a roommate.  Immediately as you walk in, it's dark and quiet.  I felt like I had to use my \"indoor voice\" at the library.   There's a coat rack and then curtains before you walk in to create an entrance that I didn't appreciate because it's small and I like to see a place I've never been in fully at first glance.  The place is dimly lit for romance or for the slow lane.   We were seated and told the specials and given detailed descriptions of whatever we had questions about.  The waitress was knowledgeable and attentive.  We ordered a mussel round noodle soup dish for the appetizer to share, some wine and then boar with pasta and pork belly special.  The mussel dish was delicious.  The mussels were tiny but flavorful and the noodles just right.  The boar was good but it was a bit dry, however, that might just be how boar is.  The noodles were also a little dry but flavorful The pork belly was excellent.  Mmm.... it was a huge slab of bacon goodness.  I loved this a lot.  The bread they had were tasty as well, but the olive oil could have a been a grade better.    1 appetizer, 2 main dishes, and 1/3 or 1/2 bottle of wine cost us $70.  It is definitely not a cheap restaurant, but it's definitely memorable."}
{"text":"The fellas and I were looking for a nice top level italian meal while traveling through in our road trip, something similar to maybe Rosebud on Rush in Chicago.  While I did enjoy my meal, this was not the meal I was looking for.    For starters the place is rather small, cozy, but when you walk through the entrance you are immediately standing in the crowded dining room.  No hostess table, no entry space, nothing but a group of four looking to eat and get out of the cold now crammed in a 3'x3' space with diners all looking up taking their evaluation of who/what just walked in.  30 seconds in and already not comfortable.  This place had Mario Batali written all over it, what I mean is a super small menu, most of the Italian I can't read, all of the dishes were deep Italy style and totally homemade style recipes.  This is a very good thing in it's own right, but not what me or the group was looking for.  I wanted the whole slate of Italian favorites with white table cloths, premier service and food quality.  We had it all here except for the Italian favorites and the table cloths.    I knew we all felt the same way when we all ordered the same entree and had the same opinion.  After the appetizer which was good we all had the spicy pasta with meat ragu.  It literally came in a bowl similar to the size I would eat my cereal in.  After I was done I was jokingly like \"ok now I'll take three more of these\" and at $34 each, I was not happy, it wasn't that spectacular.  They might have gotten away with the perception factor if it was at least in a large bowl.  We all had dessert too and I still had room.  One of my freinds even used a classic line from a trip 3 years prior, which was after eating he said \"anybody up for PapaJohns?\"  The only saving grace was that the waitress failed to charge us for the $40 bottle of wine. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Wow this place was great! It was super cozy and the food was very well done. I loved our server; She was quite enjoyable to chat with, was unobtrusive yet always available, and she seemed happy to be working there.  Our Mare` plate was essentially comparable to a sashimi sampler at a nice sushi place, but with the addition of some Italian sauces and seasonings. Tonight, the Mare` plate had monkfish with a sort of marinara dressing, lightly lightly batter then fried squid with lemon aoili, and octopus and fava beans in vinaigrette. Outstanding.  ...but the whole experience was expensive. The check bummed me out a bit. Still, it was a very nice place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Osteria Papavero a 5 start review... after reading other reviews, and hearing from my roommates how much they adored this place I really had such high hopes. But... not all hope is lost for me for Papavero.  Love how quaint, and cozy it is here. We came at a later time for dinner and got seated right away. Checked out the drink list, and I ended up ordering the Azzuri Dacquiri. Loved it, I would compare it to a margarita but more sour/bitter. After we got our drinks, we waited for quite sometime for our waitress to come back. She read the specials off to us, and then took our order. She quick grabbed our menus and then didn't see her at all till our food came out. I ended up getting the  Crespelle agli Spinaci which was absolutely fantastic.   The cons I have with Osteria Papavero was that our waiter was just super inattentive, and when she was talking to us it was very robotic like, and never once smiled the whole time we were there. And lastly... for the amount of money I'm spending at Osteria I would hope I would have a great experience. And sadly it just didn't do it for me.   Maybe that I just came on a wrong night, but I wouldn't mind trying them out again, and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday!  The space was small, people had to kind of squeeze by the front door and wait for the hostess.  It's definitely a pricier place, but food was good. We started with the veggie platter and cheese platter. Not a lot of food, but was pretty delicious.  For the main course. You have the option of around 8 dishes. I had the black lobster spaghetti, and it was pretty good. Tried friends dishes, they were all tasty! Specifically, the spicy pork sausage pasta was very flavorful.  Desserts were also pretty delicious, we tried the apple pie and the chocolate salami one. Liked the chocolate the best as it was super chocolatey and had a nice grainy texture."}
{"text":"Never had a disappointing experience here! This place is fantastic. Ok, I'm going to get the only negative thing out of the way here, they don't take reservations and sometimes, the wait can be long, especially for larger groups. I once waited for over 2 hours and finally just ate at the bar with my group. The bartender gave us a bottle of wine on the house for the wait time, which I thought was very nice of them. So, it could definitely require some time investments, but well worth it.  Their main menu changes occasionally and they have nightly specials they post on to their website every evening. Off their regular menu, the pasta with truffles is absolutely fantastic! (don't remember the actual name on the menu) The salumi boards offer a nice selection of meats and the onion jam is tasty. The mixed grill of meats are competently done, but nothing to call home about. I usually order most of the meal off the specials menu and then supplement with one or two things off the regular menu and share everything with my table.   This place also does an offal week every year, where their nightly specials are all offal dishes. This is my favorite food week out of the year in Madison! So if you're an adventurous eater, don't miss it! It usually happens in late Oct."}
{"text":"Insultingly small portions for the price. I have no problem with limiting portion size and focusing on detail (in fact, I prefer it to the ridiculously oversized portions that most restaurants pile in front of you), but this went far beyond a point of ridiculousness - I felt like I was eating at the snooty restaurant archetype found only in comedy films. I was served about 6 ounces of a very light and simple pasta and paid at least $20 for the privilege. It didn't even contain any meat. I easily could have taken my money across the street and gotten a couple porterhouses for the price I paid for dinner for two here. I left this place hungry and poor, and therefore won't be repeating that mistake."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a higher rating because the food was delicious. Unfortunately, the waitress was rude and untimely."}
{"text":"We tried lunch at Osteria Papavero this week. We arrived @11:45 and were told to pick our seats. There are about a dozen or so tables inside and a few outside as well. It was bright, clean, and smelled amazing. There were only a few customers there when we arrived so we chose a window table. Our waitress quickly brought us menus and told us the specials. They all sounded delectable. She returned after a few minutes to take our order. My dining companion ordered the lasagna which was one of the specials. I ordered another special - the broken pasta which included pork and escarole. Our food was delivered incredibly quickly. I don't think it was even a ten minute wait. Both of our dishes were not only gorgeous but delicious. My pasta was tender, just slightly al dente, with gobs of spicy pork and tender escarole. My companion scarfed down his lasagna. Our waitress returned and asked if we wanted dessert. Normally I pass on dessert but I asked what they had and she described a bread pudding with caramel I just could not pass on.  It was at this point that things really slowed down. After an abnormally long wait, especially considering how quickly we were originally served, I looked around. Every table including those outside were filled. It appeared that our waitress was waiting on every table, which explained the sudden slow-down. Eventually my dessert arrived and it was everything I hoped it would be. Mouth-watering, slightly melted ice-cream, sweet, luscious caramel. We flagged down our waitress again who brought the check and eventually we flagged her down one last time to pick it up again.  The atmosphere and the food were phenomenal. Our waitress was great when we saw her. My only complaint is that it seemed they were greatly under-staffed. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good Italian food at a reasonable price.  Close to the capital so a good lunch or early dinner spot.  Friendly service.  Good wine and martinis."}
{"text":"After having an excellent lunch at Papavera some months ago, I decided to try an early dinner there.  Dinner was quite disappointing.  Caprese salad as a starter was okay though the sliced tomato was small.  Dressed arugala added color and flavor but anchovies were overly salty.  The crespelle with spinach had little spinach and was overwhelmingly white, reflecting the crepes and ricotta, and the taste profile did not get more nuanced as one ate.  Presentation of the tortelli, house-made pasta pockets with nettles and ricotta, could have been improved--they were swimming in a bowl of tomato sauce with no spoon provided.  Three medium-sized seared scallops comprising the Capoe Asante special were tasty enough but overall the dish did not impress.  Desserts were okay but, again, nothing special. Service also needed improvement.  The server, who was not particularly upbeat, brought main dishes before clearing off the appetizer plates making for an awkward transition.  In reciting the specials, she more than once indicated there were only one or two servings of an item left and this was early in the evening.  The server did not appear delighted with her job and that sense transferred to the guests.  The dining experience overall was serviceable but not something I would return to try again."}
{"text":"Papavero is among the top 3 or 4 best places in Madison, or even the whole state.  The food is Italian themed but could be called New American.  The charcuterie plates are adventurous and great to share for a foursome.  The cocktails are inventive and delicious.  They always have a bunch of beautiful specials.  These folks not only know how to cook, but how to design an attractive menu.  I could eat here every week and never get bored."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends, and we really enjoyed the exotic meats. The waitress knew the menu very thoroughly and had ingredients very well memorized. It reminded us of that spongebob episode where all he remembers Fine Dining and Breathing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just enjoyed a lovely dinner at this restaurant. The portions aren't huge but we definitely had enough to eat. The butterscotch pudding was outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to whenever a friend comes in town. The atmosphere is great and the food is unbeatable. The menu changes quite frequently and it's never been a disappointment."}
{"text":"I really, truly wanted to love this place.  BF and I went last night for the first time.  Our server was friendly and showed a thorough knowledge of the menu and most of the specials.  One of the specials last night was a Torta (apparently giant tortellini).  The server said she would check with the kitchen to find out what kind it was.    In the meantime, a large table of men obviously there on expense accounts were seated next to our table.  If I saw that kind of tip potential walk in the door I probably would have fawned over them, too, and forgot about everyone else.  I asked our server three separate times what the Torta special was.  Then she returned quite late to take our food order.  BF and I shared an arugula and speck (ham) salad, a first course (egg noodles with wild boar) and a second course (pork shoulder, pork sausage with potatoes in a tomato sauce).  When we ordered we told her we were sharing and would like extra plates.  No extra plates came with the food.  Again, we had to ask multiple times for the extra plates.  She was so scatterbrained.  So, for service, as much as I liked the server and as knowledgable as she was, she just wasn't keeping it together last night.  Yes, I understand:  expense accounts = big tips.  But the BF and I are locals, and with better service we would probably return to the restaurant as regulars.  The corporate dudes probably won't come back.  Be nice to us wee locals.    As for the food, it was good.  Not great, but good.  But now I'm craving the food at A Pig in a Fur Coat on Willy St, where they do pork dishes better than anyone else.  Almost forgot dessert.  We shared Lemon Tarte with Raspberry Sorbet and Whipped Cream.  All three items were delicious, although the BF stated the whipped cream tasted odd.  I couldn't tell.  I would have paired either the tarte or the sorbet with something less tangy to let either one shine.  As it was, it was too much sour (too much \"tartness\") going on and it just tasted like a big mish-mash of sour."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise on a Saturday night!! A quaint romantic place, although there were a few non-couples and children there, too. The bartenders and waitstaff were very pleasant. The hostess wasn't. Maybe she was having a bad day?  Food was divine. Basket of bread and focaccia with olives baked in was amazing. There was also a square of fried dough. So very good, just a bit too salty. I brushed the extra salt off and it was fine. My wine was a lovely moscato that I will be searching for in the liquor stores. My husband also enjoyed his wine. I ordered tagliatelle with crab meat and cherry tomatoes. My mouth is watering just writing about it. My husband ordered the tiny gnocchi. Again, a home run! Per our server's suggestion, I had the chocolate bread pudding with passionfruit syrup and a dollop of whipped cream. I have been dreaming about that dessert ever since. The room is not very large so it fills up quickly. Wasn't loud though! My husband and I will be back there very soon."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a birthday. It has a nice cozy atmosphere and our waitress gave us good wine recommendations. I had the Nduja, a pasta dish with pork sausage, which was quite good."}
{"text":"My new favorite!  For those of you that are keeping score, Papavero stole the number one spot from my former fave, Nostrano.  Every dish. Every single appetizer, entree, cocktail, and dessert that I have tasted here has been spectacular. There are roughly 12 daily changing specials written on the chalkboard. Many of those specials are fresh seafood - hard to come by in Madison. I would tell you to stick to the specials because they're so fun and different, but lately I've been grateful that the braised boar papardelle was on the menu so I could come back for more of it.  One tip: Ask for an Amaro as a digestif after your dinner! Your server can explain what it is if you've never heard of it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything was good - appetizer, entrée, dessert and even the coffee. There are three or four dishes in each category plus seasonal specials, plus they rotate dishes on and off the menu. The have an informative FB page so you know what hot & current, can't ask for much more. The soft shelled crab entree is absolutely fantastic, not too much coating, not too much sauce, sitting on fresh vegetables. Wow!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in Madison. I recommend trying their seasonal vegetable dishes. It's a very nice restaurant where the staff are not snobs. Still can be a place for causal dining."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  My love affair with Osteria Papavero most definitely started from the very first visit.  As most restaurants around the square are great for date nights, Osteria Papavero definitely turns the romance up a bit with a lovely intimate space that doesn't feel too dark, or too intensely moody.  Having eaten here several times now, I'd have to say that you can't go wrong ordering from their regular menu. I personally love hearing the specials and almost always go with one of them for my choice of entree. Their food is really on point whether you decide to come here for lunch or dinner and one of the items I tend to come back to again and again during dinner is the Antipasto di Mare. This is an appetizer dish that is three different small servings of seafood that changes nightly. It ranges from soft shell crab, to scallops, to beautiful luscious tuna, and everything beyond. Each small dish is always wonderfully prepared and I absolutely love the fact that you can try a little bit of three different things to start off your dinner. Secondly, the butterscotch pudding is absolutely DEE-VINE. It's a heaping portion of perfectly creamy and deliciously butterscotchy (that's a word now) pudding that is in the right range of sweet where you don't feel ill after finishing off the entire bowl (which you will). The Panna Cotta is probably my number two for dessert, but I'm a sucker for anything in the gelatin/custard family for sweets.  From the very beginning Osteria Papavero has always been outstanding, with remarkable service to top it off. This restaurant will always hold a fairly large spot in my heart."}
{"text":"Very cool, very casual little new restaurant on Wilson street. I popped in here with a couple of friends on a terribly blustery and snowy day for November to grab some lunch and warm up. And it really did the trick. Three of us snagged a nice little bottle of red wine with some tasty little prosciutto flatbread sandwiches and a bucatini (hollow spaghetti) dish. All in all the lunch was super light and simple which was great considering all the fried food I had been stuffing my face with while in Madison. We topped it all of with some really delicious deserts, the pumpkin dish (whose name escapes me right now) was pretty unbelievable. My only complaint is that they seem to have a few growing pains to work out like offering us wine they ran out of and giving us our check too soon, but all in all a pretty cool Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to trying this restaurant. But because of such poor service during my experience here, I can say with confidence that my first visit to Osteria Papavero will also be my last.   Examples of the poor service: -We stood 5-10 minutes with multiple servers seeing us and walking past us with no greeting and no discussion about finding us a table. -After getting a table, we sat about 10 minutes before being greeted by a server. -Husband found a hair in his water glass. \"Oh gross\" and a new water was the apology. -My glass of wine took 20 minutes to arrive at our table and arrived with our entrees. The wine arrived after a reminder to our server. -I watched plates of food sit on the counter for 5-10 minutes before a server would pick them up and deliver them to the designated table. I watched one server walk up to the counter, look at the ticket by the dishes, then walk away. This struck me as poor teamwork among the staff. Guests are hungry, and their food is clearly ready. - I watched a server cleaning glasses at the bar look up and make eye contact with two guests who walked in, and then went back to cleaning the glasses. Are guests unwanted?  Finally, I also had a few concerns with the Italian theme of the restaurant: - Osteria Papavero should do what restaurants in Italy do: The servers should ask guests if they would like an espresso (or at least coffee) after their meal before delivering the check.  - If the specials on the chalkboard are written in Italian, the servers should correctly pronounce the dishes when they explain them to guests. My server pronounced \"vongole\" as \"vahn-goalie.\" No.  For the food, the apps and entrees were fine. I enjoyed my saffron pasta, although I thought it could have used more salt; the only noticeable flavors to me were pasta and saffron. The desserts (lemon custard with blueberry compote and chocolate brioche bread pudding) were quite heavenly!  In the end, I found the extremely poor level of customer service really disappointing and took it as my signal to not go back. I really wanted to like this place. What a bummer."}
{"text":"middle of the road Italian food - ox tail was appealing"}
{"text":"I've looked high and low; I've searched nooks and crannies; I've stepped foot into some not so pleasant places (insert names of establishments holding titles for my one and two star reviews), all in the name of finding the best dining experience in Madison. After a year and a half of living on the isthmus, I have found it, and it was closer than I thought.  Osteria Papavero has everything a restaurant needs to be a successful business. They have knowledgable bartenders (I know little to nothing about liquor or wine) who give great recommendations. The staff is cordial and on point even while busy. And yet, attentive enough as they are, they do not hover, and allow you to enjoy your wonderful meal in peace. I give them mad props.  Now, where Osteria really got me was when I tried the first bite of my meal. I ordered the Crespelle alla Fiorentina, and after that I knew that this place was \"the one\". I couldn't stop eating it, and I was already full on their delicious complimentary bread (and wine). My partner had one of their many specials and devoured it, and my mother enjoyed her meal as well.    Although this wonderful restaurant is a little pricey, it is well worth it.  After all, this is the best place to dine in Madison."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner based on a recommendation from our B&B innkeeper.  Our meal at OP did not disappoint.  They offered at least 5-6 specials based on seasonal ingredients.  Their pasta was cooked to perfection and where we really  thought they shined was the starters. Beautifully prepared asparagus soup, and a decadent yet light burrata salad. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and authentic Italian food.  Been coming here for years and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"All around a great, relaxed meal. My mother has food allergies, so I emailed them as soon as we decided to go, and they responded promptly with assurances.  We arrived early on a snowy evening, and were able to get a table for 5 - about 20 min before the rush - so drinks in hand we decided on dishes.  Get a special - they were amazing.  Be prepared to have a relaxed dinner - slow service is not a bad thing - they are expecting you to linger.   I can recommend the short ribs - chorizo prawns - cured meat plate -mulled wine"}
{"text":"Went twice, once for lunch with colleagues and once for dinner with BF.  I have to say that I had a better experience with lunch, than with dinner. At lunch the food was homey, simple and delicious. At dinner I found it a bit over dressed.  For the time being, I will give it 3 star because the dinner dishes fell into the trap of many Italian restaurant: too much sauce, too many flavors, trying too hard to be something special. To me, the best Italian food sports few flavors. One main standout ingredients. A subtle balance of all the supporting components working to enhance the main ingredient without overpowering it. I understand that this is not what most people thin of as Italian, so I realize chef and restaurateur have to go after the main crowd and this might make for a tough balancing act. But that dinner was threading to close to the worse side of Italian food.  Other than the food, at dinner I had some pretty bad wine. The first glass I even sent back. I might have just chosen the wrong wine, but that also did not help with the whole dinner experience.  Anyway, I will be back hoping to find a better balance next time. Or I might just stick to lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The people who run it are wonderful - kind and attentive.  The dessert options (even if you aren't a sweets person) are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is a very dainty Italian place perfect for date nights. The establishment is small with 2-3 servers and limited selection of menu which changes for lunch and dinner and also everyday. We tried the mushroom soup which was surely rich in terms of exquisite mushrooms but they were too chunky to go in a soup (I had to use fork and knife to fit those chunks in my spoon) overall the flavor was decent. What took the all star rating was the brilliant tortellini pasta with lobster mushroom and artichokes. The flavor was delicate yet complex. My partner tried their gnocchi with sausage which was full of spice and delivers the hit. We finished our meal with the recommended butterscotch dessert and it was nothing like I have tasted before. Must try!"}
{"text":"I had the Pappardelle w/ Wild Board... it was decent but the portions were puny... might have been a little too salty for my liking as well.  Bottom line, I think I'll find another place for Italian food."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMMMMMMM! In fact, the only negative thing I can say is that EVERYTHING on the menu and all the specials sounded amazing so it was super hard to choose.   From the atmosphere to the service to the food... all great!  Really, why go to fantastic restaurants in town if you're not going to go all out... and we did. Don't skip a course cause you'll be doing yourself an injustice! I could go on and on about the entire meal. Just when you thought you'd eaten the best thing of the night the next dish came out and proved to be even more delicious.   To highlight a few, the Caprese Salad had the best sun dried tomatoes I've ever had. No seriously, there are not words to describe their awesomeness! And the desert. OH - MY - GOD! You know that part in \"When Harry Met Sally\", with Meg Ryan in the diner... you know the scene.... Well, that was me with each mind blowing bite of chocolaty perfection. Easily the best desert in Madison, and sadly I don't even know the name of it cause my husband ordered it for me as a birthday surprise. Trust me, cake is old news, this fudgy, whip creamy, cherry delight is truly orgasmic."}
{"text":"We had Antipasto Misto di Verdure (3 appetizers), Spaghetti Cozze e Vongole (seafood pasta) and some duck ravioli special.  The appetizers were unique: some swiss chard flan, garlic veggie, and bacon-wrapped grilled pepper and eggplant.   They charge $3 for meager amount of bread: 3 pieces of cold bread + 1 fried and over-salted flat bread.   All food was extremely salty and oily, including the bread.The entrees could have been better if they cut the oil and salt down to 1/3. The portions are small, and I feel that in terms of price per unit weight, it probably rivals the expensiveness of Magnus next door.  The duck ravioli was $17 with 5 raviolis in it.   My advice: order the appetizer special to go and eat it with bread from copps while watching a movie at home."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants, if not the best, in Madison.   Traditional food, traditional ways of serving it, traditional portions but CHEAPER than traditional prices. If you want REAL Italian food, come here. If you want fake, American Italian food, go to Tutto Pasta.   This place is so amazing, and use of local ingredients makes a world of a difference. Seriously, go here. You won't regret it.   Probably should get the Wild Boar dish."}
{"text":"Decent food, nice cozy space. A bit overpriced with small portions.   We ordered the crab cream pasta, which instead came out with a middle-of-the-road marinara sauce and only the slightest hint of crab, embarrassingly so. It was basically a 'macaroni with gravy' and not much else. That the dish didn't reflect its description would have been OK, but it was tiny and my partner was left hungry for $20.   I ordered the fish special with what appeared to be an olive and eggplant puttanesca-like ragout of sorts. It was very vinegary and there were quite a few olives (a high-priced item) and the fish was OK if a little fishy. Also for $20 it was basically worth it but lacked any wow factor.  The chocolate cake with coffee for dessert was acceptable and had so much coffee that we stayed up pretty late.  With one glass of wine the above cost was about $65, similarly priced to other expensive-ish restaurants in town. We'd come back for lunch but that's a bit too expensive for small-portion pasta."}
{"text":"This review is only for drinks and dessert.  Great drinks, great wine list, AAAAmazing desserts.   Great second date spot, or get drinks and oysters at Tempest, and then come over for more drinks and dessert.   Great service, regularly has plenty of seating."}
{"text":"+/+/-/ service was excellent (not fast on the water refill however) +/ ambience was classy and clean  +/ delicious bread  +/+/ food was yummy +/+/+ flowers and candles at every table Would like to give it 4.5 stars. Is a very nice Italian restaurant and close to the capitol. Two entrees, dessert, and no drinks for two was $50."}
{"text":"Been back quite a few times since my first review, and I'm still their biggest fan. This is the little out of the way place I recommend to my friends to bring their out of town visitors to impress them with the foodie side of Madison. The seafood is always excellent. They had a duck special last time that was on point, and their wine list is perfectly sized for the location. I have no reservations about recommending this place to anyone.  Also. If you get a chance to get their mulled wine--do it. Oooooh. So greattt."}
{"text":"Attention: Corey D.! Look, I finally did it.   So the long-awaited dinner plans to come here finally commenced. We met with another couple who was here for the first time as well. We were seated as soon as the whole party was present; our table was near the door so even though the entrance was covered by curtains, we were blessed with the cold breeze every time it opened.   We started off with the bread basket. Not too extraordinary, but we did enjoy the huge piece of fried ravioli-looking bread. I have no idea what it's called. Forgive me.  Our friends started with the Assaggio di Formaggi Freschi, which was a three-cheese appetizer course with what tasted like honey jam. I can't remember the cheese on the plate, but it was likely goat cheese was one of them. It wasn't bad--I didn't have much of it but a small taste of each cheese with the honey jam. It wasn't a favorite either.  I started with the Zuppa di Funghi, which is wild mushroom soup with grilled country-style bread. But if you notice, I didn't get my grilled bread. Huh? That may be the reason the price I paid for was $5 versus the menu price of $9. But then again...$4 more for the slice of bread? I was confused. I didn't ask. I saw it on the receipt and didn't think twice. I didn't care at the time. I do now! Oh well. The soup was DELICIOUS. The variety of mushroom was such a treat, I didn't expect it. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again and again.    My fiancé had the Crespelle agli Spinaci, which was really cheesy and not a lot of spinach. He said it was fine; I tasted it and thought the same. I ordered the Taglierini alla Norcina, which was amazing. The black truffle and the sausage and the cream sauce? Sooooo comforting on a cold night. This and the mushroom soup made great love in my tummy. Yes. I did just say that. The portion sizes for these dishes weren't massive, but they were satisfying.   Our friends ordered a scallop dish and a tortelli dish. They both enjoyed it.   One of us ordered the Seadas for dessert, which was totally surprised us in taste. And not in a good way. We didn't expect the cheese to be so----potent? Needless to say, we anticipated a sweeter dessert. Our server noticed we didn't seem to enjoy and told us after the fact that it has a \"funky\" taste. It would've been nice to know beforehand. The fried pocket it was in was good on its own; I managed to take a small corner edge that didn't have the cheese filling. Not a favorite. We all agreed we should've went with butterscotch pudding.   As for the service, no complaints really. Our server did an amazing job describing the specials for the night and helping us with the menu when it was time to order. Our drinks were refilled in a timely manner. And someone made coffee nearby so we enjoyed the smell as it traveled towards our table.   Overall, not bad. It wouldn't be a regular place for dinner, but the whole trip was really for the mushroom soup. I did it! It was yummy. I was impressed.   But where was my bread? =("}
{"text":"Before my lunch today at Osteria Papavero, I had no idea that a sandwich could possibly be so delicious and well crafted! I had the Three Little Piggies sandwich and it was amazing! I knew when I saw it on the menu that I would probably like it, ( I can't resist anything that includes bacon and avocado) but when I took my first bite, I was surprised by just how much I loved it. The flavors of the smoky bacon, fresh avocado and spicy peppers were perfectly balanced and so tasty. I will definitely be back for this sandwich again!  We concluded our meal with the Butterscotch Budino. Like many previous reviewers have said, it was absolutely amazing! I'm not usually one to pick a butterscotch flavored dessert, but this one was fantastic. It had the perfect level of sweetness and a fantastic, lusciously creamy texture.   Everything I sampled at Osteria Papavero today was delicious and I can't wait to see what they have to offer for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice service, solid menu choices. Prices were high, portions were small, we were there for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Waitress really knew the art of serving attentively and recommending menu items . Food was great, we did cocktails instead of wine and all of them were really good. I love bourbon based drinks so the \"main squeeze\" was awesome!"}
{"text":"Five hundred stars.  I've been reticent to post about this one, for purely selfish reasons: I don't want too many people to know about this place.  It seems to fly under the radar with a pretty low profile in the crowded Madison restaurant scene, and that's fine because, make no mistake, it's amazing.    I've been coming here about once a month for a few years, and the food has never been short of fantastic.  After reading a what's already been posted, I'll try to sum up my many experiences in a few short quips and tips:   Get the Budino for dessert.  I'm not even a fan of butterscotch pudding nor do I even order dessert as a mandate, and it's amazing.  Pay attention to the long list of specials when your server describes them, which are written only in Italian (with no descriptions) on the wall.  This is the best stuff they have going, and it changes just about every day.  Ask him/her to repeat them if you didn't get it all the first time, there really are a lot.  Of the options on the printed menu, all are fantastic.  The N'duja is incredibly spicy, but good.  The Wild Boar pasta dish is amazing.  Also, there are usually several rotating appetizer samplers (seafood, vegetarian, etc) where you get three or four different preparations in separate little bowls on one plate.  Just like the specials, these preparations change daily, and are also good for sharing.  Try something from the bar.  They don't take reservations and the place is almost always busy on weekends, so there can be a bit of a wait.  It's worth it.  Wait at the bar and try one of the wonderful creative cocktails from their list, a beer (there is usually a different, not-mass-marketed Italian beer on draft), or a glass of wine.  Their wine list is extensive and features only Italian wines, many of them somewhat obscure if you're not an Italian wine expert (I'm definitely not).  The servers have always done a great job pairing the wines with the food ordered.  A lot of reviews complained about the portion sizes for the entrees.  They're only on the small side if you're used to traditional Americanized Italian food portions at a place like Olive Garden, ie. huge.  Papavero is real, authentic, inventive Italian, and entree portions are smaller in Europe.  Instead, order another appetizer or two, and save room for the Budino for dessert.  Share a bunch of stuff and try as much as you can.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I went here for Madison Magazine's Restaurant Week. The menu is filled with traditional Italian food. My friend had pressed coffee with her meal. They press the coffee at your table...talk about fresh. I had a tortellini for my main course. It was made with care and tasted fantastic. The portions are not large so I would suggest starting off with an appetizer or finishing with a dessert. The quality of the food is worth the price in my opinion. The tiramisu is out of this world.  Oh, and it's a small, busy place so I would suggest either eating early or late if you plan to dine here on the weekend."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by a recent and first visit to Osteria Papavero.  Upon arrival on a Monday evening around 6 PM I was a little concerned that we were the only patrons.  Further, the interior is very casual, dare I say \"Ikea-esque\" but perfectly comfortable.  Upon being seated we were handed a pretty light menu with few options.  The chalk board at the north end of the dinning room helped our waitress explain a few of the available specials that night.  What was offered included fresh seafood such as Octopus along with Halibut and a beef dish a friend ordered.  I don't remember all the details but what I do remember is that the food was excellent, fresh, creative, and unique.  In fact, it was the first time I'd been served an entire whole octopus though I've ordered octopus many a time.  This is going to be a short review cuz I just want to get it in but rest assured, this is about as close as you're going to get to European style dinning in the Midwest.  There are certainly more upscale Italian restaurants and there are certainly more traditional Italian restaurants but Papavero gives you a real feel for freshly prepared, creative food.  I truly enjoyed my meal there."}
{"text":"Far and away the best Italian in Madison, and among the best restaurants period.  Authentic but creative Bolognese-inspired cuisine.  This place is so good it would thrive in Bologna -- so it's a real treat to have here.  The only chronic issue is that service can be slow when they're busy."}
{"text":"We went for my brother's birthday, just popped in. The menu is very limited and confusing. I get they want it in Italian, but nothing looked familiar. I had the wild boar and egg noodles, it was good, but not great. The soup of the day was better. It just seems like they could have done so much better."}
{"text":"I didn't go many places for Restaurant Week, and I am so glad that Osteria Papavero was one of my choices.   Ambiance: It was a fantastic place for a ladies night, but it would also be good for a date.  The restaurant is very cute, quiet enough for conversation, and small enough that it feels intimate.  Food: I did not expect much from the budino, but the rave reviews convinced me to try it. You have to get it, it was beyond belief. Also, The Elk Ragout was INCREDIBLE AND they had mulled wine.   Overall: One of my favorite places in Madison. The prices were definitely reasonable and the service was attentive without being intrusive."}
{"text":"I came here for summer restaurant week and was sadly not impressed.  Polipo - grilled octopus was cooked way to long. Was so difficult to chew, even to cut through with our knives. Super disappointed.  Magatello - Meat was nicely sliced!  Tortellini Alle Erbe - the tomato/butter sauce was too liquidy and lacked flavor. Tortelli was tough and didn't taste freshly made.  Filetto al Peppe Verde - tenderloin was cooked well here but the spinach was too sautéed, almost seemed like a pure with the green peppercorn sauce, so another element of flavor in the dish was missing.  Dessert - good, but nothing special about them that I couldn't order in another Italian restaurant.  Staff - being right on the square, I recommend having some change available to customers in case they need for parking. Having none in this location is pretty absurd to me, especially with a lot of coined meters still in the area. Waitress was not very attentive and seemed irritated by us which put a damper on the meal.  Cute little space, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I feel like words just won't do justice to the phenomenal level of quality that Osteria Papavero has created on all levels, but I will do my best. I absolutely feel (and my husband agrees) that it's easily one of the best restaurants in Madison for a number of reasons. Let me count the ways.....  1. Their service is stellar! Our server on 2/13/15 was Becky and she was perfection. Love her! She was professional yet personable/kind and easy going yet very informative on all aspects of the menu. I felt like I could just sit down and have a chat with her, she was that lovely. I hope we have her again.  2.  Their food is AMAZING - every single time! Their rotating, seasonal menu is wonderful in and of itself, but they also have a way of consistently exceeding my expectations. It's always beautiful and sensational to the senses. I'll get into the details of our meal in a little bit.  3. The restaurant decor is a great combination of comforting, interesting & minimalist. The tables are really beautiful; many of them look like trees and have thoughtful, little details. Take a look next time you're there. The lighting makes me really happy - not too dark & not too bright, plus I love the look of their sconces. The dishes are simple, classy white which really aids in showing off their gorgeous fare.  We chose to do our Valentine's celebration one day early. Brilliant choice, I know! We got there close to 5pm to secure a nice table since they don't take reservations and they fill up quickly, especially on a Friday night.  We started with the Burrata which included fresh made mozzarella, eggplant fries, and an arugula salad drizzled with honey. It was heaven. Everything was so light and flavorful. And each component balanced the others. I've never had such tender, almost spreadable mozzarella in my life, the eggplant fries were crispy with a great text and the arugula salad with honey provided some sweet with the salt.  For my 2nd course, I chose the Taglierini alla Norcina and I did not want that dish to ever end. I ate it so slowly savoring every bite. The pasta was fresh and delicate, the homemade sausage was full of wonderful flavor and the cream sauce was so light, almost peripheral, but exactly what the pasta needed. It was topped with some thinly shaved black truffles that added a nice earthiness which I enjoyed (and was surprised by seeing as I'm not a mushroom fan). The Taglierini and I will definitely meet again. My husband had the Crespelle agli Spinaci, savory crepes filled with ricotta and spinach topped with a besiamella sauce. It was rich, but not heavy, nicely balanced with a tomato sauce. He was beyond happy.  We finished off with the Budino, their unbelievably delightful butterscotch pudding topped with fresh whipped cream & dusted with cocoa powder. To call it a pudding really doesn't give it the credit it so rightly deserves and words fail me on this so you'll just need to go eat a bowl so that you can understand the magic.  We left happy and satiated. Thank you, Osteria Papavero! And please don't change a thing."}
{"text":"a hidden gem - a diamond in the rough - went here purely based on Yelp reviews and will be returning many times again.  A rather small, store front like ristorante of the type one finds in Chicago or New York with excellent food and a superb selection of wines. An excellent bar is the centerpiece to seating for about 35.  Now they had no cocktail onions and no drambuie, but beyond those faux pas, we had an excellent dinner.  We had a wonderful server named Sara who knew the menu intimately, had superb wine pairing suggestions by the glass or bottle and she recited the specials off the chalk board with the expertise of the professional she is and clearly provides the establishment with an exceptional talent.  She had tried most of the menu and was an entrusted expert when it came to deciding between items.  I would return only if she were my server. They had no cocktail onions for my Gibson, but the olives transformed my norm into a superb martini of acceptable character and overcame my temporary disappointment.  We did several of antipasto as starters and had a wide array of sausages and terrines that were excellent, along with a fresh seafood plate that featured sushi grade ahi tuna done several ways and calamari in a provencal sauce that was a perfect pairing with the home made breads. I would have like to have seen some oil or butter on the table to accompany the breads.  Home cooked, properly prepared and served, they were excellent when paired with our entrees at this dinner.  This anitpasto was such that one could enjoy wine, bread and antipasto and forgo dinner. The squab and foie gras was excellent, perfectly cooked, though a little shy on the foie gras, it was an excellent entree served on a bed of sweet and sour greens and off the menu.  The others in the party had pasta, all homemade and tasty with obviously hand cut sausages and special attention to the sauces and toppings of fresh veg and cheeses. The crepes were seasoned well, stuffed properly and tasty in a light bechamel sauce..  For dessert we tried the ricotta cake - moist and a fun topping of fresh berries, the butterscotch pudding - melts in your mouth better than anything grandmother ever made and perfectly brewed coffee in a French press to culminate an excellent meal.  Not as pricey as some might think, well worth it for exquisite fare.  Service was superb, food excellent, hot and well presented in unque presentations.  A very romantic ristorante and one that lovers or soon to be lovers would relish as a way to start their evening."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review about my favorite Italian place in Madison?  Probably didn't want to get the word out but looking at the reviews, it is definitely out.   Small, rustic, no pretense but serving great food and drinks.  While the items on the menu are solid (pappardelle with wild boar is always a fave), I really think the restaurant shines through their specials.  My last visit was during lunch and I had an incredible gnocchi with braised lamb leg.  The housemade potato gnocchi was soft and pillowy and paired well with the rich and hearty lamb.  I love that the restaurant serves as a blank canvas to the food and diners that come eat here.  It is just as comfortable for a business lunch as it is for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"This is hands down my absolute favorite restaurant in Madison.   It is a small/cozy/romantic space and they do not accept reservations, so if you have to wait, grab a seat at the bar and have a glass of wine, trust me it's worth it. Surprisingly I've never had to wait more than about 20 or 30 minutes and that was with a larger group.   The food is just fantastic. They change their menu up pretty frequently but they also have a few main stays. I've had a variety of their pasta dishes as well as some their meat and fish entrees and I have never been disappointed. The ingredients are always very fresh, the pasta is freshly homemade, I really can't say enough good things about it.   I've been quite a few times and the wait staff is always superb. They all know the menu very well and have a good knowledge of wines as well and are always prepared with recommendations based on what you are looking for.   This is as good as it gets when it comes to Italian food in Madison."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week Review  This place is a cozy little area tucked away near the capitol. We made sure to arrive early for dinner to beat the rush (as there are no reservations). We were immediately seated. We tried the octopus, branzino, beef tenderloin, budino and budino de pane e cioccolato. Our dinner came with a small basket with an assortment of breads that we appreciated (including a fried one similar to an elephant ear but was savory rather than sweet, an olive-bread and a classic). Our appetizer, the octopus, was good. The chef knows what he/she is doing with the sear and the cook; the flavor was wonderful but the octopus itself had a strange texture (almost more like a chewy fish - perhaps the result of cooking something frozen?). I would chalk this up to being the lack of seafood in Wisconsin rather than the chef, though and still enjoyed the dish. The bed of potatoes and roasted peppers were beautifully seasoned and generously portioned though and I enjoyed the dish overall.  Our entrees came out and I was mildly surprised, as the portion size was the same as our appetizer (maybe just plating on a larger plate would make it seem more entree-esque I would say). They do say good things come in small packages though, which was very true. The beef tenderloin was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was oh so buttery. It was deliciously rich (with all that butter, how could it not be?), but maybe a tiny bit salty for my taste. Still great though. The branzino was also perfectly done. The skin was nice and crispy and the flavor of the fish was delicious. The ratatouille was simple and was a bit of a strange accompaniment to the fish in my personal opinion, but overall the dish was still solid.   Dessert was definitely one of the best parts of the meal. The budino as everyone has mentioned, is surprisingly delicious. I would not have thought to order a butterscotch pudding, but the flavor is delicate and cool, and it tasted decadent but not overly sweet. The budino de pane e cioccolato was also very good. I usually would not order a bread pudding, but was glad for this exception. Again, not too sweet but also very satisfying.  The biggest qualm I had was the huge lull between dinner and dessert (maybe 20 minutes?). Our waitress did notice after awhile that we had not received our desserts yet, but I felt like it was dismissed, while we saw other tables around us who came after us get theirs first. Luckily, we didn't have anywhere to go, but it was a strange wait. I did not change my overall review though, as I felt it wouldn't be fair for a minor mistake, but felt it was something worth mentioning.   Overall, the food was expertly cooked and we had a nice evening out."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and found we would have a thirty-minute wait (They do not take reservations) so decided to sit at the bar.  The bar tender poured me three tastes of wines and asked me to describe them.  Based on that, he brought out one more that he thought would suit.  It was a boutique Italian wine that was perfection - everything I always look for (and often don't find when dining out).  I began with the pork belly appetizer. The crispy on the outside succulent on the inside pork belly was topped with a faultless fried egg and surrounded by smoky fresh whole chilies sautéed in virgin olive oil. This rift on bacon, eggs, and hot sauce was one of the best things I have eaten this year.  My daughter began with an excellent caprese salad that had a nice addition of arugula.  My daughter had the tortellacci with a gorgonzola cream sauce, which she pronounced \"delicious.\"  I had the tagliolini with tomato sauce and lobster tail.  The sauce was fresh and flavorful.  The lobster tail was a tad fishy but mixed well with the sauce.  The portions were just right, after the rich appetizers.  We couldn't resist the dolci.  I had the butterscotch pudding that was marvelous.  My daughter had the cheesecake which had an interesting tart kumquat sauce adorned with a wonderful crunchy roasted pistachio crust.  The atmosphere was reminiscent of Rome.  The service was knowledgeable and gracious.  The bill was about $60 a person, which felt reasonable given the quality of the food and service.  My only complaint is that I wish they took reservations."}
{"text":"Amazing food every time.  Lunch is extremely good.  Dinner is out of this world. Friendly, knowledgeable servers. We dined with an Italian student and she said the food was \"just like home\". It is her favorite in Madison by far.  We usually start with a cocktail.  They have a great and changing selection.   Then we move on to the vegetable or seafood appetizer.  Each is three different preparations.  Tonight the seafood appetizer was squid with roasted red pepper sauce; smoked salmon and bean salad; plus a scallop with potato salad.  The sauces on each were different and delicious.   Then we had a piece of trout roasted and served on eggplant and mashed potatoes.  Again, amazing.   Dessert specials are always good.  But you have to try the Budino, a butterscotch pudding. It is the best single desert ever.  It even beats chocolate.   With dessert you should try an amaro, Italian after dinner sipping liquers.  They have a big selection and will give you tastes to help you decide.  This is the best restaurant in Madison. You need to go."}
{"text":"MFing Pasta con la N'Duja & Budino di Caramello all day, every day. If it was appropriate to take away stars because one combo of dishes is so good that it becomes impossible to order anything else, I would do it. But alas, I can't. Generally, I'm not too fancy. Throw some italian-american red sauce on anything and melt a buttload of cheese, then I will eat it and enjoy it. This place though. Not even Italian-American, but straight up motherland. Balanced, nuanced, creative & delicious describe every single dish I've eaten here. Truffle appetizers, cocktails, the afore mentioned entree and dessert, you name it.  Probably the best restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place for dinner, unusual beer selection. Small menu but what is on it was worth ever bite, they were even nice enough to make the kids a simple noodles with sauce and gnocchi with pesto. Next time in Madison a must stop!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars to Osteria Papavero, because the food was okay and the service was also fine.  As I'm sure you can guess from the sentence above, the overall experience did not blow me away, but I'm glad I gave it a try. It's been on my list for a few years and will probably wait a few more for a round two.  What I Tried: Antipasto di Mare- Three small plates that change regularly 1. Soft shell crab frittata- Lacked well rounded flavor and was tough (for eggs), but over all, okay. 2. Salt cured cod with tarter sauce- Very plain but balanced dish, fish was very tough (but that could be because it was salt cured). 3. Sword fish in a tomato sauce with olives- Sword fish was cooked well, very tender and the sauce was very flavorful.  Norcina- Penne like noodles (looked hand rolled), loaded with Parmesan and cream sauce. Very flavorful. I would definitely recommend this one.  Pasta con la N'duja- Really big rigatoni like noodles, lots of sausage and just a little sprinkling of smoked ricotta on top. A little greasy with all the sausage, and quite spicy (Full disclosure: I am a spicy wuss, so it probably is not that bad)   Butterscotch Pudding- Based on the reviews, I was expecting a revelation/vision, and all I got was a good idea. Good but not the spiritual experience I was hoping for. To recreate, I would recommend Martha Stewart's recipe for pastry cream for eclairs, then add a good quality butterscotch or caramel at the end: http://www.marthastewart.com/317571/pastry-cream-for-eclairs"}
{"text":"The food was worthy of 4 stars, but it took forever to get it!    Yeah the menu items were creative, but not mind-blowing, and honestly the portions were a bit small for the high cost.  There was really nothing on the menu that was appropriate for children, so it was complaints all around.  My husband found nothing on the menu that he wanted, probably because there weren't any authentic Italian dishes-- everything was complicated and complex, which is NOT how food is prepared in Italy.    The questionable food, plus the excessive wait, can only mean one thing: Average. Hence, 3 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite italian place in town. Intimate setting; probably the most romantic spot in town. Pasta made in house with some of the best sauces around. Truly delicious with an ambiance that can't be beat. Take her here if you really like her."}
{"text":"This place is perhaps the best restaurant for its price in Madison.  I love coming here for lunch, the prices are very reasonable and everything is always really, really good.  For Dinner, this place is great for a party or just for a date.  The portions are light, but the price reflects this.  The smaller portions make sharing fun and it is always fun to check out the daily specials (usually there are at least 5)    One of the reasons their specials are always changing is because they buy fresh produce from local farms like Harmony Valley and local organic meat producers.  The Chef, Francesco has come by my table on multiple occasions to offer daily specials and make sure everything is up my standards (which are high)  I hear he is from Italy, which makes sense because the food is so good.  I love their home-made bread!"}
{"text":"OO LA LA!  What a romantic spot. A bottle of wine, a little candlelight, and a delicious dinner? I think I'm in love...with Osteria Papavero.  Many of the comments here recommend ordering from the specials board, but I went with the regular menu items and they were great! As I mentioned in a tip, the wild mushroom soup (Zuppa di Funghi) is outstanding. It's incredibly flavorful and the mushrooms add a really nice texture (plus, it's vegan without cheese on top). I give two thumbs up for the Antipasto Misto di Verdure, a large appetizer composed of three different tapas-like portions, each made using locally sourced vegetables. All three on my plate were phenomenal (the two I remember were delicious roasted fennel and some sort of house-made tart). I will be back for some more O.P. lovin' soon."}
{"text":"Went to Osteria Papaver last evening with some clients while in Madison at a conference. Called ahead to find out they don't take reservations, but the woman offered to put our name in and have a table ready. Which is was, when we arrived, all set up and ready for us.  The food was wonderful!!  Not a huge menu selection, but everything we ordered was excellent, and our waitress also was able to select wines by the glass for several of us based upon some basic descriptions.  I will absolutely visit this wonderfull charming restaurant again next time I'm in Madison, and  highly recommend it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Madison gems. It's a quiet and quaint restaurant with big things happening regarding food.   Go here for dinner with your girlfriends. Go here for a quiet date. Go here to glance every now and then at the attractive bartender. Whatever you go here for, just make sure you order at least one thing off the specials menu and end your evening with some lemoncello."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best Italian restaurants Iv ever been to in my life, there wine was fantastic, there cocktails were very creative and used great ingredients, and there food was ridiculously amazing, service was also great, will be back!"}
{"text":"What can I say that has not already been said?  Osteria Papavero (Pronounced Pah-PAH-vro, or someone will correct you embarrassingly when your Spanish kicks in and you call it 'Pa-pa-VEH-ro')  This place is consistently wonderful.  Classy, quaint and sweet, but not overdressed and stuffy in atmosphere.  Generally it is not too overcrowded. Though their space is small, it is cozy rather than cramped. On occasion they do become overwhelmed during peak hours, like everywhere else downtown. I believe they do not accept reservations, though once they did apparently set up a table for our larger group when we called ahead to make sure we were not being jerks by walking in with 12 people. If we had come later in the evening, yes, we would have been jerks to do that.  Service is attentive, though I often feel bad for the servers who have written down about 20 things that they have to tell you about for specials, in great detail. I love hearing the specials, but then I cringe when someone at the end of the table asks them to \"repeat that, I didn't catch what you said about the duck\" after a 12 minute long specials list. But what this means is that their menu is specials-heavy, focusing on what is fresh, seasonal and exceptional at the moment.   Food is well presented, the charcuterie boards varied and delights to behold. You could easily make a meal of shared appetizers. Of course their entrees are delicious as well. My favorite was the black truffle and sausage pasta, but everything I've sampled was superb. Except the okra. There's nothing that you can do to okra to make it good.  Except throw it in the garbage. Or don't pick it in the first place. Let the okra live!   But I digress.  Get that butterscotch pudding. I, too, was skeptical of how good something like butterscotch pudding can be.   It's insane. Get one, eat it, and order another to go. They have good to-go packaging for the pudding. Then eat the second one when you get home and put on your sweatpants. That's how pudding should be eaten, after all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem located right off the capital square in Madison.  They have by far and away the best Italian Food in Madison.  This is not your traditional Italian restaurant with huge portions and heavy sauces.  Each Meal is hand crafted to perfection.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who likes slow cooked meats, delicious pasta, and something a little different than every other Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent. I ate my first Italian sandwich here for lunch. For $10.95, you get the sandwich + soup or salad. A solid lunch deal. I ordered the pepper panino, and it was an utter delight! Portion size and taste were both there.   The space is quaint and relaxing, making it ideal for a group of people to stay a while and linger or for one to grab a solo meal (can eat at the bar). The lunch hour I was there for got pretty busy, however, and there was one waitress attending to folks. I was there in a group of seven, and I think it took 35-40 minutes for the food to come out. Don't expect a quick meal here. It is quality though.   One of the places I will return to in future Madison visits. As long as you have some time, make your way to Osteria for a fantastic lunch!"}
{"text":"Left a couple of things to be desired, but ultimately well worth the price. For about $30 / person we walked away pleased.   The lighting is a bit too dim, and it would be nice to enjoy the food visually as well as gastronomically, since the presentation is quite nice. The service was good without being obtrusive. One nice thing about menu is that it changes regularly, with about five nightly specials featuring a variety of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Sadly, they did not post a current menu on their website so I did not get to try a dish I was looking forward to. It would also be nice if they posted the specials, which might even entice people to visit more often.   We ordered two appetizers, two entrees and a dessert; of these, one entree and the dessert was off the menu, and the rest were all specials. I have been to places where the specials were not as well executed as the menu items, this is not the case here.   Appetizers:  1. Beef Carpaccio with various marinated vegetables and shaved grana cheese. The beef was sliced a little too thick for a carpaccio, resulting in it being a bit hard to chew. However, the flavor was good and went well with the veggies and cheese.  2. Concord grape salad with walnuts, grana, bacon, greens. Very tasty grapes were the highlight of this dish. It seemed strangely off, however, the bacon was good (of course) but was somewhat unnecessary. The salad would have been just as good without the bacon, and the dressing for the greens was very faint.   Entrees: 1. Tagliatelle tossed with wild Texan boar. The sauce was good and the abundance of cheese was good. The boar was dry, too lean, and had a lot of alcohol flavor.  2. Squid ink risotto with scallops, mahi, tomatoes. Best $13 ever spent, or very nearly so. The dish had a pungent aroma from the squid ink, but was not pungent in flavor. The risotto was done perfectly.   Dessert: Plum brown sugar cake with raspberry sorbet. Great cake, nice fruit compote on top with very tasty plums. Very intense raspberry sorbet, almost like pomegranate in flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable with a good vibe. Panini + soup or salad was $11.50, and the sandwich was quite large. Soup was ribollita. Service was pleasant and got in/out in an efficient manner."}
{"text":"I went last night with a group of coworkers and regretted not going sooner.  Warm, lovely, cozy. When you walk into this small restaurant, you are immediately calmed from \"the hustle and bustle\" of the street and the chill of Madison winter is long behind you. The place is nice enough to be a great spot for an occasion, but still relatively laid back.   Great service, I was honestly just amazed that our waitress could remember everything about the specials!   The food was delicious. The menu doesn't need to go over the top, everythings just cooked well and tasty. I took Corey D's advice and ordered off the specials menu, which is basically the same length as the regular menu (thanks Corey!).  Highlights: - Filetto: steak with a slab of muenster cheese on top. This sounded kind of weird but I love steak and I love cheese, and so naturally I loved my meal.  - Meat antipasti: we shared this FANTASTIC assortment of meats. Definitely not your typical charcuterie board.  - BUDINO: I would come back just for this. As others have mentioned, this is perfect. The pudding and fresh cream are so smoothe and it just has a rich, perfect taste.   I really need to go back and try some pasta!  I will end by saying that my mom raised me with an 11th commandment: thou shall not eat Italian food outside of NY, San Francisco, Chicago (maybe)...and Italy. After living in Madison for awhile, I realized I had to break this rule and have had some good and bad experiences. Osteria Papavero is the type of place that proves my mom is just a (wonderful) snob, you can find good Italian food anywhere!"}
{"text":"I know some people complain about the prices and food portions, but I found them to be reasonable.  I would consider this to be one of the few authentic Italian restaurants in Madison.  I had the pasta with the venison ragu sauce, which was filling but not heavy.  Nothing worst than feeling like you are going to explode after dinner.  The pumpkin flan was pretty good, a bit on the sweet side but good nonetheless.  I highly recommend based off the food.  I would have given 4 stars, but there was an issue with service.  The pace of the meal was perfect, and the server was friendly, but it was incredible that after ordering a diet coke, they only brought me one refill after I had to ask for it.  The server even came to the table to refill our waters, saw my empty glass and walked away.  At one point another employee who I assume was the manager as she also was walking around checking on tables, glanced at my table saw my empty glass and kept walking by.  Next time maybe I should get a bottle of wine so I can pour my own refills.  I still recommend them, as the food was great, service was friendly, even if they seem to be stingy on soft drinks.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. It's extremely cozy and has FANTASTIC food, the closest to authentic Italian food I've found in Madison. The size ensures staff is extremely attentive and they make fantastic recommendations and make for a leisurely, lovely meal. There outdoor seating is also great for a 5PM drinks and apps (you'll order a lot!)"}
{"text":"I agree with greenjjm about the amount of salt in the dish - all the dishes, including bread served in a basket, were overly salted.  However, there are some positives. * Service - I'd give 4 or 5 stars. I was in a party of 4 sitting outside for dinner. The waitress for our table was very very very nice, charming, and pleasant. Other staffs also helped setting pates on the table (the table was bit small to accommodate all plates) and  were attentive throughout the night.   * Inventive dishes - they're at least trying, and i love the creative combination of flavors and ingredients. I enjoyed the chard & broccoli mouse, roasted radiccio with bacon, and octopus inked linguini.   The pasta didn't taste too fresh (nor was it cooked al dente), and I do wish that they cut back on oil and salt so that we can taste the ingredients little better. No one wants to eat \"salt flavored\" dish. Given the fact that the best thing out of the dinner was the accompanying fig preserve on the cheese plate, I can't give more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested to my date by a coworker. We were excited to try one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. Based off the yelp reviews the thought it would be a fool proof option.   The food: we ordered, wine, an appetizer to share, and two entrees. The wine was the best part, unfortunately. The appetizer was a sea food sample platter.  The seafood sampler contained a mushy croquette, a gelatinous slice of grilled calamari lacking flavor and the only decent part was the third part of the sampler consisting of clams and other mixed seafood. My entree was a chefs special of butternut squash tortellini that was completely inedible, drenched in oils, hard and under cooked, I unfortunately had to send it back.  We also tried another special for the evening, which was the emu. While the emu was seasoned properly, it has a very tough like texture that felt a bit overcooked. All around not as bad as the tortellini and at least edible but nothing to write home about.   A highlight of the evening and only reason this review has gotten two stars instead of one, or because of the wait staff. They were pleasant.   I cannot recommend the restaurant for any occasion. Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Super cute Italian restaurant and super delicious amazing food. I've only been here twice for lunch and each time I had to order from their daily specials. For lunch, most everything is only $9.75 and the sandwiches come with soup or salad. You can tell this place is legit, pasta is only on their daily specials.   Everything I've had here has a uniqueness about it. [Begin Italian music in background] Could be how the ingredients slow dances with my taste buds, or how the presentation has me thinking what the next dish will look like. All I know is that I haven't gotten a blah meal, was always satisfied and will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurant in Madison. My husband and me both ordered a vegetarian dish. We ordered the vegetarian special of the day and a Tortalacci which was delicious and the food portions were also in apt amount. We finished off our entire meals."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. Lovely ambience. I was on a visit to Madison and chanced upon this place. The wine selection was good. The waitress was very attentive and made sure she answered all our questions. When I requested for a vegetarian pasta, they had one custom made - and it was delicious. The tortellini my friend ordered absolutely melted in our mouths. The desserts were good -- the selection is not huge, but whatever we ordered tasted great. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our group of four visited Osteria last week as a special occasion meal. The ambiance was more  Italian rustic than I had anticipated, but it was nice. Not cookie cutter decor and it struck a nice balance between not intimidating if you are dressed down, and not too casual if you want to dress up.   Service was very good, as many other Yelpers have described. There's an art to being attentive but not overbearing, and the server had that down.  She also was helpful with recommendations on food, wine and grappa.   Now, for the food. It was interesting, in a good way. First, the complimentary bread basket was very good. Bread fried in lard is apparently delicious! We went with the large salumi board for an app. It had two cheeses and maybe six or seven meats. It was generously portioned, and offered good variety. But this is for the semi-adventurous, so be aware it's not just cured salamis. There was also offal and blood sausage involved. We almost finished it all, but it was a lot.  Entrees ranged from good to great. The standout was the Cinghiale. To die for. The Granchio, Gnocchetti and trout special were all very good. I chose the norwegian trout, because it's something I've never had before, I wanted something lighter, and you don't see it everywhere. It was very good, but the potatoes chunks and mushrooms that came with it were a bit of a bore. Wish I'd have had some pasta instead because their pasta is perfection. We shared boudino and a dessert special. They were good, but I don't know that I'd do it again, particularly since we'd already had a big appetizer. I'd stick with coffee and maybe share one dessert among a foursome.  Wine list was great! And a very large grappa menu was a fun surprise. You can get a flight.  Of note, the bar area is very small, but would be nice if you are dining solo, or meeting a friend for a glass of wine and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food. For appetizers we had the Polipo (fried octopus with Yukon gold potato and Calabrian chile salad) and the Magatello (house-smoked roast beef, crumbled blue cheese, toasted  walnuts, pickled red onions).  For my entree I had the Branzino con Ratatuglia (pan roasted branzino, Ligurian-style ratatouille), and my companion had the Filetto al Pepe Verde (beef tenderloin, green peppercorn sauce, buttered spinach). For dessert we shared Tortino di Ricotta con Mirtilli (Ricotta cake, blueberry compote, lemon curd) and the Budino di Pane e Cioccolato (bittersweet chocolate and brioche pudding, whipped cream, caramel sauce, toasted pecans). Everything was delicious. The octopus, branzino and tenderloin were all perfectly cooked and delicious. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Putting in to words how much I adore Papavero is about as hard as I imagine it is for a server there to remember the countless specials they rattle off (which rotate) nightly.  But ya know what, they seem to get through it, and so will I.   The primary reason I'm at Osteria Papavero several times a month is the fact that the place is consistent beginning, middle to end. Despite the resto being obscenely busy when I've tried to snag a table, someone is able to greet me and give me an anticipated wait time within moments of walking in the door. It's that level of attentiveness that starts the experience off on the right note.   From there, it just gets better. Whether you have to sit at the bar and imbibe and snack before a table is ready, or if you're lucky enough to snag seats right away, the cocktail menu is a must before you even consider savories and wine to sip. Im pretty partial to the Bugado Bianco (Koval Levant spelt whiskey, Cinzano Bianco, Bitter Cube cherry bark vanilla bitters), crisp, clean and absolutely perfect any time of year. Their barrel aged Boulevardier is also stellar if you're looking for something a bit more spirit food.   When it comes to food, don't even open your menu until your server describes the specials in chalkboard. The level of detail they go into as they cover each is so rich, you'll want to order them as a thank you for summarizing them so well. Because I don't dig lactose, I can't say whether or not the cream based dishes or cheese filled pastas are good, but if it's on the chalkboard and if it's mostly dairy free, I've eaten it and I've loved it!   Inside the menu the Zuppa di Funghi is unreal, it puts all other mushroom soups you've eaten to shame. Wild mushrooms (I can count at least 4 varietals), tomato and wine; that's it! It's a pricey way to start your meal coming in at $9, but the grilled bread served alongside it is worth at least $10. And you know what, I've tried to recreate the dish at home and it failed miserably, so I'm ok paying a premium for something stellar that I can't repeat. Antipasto di Mare (seafood) and Antipasto Misto di Verdure (veggie) are always spot on, and about the latter, Papavero knows how to turn veggie loathers into veggie lovers. These starters typically feature a variety of four smaller bites to share with the table or devour on your own. When talk turns to entrees, there's like more that needs to be said about the wild board papardelle than ORDER IT! And if you don't crave carbs or aren't wild about wild boar (but seriously, get this) the selection of grilled meats is magic. It's certainly not for those looking for something lighter, but if you're intrigued by the offerings (which rotate) the night you're there, split that meat!   Turn the menu over if you dig dessert, there's usually about 6 different options. And while I know people go bananas for the budino, it's their honey and pine nut tart that tops a bowl of budino (which is still insanely awesome). The tart is nutty, not to sweet and the perfect size, a sliver of heaven, making me feel like I'm not indulging too much. And because it's packed with pine nuts, I've decided it's actually not dessert at all, but an after dinner savory. And while we're talking after dinner, sip (or shoot!) some Amaro, the Italian way, nay, the ONLY way to end an awesome meal. They have a plentiful collection and information about them all, so hit bartenders up for info and learn a little while you digest.   Two other quickies I want to gush about:  -Those that note the small space and feel it's not a stellar spot for groups, listen up! I was there one night when they brought tables together for 20 so it can be done! It was towards the end of dinner service, so if you're looking to dine in a large group, consider the time, and you may want to give a call and ask if there's space. While they don't take reservations they'll be able to tell you if they can accommodate your large party.  -As I mentioned earlier, lactose and I aren't friends, so I ask for the Zuppa di Funghi sans sprinkling of cheese every time I go. Well check this out, last time they were so concerned about dairy and so willing to make accommodate that they brought out some vegan bread! It was unexpected but nothing like that grilled bread :) but I was so grateful for their effort!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had our first visit here last night... Went early, 5:45, and got a great table in the window. Service was excellent, our server was very knowledgeable about the food and drinks. We started with aperitivi and the 3 cheese plate, served with a basket of assorted bread.  I had the Granchio, maybe a little fishier than I anticipated but it was still fantastic. Hubs had the Butternut Squash tortelli (the best). I had the Butterscotch pudding which lived up to the hype.    Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good! The menu is constantly changing to highlight the best in-season foods. We tried the fish, the veggie and meat dishes between four of us. I think everything we ordered was on special, was fresh, flavorful and absolutely amazing. My best recommendation is to come here, get the specials, enjoy a culinary experience! Also. The value for money is incredible; the food, drinks and service are exceptional for the price. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a very good lunch. Eggplant pizza and salad. Attended on a whim and don't regret it. Stick with specials. Coworker had the braised pork and gnocchi. Very good. Will try for dinner soon"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. My boyfriend and I came here tonight for an early Valentine's Day dinner, and it was great.   Firstly, I was very impressed with our server for her knowledge of the extensive menu and ability to recall all of the specials to us in order. Seriously, there were like 8 specials with intricate ingredients.  Secondly, the food was all very flavorful, hot, and cooked perfectly. We had two types of fish, which were buttery and delicious. The eggplant accompanying one of the dishes was amazing. We also got this spiced pork sausage which had interesting clove and nutmeg flavors.   Finally, the ambiance was nice and cozy for a date night. I was worried it might be drafty, but there's a curtain in front of the door where you can hang your coats. There was also a space heater warming them before we left, which was excellent . The tables are really unique too.   In conclusion, I'll definitely be coming back to Osteria Papavero and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"Recently visited for the first time on my birthday. Delicious. Classy. Italian."}
{"text":"Very good food, but often horrible understaffed. Will not be visiting again after waiting forever for lunch."}
{"text":"I was hovering around a 1.5 from dinner at Osteria but ultimately decided a round-up would be more fair just because the server was nice enough and it's not like there was anything TERRIBLY wrong.  But what went wrong? Let me count the ways.  1) We, a party of two, were seated at our requested table and the time from being seated until our server first showed up to offer water glasses and water took 15 minutes. Maybe there was a special event or something but there was a server in a different section who was chatting with her table for a majority of that time.   2) The appetizer special we ordered was described as kind of a meatloaf with a runny egg over it. This evoked a pretty specific image and expectation. We got... probably slightly overcooked ground meat covered in a mostly solid egg on top (i.e. It wasn't runny at all). The taste was good but it was a very small plate and not nearly as \"photogenic\" as I would have hoped.  2) The bread came out after the appetizer. There was no butter and no oil for the bread. Maybe that was the \"style\" they're going for but... they may wish to reconsider as it was a very odd choice.  3) I ordered a three meat mixed grill. It was... lackluster and lukewarm when it arrived. It was heavy on generic tomato flavor and the meats themselves were just kind of \"meh.\" Can't say it was worth the price at all. The other person with me got a ravioli... it was drowning so much in cheese it lost all flavor except for the cheese.  4) I left feeling kind of hungry. That's how small the portions were. It just... was less than ideal.  In sum, while the environment was intimate and kind of cute, the food was just okay and on the small side portion wise, and the service at the start was incredibly slow and I thought several times that we had just been forgotten. It ultimately gets a two star though because our actual server was pretty good at the end of the day, once service got started, it was good. And there was nothing egregiously wrong with this place (I guess maybe it's over priced but that's kind of how it goes). If you're a struggling student with a little bit more money to spend and want to take someone somewhere \"nice\" I could see this being a pretty cute spot."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant but it failed miserably. The price was affordable for a three-course meal but the taste and quality was mediocre at best. The seafood appetizer was not perfectly seasoned plus the seared ahi tuna was not fresh. The lamb tortellini was more pasta than meat so that was disappointing. Worst of all, the butterscotch pudding tasted like something that you buy at the store."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Madison.  You better get here early if you want to get a table. But trust me it's worth it. They are snobby and have their regulars but we've waited for a table in numerous occasions and we're always delighted.   Try something new here, try the chefs special. This is not Olive Garden this is fine Italian dining."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were absolutely delicious! We received extremely slow service (almost insultingly slow). Luckily my husband and I were fine just hanging out, but it didn't feel like our patronage was appreciated. I'd recommend for the good food, though."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  The braised short rib pasta lunch special was great.  The pizza and service was not.  The pizza tasted microwaved..."}
{"text":"I can only review in regards to lunch but it's the best lunch I've had in Madison. My boyfriend lives above this restaurant so we make it for lunch pretty regularly. I always get one of the sandwiches because I just love the bread  -the way its perfectly toasted, and how the flavors of whatever I decide on compliment each other. They always have some new things and I always end up completely satisfied. I've had the same waitress every time and she's great -very personable and attentive without being obtrusive.  Last time I was there we had desert and the chocolate cake with pears  and huckleberry ice cream was incredible. It was a very rich chocolate  so the fruit was an excellent addition. The ice cream just by itself was awesome and unexpected."}
{"text":"Best, most consistent restaurant in Madison. Do not get why it does not show up when I search. I have eaten there 20 times since it opened and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Very good food (try the mushroom stew, it's divine!), friendly/well-paced service, and a good atmosphere. The cocktails were better than average (not so much simple syrup) but not the best I've ever had. The dessert was fabulous (some sort of cheesecake-y fruit tart hybrid with peaches and raspberries), and I don't even generally like sweets.   Also, I am on crutches and they were extremely accommodating of my needs, which dramatically improved my dining experience."}
{"text":"Interestingly I do not go out for lunch often. I enjoyed my sausage panini with red peppers and mozz! Kale soup was also a go. Granted it was lunch time, I did not see many customers. Wait staff was attentive, ample wine list, interesting decor with cute tree-like tables. My only complaint is the menu for lunch is not extensive."}
{"text":"The little smoky-sweet roasted peppers stuffed with murcia sausage and grilled raisins, currently part of the vegetable antipasto, are probably the best thing I've ever eaten here, and one of the best appetizers anywhere in Madison; don't miss them.  And the fettucine with black truffle oil, part of the \"truffle three ways\" appetizer, is nearly as good.  The spiced califlower in the vegetable antipasto, though, is kind of a mess -- the cumin is applied with a heavy hand and dominates the taste of the vegetable."}
{"text":"Giving this awesome find a solid 4 stars! Wanted Italian while in the Madison area. Based on the reviews from Yelp I decided to stop in. Nestled not far from the capitol area this cozy atmosphere was adorable with stucco looking walls and unique wooden tables.   The menu was short but there were multiple daily specials and they paid attention to every, little detail. We decided to start out with a half bottle of a red blend wine, full bodied and smooth. They offered wine by the glass, half bottle and bottle - whatever you prefer! The fresh bread brought to the table was warm and there were a few different  styles to choose from. Then for my entree I ordered the Torteccini. I was so happy with my choice! The cream sauce with the Gorgonzola cheese and walnuts wrapped inside the pasta was a unique and tasty combo. It was a perfect service size, just enough to fill me up without overeating!   The dessert choices sounded fantastic but we opted out. I would definitely come back. If you are looking for authentic, fresh Italian stop into Osteria Papavero!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good Italian restaurant because I swear my obsession with Olive Oil and Bread has to come from genetics.  Luckily Papavero isn't a good restaurant, it's a great one.  Cozy from the minute my wife and I walked in on a blustery Wednesday night, they had great relaxing music playing and nice wooden tables by the window to watch the passing scenes.  Our server was very friendly and conversational, and had just the right amount of attentiveness to keep us satisfied.  We ordered some wine and the three cheese formaggi to start things off which along with the bread basket was a nice appetizer for the two of us.  The wine I had was a 2014 red vintage from Sicily which was a perfect medium taste to go along with the samplers.  For our meals we had the N'duja and the Norcina, both excellent pasta dishes in their own way.  The N'duja is a bed of pasta noodles with a smoky, spicy, elevate the senses marinara sauce, and was something I would absolutely order again in the future.  I like how it gives you a mix of flavors as you're eating it, bringing out the sausage, garlic, and pepper flavors well.  My wife's Norcina was similarly delicious, being a buttery truffle pasta with a nice creamy taste.  Both dishes looked average to small in size but were deceivingly filling.  The best part of the night was easily the fried bread.  A salty treat to be sure, but one that lingers on the tongue with that addictive set of properties that makes you ask for the second basket.  Prices are high and menu descriptions overwhelming, but that's par for the course with fine dining downtown.    It's good.  real good.  Hope it starts your next date night off as awesome as it did ours"}
{"text":"My husband has been here a few times, not on work days, and always loved it. But I ate here for the first time yesterday and had a pretty poor experience, save for the waitress doing what she could at the end to make up for things. Here follows my tale of woe.  Although this place is right off the Capital square, so you would think that folks that are working there would eat here for lunch, they don't. I had the afternoon off, and met my husband here at noon - he only had until 12:50. There was only one waitress on duty, working the bar and restaurant (including outdoor seating). Looking around, I saw that my husband was the only business person there - everyone else seemed to have the day off. And it became clear why there were no other people there for a working lunch - service was too slow with just one server. My husband ended up leaving to race back to work before we could ask for the check.   So first tip - don't go here for a lunch when you have less than a full hour. And even for a leisurely meal, it was slow. The restaurant should have had more than one waitstaff.   Some folks complain about the prices and portion sizes. I don't know about dinner, but I guess I expect smaller portions for lunch, and the higher prices don't bother me. His pasta special was a good sized portion, very nicely done, for $9. The side cup of soup was a little steep at $4.50, but also well done (sweet corn soup). But even with my sandwich removed from the bill (see below) the bill was still $19 for pasta, cup of soup, and 2 iced teas.   My sandwich was a disaster. I ordered the prosciutto/arugula/mozzarella panini. First of all, when it came it was essentially a very thin piece of bread, folded around the fillings and grilled. There was less bread than I would have guessed. And the arugula, oddly enough, was dressed with vinaigrette, something not noted on the menu and, frankly, really odd. So with the super thin bread, and the oily arugula, I could not eat the sandwich by hand. So I tried with fork and knife.  With my first bite, I got a huge glob of chewy fat. Huge. I spit it into my napkin, thinking it was just bad luck. Second bite, same thing. I then opened my sandwich and pulled out an amount of prosciutto fat that far outweighed the amount of meat present. It was really gross. See the photo I uploaded to get an idea of what I'm talking about.   The waitress did not come back to the table to ask about the food until after my husband had left and I had given up. I pointed out the enormous pile of fat on my plate, and she said she would remove the sandwich from the bill. That was very nice. When she brought back the bill, she also said she had shown the chef, who apologized, said it was a really fatty cut of prosciutto, he should have trimmed it, and it would not happen again.   Damn straight it won't happen again - at least not to me. I will never go there again. It's a shame, because the food can be great (my husband was pleased with his dish) but there is NO excuse - none -  for serving a customer this kind of gross meal. But props to the waitress for her professional handling of the situation."}
{"text":"Creative food and more authentic Italian.  Not necessarily the best ever but good.  A tad of pretention but I blame it on the patrons there."}

{"text":"Lovely little romantic spot in Madison! My class at epic ended early so i took a cab downtown, everyone kept recommending this place & I am so glad i tried it. The staff is friendly, food is impeccable. I tried a sausage pasta with burrata salad which was absolutely delicious. The ambience is very romantic (dim lighting, candlelit dinner) but I had a great dinner just by myself! I will definitely be back when I return for epic training."}
{"text":"Been here before for large receptions and lunch - dinner... Restaurant week this week - 3 course meal for $15. I was very excited to eat here again because I have had some great meals in the past.  Party of 5 - two arrived early and waited at the bar for us to arrive.  We were seated at a very small table within ten minutes.  The tables themselves are works of art - cherry tops - individually crafted by Aaron Laux Design https://www.aaronlauxdesign.com  Three of us had the craft cocktails - good but not great.  The server brought all five salads in two hands - and had to ask for help to serve them.  The tray is an extension of your hand...    For my first course I tried the INSALATA DI RISI - the rice was lackluster - the consistency was that of minute rice - with black olives and tomatoes - and a sprinkle of fresh herbs.  I just checked the menu to see what ingredients were listed and was surprised to see that listed was  Sicilian tuna.  I noticed this when I ordered but promptly forgot - there was no note of tuna in my salad.  Others tried the INSULATA PAPAVERO - which looked beautifully dressed and had a lovely portion of Wisconsin mozzarella.  When we had finished the salad, a server stopped by, holding in her left had a stack of dirty plates from another table, and proceeded to clear and stack our plates on to the pile.  Two of us ordered one of the pasta choices, spaghetti with clams.  Again lackluster seasoning - too salty - a sprinkle of fresh herbs.  The server seemed quite put out when we asked for forks, which had been cleared with our salads, and a small plate for the clam shells.  One order of the pasta with cauliflower - which looked wonderful, and one order of the calzone with spicy pork - both of which looked very delicious.  We selected two of the desserts.  I and one other had the BUDINO DI PANE E CIOCCOLATO - bittersweet chocolate and brioche pudding, whipped cream, caramel sauce, and toasted pecans.  I have to say that I am not a chocolate fan and only order chocolate occasionally.  The chocolate brioche pudding as similar to a 3\"x 3\" brownie, approximately 1/2 inch thick.  I think it was almost devoid of flavor.  I could taste the caramel, whipped cream and toasted pecans...  Three had the TORSION DI RICOTTA CON MIRTILLI - Ricotta cake, blueberry compote and lemon curd.  Both diners mentioned that the dessert was \"good\"  but the lemon curd seemed to overpower all the other flavors.  I like this place and generally like their food.  I will return to Osteria Papavero and hope for a better meal.  If the service had not irritated me I would have given the review three stars."}
{"text":"Clearly one of the best in town. Corey D. thinks so, the James Beard folks think so, my Spousal Unit thinks so... so who am I to argue? To be honest, I haven't eaten here that often but every time I have, I've been ba-lown a-way!  This night the S.U. and I came for an anniversary dinner (insert big number). We started with an antipasta di mare and an insalata d'indivia served with a half-bottle carafe of an excellent northern Italian white. Perfect combo to get us ready for the boar ragu on paparadelle and the special, a veal cutlet stuffed with Italian ham and a nice cheese I can't pronounce. Washing these two dishes down with carafe of Multipulciano (one bite, one sip, one bite, one sip, repeat, etc.) was dream-like. So rich, complex, full of dense meatiness ..... wow! We couldn't finish both dishes and yet somehow still had room to split a small desert. (Mmmm boar ragu for lunch!!!!). Let me just say that in a town where some of the best tasting dining experiences can leave you a bit annoyed by the small portions, that is not the case at OP.  I love that their house wines can be had by the glass, half or full bottle carafes. I love how their specials are so creative. Per me, è come buono come si arriva. Bravo!"}
