{"text":"This place is awesome! I drove by thinking it was still the old capos Italian restaurant. I decided to give it a try. I walked in and was greeted by a friendly staff the place was packed. I sat at the bar for a bite to eat before I knew it a few hours had past lol!!! The food was great and the cocktails even better, the owner Stephan was very cool and took great care of me."}

{"text":"This is the best place to go off the strip!!! Love the entertainment and the food. I got my pic taken with a real Brazilian dancer!! Make sure you reserve a table though.. It's better seated with a great view of the performances or DJ."}
