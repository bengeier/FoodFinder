{"text":"Never recommenced this place to any one.   -I requested them to serve fresh fried food but they served cold chicken and on enquiring they insisted that its fresh fried. Blunt lie!  -Soft drink was actually warm and on request to provide ice they refused  -Food taste crappy  -There were no napkins available (lolss ... a basic thing)  -With several better fried chicken options in Markham there is no point paying same price for tasteless food and poor service  Suggestion to Chunky Chicken: I understand its a newly launched outlet therefore a rule of thumb is to provide better quality food and nice customer service if you guys wanna remain in business in competitive market."}
{"text":"This place pretty much just popped up in my neighbourhood, no flyers no publicity so we decided to give it a try  First visit:  I ordered the spicy black bean burger combo 7.79+tax and the peri peri burger 5.79+tx  I was told I couldn't get a poutine as a side with the combo and would have to get it on its own for 4.49+tax  The burger patty was really good but there was nothing but mayo, cheese and lettuce in the burger which was pretty gross (also it's not spicy at all despite what it's called) The peri peri chicken burger was excellent!!  Second visit: I wanted to try their poutine so got a veggie burger combo with poutine upgrade (which is possible with combos despite first visit) came out to ~11    Also got a half chicken for 9.99   Made the necessary adjustments to the burger after our first visit but this time there was no cheese so you really have to be specific or ask what they put in the burger since there's no consistency   The poutine was nothing special and I was kind of disappointed just tasted like standard food truck poutine. On its own the poutine is 4.49+tax and the quantity is so small about 10 oz bowl not worth it at all   The half chicken wasn't tasty at all and all the spicy flavouring was on the outside of the chicken which was overwhelming  Also the price is a bit much for half chicken and with a combo it was $15 which for students is unreasonable since the quantity is not that much... It depends on your taste buds though and the day you go because I've heard great things about the whole chicken   The interior is really nicely done up  The service was excellent, food came quick and staff was polite but since they just opened up some discrepancies between menu info is understandable   Haven't tried the fried chicken yet but the peri peri chicken burger so far is the only thing we'd go back for since there are way better deals at Popeyes and Chicos (both halal and down the road)   I guess with some publicity and adjustments this place could work. Overall, average food, a bit too pricy, nice atmosphere and good service.. Worth a try!!"}
{"text":"One word, disgusting, food is, service is. People that works there simply doesn't care,  don't waste your time, just go to KFC or Popeye's instead"}
{"text":"A bit surprised to see so many low reviews here.   This restaurant has its flaws but overall I enjoy it enough to be a repeat customer.   The interior is usually clean and it is a place I can bring my family to for a meal.   They even had a small area set up with toys for kids.   I can't comment on all the food items but their peri peri chicken burger is a great spicy meal.   I also frequently get the chunky special pizza, which is quite unique and delicious.   I recommend those two items on their menu if you haven't tried them.   I've also tried the fried chicken and regular chicken burger and don't think either were that great, which is why I only tried each once.   One complaint I have is the wait times. I often call ahead of picking up and the set time that they tell me is usually inaccurate. If they say 10 minutes, it can take 20 minutes sometimes."}
{"text":"$5 for a small 3/4th filled box of fries. They put a small spoon of gravy with minimum cheese in it and call it a \"poutine\". Not worth it. Furthermore,  the popcorn chicken was rock hard. Only  thing alright with this place is their peri peri burger."}
{"text":"***Mediocrity at its best***  Chunky Chicken is a UK chain arriving in Toronto just in time for the PANAM games and to gain popularity with the million+ GTA muslims who stopped cooking and now solely depend on eating out as a means of entertainment and high cholesterol.   This Markham establishment serves Pizza, Fish, Grilled and Fried Chicken.  A wannabe Popeyes with a Nandos twist if you will.   Lets talk about the food. It lacks depth and uniqueness. If bloody under cooked chicken is your thing, your in luck. I cant say all of the pieces were like this but when the serving staff refuse to take accountability for this.... its really is just another desi establishment. We were told this is the marinate and the pink is the spice - DONT THINK SO. We tried returning the chicken but they had none of it. IT WONT KILL YOU TO REPLACE A FEW PIECES OF CHICKEN!@#$@#% EVER HEARD OF SALMONELLA?   I'll keep this short. After trying the pizza, fried and grilled items, next time i'll walk 20 steps across the parking lot and stick to BAMIYAN.  A host of other goodies, including brownies, cookies and ice creams are served, offering something for the whole family, just not my family.  The shop is both clean and tidy with a colorful inviting appeal.    Good luck folks!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent. Get the peri chicken and/or peri chicken with salad. The fish burger is tasty as are the onion rings. The fried chicken is not consistent, some days it is very good, other days not so good. Only problem is the service is dismally slow. You can expect to wait a half an hour or more for an average fast food order.  I don't expect to go back anymore after this. Today, our order took 45 minutes. Just pathetic really. There are so many competing places to eat and for the service to be this slow is atrocious."}
{"text":"We ordered through Uber Eats and really enjoyed our peri chicken burger and peri chicken tenders. We also got a side of fries and onion rings, both of which were great. You can tell they use good quality meat and cook it so that it stays juicy. It's also seasoned very well. Delivery was fast! Would definitely come back here to fulfill my fried chicken cravings."}
{"text":"My daughter loves chicken so decided to try this place out. The prices are veg reasonable and it's nice to see they have the fried chicken and the peri peri chicken on the menu. I had placed my order at 9:06 pm, I waited and waited then finally went up at 9:23. The lady said they are waiting for the mild chicken to be done. I finally got my order at 9:40 and it was missing the wrap. She then told me It's coming, I took what I bought chicken burger, and chicken pieces and went to feed my daughter. My wrap didn't come till long after. The food was good but nothing great, not worth waiting for all that time. I had my kids and the place was SUPER cold, they need to turn up the heat. My husband walked out feeling sick. The washroom was a mess. I don't think I ll be coming back for chicken here again."}
{"text":"Chunky Chicken - visited ; December 29th, 2017  Happened to stop in here because I did a customer food pickup for Skip the Dishes, and I've been curious about Peri Peri chicken for a while.  Service was very friendly, at least for our visit.  $0.75 for drink refills.  Cash and Debit available, uncertain on Credit Cards as of this writing.  Food : wife and I ordered the Friday Special (Chunky Special Pizza 7\" w/2 pieces of either mild or peri peri chicken) we opted for the mild chicken, since the 7\" pizza had peri peri chicken as a toppiing.  We also orderd peri peri chicken poutine.  Since this was our first time tasting peri peri chicken, wasn't sure what to expect..but wow it kicked us in the mouth spice/heat wise.  Both the peri peri poutine and the chunky special pizza gave us trouble due to the amount of heat.  We had to let the pizza cooldown some before we were able to eat it without reaching for our drink, same goes for the peri peri poutine.  As for the chicken, the meat itself was juicy and tender, however we had to peel off the batter..even tho it was really crispy...it was just too salty for our taste buds.  Other thoughts : their poutine needs some work.  Tasty as the gravy was, it wasn't hot enough temperature wise to melt the cheese curds.  Also the layering didn't seem correct for poutine.  Shold have been fries at the bottom, then the chopped peri peri chicken, then cheese curds than the gravy last to help melt the cheese curds.  However, what we received was : fries at the bottom then cheese curds, then peri peri chicken then gravy.  The gravy could barely reach the cheese curd layer, let alone the gravy wasn't hot enough to melt what it could reach..and the fries themselves were a tad on the cold side.  Repeat visits : for this resto, yes, we will be returning since there are a few items that we are still curious to taste.  Namely their fish sandwich and their veggie burger offering."}
{"text":"Ordered the manager's special, wedges, onion rings and peri peri wrap..  The manager's special is a great value!!! The chicken was tender, well flavoured and super crispy with a little kick...will definitely reorder!!!  Wedges and onion rings were okay..nothing fancy!  But the peri peri wrap was delicious and well flavoured!"}
{"text":"Dropped by to grab a late lunch and was surprised to see that there were a decent amount of customers.  It's very spacious with nice booths and ample of lighting. I ordered the peri peri chicken burger with a side of onion rings and a pepsi and i was stuffed! The burger was a decent size and the chicken was spicy and juicy. I definitely enjoyed it and would come back! It is a little on the pricey side,i paid around $9.00 but i was satisfied with the food!  *There was a fly around the cashier which i wasnt too happy about."}
{"text":"BAIT AND SWITCH  The thorncliffe location is so much more trustworthy  I ordered the \"CHUNKY CHICKEN\" peri peri sandwich. Instead I got a cold bun with 2 chicken tender pieces. What a rip off!!!  Who does that - that is not halal!"}
{"text":"OH WOW!!!  Hands down one of my favorite sandwiches EVER!!! - THE PERI PERI CHICKEN SANDWICH  What can I say- think of a wendy's crispy chicken size with Popeyes fried chicken battering and Nando's peri peri flavour! Jeeeez!!!  There is a special where they are $1 off on Wednesday and I know I will be back there once a week for this incredible sandwich!   DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH'S IN TOWN!!!!!  ALL CAPS JUST TO PROVE MY ENTHUSIASM OVER A SANDWICH!!"}
{"text":"I came today to get 2 pizzas for my kids' lunch.  I got there at 11.50am, they open at 11.30am.  I asked for two 7\" pizzas.  The server goes to ask one of the cooks, if they have any.  He says no, they only have 12\" dough and the dough maker ain't coming to work till later.  HELLO? WTH? Why can't you use the dough you do have and serve customers that are in the store?  You could have even split one dough to make me the 2 pizzas.  Such a shame because I like their UK style pizzas but the place is run by a bunch of muppets."}
{"text":"Came here at 7:30 PM during dinner time and surprised the place was empty! Not a good sign. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a kid's meal. I wanted to get 1 leg mild and was immediately told they don't have mild and didn't really give me an option to wait. They are simply out. So I thought I'd get the popcorn chicken and fries.  Popcorn chicken - very LITTLE batter and it is NOT CRUNCHY at all. Instead the popcorn chicken was rather soft and chewy. What an irony! Please do yourself a favor and don't order popcorn chicken. Strike 1.  Fries - lacking flavor. Strike 2.  My BF got a 2 pc chicken spicy. Which is NOT SPICY at all. I would label it mild. Didn't taste any spice at all. I can't believe they call that spicy. What a disappointment. Strike 3. They're out!!  The price does not match the quality of the food they make.   What's funny is that the family who ordered after us wanted fries (which should always be available) but they were out! Again the cashier didn't give the option of waiting but told them they were just sold out. And it was only 7:30! They are open til 10!   Really the only positive thing about this place is the cleanliness. Everything else is not worth going back for. Not coming back. There's waaayy too many other better places out there. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This place is a ripoff. The prices are way too big for low-quality food. I'd rather eat Nandos or even Popeyes than this. The Peri-Peri chicken wrap was cold and bland and it was overpriced. This establishment can get better if they can improve the quality and make the prices more reasonable. I've seen similar restaurants with decent food quality and prices than this. One positive I can point out is that the seating is amazing. I cannot believe a Sheesha Bar was removed to build this!"}
{"text":"What exactly is chunky chicken? Another fried chicken chain that tries to be unique but kind of fails to deliver.   I had the their food as takeout and was told by a friend that the only decent thing on their menu was the peri peri chicken burger so that's what we got. It's essentially a spicy version of a McDonald's McChicken and was decent. Like there's the mayo, lettuce, and their spicy sauce. There's a lot of kick in there which is good but it's definitely going to be too spicy for the average person. The texture was pretty decent as well and their onion rings were standard.  The interior looks nice and clean and I was suprised by that. It looks like a proper fast food chain (and it is one), and there's proper packaging and boxes for their foods which I didn't expect.  There's probably better options in the area if you want food similar to what they have here at Chunky Chicken as I would choose KFC and Popeyes over what they serve here. I appreciate chunky chicken for being trying to be different but you have get fried chicken right at a fried chicken place."}
{"text":"\"Chunky\" Chicken? Oh the irony!  FOOD: The chicken was anything but Chunky! i ordered a quarter chicken peri peri, and i felt bad for the chicken and it probably felt bad for my stomach. The leg piece looked like it came out of a chick and not a fully grown chicken. I had to get another quarter leg to quench my appetite. The taste, well it is spicy but i wouldn't call it tasty. Coz like, you can make better chicken legs in a toaster oven with your own spices.  Environment: They have clearly spent a lot of money on it, but it looks rather cheaply designed or rather off taste as somebody else pointed out. The colour combination, the high ceiling, the unused space, bright white lights, doesn't make for a place that is comfortable for eating.  If you want to get authentic peri peri, just go to nandos or  Los Chicos.  Sorry Chunky Chicken, i really wanted to like you."}
{"text":"Ordered the peri peri chicken. Not terrible but they somehow made the dark meat taste as tough as the white. Peri peri sauce was spicy for those who can't handle spice. Beware that the \"opening specials\" flashing on 1/4 of their menu is actually not valid (was not given a warning though they compensated with a free drink)."}
{"text":"Arrived just before 8pm - I was headed to bamiyan and saw the bright sign and thought I'd try it out. Got three pieces of mild fried chicken with wedges since that was what they had and I didn't want to wait for spicy ones.  Despite the appearance of possible seasoning on the wedges, I would assure you that there is none. Ugh. Ok, deep fried potatoe. Fair enough. The chicken got worse - there wasn't any seasoning on the chicken. It seemed that they dredged it through a flour and cornstarch mix and that is it - no salt or pepper or anything else. Also, the chicken lacked any texture. It's like it was overly tenderized for far too long. I can't think of any redeeming qualities aside from the fact it was crispy despite being under the heat lamp.  It's a clean enough spot, and I didn't have any issues with the service. But the food.. I should have went to bamiyan (or however it is spelled..)"}
{"text":"This place doesn't try to go all out, they chose a few staples for breaded fried chicken, revamped the interior of the failed business (Hero Burger) that preceded it and made it unique to a brand they can pretty much call their own.   The place has a seating area for about 20 people, it's super clean (having just recently opened) and they always have a line up, so they're definitely doing something right. Food wise it looks like they're trying to be the halal equivalent to a KFC with pricing being on par for similar meals and side dishes. All in all I like this place and I hope they do well."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a couple of times and it has been a great experience. However there was one time I ordered dine in and asked for spicy chicken and it was dried and not juicy at all. I couldn't asked for a redo but I think the chicken was left out. I have ordered many times for delivery and take out and it was left with great food. The poutine is WONDERFUL and spicy. I will try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to try this place and give it a 5 stars but I don't think I will be able to do that.   The service was good and the atmosphere and interior was great. I had the Peri-Peri poutine. I was hoping for something that was flavorful and for some reason I thought it would be chunks of crispy chicken but it was the chicken breast. It tasted kind of earthy and it was actually a kind of mildly warm in contrast to the hot fries and gravy. I guess it's pieces of chicken they have in the freezer and they warm it up separately and then throw it in the poutine.   In addition the chunks of cheese did not melt as it would with Harvey's poutine.  Actually while eating this poutine I wanted to head over to Harvey's next door but I didn't at the risk of being a complete fatty...  Update:  I also have the chicken tenders and it tasted bad. I think it's the way they season their meat. Not a very good seasoning combination. I wouldn't recommend it.  To be honest Popeyes is the Bar for a fried chicken shop these days."}
{"text":"Not your typical fried chicken place. And I really mean not typical. Because it's below typical.  The chicken was small, not so crunchy, and tasted strange.  If you haven't noticed already, if you compare the price for the Friday 2 pc deal and the regular price for 2 pc chicken.. it isn't a deal. The price is the same lol.  Haven't tried their nuggets or popcorn chicken, but so far the chicken disappointed too much for us to say let's go back and try their other stuff."}
{"text":"The best halal chicken burgers ever! I got the peri peri chicken burger and it was delicious. The fried chicken buckets are average, nothing special. I would definitely order the burgers here over anything."}
{"text":"Here is a no frills review: 1. They make a juicy veggie burger 2. 5 stars for cleanliness 3. Slow service. Took about 15 minutes  4. Spicy is a bit too spicy! This unfortunately lead me to feeling the ring of fire."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but people need to save their tastebuds and monies from this place! I'd give less stars if I could.  Went here for the first time because it's pretty close where we live and this plaza is jam packed with lots of other food places that we're pretty tired of, so we decided to try the chicken here.  We got the 9pc with large coleslaw and the jalapeño cheese sauce as takeout.   Pros:  Halal  Close to us Seemingly new, bright looking restaurant   Cons:  Service- not only did the girl at the counter mess up the order, she forgot our sauces we paid extra for (which are a total fail, the taste is meh and the consistency of the sauces is weird too, I'd recommend not paying the extra 50c for them). We also ordered the large coleslaw but she forgot to pack it and had to go back to get it despite the receipt stating the full order. Maybe she's new but she wasn't really enthused at us telling her she forgot our coleslaw. I mean, own it, at least.  Horrible fried chicken. Ugh we got the 9pc and no one in my family finished theirs, its overly greasy, no real flavour and tasted stale. We went on a Saturday night so maybe the chicken is not fresh on Saturdays? Maybe it's meant to taste like oily, stiff cardboard? I'm sure if it could speak it would tell us its secrets....  The sauces. So badddd. Wished we didn't go back for them haha.   We're so not impressed and will never be going back. Sorry #notsorry"}
