{"text":"We ordered the original dagu rice noodle, it was a little bit pricey for the portion. Waited around 30 mins to get the noodle during not busy time, which was too long.  Ordered the Watermelon juice and it was very good, refreshing and not over sweet at all.   Will be back to try more flavors."}
{"text":"Tried out this new noodle place that is next to Chatime located in the corner. It's a small place but turnover is fast.  Overall, there's not a lot of variety as the menu has limited selection. One thing that really stands out here is their superb service.   Food:  Ordered the beef bone in brisket noodle and tomoto beef rice noodle. Both dishes were served pretty quickly and came  out very hot which is appreciated. The beef bone in brisket was good with flavourful broth but portion was small. If you're a meat fan, there's not much. They provide gloves to eat the beef bone. The tomoto beef noodle is served very nice with all the condiments/ingredients on a tray so you can clearly see what you're eating. It's a good spread of ingredients. The broth is served separately and you can add noodles and ingredients at your own pace. Broth is flavourful and good texture for noodles but still small portion.   Service: Superb, they come by to ask periodically to make sure we were okay. They also patiently explained the menu and individual ingredients on the tray."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends on a sat night post 8:30. It was PACKED!! We waited at the door for about +15 min as the inside of the store was relatively small. Thank god it was a mild weather night. Narrow aisles for the waiters/ waitress to walk through and serve the bowls with boiling soup. Salute to them. Taste was alright...Nothing remarkable about the tomato beef I got. The soup based is more on the sweet side. No hint of tomatoes. Presentation is fun tho...the multiple mini dishes created some stress on the already limited table top space. Luckily they cleared them out relatively fast after used."}
{"text":"The food is great here! The menu is simple which is perfect for an indecisive person like me. I love coming here for a quick and yummy meal. The soup is delicious and full of flavour. One negative would be that the servers look pretty careless with the hot soups and I'm always scared that they might spill!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the same plaza as Chatime, near T & T, it's a small modern restaurant so either go there early if you have a big party or else you may be waiting in line. The customer service is pretty good and the flavours of the soup is flavorful without being too salty. Also, you can request for 1 more bowl of noodles for free.  I've tried the Kimchi flavour and the spicy soup, which is not spicy as expected. I definately recommend coming here."}
{"text":"After a pleasant experience at Oriental Rice Noodle, I wanted to broaden my horizons and give another noodle house a try. Dagu, can simply not compare to their heaviest competitor.   First off, came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was extremely busy. Had a party of 6 and waited about half an hour for a seat. Ehh, didn't mind that much since I was really craving a big bowl of hot noodles!   When I got my seat, I saw that their menu had much more variety than most noodle houses. They offered several different soup bases with different toppings, and also had the unlimited noodle deal. Quite honestly, the menu was confusing to me because I wasn't clear on which bowls gave out the plate of mini toppings, which was what I wanted. Ended up ordering the pork bone noodle soup, where the little toppings were found inside instead of the normal \"add it yourself\" service. They didn't list out the small toppings inside the soup so I was basically fishing for mysterious items. So I guess if you're into surprises, this is for you! But if you don't want to find a random little egg in the bottom of your soup, maybe ask in advance for the ones where you can add the toppings to. The pork bone was enormous and very dry. Soup was very savoury but left my tongue feeling extremely chu afterwards. Service was slow and inattentive.   Oriental Rice Noodle is located just a 5 minute walk from this place, and their service and food is much more satisfying. I would suggest going there before this place."}
{"text":"I loved the flavor of the broth from this place. It was really good and made the ingredients taste good as well. I got the crossing the bridge while my friend got the original pork bone broth. Hers was probably saltier and mine was more milky.  Caution the bowl is super super hot! And they only take debit or cash.  They're also very slow but I'm normally not in a rush so it's fine with me.  I would come back. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the House Specialty C1 yesterday. I liked the broth. The pork bones though were too much work to eat because they weren't boiled for long enough, however the flavour in the meat was still apparent and also tasty. The noodles were good, nice and soft. Vegetables and other meat toppings were on the scarce side. We weren't aware rice noodles are refillable for free, service didn't really care to inform us. They weren't rude or mean though, just nonchalant.  I don't think I'll really crave this place against other options after trying it out but it's not bad. Kinda sits at okay for me. You could still check it out, if you're looking for something new."}
{"text":"Firstly, they only have one type of noodles... rice noodles is yummy but other noodle places that provide unlimited noodles will let you mix and match your carbs; for example, at Orientation noodle house, I would order rice noodles then switch to ramen noodles.  Secondly, this place is very cheap with ordering more noodles; you can't order a new bowl until you finish all your noodles. Also, we wanted to order another bowl but because we had already asked for our bill the waitress refused to give it to him."}
{"text":"The concept of this noodle place is quite unique as they serve everything in a soup noodle separately. You get to choose what you want to put in from the tray that it comes with. The noodles are served on the side and it is unlimited refill. A bowl cost about $9.99 to $11.99 depending on your choice of soup.   I enjoyed this place because it was pretty yummy, filling, fast and convenient. Price was reasonable for what it is. It took half an hour to finish my meal as they served quickly as soon as you order. There's no wait time on seating on a weekday but on a weekend, it will be a 40 minutes wait. To get a seat, you will have to personally write your name on the waiting list yourself. It is first come first serve; they don't accept reservation."}
{"text":"Dagu is a chain from China that specializes in soup noodles that you add into a bowl of boiling hot broth. We came as a group of 3 on a Sunday around noon and was seated within 15 minutes. The decor and furniture is essentially the same as the previous restaurants that it's replaced.  Food 3/5 We ordered the signature rice noodle with braised bone in pork, tomato flavoured noodles with beef slices and the braised bone in beef. In addition to the pre-set items, we also got extra beef and lamb which were already added in the soup so we can't speak on the value since we don't know the portions given. All the noodles come with toppings such as ham, corn, tree ear, etc. but interestingly came on a side tray for the tomato broth. The noodles come out al dente and are hot so you know that they are freshly cooked. It's nice that the noodles are al dente so that they don't overcook in the boiling soup or get too soft mid-meal. The signature broth is apparently made with the finest pork bones with collagen in it for additional health benefits. That being said, I thought the meat would be fall off the bone, but was actually a little tough. To be honest the soups weren't anything amazing, and similar to another reviewer the tomato tasted a bit like Campbells canned soup with diced tomatoes in it.  Service 4/5 Unlike typical Chinese-run restaurants, the service was quite good. The servers were attentive, quick to respond and were really nice. One example that stood out in particular was the server noticed me finish the water jug and changed it without even being asked. They speak decent English so you know you won't be shafted service wise for not speaking the language.  At the end of the day noodles are a comfort food and will never be a bad choice. I would definitely come back again but it wouldn't be a go-to place."}
{"text":"Dagu was ok, not too oustanding but also not bad.  There's too many of these type of noodle restaurants now and the market has become saturated. I prefer the toppings and soup base from a similar restaurant at T&T plaza."}
{"text":"A new noodle place around Markham. They will soon open another one at Bay and Dundas. Heard Dagu was a famous noodle place in China; so we'll give it a try.   Arrived around 6:30pm and it was 70% fulled. Mainly young couples ranging mid 20s- mid 30s I assume. It is a good place for a quick dinner on a cold night. The interior design is very modern and clean.  Their soup is famous for collagen due to the large amount of pork bone they use to make the broth. I ordered sour and spicy noodle & my bf ordered the famous beef bone noodle soup. Mine came with side ingredients which I had to add in myself. His was already added into the stone bowl and he just added the rice noodle. His noodle came with two large beef bone with beef meat on it. (I didn't taste it) but he said the meat was tender enough to fall off the bone yet it was chewy and has a texture to it. I guess it sort of feels like beef brisket and it won't melt in your mouth maybe? LOL  My side ingredients was alright. I believe they can do a better selections. They had corn, ham, 1 cube of fish tofu, pur√©e picked vegetable, one intimation crab stick, minced pork, cooked quail egg, bamboo shoots, fried vegetable that tasted like peppers and black fungus strips.   Noodle texture wasn't as chewy as I thought, but I still wouldn't mind it. However because I had left overs, the next day when I had it... the noodles soaked up the soup became soggy and thick.   Soup/ pork bone broth can be way hotter (temperature). As soon as I put in the lettuce and semi-frozen beef, the soup wasn't sizzling hot anymore :(  The flavor was alright. It wasn't bad but I have had better.   Overall, maybe it is what we ordered but I only think it's A-okay.   PS: they have a side dish of nuts for free. PPS: After we left, I found out if you post a picture on social media they will give you their pumpkin pancake dessert or something. (bummer!)"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm another noodle place to try :) great comfort food or just on days where you don't know what you want to eat (i.e. no specific cravings lol).  Came here to try this new place out because we saw some cool enticing pictures. I like how the soup and noodles come separately as well as the toppings. I think it really depends on which one you order because my friend ordered the one with braised bone-in pork soup while I ordered the Crossing the Bridge Kimchi soup with extra beef slices and only I got the toppings on the tray. My friend got most of his in the soup but was missing the pickled veggies and a couple others. So BEWARE! If you are coming here just for the tray of stuff (because we all like to post and share interesting foodie pics on instagram), I think choosing the Crossing the Bridge noodles will get you just that lol! Just saying!  Moving on, the noodles were pretty all right. Came out warm along with the bubbling hot soup which was perfect. Everything tasted pretty good.  We came just before the busy dinner time so we were seated immediately. Soon after we came, the 7pm/8pm prime-time dinner go-ers arrived and the place got super busy (lucky us!). So note to others, if you ever wanna try a good place, go earlier to avoid line ups or busy times if you aren't about the crowds. Or you can test your luck and see what you get ;) that being said, service was the usual but the people there were polite.  If I was in the area again and wanted some noodles, this place wouldn't be a bad spot."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 4.5 stars. The quality of the soup very good, super flavourful and tasty. A wide variety of soup base flavours to choose from and it's served quite fast considering how busy it is.  I ordered the tomato beef rice noodle, and my boyfriend got the mushroom soup base. Both were delicious. Would give it a five stars if they didn't forget to make my drink."}
{"text":"I waited for over an hour when I was here with my family. It was hard for the staff to find a table for 5 because they didn't have a system in place to accommodate groups larger than the usual 2s and 4s. They kept giving tables away for smaller groups that showed up after us.They finally granted us a table when we complained that it had been over an hour and my grandma in her 90s could not wait and stand any longer. So definitely an advantage if you come here in smaller groups of 2s.  I was a little confused with their menu items of the Bridge Noodles and their Set Noodles. Then after the staff explained to us (who only spoke Mandarin by the way), we realized that the only difference between the two was that you get to dip the ingredients in the broth yourself in the Bridge Noodles and the Set noodles came with everything already inside the broth for you. You could say that that was gimmicky and made for a nicer presentation. But at the end of the day, it was just still a bowl of noodles. Their signature pork broth was flavourful and hearty. It wasn't too salty or tasted like MSG which was good. Their pork bones were huge but there were no meat on them, unlike Korean Kam Ja Tang. The ingredients for the Bridge Noodles were also skimpy.  Good thing was, they offer unlimited refill for noodles. We didn't order any refill as the portion was enough for us at lunch.   If I didn't have to wait in line, I'd probably go back. Otherwise I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"The food here wasn't very tasteful. Since it was free noodle refills, I managed to get full but didn't quite feel satisfied. I got the signature noodles with braised bone-in pork. It was very difficult to take the meat off the bone. On the bright side, it was extremely hot which was nice for a cold day."}
{"text":"Very bad service to start with. Came with group on 5 people and when we sit down it is a 4people table and telling us could not add the chair. Asked us to squeezed in because their largest table is for 4people. And the attitude was very bad."}
{"text":"Came around 5:30pm and got seated right away, a huge line formed shortly after that.  Ordered the \"crossing bridge\" noddle set with beef, found the meat portion a bit lacking as you get 3 thinly slices of beef (think of the hotpot meat), as well as the $2.99 add-ons (3 stuffed meat balls).  Otherwise it was a tasty meal I rather enjoyed and was comfortably full afterwards."}
{"text":"Not sure what people like about this place I just find it was not good at all. So try the pork bone rice noodle soup but I can't even bite on the pork bone meat cause is still hard. The soup flavor was ok. The other noodles we order is the traditional bridge rice noodles. Basically they give u a little of everything frozen stuff and u put it in the bowl of the hot soup. The quail egg has a smell that going bad. Basically u r having hot pot but don't get what to choose. Not worth the time and money."}
{"text":"I came with a friend for a quick after work bite. It's super close to my office, so this is going to be a bit of a problem for me.  I had the Sour & Spicy Flavoured Rice Noodle Soup with XiangXi Pulled Beef. The soup was perfect. It was EXACTLY what I wanted. It was quite sour, without be too sour, and nicely spicy, but not so much that it overpowered everything else. The soup comes in boiling hot bowls with the noodles on the side, so that you can put them in yourself, perfect for slow eaters who hate mushy noodles (not me, I'll burn the roof of my mouth every single damn time). Mine came without the instagram-worthy side dish plates, but had nearly all that stuff in the soup, anyway. The amount was just right... very filling, but still at a reasonable enough amount that I could finish it without feeling too full.   The food comes out pretty quickly and service is very efficient. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to drop by here late night to check it out after reading the hype about it all over BlogTO. Situated right beside a busy Chatime, Dagu Rice Noodle has a brightly lit sign sure to grab anyone's attention. As soon as I walked in, we were greeted and sat down by more-than-pleasant servers. If there's one thing I gotta say, the service here was absolutely outstanding. We even got complimentary roasted peanuts along with a childhood story by the waiter! On to the food though, I ordered the spicy flavoured Crossing the bridge noodle soup while my friend got the Rice noodle soup with braised bone-in beef. Mine was a DIY sort of deal where all my meat and noodles and toppings came seperately and I had to throw it into the piping hot broth. I three everything in because I wanted to get the full taste and I gotta say, that broth had a good kick to it! Very flavorful while keeping a good amount of spice, all the different ingredients blended well in the soup. The only downside is my broth got a bit too peppery/sour at the end but I think that came from one of the toppings I threw in. (Gotta remember not to put that next time). My friends soup I actually liked better than mine. There were two huge beef bones thrown into the soup and the soup already had all the ingredients in it already when it arrived. The bones definetely gave the broth  a further dimension of flavor and it tastes amazing all the way through. I added a bit of chili oil to spice it up, but the braised beef on the bone was so tender it fell off the bone. They do give you gloves to pick up the bone and bite into it but the meat was so tender this wasn't even necessary! Quantity was a good amount and we were both stuffed after we were done ( BONUS: they give unlimited noodles for your broth if you like).  Overall, a great experience and would definetely come back to try the other noodles out! Customer service gets a 5/5!"}
{"text":"We were first given the tray of toppings for my bowl of cross bridge noodles and also two bowls of rice noodles that were already cooked.  When my bowl of hot soup arrived, I poured in all of the ingredients on my tray starting with the meats into the bowl followed by the bowl of pre-cooked rice noodles.  \"Crossing the Bridge Noodles\" have this specialty where all of the ingredients are then cooked together with the rice noodles in the hot soup.  I've had it before many times.  Mine was the Signature Rice Noodle Soup with Braised Bone-in Pork.  I liked my soup base since it was so light in flavour but still very fragrant and tasty.  The braised bone-in pork was meaty.  What I liked most were their rice noodles.  It was firm enough for my taste and had a slight bounce in it.  Now I understand why they are a popular franchise in China.  The Sour & Spicy Flavoured Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle Soup with Beef Slices came already stocked with the ingredients in it so only the bowl of pre-cooked rice noodles had to be added in.  This soup base was indeed a bit sour and spicy; true to its name.  It wasn't very, very spicy though so don't worry if you don't have a big tolerance for spice.  This restaurant was very packed at the mid-point of our meal.  There were so many people coming in for lunch on a weekday that a line started to form and there were a good number of people standing outside.  Wow!  That was really impressive.  I haven't seen many restaurants in Toronto have a line-up for lunch."}
{"text":"I usually come here before 6pm for an early dinner, and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get a table (you may have to share a table with other patrons though).The toppings that come with the noodles are pretty much the same as what they serve in other crossing the bridge noodle restaurants. (I never get why they give you a spoonful of corn, you will never see them again as soon as you dump them in the soup) The kimchi soup base is my personal favourite. I've never seen it in other places. There's a lot of kimchi in there, and they also put dried small shrimps to make the soup base very flavourful and aromatic. In terms of the noodles refills, I would suggest that you write on the order sheet how many noodles you want with your order so your soup won't get cold while you wait for your refill. The only suggestion for improvement for this place is to train their servers to be a little more attentive."}
{"text":"Overhyped and overpriced...  Service was pretty bad too. There were a bunch of people standing at the entrance waiting to be seated with no greeting from the waiters. I get that they're busy but they could've acknowledged people waiting to be seated.   The food was alright, soup was really salty and the pork bones were tough...there wasn't much substance to the soup and I feel it was not worth the price. Also I could barely hear the girl when she put down our food - wasn't sure which was for who.   Overall I had a poor experience here, I keep seeing them being advertised everywhere and honestly, it really wasn't that great. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to this place on its opening time at 11:30. and i have to say 2 things, this rating reflects that the service is 5 star quality,. however the food is 1-2 star quality, hence the 2 star. we ordered their signature noodle, a beef jerky appetizer, crispy chicken, and a brown sugar sticky rice. 40 minutes later. we have the noodle which was okay and average, the extremely tiny beef jerky appetizer for 6.99 as shown in my picture, which has a taste of prepacked beef jerky. and we couldn't' wait any longer for a crispy chicken and brown sugar sticky rice that just couldn't arrive. the servers did apologize profusely and repeatedly hence the service 5 star. however we still never got the food, and by that time we pretty much just gave up and left. i have to say this chain restaurant from china which is relatively popular has not really caught up to the hype. and also we tried to order one of the rice meals, however we were informed none of them are ready to be ordered yet. so basically just disappointment all around unfortunately. i can't really recommend this place to anyone as our experience was not exceptional. outside of the servers actually being nice and caring, we can't give it a high rating cause most of the food could not even arrive, and the ones that did arrive was underwhelming"}
{"text":"Summary: Chinese chain offers soup noodles with a great soup base and decent portion sizes although not a ton of variety (small menu); appetizers are unique but somewhat underwhelming; great effort in service.  Nestled in the corner next to Chatime, Dagu offers a showing of traditional Chinese style rice noodles (kind of like spaghetti; NOT the rice noodle rolls in dim sum places).  It's not a big restaurant so it's more ideal for groups of 1-4. About half the seats were filled on a Tuesday afternoon, but I imagine it would get busier as it gets colder.  We ordered a couple of bowls of noodles and two appetisers. The different options all have fancy names akin to crossing a bridge and such, but we'll say we got the tomato/beef slice and the big beef bone in brisket.  We were given a complimentary plate of nuts and the noodles came out less than ten minutes after we ordered and they were BOILING hot!   What stood out about this was the broth. It was packed with flavour. The beef bone-in brisket came with everything already in. The tomato beef slices came with the soup ingredients on the side including rare beef slices. It had corn, imitation crab meat, fish cakes, and more (see picture). Both soup bases had ground beef in them.   You pour the noodles in separately.  The beef bone in was solid size and they give you gloves to caveman style it! Pretty good but I would have been happier with more meat.  Service was good and unusually keen for a soup noodle restaurant: at least three staff asked us how we were doing or if everything was okay. They spoke to us in Mandarin until we asked for English though.  Appetizers were interesting. Popcorn chicken has a wasabi flavour to it but we didn't see any actual wasabi. The brown sugar sticky rice was unique? They didn't have lamb skewers."}
{"text":"I'm never really sure how to assess rice noodle places fairly because... well, it's a really ad hoc experience. I mean, if it's bad, it probs means that your kitchen is ratchet.   Okay so... rice noodle soup was fairly hot, so that was good. I got tomato base, which was amazing. Mega salty but I could down that thing and not have regrets later.   Toppings were very minimal. Like.. you couldn't give me 2 pieces of ham??? Honestly, I was only full because of the massive amount of rice noodles in there. There weren't enough toppings to make it flavourful enough. It was basically 80% tomato soup, 15% rice noodles and most toppings lost their flavour in the soup by the time you find them all.  Tip: put corn in the spoon, dunk it in the soup, then eat it. Any other way and that would mean you lose the corn forever.   I'd come back if I was dying of starvation but I wouldn't actively seek it out."}
{"text":"Just had their tomato meat soup noodle n it was a little sour for me but it was really good. I wish they gave a little more veggies thou..."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here because I love soup and noodles, and this restaurant offers unlimited noodles! I must say that I have a preference for egg or flour noodles and that I'm not a real fan of rice noodles.   I ordered the Tomato soup with shrimp (add-on). Not sure how to call it, but the condiments/side dishes came pretty fast, including 1 quail egg, 2 frozen beef slices, half crab stick, bamboo shoots, 1 tofu cut in half, corns, 1 slice of ham, black fungus, lettuce, and 3 other stuff. The broth came in boiling hot, and it is recommended to add all side dishes to give them time to get cooked before adding the noodles. The noodles portion is good enough for 1 person with medium appetite. They also give enough broth for a 2nd order of rice noodle.  The rice noodles were of a good firmness, could be slurped very easily. The broth was also tasty.  However, I personally prefer a richer broth (similar to ramen soup), or if I could choose, i'd have egg/flour noodles in this tomato soup and I would have enjoyed it more. This is just a personal preference.  Food: 3/5 Service: 3.5/5 Price: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at around 1pm on a weekend and there was a huge line up, waited for about 30-40 minutes for a table for 3. I think it is owned by the same people as spicy mafia as the manager looked the same.   Crossing the Bridge noodles are fun because you get the whole tray of items to dump into the soup. It looks pretty but the ingredients themselves were pretty mediocre, like 1 fish tofu cube felt a bit sad but there is a food variety including corn, pickled veggies, quail egg etc.    The soup comes bubbling hot perfect for winter, when you dump all the items in the oil in the soup gets a bit splattery. But their portion is huge! No extra noodles needed for me at all, I was so full after. The soup was good and flavorful, slightly oily but still delicious and savory.   It wasn't too expensive about $10 for a bowl of noodles which is ok. I would go back if I was in the area and wanted some noodles but not on the top of my mind."}
{"text":"Just like all the other \"crossing-bridge\" noodle soup places, the mains are: noodles and soup in a huge hotstone pot. Dagu is a fairly big chain in China, and by far, this is the best crossing bridge noodle soup I've had. No one pays me to write this stuff so I will be very honest, Dagu's soupbase is quite flavourful and what's most important; I don't get thirsty after!  Their side dishes are quite good too, and I order the Beef Shank & Tongue in chili oil every single time and it never disappoints me.  Yes there will always be a hype when a new business is opened in the area so there will always be lineups,is it worth the lineup? Well Yes, and the lineup is only 10-20 minutes wait (at least when I went during lunch time mid week and dinner on a weekend). But there isn't a lot of space for you to stand at the door so you might be stuck in between the glass doors with 4 or 5 other people that are waiting like you.  Perfect place for cold weather and make sure you park underground during your visit!"}
{"text":"*violently shakes head right and left*   Yeah. I didn't really like this place. The service was pretty good (tbh this makes up the entirety of the one star rating lol.) The food or at least what I had was not good at all.  I got the \"Spicy Flavoured Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodle Soup\". It was so god damn salty. It's just straight up salt. Apparently it is a level 2 spicy (or it had two red peppers next to the name), but ya girl wasn't even chugging water because it was spicy. LEVEL 2 SPICY MORE LIKE LEVEL 100 SALTY. I swear my tongue was cover in salt particles. Other than the saltiness, it tastes quite...bitter too. I think it's the pepper so whatever but yeah. The salt part was just ridiculous. It's funny because there was this woman next to me that had the same thing and I was like bruh, if you can't handle the spiciness DONT ORDER IT (she was drinking a lot of water and coughing quite a lot too). OH BOY I NEED A SLAP TO THE FACE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU MAN. I AM SORRY I HAVE WRONGED YOU LIKE SO. NEVER AGAIN. I honestly wanna hug her for finishing it because I really tried my best to, but I really couldn't. I legit tried to put the rice noodles and the other ingredients out of their salty misery by taking them out of the soup and drowning them in water but it was STILL SO SALTY.   SALT FOR DAYS SALT SALT SALT   Pro: If you share a photo of your food or something on social media, you get free red bean filled pumpkin pancakes! They were pretty good (and hella hot; my tongue be a medium rare)  **excuse my grammar in this; it's horrid"}
{"text":"Personally this is just alright..I am so glad that we did not have to wait too long for this! Not sure what the hype is with these rice noodle pots...  Let's get right into my lunch experience! We came for a late lunch on a weekday and there were maybe 2 or 3 tables ahead of us which was maybe a 15 minute wait. We put in our orders quickly as we chose mainly what other people ordered. We got the classic pork bone soup (not Korean style but more like Chinese pork bone soup) and the tomato soup base which came with slices of raw beef and other condiments you could add in.  Both soups are flavourful and since they come sizzling/boiling to the table, I guess that is what makes it unique and interesting. Once you get the soup, you put in the either the remaining ingredients or the rice noodles. It was just the beef dish where you would put in all the items like hot pot. These noodles pots are definitely great for a cold day.  Both broths are tasty and each pot is a good individual portion. IMO the amount of noodles that you get at first is just right so I am not sure why you need refills or so many refills of noodles. However I see so many people ordering more so it must be their thing!  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the food and service was quick and we were both satisfied with our lunch. I just don't understand the hype and these rice noodles have been around for quite some time. I will come back occasionally but definitely not if there's a line up."}
{"text":"A bowl of hot soup is just perfect when I've got some congestion and sinus going on. I ordered the mushroom soup base and the flavour was delicious and deep. The only downside is that I am not a fan of the sides that were offered and I found that even with the hot soup, I didn't find the fish cake or the crab meat hot enough for me but this is a personal preference. Regardless, for the cost and the amount of food, it was a good deal.  The servers were pretty attentive to our needs (probably because we sat near the back and there's a Chinese saying that goes \"those close to the kitchen get to eat\") and so we got refills for our noodles as well water fairly quickly.  This place is pretty packed with quite a few people waiting even when my friends and I left around 8pm. So if you're waiting in line for this restaurant and you're reading this review... it's well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant featured on social media platforms as a Shanghainese soup noodle place with unlimited free noodle refills, so we naturally had to try!  We ordered the pork bone soup (not to be confused with korean gamjatang pork bone soup) and their tomato soup. Their pork bone broth was excellent - not too salty yet very flavourful. Their tomato soup was a bit sour and gave us our fix as we're in a \"tomato flavour everything\" phase.  Depending on what you order, you get a tray of ingredients that are separately plated for you to add to your soup broth yourself. It's really gimmicky... but it's one of the best damn gimmicks I've seen in a noodle house!  Service was friendly and above average for a Chinese place. Great job, Dagu!  We came at about 8:30pm on a Sunday and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. This location used to be the hot pot restaurant \"HOPO\", and you can see that Dagu Rice Noodle still looks a bit like HOPO as they kept the red theme intact.   There is a Chatime next door, great for post-meal BBT if you have room left in your belly after consuming bottomless noodles.  If you can't find parking on the lot, there is additional parking underground around the corner (still part of this plaza)  Highly recommend to anyone who likes soup noodles."}
{"text":"Lots of hype for this place for both locations downtown and markham because of its chain in China. However I find it tastes just like any other oriental bridge rice noodle place. Nothing really special with it. It's the same ingredients that you put in, no other topping that was \"unique\" for their original rice noodle. Their broth is suppose to be their highlight but I find it way too salty compared to other places. Just tastes like loads of MSG even though they claim they don't put it in. Other places are not as salty so you can drink the broth along with the noodles. I would say it's not worth the line up and wait.  Service was pretty bad, had to flag down a waitress multiple times to get water."}
{"text":"i like this location a lot more than the downtown one. i had the fish pickled cabbage one and the flavours were great. i also recommend the fried pumpkin with the red bean paste - and i usually don't like red bean!"}
{"text":"Many hot stone bowl noodles shops have been opening in Markham and Dagu is making a strong challenge to be the most popular. Come early or be prepared to wait as the lines are long and there is very little wait area. We came with a group of 5 and had to wait about 30-40 mins. We grew a little restless but eventually got a table and was given a complimentary dessert. We specifically enjoyed the Tomato beef soup noodle and the spicy cabbage and fish noodle. We also ordered a side of Taiwan style fried chicken which was well fried but a bit too much batter.  Overall, what stood out to us was the wonderful service of their wait staff. Throughout the meal, waiters came by with very careful delivery of food, extra napkins and a manager came to talk to the senior in our group.  Definitely will come again...but maybe at a quieter time."}
{"text":"After HOPO & Spicy Mafia, this location is now home to Dagu Rice Noodle (though all with a similar soup theme). \"Crossing the bridge\" noodles are quite the trend these days, and the piping hot soup is perfect for this chilly weather.   I got the Tomato Soup Crossing Bridge Noodles which comes with beef slices (the pork soup & spicy soup comes with pork). The tomato soup has a very strong tomato flavor, kind of like Campbell's. The 'toppings' are the standard - corn, fish tofu, wood ear, etc. - don't care too much for those as I don't eat most of them. There is also the option to have the signature/standard noodles which has pretty much the same ingredients already in the bowl instead of a separate platter.   Seating is spacious and comfortable despite it being a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Was a bit too gimicky for us. Taste and ingredients were average at best. For the price, you do get full with noodles if thats what you are after as toppings were sparse. My cousin did say that the spicy broth was good but I had the regular option.  Service was erratic and cleanliness could be improved.Fruit tea was expensive and just a plastic  cup of sugar water with chopped sad looking fruit pieces. Appetizers were accurate ...really small plates.   Ok for a winter meal ...but know that if you take a few more steps, you would have a better meal at Kinton Ramen."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup was kept hot and tasty in a stone bowl. Apart from the pork slices, toppings that it comes with are quail egg, crab stick, corn, bamboo, black fungus, preserved vegetables, ham, ground pork, and deep fried pork.   Salted fried chicken was very moist and tasty. Deep fried pumpkin pancake (it's chewy, made with glutenous rice flour) was a nice crispy treat (free with any social media share)! I really liked the yakult mango shake."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (4) 30-ish seat restaurant tucked in the corner of the plaza, visible from Warden. The restaurant is decorated in black and red accents, a large drum (\"da gu\" their namesake) hanging on the wall. Tables are set up for smaller groups of 2-4. There's a clipboard by the door for guests to write down their name and party size. Tables are clean and still very new. Parking sucks at this plaza. so head underground if you must, but spots are cramped regardless.   SERVICE (3) Not much service to speak of as you fill in an order sheet and they bring your food over within minutes. Waiters are quick but not very attentive. Took a couple tries to get our bill and a box, but understandable due to how busy the restaurant was (even at 2:30!)   FOOD (4)  I ordered the mushroom soup base this time, which came with several kinds of fungi (e.g. enoki, oyster mushrooms, ...). I really enjoyed the soup (just a tad too salty) and added all accompanying toppings. Some at our table opted to leave the picked veggies. Soup and bowl were super hot when served and the noodles were cooked to a perfect chewy consistency. We also ordered the Sliced Beef and Ox Tongue in Szechuan Chili Sauce which was very good. Generous serving of meat and sprinkles of nuts. The chili oil was aromatic and not too spicy.   QUALITY/VALUE (3) Starting at $9.49 for their original soup noodles, extra for other soup bases/additional protein. It's 2.99 for extra protein, but that gets added to your bowl before it's served to hide how little there is for 3 dollars.   OVERALL 4 stars - I would return."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Both times on a weeknight for dinner, a bit of a wait each time. The menu is also your form to order, and you simply tick off what you'd like. The soup noodles come with unlimited noodles!  The first time I got the Beef Rib soup. I was disappointed to find out that it was not one of the orders that comes along with the platter of ingredients. So I had to come back.  The second time I got the spicy noodle from the bottom section. This time, with the platter. The first thing I did was throw everything in the big bowl of soup anyway so I guess it wasn't really necessary, but it was part of the experience I guess.  The taste is pretty good, but in the end it's just a bowl of soup and noodles. There aren't really that many ingredients and the broth is not as flavourful as I would've imagined. The noodles are good, with just a slight bit of chew. I've also tried a couple of the sides: the fried chicken and the spicy marinated beef (salad?). Fried chicken was okay.. but the beef was pretty good.  Overall the place is 3 Stars for me. Might come back again sometime if I'm really feeling AYCE noodles."}
{"text":"I dont really have much to say. We waited 45mins for a table, and then waited another one hour until the server told us she missed our order. Lolz."}
{"text":"It is maybe worth the hype?  I saw a huge lineup at their newly opened downtown location so I figured that I'll give the restaurant a try, after realizing that they have a Markham location as well. I have no experience with the Dagu restaurant franchise, so I'm not sure what the hype is about.  Environment: Very close to the T&T supermarket at Steeles/Warden, though it is a block north of that plaza, so for the TTC commuters it may be a challenge because you'd either had to walk 10 mins to pay extra fare to go north. The surface parking is pretty limited due to all the restaurants here, but there are underground parking available. The store itself isn't very big, so it's recommended to come in groups of 6 or fewer. Also, be sure to come earlier than the dinner rush hour because the seats fill up really fast.   Food: The prices for the noodles are alright, mostly within $10. We ordered the regular pork bone soup noodle, beef bone soup noodle, and mushroom soup noodle. Only the mushroom one came with the extras on the side, while the other 2 were all mixed in when they served them to us. One thing to point out is that the noodles are available for unlimited refills, so you're guaranteed to never leave hungry! I think the soup tastes alright, though it's pretty salty for me which caused me to drink lots of water. Not sure if you could request them to add less salt to the soup. We also ordered some desserts on the side, such as pumpkin cakes and durian pastry. Average taste, but the prices were definitely too expensive for how little the serving sizes were.   Service: Average Asian restaurant service. Won't come refill anything unless called upon. Though no complaints when we request to do something.   In conclusion, I may come back again if I'm craving for some hearty Chinese soup noodle. Would definitely try to ask for less salt next time, and would definitely forgo the desserts/sides"}
{"text":"Taste: 3 Service: 3 Presentation: 2 Value: 3 Overall: 2.8 rounded up to 3  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we're javing today. Everytime I walked past the Dagu downtown I see a long lineup for it. Is it really worth standing out in the cold for an hour during these freezing winter months? Let's find out.  The bowl came in a sizzling 150 degree celcius hot pot so I advise you not to touch it. Let me know if you do though, I would give you a medal for being so bold :). The noodles I got were quite dissapointing. It just tasted like a wet clump. The broth was quite tasty though. Because they serve unlimited refills of noodles, I decided to order another bowl. The second batch of noodles on the other hand were very chewy. I guess I was just unlucky with the first batch.   In terms of value, it's 9 dollars per bowl but the topics are a hefty 3 dollars each. The toppings I ordered barely existed so it was definitely not worth it. The unlimited noodles are awesome if you are on a high carb diet though.   The service was average. We asked for a refill of noodles and it never came and I had to remind them again to bring them again. However, they brought us more napkins when my friend was sweating his balls off from eating so quickly.  Overall the noodles were OK. I would definitely not wait in line for this though, especially if I have to stand out in the cold. I will try the Toronto location later and see how that compares. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant today on a cold fall night looking for something similar to hotpot of the sort and ended up getting noodle soup. I ordered the tomato and beef combo, the soup was salty and flavourful. The crowd were late twenties. I recommend it to anyone who wants to grab a quick bite.Oh ya, free refills is a good idea."}
{"text":"We heard this new ramen restaurant and decide to try.  The first impression was the restaurant is renovated and clean.  The menu is small with limited number of food selection.  We ordered pork bone noodle and tomato broth noodle.  The noodle came out hot.  The tomato broth is not that good from my opinion.  The provide very little meat consider the price is not cheap.  The pork bone soup is good but majority are bones and again very little meat.  We didn't feel full after the meal.  The lack of food selection and portion of the meat is not generous.  We will not come back again unless they improve on the things I mentioned."}
{"text":"Already been here couple times since they opened for business and tried most of their popular noodle items on the menu....  Rice noodles soup with braised bone-in beef - it came with two huge beef bones with good amount of beef attached on them. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and flavourful. Eating this could get a little messy but its worth it.    Original crossing the bridge Rice noodles - the soup base was tasty not as salty and full of msg like other places. The noodle comes with 10 small plates of ingredients and four thin slices of meat that you add to the boiling broth yourself. Overall, I found this to be flavourful and on the better end of the many crossing the bridge rice noodle places thats popping up in Toronto/Markham.     Spicy flavoured crossing the bridge rice noodles - this is just like the original crossing the bridge noodle but with a spicy twist to it.  I am a fan of spicy foods so the soup base was not as spicy as I wished but for people that can't do spicy it's just right. However, this is more on the saltier side.   Tomato flavoured crossing the bridge rice noodles with sliced beef - Probably my favourite soup base on the menu out of the four that I tried. The soup is rich in tomato flavour and it has some diced tomatoes in it. Its not too overwhelming and has a comfort food feeling in it.   It's worth to mention that the noodles are unlimited refill. The restaurant is quite thoughtful that the refill noodles are a bit more cooked considering that your soup is no longer boiling hot like first served. This ensures the consistency in the firmness of the noodles (even when the broth is lukewarm).   On a final note, since this place is still relatively new so be prepared to wait in line for a table on the weekends (especially during lunch and dinner hours)."}
{"text":"I visited on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was quite busy but there was no wait. Ordered the signature noodles. Found the soup fairly refreshing but the noodles and ingredients quite standard. Nothing impressive or disappointing for me."}
{"text":"First thing - this whole \" chain from China has arrived\" hype is not worth it!  It was super packed when we first arrived and we were told to write our names on paper. While waiting around, the store was quite small and hectic. Honestly, I had already at this point been to other noodle places with the same concept so it didn't phase me. I tried the tomato soup over the bridge noodles and my boyfriend tried the original. It was confusing because I didn't really get the difference between the regular rice noodles vs. the over the bridge noodles. The tomato soup wasn't bad but I thought the original soup that my boyfriend had tasted better. Also, tip for everyone ... stay away from the $1.99 chicken, it taste bad and was dry. I also found the noodles to be super overcooked which I personally did not like. Overall, was very average and not the best place I've been for noodles with this concept of mini plates of items to be  added to the soup. The refillable noodles though it always a plus though!"}
{"text":"Endless rice noodles? Yes please. That was what pulled us in.  The bone-in pork broth was decent, nothing special but the pork was terrible. It was not close to being fall-off-the-bone and you really had to work at it to get any meat from it. The crossing the bridge noodles were so stingy on the toppings given. The tomato soup base that we ordered for it was nice, though mid-way through the meal we felt it was really oddly similar to Campbell's tomato soup. (I'm sure this is not the case..... but just saying) The additional rice noodles are a nice touch, though we noticed that it took a pretty long time to get additional portions.   The staff here are pretty rude, even for a Chinese restaurant. Don't come here expecting a decent dining experience. It's really more of a get in, seated, eat, pay and get out type of place.   We'd come back if were really hungry and had no other convenient options. Otherwise, I'd pick a place that has better overall quality."}
{"text":"I ordered the basic pork base and it had a lot of things in it that I wasn't really aware of.  I really wish they listed what they put in it, otherwise, the rest should be options.  I ended up pulling a bunch of things out and giving it to my girlfriend.  The noodles, however, were very yummy and you can order as much as you want.  My dinner came with two large pork bones in it and I literally couldn't eat it.  The meat was pretty much fused to the bone so I couldn't pull it off with my chopsticks or even with my hands.  So that was a large let down.  The appetizers are small and unimpressive.  I looked around when we got in and none of them looked particularly pleasing to the eye, especially after you look at the menu and see the prices associated with them.  They're just not worth it.  The service is also not something to applaud here.  They don't really check up on you and the servers don't even look like they want to be there.  I asked a waiter for soy sauce and he ended up bringing us two bottles of vinegar oil.  Apparently soy sauce can mean different things, depending who you ask.  Maybe it was a one off.  I want to like this place, but at the time of this review, I don't."}
{"text":"I got to that place around 12:30 and there was quite many people on ground. I tried their spicy Rice Noodle Soup with Fish.¬† The taste was very similar to¬†Sichuan-Shui Zhu Yu.¬† They have the warning label stick on the table¬†saying that the hot plate is over 150C.¬† This shop i believed is a¬†franchise store.¬† I saw their sign - in Downtown Toronto close to Eaton Center.¬† Seems like the price is a little bit high for $12.42.¬† I¬†don't know but everything seems expensive now."}
{"text":"Went to the one in downtown. I was hoping it'll be my favorite new spot for rice noodle. The food was not bad; service was disorganized. Didn't serve you water, forgot about your add on ... after all they only  accepted cash or debit which includes the minimum tips for 12%... I'll go back for some other flavors but definitely not the service there."}
{"text":"Unlimited noodle that many of us can't really benefit from. Packed, has to wait even though we came before 6pm."}
{"text":"Dagu is where HOPO and Spicy Mafia resided. Their signature dish is their bridge noodles. This is where they give you a boiling pot of soup and give you all the ingredients on the side. Including noodles, beef, sausage, corn etc.   You might have to share tables at their tables are long and they might place people from different groups side by side at the same table.   I got the spicy original bridge noodle soup with extra beef. It took a longer time than expected but this might be because it takes a while to heat up the stone bowl.   I loved it except for a few things.  1. The ingredients seemed rather skimpy on portion.  2. When I ordered a refill for my noodles (unlimited yay!) it took SSOOOOOO long to come out so by that point I almost paid and left.   The pumpkin red bean cakes were good but not a must. My friend looooved her brown sugar dough (don't remember what it's called).   It seems like service is mostly mandarin speaking staff but they do have several who are proficient in English to help you understand the menu.   That being said the service was friendly but slow and forgetful. The food was good but could be better.  Definitely worth a try if you love carbs and looking for some hot soup in this ridiculous cold."}
{"text":"The good: the soup is delicious! The broth is tasty and flavourful without it feeling unhealthy. I got the original where you add the ingredients in yourself. It comes with 3 pieces of pork and then the rest are toppings that go right in the soup too! You can order as much noodles as you want and you leave feeling very full. I also tried their sides, cucumber and beef tongue, which were well seasoned.   The bad: The seating is the same layout as the previous owner and you have to wait a bit, and it's not the best place to stand around with hot bowls of soup being carried back and forth. Okay service."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this noodle chain, but I didn't really find it that different from other similar noodle restaurants. I think the specialty is the super hot broth and the numerous toppings that you can throw into it. The noodles were a good texture and and you can actually get unlimited free refills. The broth flavours were good and all in all a decent place for noodles, but on busy nights not a meal I would wait around for. The meat portions are also rather small for what they charge."}
{"text":"Finally came here to try their rice noodles. Have been here twice. First time the waitress wasn't very friendly.  Second time was better. Both time ordered the original crossing bridge rice noodle.    What I like: - Free refill of the rice noodles - super fruit tea!   The fruit tea was so refreshing perfect for a hot summer day.  Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Got the tomato soup based one, nothing special but can refill noodles for free. Also got the mango yakuit which is so so as well. Overall not bad but don't think I would come again."}
{"text":"I feel like this location is cursed. All the predecessors couldn't last more than a few years in this place. Maybe Chatime took away all the good business? Haha.  This place is decent for a cold winter's day. I came here for lunch and it was packed. Despite the signs claiming this place uses \"no MSG\", the broth still made me drink about 10 cups of water. The noodles are Q (chewy) and the meat is very tender.   I'm a noodle fanatic so I love that there's no limit for that. I do wish they would give you more contents in the soup though (thanks for the 2 pieces of lettuce??).   Overall, a decent place but -1 star for the subpar service and -1 for the salty broth."}
{"text":"So good always crave for the noodles. Staff is great, food portion is generous and price is good. Usually there's a line up but I never had to wait too long. I always get the pickled cabbage and fish soup base."}
{"text":"Awesome noodles!The best rice noodle in Toronto in my opinion. Always packed with ppl waiting to be seated. The portion is big with lots of soup and veggies and meat. The noodle never gets soggy. Perfect texture. Especially loved their cold bean noodle but it is always sold out so quickly! Too popular!They need to have more bean noodle to meet the demand lol! Will be back again and again ..."}
