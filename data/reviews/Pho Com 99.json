{"text":"The food is good, no question. The customer service however, leaves MUCH to be desired.

I've never had someone yell at me or my fellow diners in a restaurant for wanting to pay separately. And I don't mean \"annoyed\"; I can understand being annoyed about splitting the bill, but they were actually *yelling* at us.

Furthermore, the gentleman at the cash *grabbed* my debit card from my wallet, as I was getting my credit card out. He \"preferred\" cash... 

Can you imagine how ridiculous that is?

I didn't have to, I was there.

If you want decent food and to be treated like crap, go to Pho Mi 99. If you want the EXACT SAME quality food and GOOD service... continue down Dixie or Dundas in ANY direction for literally a block. :)"}
{"text":"Still the best pho around. The broth is simple yet very flavourful. The service is quick and the ingredients are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I missed this place, and I'm feeling very charitable this weekend, so I'm bumping this up a star.

My family and I came here for the usual. The quality was still high, the service was still great -- and this time around, I tried the fresh rolls with chicken and shrimp, which were fantastic! The peanut sauce really sets them apart.

I'll be back again as soon as I'm able to."}
{"text":"Our go to pho restaurant close to our neighbourhood. The service is always really quick, prices fair and quality is good. Visited last Saturday around noon and the restaurant was packed with families. A great place to check out for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Good prices, good food. Tacky ambiance, but overall I recommend this place.
Good place for the vietnamise soups and other dishes."}
{"text":"One of our favorites when in the greater Toronto area. Great value, tasty food, never disappointed! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Newly renovated! It definitely doesn't look like your typical Vietnamese restaurant but kudos to them for setting the bar a little higher.

Their food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I came here tonight as I was craving Mi Vit Tiem (roasted duck egg noodle soup) and a Soursop Nectar milkshake. I got exactly what I was expecting and was very satisfied. The duck was fall off the bone and the broth was fragrant and flavourful. It's not a famous dish as Pho is but it's worth trying especially if you want something different. I forget what my boyfriend got but it was a rice dish with deep fried fish. The fish packed a lot of flavour and had the perfect hint of lemongrass.

The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because service is just meh, mostly because I find the waiters are really awkward and sometimes just plain creepy."}
{"text":"How have I not done a review here yet? I have come to this Pho restaurant so many times because of their service, quality of food and cleanliness. I always order a fresh shrimp roll and a rare beef/ tendon Pho and they always provide consistent food quality. What more can you ask for? Whenever I feel like some really good Pho, I just hop over to this location right here.

Yesterday was a bit different. It was my son's birthday and my entire family knew we wanted something that was tasty but wouldn't break the bank either (after all, he's only two years old and didn't need some fancy dinner lol). What's something a 2 year-old and adults can enjoy? Pho! 

We ordered the chow mein noodles, mango salad, beef stir fry, chicken stir fry and a couple bowls of Pho. I was impressed with the salad and both stir fry dishes. Obviously, the Pho bowls were \"Pho-nomenal\" (hehe- I had to be corny). However, the chow mein noodles were a bit too spongey for me. The sauce was flavourful and veggies were cooked well. 

I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this location for a long time. They renovated the restaurant as well couple years ago but the vibe is still the same. The service is always great and the food come to the table fast, hot and all together. 
I ordered the Pho house special which is always the best because it has a mix of everything. 
We also ordered the Beef Stew with Rice. Really good, the meat and veggies are tender and the broth is nice and rich without being oily. 
The deep fried spring rolls are always a must have. 
The rice dishes are ones that can't be messed up and always good if you don't feel like having soup.
Their Vietnamese ice coffee is really good and strong. 
The prices are really cheap and the portions are good especially the Pho."}
{"text":"You may not know this but I love pho. So much so I think I should marry a Vietnamese.

I had the BBQ Pork Rice Noodle Soup with Deep Fried Spring Rolls. (see pictures I uploaded)

All of the ingredients were super fresh and the spring rolls were very crispy.

I added some of the hot sauce to my soup and then proceeded to clean the bowl.

After a lunch like that I do not have to eat again for the rest of the day.  I have no idea how Bourdain can eat all of that food.

Even though I visit this place twice a month I am going to check out the other Pho restaurants in my area, Dixie and Bloor.

I have read some great reviews here on Yelp about those places, one just around the corner from me, so I need to be fair and compare."}
{"text":"My favourite go-to Pho place in the GTA. The pho soup is not aa greasy or salty as the other places and it's ALWAYS piping hot so it cooks my bean sprouts well through during my meal. I have yet to try so much on the menu as there's like hundreds to choose from! Really lovely pho and the owner is also very friendly. Would not go around 12pm or 6:30pm as it's super busy and you have to wait to be seated. It's in a plaza and there are a lot of pho restaurants around Dixie and Dundas but this is the one!"}
{"text":"Admittedly I've never been a Pho type of guy but I was walking by this place had a really good feeling that this was going to my new \"go to\" place near my house and so far I haven't been wrong. On my first visit the along was locals there were a lot of Caucasian hippies types there.. an interesting mix. The prices are not expensive but the food is great and quick. The decor of the restaurant is upscale.
 For the pho requested I cooked meat with added extra vegetables which really added to the dish. The fresh spring rolls with shrimp we're ho-hum. The great thing about the fried rice it was not greasy like that most Chinese restaurants.

Definitely check it out if you near the Dundas and Dixie area."}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed with people when I got there to pick up my order so I thought the food would be amazing. Food was pipping hot every time I had gotten take out but I found their food was a hit or miss. Although the pad thai that we got was flavorful, the Singapore style vermicelli was disappointing. The noodle that it came with for take out was definitely not vermicelli. The thicker noodles that it came with tasted over cooked and mushy. Wasn't too happy with that.  The satay chicken that we ordered was so-so, wasn't terrible but did not pack a punch. All in all it was an okay experience, was nothing special though.

Oh! With that said though, their avocado milkshake is yuuuuuummmmy!!!! So will definitely be returning for that! And maybe give their pho a try since I had not returned to my favorite regular pho restaurant, also in Mississauga, after that shooting in front of their parking lot a month or two ago."}
{"text":"I like the #119, bbq pork style pho. 
I don't overly enjoy the chicken pho (poor cuts of chicken). 
Spring rolls good. Service very hit and miss."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Service is awful. Brought in three kids ranging from 4 to 8 during a time when the restaurant was not busy. The manager told the kids to not play with the utensils! They are children! And they weren't extremely loud for the 4 people in the huge restaurant. Not going back due to his attitude l"}
{"text":"The service is FAST. I ordered, went to the washroom, and the food was out and piping hot before I got back.

Cheap, satisfying portions. A great pho place.

What you'd typically expect - some salient rice noodles, raw-cooked-in-broth beef, and a bunch of beansprouts, and various herbs, etc. Hits the spot at lunch for sure."}
{"text":"Bright and clean place under new management.. Love their assorted meat fondue!!sooooooo gooodelicious!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Pho Com 99 for YEARS.

It is a little far from where we live but we always try to make the trip out here because it is our absolute favourite place to get pho from.

Everything that we usually order, whether it is pho, vermicelli, chinese broccoli, fried rice, etc. is always consistent and so tasty.

The owner is also the sweetest man and I don't think I have ever caught him without a smile on his face.

(I accidentally left this review for another random Pho Mi location thinking it was Pho Com but this place is the OG)."}
{"text":"One of the waiters is usually grumpy and rude; however, all of the other staff are super friendly and service is fast. I've tried so many other places in West Toronto and Mississauga but none compare. Great food. Very Clean. The best overall Vietnamese I've found in Mississauga/Etobicoke."}
{"text":"This is a local spot that I go to for lunch at work. Their food is always good and the service is always friendly and fast. They also don't have any issues with splitting orders or splitting the bill. I usually order either the pho, vermicelli or the pork chop and chicken on rice meal. 

This place is well worth the quick stop in."}
{"text":"The food here was just ok.  Our party of 5 ordered 3 different soups and all found the broth tasted like canned broth.  The grilled pork chop and fish dish was ok for the price, but again, nothing special. Service was hit or miss."}
{"text":"It's nice to find pho in an unexpected area.Really liked the service from the staff.The food was fresh,and the menu had some items I don't think I've seen in other pho places. Prices were reasonable,the portion was okay,not as much protein as I've had with similar noodle orders."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad. The service isn't bad. Not my #1 pick for pho. But the food here is decent. And the menu has a wide selection of dishes to pick from."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese 
Decor is cute, friendly staff, and while you are here, try the fried wonton, fried spring roll, Pho Gha with grilled chicken & pho Bo mmmm"}
{"text":"The pho at this place was average. The broth and noodles tasted good.  Though the bowl was quite large, there was barely any meat in the soup."}
{"text":"I went here today since my go to pho place was closed for renovation. 

The restaurant looks very clean and modern compare to other Vietnamese restaurants. I remember this place as pho mi 99 back in the days. 

I got the bun bo hue and spring rolls. The spring rolls were really good! 2 spring rolls were $4.50
The bun bo hue was alright, I didn't like the texture of the bun(noodles) it was way to soft for my liking. The beef in it didn't look appetizing so I didn't really want to risk trying it. I wasn't so wow by it. 

Overall, it's okay place. I wouldn't really come back since there is so many good Vietnamese restaurants near by. If I do come back I would def try out the pho."}
{"text":"We haven't been to this location since it was a Pho Mi 99. 

In those days it was rather like the poor cousin of the HWY. 10 location of Pho Mi 99. We drove by and noticed the name change, so we thought we'd give it a try. And we are very happy that we did!

The dining room was very nicely decorated in a contemporary style and seemed very clean. The washrooms were spotless! This is a big deal when it comes to the typical local Viet. restaurant. 

I ordered the beef stew with rice noodles. It was filled with plenty of beef, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was very tasty. 

My husband had the rice with grilled chicken, fried egg and steamed egg. He thought it was all very good and the fried egg was nice and runny. 

All in all we were very pleased with our meals and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"After a morning of shopping a friend and I decided to give this place a shot--the reason for their 3 stars is because no half stars were available, if they were they would 2.5.  The service was your typical quick Vietnamese style dine in.  It was quite busy on a Saturday at 1pm.

We were pointed to a table and sat down.  Menus and order pad was already there.  A pot of tea was brought out as well. The menu was very very extensive!

I had ordered the vermicelli with grilled pork, shrimp on sugar cane and spring rolls.  It was a large bowl, I'll give them that but the flavour was lacking because there were enough variety of vegetable to give more dimension to the dish.  Missing was your carrots and radishes.

My friend had grilled pork and chicken on rice with a sunny side egg which was over cooked like the meats.  She said it was ok but would never order that again.

I think I would go back just to try the pho. Otherwise not sure what else I would risk trying..."}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday evening and it was surprisingly not too busy. We ordered two small Pho (medium rare beef and a medium rare beef with brisket) as well as an iced Vietnamese drip coffee with condensed milk. 
The broth as well as the noodles was really good and the service was excellent. Fast and friendly! 
The server had no issues bringing us extra limes and the long leaves for the soup. 
The total bill came to about $23 including the tip. We will definitely be going back here. 
As you can see, I didn't bother taking photos of the food because it was gone very quickly."}
{"text":"Maybe because this is based in Mississauga and a bulk of amazing Vietnamese options are in the North York area for a cheaper price, so I wasn't very impressed.

The restaurant is clean, lots of seating, and since it's in a plaza, lots of parking here too. However, with an expansive menu, most items are $8.50 and above, which is slightly more expensive than what you'd find if you travelled more east.

Most of my friends here got the pho, and upon seeing an actual small bowl when you ordered the small, I opted for the vermicelli instead. My expectations are that when you go to a Vietnamese restaurant and order a small, the bowl is still fairly large and filling, and the cost should hover around the $6-$7.50 range. For a whole dollar more and a smaller bowl, and a salty broth, those who frequent pho joints would be disappointed. However, if this is an occasional meal for you, then go right ahead.

As for my bowl of vermicelli, I ordered it with their fried fish and spring rolls ($8.50). I was surprised to see this place have a full page dedicated to fried fish dishes. The fried fish tasted great - like a Vietnamese fish fillet. Spring rolls were average. All in all, pretty okay deal.

Not sure about the pho scene in Mississauga but this place is quite alright. If you're a Vietnamese cuisine fanatic however, this would probably fly under your radar."}
{"text":"Delish! Tried spicy satay beef pho this time!

Service is even, and ambience is good.

Come here next time for your Pho craving!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the West end I come here for pho, good portions and deep flavoured broth solid 8/10"}
