{"text":"Sorry to say slow service getting our order in and the place was not busy. Food came out warm at best. Waitress did not check on us and regular coffee was $3. The potato pancakes were bland. Not impressed and will not be going back. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Venue's first wine pairing dinner last night.  My husband and I had never been there before, but what a treat it was!  The newly remodeled place is tastefully done creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The staff was was professional, yet very friendly and accommodating.  Our amazing six course meal was planned and prepared by the same guest chef  instrumental in recently revamping their menu.  The presentation, quality and taste of the dinner along with perfectly paired Napa wine was truly five star!  We're going back next week - and it's worth the 45 minute drive."}
{"text":"Visited this hip upscale cafe for the first time a few weeks back for lunch. We sat outside in their comfortable heated patio. The place is well decorated with a touch of local artwork for sale as well.
They offer a well balanced menu of fresh creative salads, hand crafted sandwiches and reasonably priced delicious appetizers.
We had great service and the owners both came out to welcome us.
This place is a great find in the hills of Phoenix in Carefree and is a breath of fresh air amongst all the big stiff & starchy corporate venues around.
I'll be back many times! Can't wait to try it out for Dinner and Wine."}
{"text":"What a shame...

Like so many of my failed relationships I fell for something that looked attractive, only to find out that beauty is sadly often only skin deep.  Such was my relationship with Venues today.

It looked great.  The location is cool, right near the sundial and the stone work and rustic/contemporary feel really pulled me in.  We grabbed a table outside and the waitress handed us some menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  She brought an iced tea and then we watched.

We watched the staff walk around seemingly in a New Years Day daze.  After about 15 minutes I told my friend to put down her menu, thinking that her still holding the menu was preventing the waitress from thinking we were ready.  Five minutes later I finally succeeded at getting that precious eye contact and she took our order.  Then...once again...we waited.

Now another fifteen or even twenty minutes passed and this time when I gained that eye contact I must have triggered her memory that we still hadnt been served so she went and checked.  Nothing.  Another five and she says \"I'm going to see whats going on!\"  She came back and acknowledged that she forgot to put our order in and offered to buy me a beer.  It was too early so I declined, but no other compensation whatsoever was made for this screw up.

She then came back again and told us that it shouldnt be much longer...there was only one order ahead of us.  How could anybody be ahead of us?  Wouldnt the kitchen drop everything to take care of the salad (thats right...thats all we ordered).  Nope.

Another five.  \"Its almost done...there are just finishing the chicken.\"  We stopped her and said \"Thats OK now...just bring the lettuce...we dont need the chicken\".  \"OK...are you sure?\"  \"Yes!!!\" we told her\"  We expected her right back now...no such luck.  Another five and she finally came back with the salad with the chicken.  

Now she didnt try to bluff us and took fault for the error.  I'll give her that but the check came without any favors.  Didnt offer dessert.  I wasnt drinking and hadnt even hinted that I do so it was surprising that the only offer she made was for a beer?  

She joked and even tongue in cheek made fun of the situation and it did add some levity.  She acknowledged \"The shitty service\" (her words) which I did laugh at.  But who would go back when they didnt even say \"Hey....its on us...just please give us a second chance\".  

I dont think I will ever go back.  Maybe for a drink but I really felt bad for everybody waiting on their meal.  I think that one table left without waiting for their food while we were there.

Great atmosphere and unlimited potential I might guess but as for right now the \"New Ownership\" sign isnt winning over any patrons.  It couldnt have been any worse before.

Good luck.  Its a tough business!"}
{"text":"Pretzel Reuben was very tasty, would highly recommend.   Had the sandwich with an orange wit brew."}
{"text":"As always a very good experience, food was correct portion size and staff were as always very attentive. I have been back 3 times in the last 10 days as you know exactly what you are getting. Good food, service and ambiance at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"A beautiful dog friendly restaurant? Count me in! Dog bowls on the patio and beautiful decor inside, this is a great restaurant for a date or anytime. Joe was a great server who checked in often and was very friendly. Amazing sweet potato soup, fish and chips, and bread pudding to share for dessert. We'll defiantly be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 3 or 4 times and have always had great meals.  The street tacos are yummy!  Halibut and Lamb Chops were perfect.  We usually go during the week and always get good service. Surprised to see complaints :(

The waitresses even treated our puupy well when he joined us outside!"}
{"text":"Love their big bar for happy hour. Fun people & bartender. Great wine selection. A nice \"venue\" in downtown Carefree amongst other shops."}
{"text":"Nice little spot.  Soup and quiche were great.  Service was awesome!  Oh, and hopslam on tap."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Small portions though.    VERY slow.  But maybe that's what this crowd wants.    Not my favorite place."}
{"text":"We have frequented the Venue for many years and this last visit was one that was truly a disappointment.  Coming in for Happy Hour, it took over 20 minutes just to get a drink order and by the time we were able to inform the waitress that we would like to order an appetizer off of the Happy Hour menu she said it was tooooo late!  She even knew we were there for awhile.  Then a member of our party asked Alan, who evidently is the boyfriend of the owner who was greeting tables and saw us come in way before happy hour ended, just rudely said that nope happy hour is over and you can't order anything.  Our party was going to stay for dinner, but after the inappropriate attitude of the server and owner's boyfriend, we decided to go to another restaurant in town.  It's really sad that we try to support our local restaurants and then are treated like they really don't give a shit if you are there or even why you are there after a long day at work and you just want to relax and have a nice dinner.  WELL, DO NOT GO HERE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.  Maybe try Indio Crow, Harold's, Smokehouse or El Encanto.  There are many other restaurants in Cave Creek & Carefree that will treat you right for any type of meal that you want.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and will not spend our hard earned money in this place and sure hope you don't either!  There is no reason to be treated like this."}
{"text":"Service was OK...food was very bland and had no taste.  The garlic potatoes had no garlic and quite frankly tasted instant.  All desserts are made outside the restaurant and come in frozen...and that is the reason they have a processed after taste.   For that price, it should be above average...this was average or below.  I live here, and am not a tourist.  I will not be back.  PLUS, do NOT order ice tea...they use tap water that smells like a sewer!!"}
{"text":"Great Ambience! Ordered the Eggplant Parmesan special. It was the best I have had and it was served with a fantastic polenta which I prefer over pasta. The chef dropped by our table and it was a pleasure chatting with her. Service was spot on and the staff made me feel right at home. Good wine selection as well. I will tell all my friends."}
{"text":"Last year of being a \"Regular\" at Venues we were just asked to leave as the bar seats are reserved at 6 PM. Arrived at 4 PM to watch sports, have appetizers and two $36.00 bottles of KJ chard. ($100.00 at this point) when approached by the owner asking us to pay up and leave as these bar seats are now reserved. Okay, just came home and reviewed one of our CC statements and tallied $1859.99 spent in last 120 days at this establishment alone. Never have been treated with such dis-respect at any establishment. Often putting up with bad service and food through their transition periods without saying a word was an obvious mistake on our part, owners befriending you, take your money.... never again, avoid this place at all cost, many great alternatives available.
Paul and Elaine Boudreau"}
{"text":"Have been several times and had good service but have to say venues wasn't prepared for Mothers Day today! We waited an hour and fifteen minutes for sandwiches!!! That was after waiting 20 minutes for a server to even come get our drink order! Don't know that we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for his 30th birthday and we were not disappointed. We came in on a whim after deciding we would go to Carefree and eat at the first restaurant that appealed to us. We looked up the menu online and thought we should give it a  try. We were both very happy that this ended up being the place. We started off with drinks and an appetizer. I was extremely impressed with their beer list. We ordered the daily flatbread and we loved it. I don't remember the name of the flatbread but it had cheese, jalapeño, bacon, potatoes and sour cream on it. The potatoes were cooked perfectly which was pleasantly surprising as potatoes on pizza or flatbread usually taste horrible, in my experience. For dinner I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and my boyfriend ordered the pan seared duck-breast with risotto and ratatouille as his sides. Both of us loved our food and I could probably write an entire review on the Brie risotto alone. I didn't finish my eggplant parm so I could save room dessert but my boyfriend cleaned his plate. Our dessert was delicious and beautiful. So beautiful that I almost didn't eat it. We ordered the creme brûlée and the flavor of the night was espresso. It's easy to mess up a creme brûlée so, once again, I was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful our dessert was and impressed that it was cooked perfectly.

Our service was even better than the food. I believe our server was Karen and she was fantastic. She had the chef come out to talk with my boyfriend and I. I felt that really added to our entire dining experience at Venues Cafe. I'm not very picky when it comes to dining out but this place really went above and beyond the expectations I had."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the reviews...I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.  We've been coming here often over the past year and have always had a pleasant experience.  The food is delicious, and be sure to order any French specials on the menu (I still regret not trying the beef bourguignon but I'm sure it will be back!).  The restaurant is beautiful inside; the bar can get crowded during happy hour, but there's plenty of other seating if you're looking for a more intimate dining experience.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant.  Here on a Friday night and it is packed.  Diablo broth was amazing.  Chocolate mousse torte was incredible.  We had really good service.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here. However, the place has really gone down hill. I tried yet again to let my old hang out redeem itself. I was disappointed. Higher prices, smaller portions, boring menu, horrible staff. I love to support local businesses, but I'm afraid that was my last time at Venue. It's a shame cute place and it used to be great!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. Some places take time, maybe this is one, maybe the good people of carefree are brutal critics? Who knows.. First.. The place looks great, the restroom looked new, the staff were perfect, the menu was simple and easy. The waitress  was spot on. She recommended the special. We went with her recommendation. Less than 10 minutes we received our salads. Excellent, next came our lunch. Excellent, drinks excellent. The ambiance is calming, the price was reasonable. As me and my wife left the owners thanked us. This looks like a great place. We live in desert hills and would kill for a place like this. We will gladly drive 10 miles to come back."}
{"text":"Trying to find some new experiences in dining, we happened upon Venues.  The decor can best be defined as rustic industrial(actually liked it).  Our waiter was okay.  Food;  mussels,if they don't do a little better job of inspection before serving, they could possibly harm someone, there were five mussels that were not opened,the dip sandwich included stale bread,dry beef and so so au jus.  For a dollar extra we chose sweet potato fries,fortunately the most edible and good choice.  We expressed our disappointment to our waiter about the mussels, his response was he would tell the chef, after that he avoided any contact til asked for the check.  Other then the house Chardonnay
and fries, there is nothing positive in this outing."}
{"text":"Stopped in after we researched Carefree for a restaurant. We were excited to see that the online menu was unique and diverse, and reasonably priced. The experience did not disappoint and went beyond our expectations. Service was excellent, it was happy hour all day/night (Sunday) and the food was delicious. Had grapefruit and crab appetizer - delicious, Mussels in wine and butter sauce, delicious, and hubby had Caesar salad and beef and BBQ pork sliders. We're going back for sure. Oh, and the dining area/bar is lit at a dim, soothing level, a real plus when it comes to a nice evening dining experience. Very well done. Thanks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Mussels are incredible, get the spicy tomato broth and extra bread. Ask for the new peligroso cocktail!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find right in my backyard!  Food was excellent and Service was great.  Have been there for happy hour and dinner.  Will be my neighborhood go to place."}
{"text":"We went with a very large group to this lovely restaurant.  The staff was efficient, friendly and accommodating. The surroundings are very clean, bright, modern and comfortable.  Our group had arranged for a buffet which was good and hot from first served to last.  I would definitely recommend stopping here for a meal."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Do not go here if you want great quality service. We ordered lunch for a client and was turned down because they were busy. Hello? We have heard of waiting you know. We just want to pick up however long it took. We asked if we can come back later then and they said no. We can't take your order. What kind of establishment is this? Completely absurd.

I have been in there several times to DINE IN with family. Service has ALWAYS been slow. I'm talking about 45 minutes just for 3 mini burger sliders. That's too bad, bc the cook is actually decent. 

Won't be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"We dropped by quite early on Sunday morning for breakfast. Metal chairs on the patio turned out to be not too comfortable, planters looked somewhat sad. When we were ready to order we learned that some of the dishes listed on the menu were actually not available. First coffee served was lukewarm, when my wife complaint she got a new mug with nice hot coffee. We ordered two identical omelets, they were served with ample bread, two different single serving marmalades, ketchup and butter in small plastic cups. Unfortunately one was missing avocado, which we had ordered and which was also listed on the check."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip in Scottsdale and a colleague and I decided to go off the beaten path for dinner and stumbled upon Venues.

The first thing I noticed was the fantastic art all around the restaurant (I only wish I could afford to buy some). It gave the place a nice warm feeling. I'm definitely big on atmosphere and this place really got it right.

But let's be honest the atmosphere only does so much for a place...what really matters is the food and needless to say I was not disappointed. We shared the calamari for an appetizer and it was so nice and lightly breaded and fried and not chewy (I hate chewy calamari!!!). 

I decided on the seafood linguine which was nice and light with al dente pasta but the real star of the night was the pork chop that my colleague ordered...I don't know what they did to it but I think it might have been the best pork chop I've ever had and the apple chutney really complemented it well.

Overall, fairly priced, great atmosphere, good service and amazing pork chops!! Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"absolutely terrible service, waited for 20 minutes just for water despite the restaurant being next to empty. decided to walk out after waiter passed by my friend and i for the third time. will not be returning, there are much better and more reasonably priced food places in cave creek. the person that gave us our glasses of water was the only reason we didn't walk out sooner. will not be returning ever."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Started out with being brought the wrong beer, no big deal. Then the waitress forgot we'd ordered appetizers (blamed it on the beer mix-up) so we never got them. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips which were two previously frozen triangles of greasy fish with also previously frozen french fries and a tiny portion of vinegary cole slaw. I ordered pasta salad with vegetables ($13) and added shrimp for $7. I got three (3!) regular sized shrimp. The pasta was grocery store-type bow tie, with mushy squash and some other veggies that weren't bad, served cold. The taste was very bland, just a mildly lemon tasting oil. This from their 'Cordon Bleu' trained Chef de Cuisine,  as the menu advertises? The fish special was $32, glad I didn't waste $$ on that. The decor is a combo of red leather banquettes, southwest, Greek and other randomness. On a Friday night, the restaurant was sparsely populated with a mostly elderly crowd.  Save your money for a different Cave Creek restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. Summer salad with ahi tuna and mahi mahi tacos are delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to Venues Cafe twice - once for Sunday brunch and another time for lunch.  The outside seating area is beautiful.  I sat outside both times.  The food is excellent and I found the service to be awesome.  They were very attentive, never needed to ask for anything as they were at the table checking in very often."}
{"text":"This restaurant has terrible food, Very inconsistent and I have gotten sick every time I have eaten there. (3 times in the last year) They serve fish that is on the edge of spoiling.  You can eat much better at other restaurants around the area.They have now let their BEST BARTENDER, GARY, QUIT!!!   He was the only reason many of the patrons went in to this place! This place is not a restaurant I could recommend to anyone. Over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Travel forever for what a waste of time. Food was Average new Chef needs training. Good luck to this place! Don't waste your time and gas. Try the Boulders it's closer!
Service was the worst diner service. Learn how to open a bottle of wine!
Better yet go to Cafe Bink same area way better food and service!"}
{"text":"What a difference a couple months can make. Everything has changed at Venues since my last visit. We were there for happy hour last night with another couple. The appetizer menu has changed and it's a joke. The delicious fried calamari was gone from the menu and replaced with a bruschetta made with a tiny sliver of prosciutto, cream cheese and jam. The stuffed eggs with bacon were okay. The appetizers on the happy hour menu were $5 with a very limited selection. My husband ordered a $16 ahi tuna appetizer that was tasty if pricey from the regular menu.

All of the servers are new. Not one server or bartender remained from the staff we had become accustomed to over the summer. Our server was pleasant but not particularly friendly.

Our happy hour turned into a sad hour when the server brought our check:  $125 for two rounds of drinks and three $5 appetizers and one superior appetizer. We'll take our happy hour someplace else next time."}
{"text":"Did not have a reservation but showed up for New Years Day Brunch. We had  Omelets which were great and the Fruit I substituted for a potato was fresh and a generous portion. 
Great atmosphere and good service despite the seemingly large number of people that showed up at the same time."}
{"text":"Just held a big family dinner for 27 (kids and adults) at Venue's.  Thanks to Jesse & his team for the attentive service.  Everyone loved the food.  
We even stuck around for some of the Kareoke!   Parents kept running their kids across to the park.  Couldn't have been better!!  

Thanks Katherine, Jesse and all for making our evening special!  
Melody"}
{"text":"I stopped in after getting my hair done to have a glass of wine and a snack. Wine and draft beer selection was amazing! But what I really want to tell you about is the staff! An older gentleman walked in that all the staff knew. They helped him to his seat and as I am watching the interaction with the staff and this gentleman, my heart gets so full it brings tears to my eyes! You see this man can't hear, came in on his scooter and barely remembers yesterday. But what he does remember is being a Korean War veteran and all the wonderful people in this restaurant! Rob the bartender, Thank You!"}
{"text":"In October 2013 my then boyfriend and I drove out to Venues for a romantic date night of wonderful atmosphere and food.  Venues had both.  At the end of the meal he proposed!  We were delighted that the staff (who were in on it) made the night so special.  Fast forward 18 months and after our destination wedding we returned to Venues to host a special party for close friends.  The private room upstairs was the perfect location.  We worked with Celine and Catherine to create the perfect menu.  It was a magical evening.  The staff was amazing and attentive.  The food was off the charts amazing.  We could not have asked for a better experience.  If you want a romantic, non-rushed, dining experience this is a great place to go.  The private room is worth organizing a large event!  Thanks to everyone at Venues.  We hope to celebrate many anniversaries and special dinners there in the years to come."}
{"text":"For breakfast on Saturday mornings, Venues is the place to be!  Full buffet or order off the menu.  Great staff and nice atmosphere.  Car buffs will enjoy the many specialty cars driven to the \"show\" on Saturdays and displayed in front.  Experience it once and you'll become a regular......."}
{"text":"We decided to try Venues based on other reviews for some beers & appetizers, and perhaps dinner.  Scratch dinner plans, as clearly serving us our beer and soup with any kind of speed or accuracy proved too challenging. Evidently there's a happy hour menu that we became only aware of when our neighbors at the bar received said menu. We only ordered soup. It took 15 minutes & they brought the wrong soup. The bartender seemed annoyed when we brought it to his attention - at who I'm not sure."}
{"text":"I had been to Venues several times over the past couple of years, and thought it was okay.  But they recently made a chef change, and now I love it!  Great atmosphere in the heart of Carefree.  If you want something a little quieter than the Cave Creek scene, Venues is a great place."}
{"text":"In the past year we have tried Venues 2 times. First time seated indoors after waiting 10 minutes with no service we left. 
Thought we would try again but to no avail. Same bad attitude, rude waitstaff no drink order. After 5 minutes and the place empty we left again. There are better choices minutes away. Try them instead."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I had the Deconstructed Tacos,  my husband had the Angus Burger and my son had the Hand Breaded Chicken Strips. The fish and steak tacos were really good.  As one other review mentioned they were not as warm as I expected,  but the flavor was terrific. My husband loved his Angus Burger and tried the house special onion rings which were AMAZING!  And last but not least,  The Chicken Strips were devoured... along with the fries which were really good as well.   Definitely a place I would visit again.   P.S. The sangria  was great too! ;-)"}
{"text":"The aforementioned \"boisterous\" bartender is one of the best things about Venues, along with the new chef and friendly staff. The salmon is some of the best I have ever tasted and is awesome atop the spinach salad for a light dinner. Eat it at the bar while chatting with the always-entertaining Christine and you will have a delicious and memorable evening."}
{"text":"We wanted to give this place a chance because the atmosphere is lovely, but after multiple visits, I must say that we will not be returning. The food is mediocre at best, and overpriced as well. Portions are small (i ordered the $14 crab cake appetizer and a bowl of vegetable soup and received 2 mushy crab cakes the size of fifty cent pieces and half a bowl of flavorless broth with literally 3 pieces of unidentifiable vegetable floating in it) My husband had pork \"albert\" which was not only a skimpy portion, but so tough he could hardly cut through it. My mother in law had the fish and chips, which she said she wouldn't ever order again.
My advice-go for a cocktail, but go elsewhere for dinner!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and we were disappointed by the food and the service. There were 5 people working there and about 10 in the restaurant and It took them almost 20 minutes to get the TV's on the Rose Bowl (instead of month-old reruns of Auburn Alabama).

French onion soup came out and was cold and disgusting. Almost every item we received came missing something or with the wrong side we ordered. The waitress didn't apologize for this but did bring us the items that were supposed to come with the food.

My salmon sandwich was ok. The menu said it was wild but it sure didn't look wild given the white-pink color of it. I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Service: Although a bit slow, the staff was very pleasant.

Facilities: The restaurant was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. The patio seating was a positive experience. (Noticed it was pet friendly).

Food: The Bluemoon draft beer, served with an orange wedge, was refreshing. Can't recommend the beet salad. Contained about a tablespoon of beets, and was served with a fried, dry puck of tasteless cheese. The fish and chips were nothing to brag about, but not objectionable either."}
{"text":"We stopped by after spending the evening enjoying the Enchanted Pumpkin Garden in Carefree. What a great place!! We sat outside and had the best service ever! I had Ahi and my spouse had Short Ribs with wasabi mashed potatoes and outstanding wine. Such a great evening!! We r now regulars!!"}
{"text":"We love dining in Carefree/Cave Creek because it's close to home.  Some restaurants are good; others just mediocre-to-poor.  Unfortunately, Venues falls into the latter category.  

We gave this restaurant two tries -- on Christmas Eve both this year and last -- which also happens to be our wedding anniversary.  Both times the food was cold, some dishes not thoroughly cooked, small portions, lackluster taste and inattentive service.  We waited unnecessarily long times for our server throughout the entire night -- and the restaurant was not busy at all.  (To be fair, we mentioned the cold food to our server and she promptly offered to take the food back.  But, we declined.  After all, who wants an expensive meal microwaved?) 

Also, why do restaurants have to change their menu for holidays?  I'm assuming it's to squeeze more money from patrons (since it seems the prices always go and the quality down).

Anyway, we're finally going to cross this restaurant off our list.  It's way over-priced for the quality of the food, atmosphere and service.  Very disappointed our special occasions  turned out so crummy."}
{"text":"I think this is a great location but I am not impressed with the food or drink. I ordered some bbq sliders and I they tasted exactly like lloyds bbq in a bucket from Safeway. Not a great deal and their beer selection is tiny. This place could be something special but sadly I will pass on going here again. It's a shame because they have a nice patio out front and the interior is nice as well."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible.  I found a hair in my meal and the wait staff acted like I was lying.  The service is slow and the whole staff is arrogant.

DO NOT eat there."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it!  Great service, great food and great atmosphere.  I would highly recommend it!  Looking forward to returning :)"}
{"text":"Despite not great reviews decided to give it a shot, we had a merlot and a margarita - neither drink was good. So instead of ordering dinner as we had planned, noting the quality of the drinks and reviews, we decided to first try an appetizer, bruschetta and see how that went - unfortunately it did not go well. This was $12.95 so thought it would be somewhat substantial - it was just 4 slices of a baguette with the usual tomato type of topping.  Unimpressed we let our waitress know and the manager then came over, she was not too friendly and did confirm 4 slices is what you get for $12.95 (the waitress had thought we got the Happy Hour size).  She agreed to reduce the price to $9.95 but when we got the bill however I noticed the Margarita had $4 extra dollars tacked on it; this was rectified as soon as we mentioned it. Won't be back, it's a shame as really nice looking place inside."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Highly avoidable. After a 25 min wait we waited another 25 min to be waited on. The food was crap. Even the coke was flat and they charged after I sent it back. Awful!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting on a trip from NYC, driving up easy street.. we came upon Venues Cafe. From the outside, the patio area is very inviting but we decided to escape the AZ heat and sit inside. The interior is beautiful, accented by a stone wall and wonderful paintings from local galleries. I love the hammered copper topped tables!

I had a organic IPA from a brewery in Colorado I believe and my girlfriend had a cocktail from the bar. We started with the mahi-mahi tacos, which were delicious. For entrees, she had the mussell and clam linguine which she raved about! I enjoyed the all the extra seafood! I had the bone-in pork chop with apple chutney, it was expertly cooked and jucier than any chop i've had before! Delicious food overall, complimented by friendly and attentive servers. 

On our next trip to Cave Creek/Carefree, we will definitely return to drink and dine at Venues!"}
{"text":"Out for a drive out of the Valley and happened to end up in Carefree.  We drove to the Sundial, and around the plaza, and saw Venues.  Very welcoming patio, and interior was very nice.  Loved the art and the rock wall behind the bar.  We had never been here, nor read anything on Yelp prior to our visit.  We had the calamari, which was quite tasty, lightly breaded but not chewy or falling apart.  We shared an order of the Happy Hour beef sliders and the Hummus Trio.  The food was very good, everything was warm and flavorful.  For Happy Hour portions, we both got very sated.  The waitress was personable, and nothing took forever to get to us, as some of the previous reviews stated.  All in all, we plan to go back for dinner some evening."}
{"text":"A splendid dinner in a neat place!  Chef Celine is so sweet and gracious and helpful, and dinner was so good that we were sorry when the evening was over!

Celine does a really neat variation on a Caprese:  Tomatoes, basil, and balsamic reduction, as usual, but the Mozzarella is herb-coated and grilled.  Great.  My Chicken Schnitzel and my wife's Haddock were perfect.

Take the drive to Carefree - it's worth it."}
{"text":"Worth a visit!  ALWAYS start off with their Manhattan, it is perfection!

 I dream about their Hanger steak with fries. It is not too large, but a delicious cut of meat. I always finish with their cheesecake .

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went here with a YELP deal a while ago.  It was nice.  The food was good, a bit pricey, but good.  Small portions.  Was there for lunch on a Saturday and it was dead so maybe this is more of a dinner hot spot.  The restaurant is very pretty inside.  I will need to check out for dinner."}
{"text":"The Sundial area in Carefree really closes up in the summer months. Some restaurants and shops just shut down until Fall. Gladly, while up in the area today, Venues Cafe was open for business. When we walked into the cool restaurant, it was a relief from the heat outside. However, it's a tad bit dark for my liking. My dad and I needed light for our menues. 

He had the BLT which garnered great reviews from him. He also enjoyed his crunchy sweet potato fries.  I had the chicken salad, sans bread, which they so kindly put on a bed of Spring greens. The chicken salad had celery and craisins in it. It was quite tasty and the chicken was moist which meant not too much mayonnaise...just the way I like it.

Sadly there were only us in the restaurant...but hoping that just means it's summer.  

FYI...Saturday mornings they do get a bunch of people with vintage cars that come up there. I have been there before and had an opportunity to check them out...cool!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible for the price.  I ordered the MahiMahi taco's and my husband ordered the Jumbo Sea Scallops.  The fish tacos, had hardly any fish and the fish that was on it,  tasted very old and fishy, ( freezerburn) ( it was not fresh fish)YUCK!. The jumbo Sea Scallops were rubbery and not very jumbo. That order took almost 40 minutes to get and it wasn't very busy.  They charged us an additional $2.50 to split a wedge salad that already cost $9.95. We sent back our food and ordered a hamburger and split that and they charged us an additional $ 2. 50 to cut a hamburger in half, and the waitress stated I could have a side with the hamburger, I ordered a side salad ( We don't eat carbs, so I didn't order the fries) it was an additional $ 2.00 upcharge. At no point in time did the waitress ever tell us about any of the split plate fees or upcharges.  So for a split hamburger, a split wedge salad and 2 waters, we paid $29.12. What a rip off!! and we sat there for almost 2 hours."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Yes the service is a touch slow, but once you know that... Grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere. Every member of the staff was so kind, it was like we were at a friends house for dinner. My hubby can be a touch picky, and they asked a few times exactly how he wanted his food to make sure it was right. He had the chicken Alfredo, which he said was great. I had a lovely glass of wine and the seafood mixture (can't remember the exact name) it was amaze balls!  We will be back... And often. So glad we found this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I recommend. We had a large group event and retained a portion of the restaurant in advance. We had a limited menu which we agreed to ahead of time. I had the wild salmon sandwich with avocado on perfectly toasted  and tender Cabatta bread and a fresh spring side salad. Food was made to order fabulous and hot. Service was attentive and genuine. The owner Kathy very accommodating and friendly. We were there in the afternoon. Nice cozy atmosphere not a large place. Full service bar.  Restrooms clean."}
{"text":"Super fun Sunday night Karaoke.  Always fun always yummy!! Great for lunch, happy hour and dinner.  Welcoming atmosphere, dog and family friendly, dates or friends get together. New menu has super fun seasonal delights. Deviled eggs with bacon jam!! Thanksgiving sliders! The bar is really diverse with a true mixologist! Italian digestives and classic cocktails. Very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. Anytime is a great time to visit Venues."}
{"text":"Great little resturant. Food was excellent if your ever up this way be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Quick and easy place to grab a bite in carefree. Nice staff, good service, good food! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food at Venues is very underwhelming. Our food was very inconsistent... either extremely salty or not enough and a tuna melt that wasn't warm. The service was good, however, and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Keep coming here and the food is fantastic. Keep up the good work venues. The filet is to drool over."}
{"text":"We just found our new favorite restuarant. Had an incredible meal (my husband enjoyed the pasta special of linguini and clams and I had the ciopinno), enjoy a really pleasant atmosphere, was treated to great service from Lorraine, and they even had Magners hard cider at the bar!  We will definitely be back to enjoy this truly wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Caution: As of November 2012, Venues Cafe does not participate in Maricopa Co. Envtl. Services restaurant grading system. 

I am truly surprised by the delightful experience at Venues Cafe this evening.  Surprised because a place this good and comfortable and sophisticated has never seen its like up here in the Desert Foothills.  And, truth be told, is quite rare elsewhere in the Valley.  But 'round these parts it's the antidote to buckets of cowboy grub!

We started with a high quality, \"clean\" shrimp cocktail.  Next, spinach salad ordered with bleu cheese dressing was perfect -- tossed with the exact right amount of a delicious but not obnoxious (read: not sweet or goopy) dressing.  Entree:  Perhaps the best salmon I've ever tasted (get it cooked medium rare!)  This included APPROPRIATELY SIZED portions of mashed potatoes and broccolini.  No voluminous portions here, thank you very much, just the perfect amount to make you want ... dessert!  Actually the strawberry shortcake was a disappointment as it was basically a nothing-spectacular cake with strawberry-ish stuff between the layers.  But not a single real strawberry, even for garnish!  Bad form.  But the warm, spicy and gooey bread pudding was dee-lish and certainly re-orderable.

The environs are an instantly comfortable, warm wood feel and the gifted live singer / guitarist, Dan Emrey, was so gratefully at a perfect volume so I never had to strain to hear my friends speak, nor did I have to raise my voice in order to be heard.  Whad'ya know?  A live musician who actually contributed to the evening rather than hogging the entire acoustic space.  

\"Bravo\" to Dan and \"well done\" to Katherine and staff."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying this is the first review I've written, but not the first time I've dined out. 

This dining experience was one of the worst if not the worst in my life. 

My mother, children and I went in for lunch yesterday after walking the art fair. After looking over the menu we decided to try it. We waited for an outdoor table to clear off for 25 minutes. Finally asking someone who explained she worked in the kitchen, so she didn't do that. I may not work in the restaurant industry, but I do know that businesses should work together as a team, ESPECIALLY in front of customers. 

We finally were seated and after another 25 mins we got water in a to-go cup. I was curious as to why we didn't get glasses like other patrons, but then I realized our waitress was lazy! She figured if she brought my 2 year old's water in a plastic cup she could be lazy with me. 

Finally, we get around to ordering. After being very specific about our orders( my mom and I suffer allergies) we received our meal. Rather my 2year old and I received our meal. My moms was missing half of what she ordered. There was no regard to our allergies and our proteins were swimming(appropriate since we ordered fish) in butter and oil. When they brought my 2 year olds, they asked if she needed utensils. I said\"no it's ok. She'll eat like a savage\" they brought her a plastic fork and I had to ask for a real set up for her. 

Food was fair. Misleading at best. It took another 20 minutes to get the check and 4 times of asking for a to-go box. 

Apparently yesterday their internet went down so they couldn't get the orders to the kitchen. I hate to say this because I'm fair young but try old school, you know, write it out. Have a backup an for when this kind of thing happens. 

Overall...this was a horrific lunch. The staff was rude and inattentive, especially the hostess. 

Next time I head that way, I'll be sure to find a different restaurant. And I suggest you do too!"}
{"text":"Although me and my husband are new to the Carefree area there was nothing carefree about venues. Now I appreciate attentive service just as much as anyone else. However I don't like seeing multiple people rush up to me as if I'm royalty. In passing I mention that it's been months since I was there. At the time an older man named Al was managing. When my husband asked him what he did he responded, \"Im the janitor\". Fair enough, except he was openly snapping at other servers. Nothing is worse then hearing a manager snap at a server for something like ice water. I thought this was supposed to be a casual american bistro? After taking us to our table he proceeded to talk about his real estate company. He must have talked for five minutes, acting the whole time like we had payed to hear him boast. My husbands brother and many other people have lost their homes, so the last thing we want to hear is someone bragging on about their recent foreclosure acquisitions. Not classy, and it seemed like he had been drinking because he was talking rapidly and was sometimes slurring his words. Managers and servers should never continue to talk to their guest once they have been served. Too bad because the butter lettuce appetizer salad was one of the best we've had had in recent memory.  Just when we were about to ask him to leave, a server asked him they needed help. When asking him we could see visible anger flash through his eyes. After finally leaving we could at least enjoy the main meal. I only mention all this because this one person managed to ruin what could have been a very romantic meal. My husbands Mustard Champagne Sauce that accompanied the salmon was lovely. My Lemon Risotto could have had a little more zip to it, but overall I liked it. Although the food was a bit safe we couldn't help but really like it. Would give the restaurant fours stars if it wasn't for the manager. Too bad. Any server who works through that deserves to be tipped."}
{"text":"Nice meal with great friends recently on a Sat. night.  Although I was nervous making a last minute reservation here, having seen bad reviews about service and noise, none of those were issues for us.  Our group of 8 were seated immediately and drink orders taken promptly.  I guess it was strange that the server (different than the person that took our drink order) went to the \"kids\" side of the table to serve our alcohol drinks to the 16-18 yr olds??!  Food was all very good quality, and considering it was high season in Carefree, we found the prices to be reasonable.  Loved the salads and apps, only \"bad\" meal was the kids buttered noodles--dried and fried (yuck). Delicious chocolate cake to end our yummy meal!"}
{"text":"We have been to Venues multiple times and always had excellent service, drinks and food. We've had some of the same issues as Stephanie D in the prevoius post where we feel we can get subpar service at other restaurants because we're young... not with this place! We would usually go very late and the owner always comes by and chats with us while drinking his own glass of wine. It is a very relaxed and wonderful place. My husband and I are always looking for small, local restaurants and wine places to explore that does not have the usual pretentious Scottsdale crowds. This place has great ambiance without coming off uptight. Plus they have great live music every time we've been there.  I will continue to frequent this place!

Apparently they have Saturday morning car shows and breakfast that my husband is planning on attending as well. I like the fact that they have bottomless house wine specials for $10...sweet!"}
{"text":"It was my family's and I first time at the Cafe tonight. We originally came to the area for Enchanted Pumpkin Garden show and we were so impressed! The pumpkins were amazing and the weather and scenery really made us want to stick around the area and have dinner. So, we found the Venues Cafe where we decided to give a try.

The noise level was appropriate, it wasn't too crowded for 5 o'clock Friday late afternoon. The hosts were friendly. We sat outside to enjoy to weather. We ordered off the happy hour menu. We ordered some sliders, calamari, chicken tenders (for the kids), and glass of cabaret for my husband. We waited about 20-30 minutes for our food (it was still day time). When our food finally came, everything came without the calamari. I thought it needed more time but time passed, our waitress never checked up on us. We even asked another server to get our waitress and she still took another 20 minutes to get to us. I wanted to order more food because the sliders were good but because I was so disappointed in our service, I was no longer hungry. In addition, when we told her we never got our calamari, she said \"really?\" and was looking around our table as if we ate it and said we never received it. A simple, \"sorry\" would have been sufficient. By the time we left and still hungry it was already dark out. 

I think the sliders and atmosphere is nice but the customer service is less than satisfactory."}
{"text":"Overall good experience.  Food was very generous and tasty.  However, Came in for weekend brunch - supposed to serve until 2pm but cut off at 1pm as we walked in after driving 35 mins specifically for brunch.  Cute place.  Good mixed menu.  Comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"This review starts with the overpriced (even if they didn't burn it) $20 chicken schnitzel, clearly overcooked (dark brown), flavorless (aside from burned oil essence), difficult to cut, chew, and ...digest. 

On seeing my partially touched plate our waitress asked if I had declared defeat (I had). Agreeing that it didn't look right, and mentioning that ANOTHER customer had just said the same thing, and that the cook said they 'kept coming out too dark' she valiantly whisked my plate away as if to rescue me from it - so I'm thinking she's doing something to make it right- I hadn't asked for a replacement or a redo though. Instead I watched my significant other finish eating without food in front of me. Finally she came back grumbling with the check and said she couldn't do anything about it and exasperatedly says \"forget about the tip.\" Such a weird awkward way to make your customer feel. (I still did tip, and paid for all the food!) but left there feeling weird with burned chicken taste in my mouth and went down the street for a drink to rinse the bad experience out. 

The food here is fairly mediocre across the board based on several visits. They do reasonably better for brunch, and I would say they should stick to that EXCLUSIVELY. Don't waste your money on dinner here with so many better options nearby."}
{"text":"I went here with my family after going to the Carefree Christmas craft fair and before the parade. It was a very busy night and seemed that no one that worked there could handle the rush. At one point while waiting for a few of our guests to arrive,  a waitress (not ours) came and took the appetizer plates that were in the empty seats and gave them to another table, without asking or saying anything to us. Not only was this rude but completely unsanitary to take something of one person table and give it to another without cleaning it! I ordered the chicken ceaser wrap and asked for no dressing but was told on special event nights there are no changes at all to the menu. Really? It doesn't seem difficult to not put dressing on my wrap. In the end,  the waitress told the kitchen it was due to a food allergy so they accommodated me, which was nice. The chicken was horrible and tasted like it was coated in salt. Overall it took 2 hours for 6 of us to eat because things were so slow. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but the service was terrible.  We waited about an hour for our food.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich which was suppose to be an over easy egg.  it was scrambled with so much cheese the grease was dripping.  I ended up eating the English muffin and bacon.  When I told the waitress, all she said was sorry and walked off.  Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a speedy dining experience, then go elsewhere. We weren't and gleefully drove the 40 miles to get here for dinner.

The staff sets the standard for personal, professional service. The dining  environment is warm, inviting, and tastefully decorated with local art.  The food is the star and worth the wait and slowing down to enjoy each and every bite.

We have been here for brunch, dinners, and even hosted a dinner party for 50 (in the private dining room upstairs) and never been disappointed.

My only hit on the place is that they apparently don't take American Express - plan appropriately to avoid some embarrassment when the check arrives."}
{"text":"We visited Venues twice in the past week, once as a walk-in for lunch, the other for dinner.  Lunch was the better experience for us.  We had the BLT wrap with fries and the chicken salad wrap with a side salad.  They were all excellent and the lunch deserve 4 stars

Dinner was mixed.  We ordered the deviled eggs with jam as a starter, and the preparation was interesting with the jam, but the deviled yolk lacked flavor and seasoning..  We shared the steak frites, and it was only OK.  The fries were excellent, again, but the steak, which was ordered as medium rare came out as rare. We should have sent it back but we didn't.  The cut was not very tender, even in it's rare condition.  The dinner deserved 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's ok, expensive, but your in the touristy part of Carefree and few and far between restaurants  here. We had the cajon green beans, decent nothing awesome. Had the fish taco's and ehhhh......I'm kicking myself for ordering them. Not good.  Drinks are pricey and the staff was ok. This place gets a solid C on the grading scale from me. Nothing great, nothing horrible."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch on a Sunday. The place was pretty empty but we enjoyed ourselves. The food was great and the service was nice. We ordered bloody Mary's and they were just ok. Watered down and flavorless to be honest. The food was a bit pricey but not unreasonable. The atmosphere is nice and the employees were friendly. It's a little off the beaten path, unless you live in carefree/cave creek, but if you are touring the area, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"The Venues Cafe is a great little spot in Cave Creek area. There are some awesome summer happy hour specials with half off all wine, beer, and cocktails! We went on a Wednesday night so not overly busy. Our server Karen was very sweet and helpful.

I had the chicken shnitzel which is breaded chicken with a sweet, jam like sauce on it with a side of whipped potatoes and sautéed vegetables. I didn't care much for the sauce but the meal with delicious regardless. 

My boyfriend ordered the special which was a seafood pasta with marinara sauce. The sauce was a perfect medium between thick and not too heavy. Needless to say, he loved it.

Our friend ordered grilled salmon with a side salad. The salmon was cooked to order and was seasoned without being overly buttery or greasy.

Overall it was a good experience and perfect location for us. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Venues a couple of days ago at noon and the place was not very full. We had a grumpy waiter that we could tell did not to be working there, no personality and did not elaborate on the menu items that we questioned him about.
I ordered the French dip but then the waiter said that they were out of it, at noon!!! WTF!
Instead of the French dip that I was so looking forward to I ordered the chicken quasadias. They were ok but the side of refried beans that came with it was so small I finished it in two spoonfuls!"}
{"text":"The whole dynamics of Venues has changed!  Carefree Station closed and they brought over most of the staff and it is crowded and noisy the original patrons of Venues have left and gone elsewhere. And a new crowd has followed from the other restaurant.  I find it to be a very odd and awkward situation......we'll see?"}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch on Saturday. The restaurant was not excessively busy. We ordered a Salad and BBQ Chicken pizza. It took over 45 minutes to get our food and that was after 30 minutes when we asked our server Shawn the status of our order. While filling glasses of water for some ladies at an adjacent table, he completely ignored us and the fact that our water was empty while we were waiting. The food was okay but not worth over $35.00 plus the wait. Watching the server, it appeared he did not want to be there.  I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here several years ago and it was ok. Tonight was the worst meal of our trip. Food was just bad. ....not seasoned, too much gravy in Cocodivan. Tasteless. And it was expensive considering it consisted of chicken and noodles. Restaurant was so warm. Maybe they don't use the Air conditioner to save money but we were hot. We will not stop here on our next trip to Carefree/Cave Creek."}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience at another Carefree restaurant, we were starving, so we ran across the street to Venues, which is usually pretty reliable.  For the first time, we had a vegetarian with us, so when we were seated (there was only one other table) I asked the bored hostess if there were vegetarian offerings.  Oh, yeah, lots, she said.  One meatless entree does not constitute lots.  Still, we were hungry enough to deal with that, but after 5 minutes we were still waiting for water.  So we left and went back to Cave Creek, where we went to a local favorite and got exceptional service and amazing food in a beautiful setting.  Why do we keep trying these restaurants in the Sundial?  They just don't care."}
{"text":"Nothing remarkable.  I don't even remember what I had for lunch (this was a few days ago)  I do remember that their version of insalata caprese uses way too much balsamic and green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Stopped into Venues Cafe on a Friday afternoon to a have a cocktail before heading out after a day in the Carefree/Cave Creek area.  This is a very cute place tucked away with a nice wine list and full bar.  The restaurant/bar area is nicely laid out with a great atmosphere and very friendly staff.  The samplings of wine that we were provided with were almost as much as you'd get when you ordered a glass!  We did not have any food so I cannot comment on that but next time we are in the area we will stop in and spend a little bit more time and order some food."}
{"text":"Mahi tacos -deelish!  Totally fun place - we loved the food and the atmosphere"}
{"text":"What a great gem of restaurant! Delicious beet salad and turkey burger for lunch today! Great service and atmosphere. My husband and I will return."}
{"text":"All around my experience can be summed up with the statement \"I won't return\". In short, food was not good, took a long time, no weekday breakfast, does not accept AMX, service was bad and for some reason staff had the atitude that it was beneath them to serve 10 Mom's with babies."}
{"text":"Catherine has been great in supporting some local fundraisers in the community and I have been to the restaurant a few times. Grilled Angus Burger, Mahi Tacos are just a couple of dishes I have enjoyed to name a few. Plus you can hang with your dog on the patio."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

I was at the Carefree Art and Wine Festival this weekend and stumbled, (literally stumbled, because wine tasting), into Venues Café.

VENUES CAFÉ 

Venues Café opened in October, 2010 and has received multiple awards for their food. It is adjacent to the Sundial and directly across from the picturesque town center park in Carefree, Arizona. Venues serves an American Bistro menu with an upscale, yet casual, dining atmosphere.  

Venues is in a beautiful building which offers an ambiance of multiple textures of brick, copper, wood and stone and invites you to want to settle in and relax. The fireplace is situated next to the well-stocked wine cellar. Venues' bar is a great place to dine, watch your favorite team play on the multiple TVs over the bar and faces their 30 foot natural rock wall. (see pics)

The Chef is Andrew Lucyshyn, an executive chef with 40 years of food and wine experience: Most recently with Sun Devil Dining since 2007 and employed at the Barrett Dining Center since 2009. He recently received the ProChef II Certification from the Culinary Institute of America (CIA), the world's premier culinary college. Chef Drew has worked in kitchens across the United States and Europe and has cooked for many celebrities and politicians. He also has been a food and wine educator for over 25 years.

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

It was almost impossible to get the bartender's attention without speaking up and creating a scene, although once acknowledged, everyone was extremely polite, just not very attentive. I even got a chance to meet the owner, Catherine Marr, who was very friendly. In their defense, the place was packed due to the festival. Luckily I had wine tasted enough to not care.

I tried the muscles, the rhubarb berry pie à la mode with a French 75, which is cognac and champagne with a twist. (see pics)

Everything was extremely delicious.

CONCLUSION 

This is a place I would hangout regularly if it was closer to my house and I will definitely be back!

{"text":"We went here for lunch because it was near an arts and wine festival we were attending.  It took FOREVER for our drink order then for our food order.  They were busy but not that busy for our table to be ignored.  The food was not that great.  I had a patty melt with fries.  I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Very pleasant evening on the patio with our kids. Food was prompt and EXCELLENT. Sweet and hot burger was fantastic and the fish and chips were the best we've ever had. Great and friendly service! Try the Blood Orange IPA (incredible!)."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, especially on Valentines Day and during the Chocolate  Festival. The owner should know to have enough staff on hand to accommodate the customers. Instead there was poor service and a long wait with only 3 servers. 

You are better off eating at the English Tea Room.   Don't waste your time at this Venue."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. There is nothing special about this place. 
The food is lack luster. There are so many other choices in the Cave Creek / Carefree area 
with more ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only do they have some of the most delicious food I have ever had the pleasure of tasting; but their happy hour was to die for too! I'd highly recommend the street tacos! Great staff, great food, great drinks at a great location! Will be recommending Venues to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"The service was so slow. The food was cold once served. It had  been sitting so long in the back before being served that the guacamole was  turning brown.  I am pretty sure I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the friendly service and the welcoming atmosphere. 
The menu is creative and offers unique options to satisfy everyones taste.
The prices were a pleasant surprise,  i felt they were reasonable given the quality of the meal. I was dissappointed however, that they didn't offer bread, even with the spaggetti dinner.  

If you are looking to enjoy a quality meal that is reasonably priced, I reccomend this restaraunt."}
{"text":"Went to arts festival and stopped at this place!! The worst of the worst of carefree!!
Ordered a blt and order of crab cakes!!
Waited 45 min and it never came out to our table!! Waitress never came out once to tell us anything, waited 5 more minutes and left this dump!!!! Dont waste your time here!!!!"}
{"text":"We were searching for someplace new and we found it! This was a wonderful surprise. We had no expectations other than we are kinda picky.  

So... We enter and find ourselves in a moody, copper table topped, rock and brick walled warm environment. The walls are adorned in local art. The music is contemporary cool easy listening.  Now for the food. WOW. I'm not easily WOWED! The eggs, onions, peppers and ham was prepared perfectly. You can taste the care and quality. Sweet onions, not white. Orange peppers, not green. Perfect chunks of ham, not yucky stuff in the ham.

It was a treat to experience great service and great food in a great space all at the same time.  Did I say GREAT? My hat is off to the chef!"}
{"text":"This was a first time for us. We came for dinner, bringing out of town guests with us. We were so disappointed! Service was soooo slow. It took 20 minutes just to get two wines and three beers and the place wasn't even crowded. Dinner took way too long to come to our table. Food was decent, that's why the two stars. It was very unnerving to see employees behind the bar drinking and then one gentleman employee came over to our table telling weird jokes..  what do you call a  constipated German. Not what you want to hear after eating dinner. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"I was really wanting to try this place for a long while for some of the things I had heard. Not living up to expectations by any means. The food was generally good and the service was OK, but was not so excited to take friends from out of town for dinner and we seemed to be the only other people besides maybe 2 tables in the whole place. In general dissapointed, but hoping maybe we came on the wrong day."}
{"text":"Fair, best way to describe! Not the most friendly place. Manager / owner at the bar two - three times and didn't even check on a single guest sitting at the bar. The bartender was not to talkative himself. They're a burger and salad place till after 4 -when they serve entrees. Not bad - it's a fair place to eat, not someplace that would be a point of destination being here for the art show was a place to eat!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is great, not sure how they can do $10 unlimited wine for ladies and stay open.    The $5 minute items are fun and have a good variety.   

I agree with MR the creepy guy should stay away from the customers.

Bring Dave back!"}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner.  The waiter was accommodating and asked the chef if we could order from the dinner menu even though it was 40 min before dinner was to start.  Certain items weren't ready but we were able to substitute for the sides that weren't quite ready.  We both ordered the short ribs and since the mashed potatoes weren't ready we were able to get the risotto or potatoes au gratin and a choice of broccolini or seasonal vegetables.  We choose the broccolini and risotto with the short ribs.  All was delivered fairly soon and looked appetizing.  The flavor was decent but the texture of the short ribs wasn't fork tender like I expected.  All the food was only luke warm not hot.  I prefer my food hot but didn't want to send it back. I would consider the decor southwest rustic and they could use a little updating.  The place was clean, the service was prompt and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Great, great place.  Ownership change made a huge difference in the quality and overall experience.  The service is very nice, the food is amazing, and the specials are really good.

Order the Chicken Shnitzel, it sounds weird, but it is one of the best things on the menu.  All of the deserts are made in house, the cobbler is my favorite.  Everything is absolutely delicious and the restaurant itself is beautiful.

Everyone must visit for a truly excellent experience."}
{"text":"I came here with friends to see Jeordie, an amazing musician (totally check her out if she's at a venue near you!). The food was ok but not great. I had the wedge with chicken. I specifically asked if the chicken was char-grilled and was told yes. It was poached and over-cooked (better than under, but still...). My friend ordered mussels and they came out good but kinda luke warm. My other friend ordered the seafood brochette and the salmon was not great - tasted very fishy. They claim it's wild.  It's impossible to get fresh wild salmon in January, so that would suggest it was frozen. When the owner came over to ask how things were, I shared my honest feedback. She graciously received my comments and thanked me. She did share that the salmon was fresh but that would suggest it wasn't wild. So either she's not clear about the freshness or the menu misrepresents the product. The real kicker for me was when I asked someone about bread for the table. I had seen many baskets brought out for other tables. When the server was explaining that bread was only served with spaghetti, a man interrupted her and basically yelled at her to bring us bread if we wanted it. He was incredibly rude to her, especially in front of customers. I shared this with the owner as well. After all my comments she thanked me for my feedback and that was it. No reflection on our bill. I was a little surprised."}
{"text":"Visited Venues for Sunday Lunch this past weekend, and since I'm on a low carb kick right now, my preference for some pasta had to wait.   So, I tried the Salmon Fillet with with Lemon Butter beurre blanc sauce, and added the seasonal veggies plus some jasmine rice.    What a great choice!   The salmon was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect combination to enhance the flavor of the Salmon.   Just the right amount.   And the veggies were cooked just right with the exact amount of seasoning I prefer, and the rice was outstanding too.   All in all, this was an excellent meal and I couldn't have been happier.   My family enjoyed a variety of burgers, always a big favorite, and I did steal a bunch of sweet potato fries from my youngest son when he wasn't looking.   
Give this place a try, the wait staff was extremely professional and I saw a lot of people seeming to be having a great time."}
{"text":"The Potato Crisps with blue cheese dip was awesome, so were the scallops.  We came late at night with only 3 other tables filled.  Unfortunately, the female bartender was a bit boisterous so we were a bit annoyed with how loud her voice was.  The atmosphere was pleasant and we wish the kitchen hadn't closed or we would have gotten dessert.  I'd return again, maybe for brunch."}
{"text":"For Father's Day we drove 45 minutes to Venues thinking it would be a delightful breakfast meal.  Their weren't many people in the restaurant  so we thought the service would be exceptional.   The service was slow and the food was not good.  When we received our food, it was almost cold and my order was wrong.  

For the  quality and cost of the food we were so disappointed.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

On the brighter side, the employees we came in contact with were very nice."}
{"text":"Biker weekend in Cave creek so decided to try this place instead of the horny toad.  Bad decision.  They weren't very busy and seated us immediately. The tables round us got reasonable service but we only saw our waiter three times : when ordering, 15 minutes after getting our food for a \" how is it\" and after waiting with wallet on the table to pay for 10 minutes

My wife ordered a salad which was good.  My sweet burger was awful: I ordered medium rare because I hate the taste of charred meat. Result was a very pink center surrounded by burned hamburger.  I would have had a much better burger at five guys or even McDonald's. Unfortunately I paid resort town prices.  Couldn't even get a water refill for less than 20 minutes. Meanwhile the others tables appear to be getting good service. Table next to us sat down 15 minutes after us but had paid their cHeck before our server even came back with ours

I wish we had gone to cave creek and waited for a table"}
{"text":"Just wasn't impressed. The menu seemed sort of meh. Nice little patio, definitely not kid-friendly though. Even the two initial servers seemed disgusted at children. Wouldn't go out of my way to return. Nachos were not on par with a place that offers that type of fare. What came out didn't even match the menu. Drink service was a bit slow for Arizona. Gotta hydrate."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been here twice, and both times it was quite good.

The place is small, but a nice place to sit and have a meal. 

The staff is friendly and more than adequate.

We first tried it on Christmas day, as it was one of the only places open. 

I had the burger, and my wife had some seafood dish that was on the menu.

The food was excellent, and well priced for a holiday. What really blew us away, however - was the cheesecake! It was amazing.

We went back a few months later and I once again had te burger, and my wife had something on the menu I don't like - but she reported it was very good.

All in all, I think this place deserves a bit better rating than it has.

I also like the art work on the walls."}
{"text":"Cute place, friendly staff and food was good. Very expensive. 10.00 for only 2 pieces of French toast and 2.95 for a cup of plain black coffee."}
{"text":"We had a lovely breakfast here this morning. Usually we will not choose the buffet but made an exception when we saw what was there and you cannot beat the price! We had delicious scrambled eggs, really delicious sausages, potatoes, fruit, toast, oatmeal and waffles with maple syrup. All of this for $9.95...including coffee.

The atmosphere was nice, the staff very attentive and friendly and they even gave us a highchair letting us know they had just wiped it down with sanitizer and it was super clean! That never happens....usually at most establishments we are handed a highchair that is in very bad shape to say the least.

A great place for breakfast. Only lost a star as I thought the coffee could be better..... but it was good enough considering all we got!"}
{"text":"In a great location right across from the Sundial in town of Carefree.  Interior is rustic/cozy, but the good news ends there.  

We sit down for brunch (at about 11:15) and the first thing the befuddled hostess plops down on our table is a wine list.  Nope, want breakfast, not wine! Waited quite awhile for the server (restaurant only had about 3 tables occupied and there were at least 2 servers working...so no excuse for the wait).  Food, when it finally arrived, was below mediocre..my \"3-egg omelet\" look like a half of an egg and was overcooked & dry to boot.  Hash browns were greasy & burnt and the english muffin came with ONE pat of butter. When I brought this to the waitress's attention and asked \"how is this possibly a 3-egg omelette...it's barely the size of my palm?\", she shrugged and said, \"Oh, I'll ask the cook if he put 3 eggs in it\" ! Duh, why are you advertising one thing and delivering the other is my question. Anyway, she then went on to bus tables, look out onto the street action, and hang around the credit card machine...clearly not interested in fixing the problem.

After waiting for about 15 minutes for her to acknowledge us (again, NOT busy in Venues), I flagged her down and explained that my meal was virtually inedible.  Cleary ticked off, she whisked my plate away and never EVEN ASKED IF SHE COULD HAVE THE ORDER RE-COOKED OR REPLACED WITH SOMETHING ELSE.  So I sat there and watched my companion finish his (also mediocre) meal.  I hope this waitress has another job...I cannot imagine patrons tip her much for the terrible attitude.  Not only was she unapologetic for this poor excuse for a meal and obviously unwilling to find out if I wanted something else, she was clearly outraged that I made ANY comment.  Too bad..I'm a local who lives here year 'round  and like to frequent the locally-owned businesses. Not this one, though.  Move along....."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Long wait time for food.  Ordered eggs Benedict.  The egg was overdone, English muffin wasn't toasted, and hash browns were undercooked.  We waited so long, I didn't bother to send it back.  When I let the waitress know, she apologized and then they offered a $2.50 discount.  One and done"}
{"text":"We have been enjoying Happy Hour at the bar on  Friday nights at Venues for some time . Gary, the bartender, always goes out of his way to provide excellent service and make sure we have an enjoyable evening.  

Tonight we invited some friends to join us so we sat at a table. Unfortunately, table service was not so good. No water refills, we had to go order our drinks at the bar. The waitress was almost rude. She gave us the feeling we were too much trouble

We will return to Venues for happy hour but probably will not try table service again.

{"text":"It was fine, we went here for Easter brunch because it was nice to take a drive out of Phoenix.  The service was ok, maybe a tad on the \"I'm ignoring you\" side but not horrible.  What was interesting about the place was the artwork on the walls was really nice.  It was from the art store a couple of doors down.  It impressed us."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch . They sat me down and I just sat there . Not a god way to do business . Nothing to drink just sitting until I hailed a server over . He's very nice and helped me . Hostess must not have told anyone to help me . I'll update review if it gets any better .
I'm updating this review , it was written while in the cafe. I spoke to the lady at the front about this problem and she explained what happened to the computer and offered to pay for my lunch. She was very nice about it, I declined her buying because I did order & eat my meal so I didn't feel she needed to pay for it. It was very nice of her to offer though. Things happen beyond someones control sometimes and I do understand."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant probably 10 times, so I'm confident my overall assessment is accurate. The location is fabulous. The decor is amazing. The food is very good.

The issue with Venues? The service. Each time I go, it takes 40 minutes for food to arrive. Part of the wait is the 15-ish minutes it takes for a waitress to even come to the table. I'm not sure why this is because there are always plenty of employees walking around?

If the owners would fix the 'time/service' issues, this would be an overall fabulous restaurant."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this fantastic restaurant.  We we there on a Saturday night and got seated right away. Great food, cocktails and music. The wait staff was very responsive and polite. The owners came by and were sincerely interested in how we were enjoying ourselves.   I had the Lobster Mac and cheese, and my wife ha the halibut.  All were fantastic. 

We are from out of town...it's a must go!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is pleasant. I have found the food to be sub-par for the area and price. Good location."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee. Two hot coffees and one with some Kahlua. Yummy. Great music in the background. Nice music in the background, very comfy place, with fireplace. When we were leaving a gentleman came up and started a conversation then proceeded to give us a tour of the upstairs that I was unaware of. Turns out there is another half upstairs. It is a art gallery/meeting room of sorts. Very tastefully decorated with a variety of pieces. There is more to be done and looks like a great spot to hold a gathering. Its full service upstairs."}
{"text":"Dinner for 4 included burger lobster trout.  Each & every bite was scrumptious   Thank you Catherine for bringing Chef Eugene to your kitchen. We can't wait to return   Happy hour is great too"}
{"text":"I should have noted the 3 stars from others...my Ahi Tuna was ruined and the service was fair at best so slow and the place was pretty empty...skip this place"}
{"text":"I walked in this morning wanting to give this place four or even five stars...I love Carefree and Cave Creek and prefer to support and patronize independent restaurants.

After reading the reviews and meeting the owners years ago, I was excited to finally give them a chance. They seemed like hard working people, eager to please with their new restaurant adventure.

Before leaving for the restaurant, I had viewed the menu online and had already made up my mind on what I wanted. My friend had the pear salad which was very nice, colorful and light.

I was disappointed with my smoked Salmon eggs benedict though. The hollandaise sauce was a major disappointment...I don't see what is so famous about it as the menu states...i can tell the difference between a freshly made hollandaise and one from a mix...and that one served on my eggs this morning neither had the look or the taste or the look of  a fresh hollandaise (shiny bright yellow...vs pale and somber)

The restaurant wasn't busy...there were a few tables seated however there was only one very friendly waitress.

Then the order came out wrong...even though I repeated myself to confirm that yes indeed it was the smoked salmon eggs benedict that I wanted...but a breakfast burrito came out instead...maybe i should have settled for that...who ate the mistake burrito ? Then the side of potatoes was barely warm...and the side of fruit was so unappealing that I did not even touch it. The second attempt was much better.

Again, I really wanted to give Venues a four or five star.I had noticed that Catherine had tried to address some of the online concerns with regards to food and service issues in the past. I thought that was admirable to at least show a certain level of care.

However in between a couple of service issues and the quality of the food does not warrant me to say that I am either a fan or this is as good as it gets. I am glad I gave them a first try but really you have failed to wow me."}
{"text":"Service is SLOW.  Food below average.  Waitress was ditzy and did not seem to care."}
{"text":"Bummer!  So cool, awesome location but definitely lacking in good management!  As a previous restaurant owner and sister to two 5-star check, I KNOW the food and location has the potential to be great and why they are accepting this level of mediocrity is beyond my comprehension!  This place could be a gold mind and if whatever their revenue is defined as a good -  it can be double!  Call me....."}
{"text":"It had very tasty food and having the yelp deal made it even sweeter ! We were there for an art & chocolate festival great place to eat & shop I will be returning again very soon the burgers were great service was a bit slow we had to seat ourselves and there was no wait which was good , the decore was cool and they had art for sale on the walls if in the area give it a try : )"}
{"text":"The ambiance  makes you feel welcome and relaxed. Service is pleasant. The menu is standard fair of salads, appetizers, sandwiches and special dishes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited over 1 hour 20 min for food.  They got part of our order wrong and gave only 25% of the 1 item which they got 90% wrong.  Had to get up to get my own silverware. Had to ask for water.  Ordered drinks but did not get them until 45 min into meal.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"From the outside, it seems like you would really like this restaurant.  The decor is pleasant and inviting.  However, once you step inside your opinion will change.  It took almost 7 minutes before someone told us to sit wherever we wanted and didn't even offer us menus - we went and got those ourselves (this was after standing there staring at 2 people that work there - with zero response - as if we weren't even there! There was even a server EATING and talking to people at the bar area).  The people waiting behind us actually left because they were tired of waiting... they had a big group, too (in hindsight, they were smarter than us!). Secondly, it took about 10 more minutes before someone asked us if we wanted something to drink.  Mind you - if I didn't have anything to do and could just sit around all day, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but I have a one year old that will only sit for about 30-40 mins without melting down (sufficient time to eat lunch, btw).  I wanted to make a simple change on one of the sandwiches, but the waitress seemed flustered and confused.  The sandwich arrived and it was pretty delicious, I have to say.  There was something weird about the fries, though ($2 extra for fries, btw).  Maybe they are fresh made or something, but they had a raw-ish taste to them. I would skip the fries if you actually want to try this place.  My other daughter had the veggie sandwich, which she also said was very good.  The food is good, but the service is terrible.  Nobody checked on us one single time... even though they were wandering around.  To top things off during our dining experience, there were several dogs barking very loudly - I thought they were out in the courtyard - turns out they were in the restaurant office!  The owner or server person actually walked them THROUGH the restaurant twice!! I love dogs, don't get me wrong - but, I DON'T love dogs in restaurants where my food is prepared and served.  So, at this point we just wanted to get the check and leave.  When the check arrived, they had the nerve to charge me $1 extra for swiss cheese - which was SUPPOSED to be on my sandwich anyhow!!! I asked the server about this and she said the Chef told her to do that -- that sounds odd to me.  She came back and said that they \"obviously comped me the $1 for the cheese\" - wow, like they're doing me a favor by not charging me for something that was supposed to be on the sandwich in the first place??!!!  Wow... I will never go back and I will (clearly) never recommend anyone frequent this restaurant.  What a joke!  For a new place, they should be doing everything they can to try to please people so they come back and tell their friends.  Carefree is a small town and they should know better.  Shame on you, Venues!"}
{"text":"Update - happy hour is a bit silly with $1 off beers.  Similar with wine, signature cocktails (the $11 ones).   Might as well not have a happy hour if that's the way you're going to play it.  

Pleasant experience here on a rather calm evening.  Service was exceptional with Joe M., and our food choices were good.  Prices were on par with alternatives in the area, though I wished there were more beer options on draft.  Wine selection seemed rather diverse.  Parking was good.  Nice, clean atmosphere.  Only significant negative was the dog-friendly policy for the outside seating.  Not all of us are \"dog people\", and yet would like to enjoy the outdoor seating during nice weather months.  I have to tolerate neighborly dog issues at home so when I go out this is one of the very things I do not want to have to deal with at all.  I'd rather deal with annoying children of other patrons at a nice restaurant than dogs."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, the service was OK. The woman who seated us seemed annoyed that I didn't order alcohol like my husband did. There are also 3 pages of alcohol to 1 page of food choices. It's not a bad place but it wasn't amazing either."}
