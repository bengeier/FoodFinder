{"text":"Fried rice was okay, postickers were good.  Their general tso's was not even remotely spicey.  Was not at all impressed."}
{"text":"Had several items delivered. It was bad. The poo poo platter seemed like it was made hours before and the items were sitting under a heat lamp. The beef dish(think it was Mongolian beef) was nothing but onion. Literally jus pile of onion w bland sauce and cpl strips of beef. Its so close to my house but I will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here a few times. I even order through Eat24.com, pay with PayPal, and pick up my order. I have yet to have them deliver to me because I am so close to this place. Their food is great. It doesn't taste like fast food Chinese food. Tastes homemade which is why I keep going to this place. I like the Orange chicken and egg drop soup. The teriyaki chicken has huge pieces. Making me thinking about it, I want to eat there now lol I actually feel full and stay full after eating here!"}
{"text":"First of all I have to say, this place has Great staffs, great service, and most importantly great food. I love eating at Family owned local business restaurant. I stopped in the other day and ordered my favor dish - Walnut shrimp. The shrimp is so crispy from the outside and with mayo sauce on top. It was so Delicoussss. And don't forget the Thai style iced tea as well. Probably once of the best I had in town. Freshly brewed tea.  I definitely recommend this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to eat at Asian restaurants at least a few times a month. We were told by a friend that we should try this restaurant. We ordered, I got the Almond Chicken and he ordered the Mongolian Beef, with egg drop soup and egg rolls. We both found the food to be delicious, portion size were great and we received excellent service. Since our visit, my husband now regularly eats lunch here, the prices are reasonable and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"WOW, Wonderfully fast and tasty. Seemed like they were at the door before I put the phone down. The quantity and quality was there, I Found a gem. We ordered Family Meal A, and we loved it."}
{"text":"this place has the worst customer service and food! when i called to get a refund the owner hung up on me! he refused to take back or correct!!! food was horrible!!! it was so dry i gagged!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Love the Crab Puffs and the Kung Pao Chicken is ok. The portions are very generous and my three star rate sums this place up, average."}
{"text":"This food, for lack of a better description, is AWFUL. As an American who lived in China for almost three years, I of course have a biased view based on authentic experience. However, We ordered the house fu yong and hunan beef, with potstickers as apps. Each dish was awful in its own way;the fu yong was so bland, with a rotten egg taste, and the hunan beef was underseasoned and vegetables undercooked. The potstickers tasted as though they were cooked 5 days ago, just disgusting. If you have any other option to eat anything, eat that. This food SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I tried giving this place a second chance but I just can't give it a great rating. I tried different foods this time just to see if it was a particular food item but to my dismay it was still bland and tasteless, even my fortune cookies were stale. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and literally only one pc of pineapple and three small pcs of green pepper. I couldn't taste anythings but soggy fried chicken pcs. My wonton soup was chewy and starchy tasting. I ordered here based on the four star reviews but wow I really don't know this restaurant got them. Maybe they have a new chef because the food I received the last two times deserved to be put down my waste disposal."}
{"text":"On December 29, 2013, a Lucky Kitchen delivery driver nearly bit my head off over his tip. You see, I wanted to give him a $2 tip, but he apparently wanted $3. Here's how it went down:   When my order arrived, I gave the driver exact change to cover my food. Then, I handed him a $5 bill and asked for three dollars back. Instead, the driver handed me $2, half-assed fumbled through his pockets, and said he didn't have another dollar on him. Calling his bluff, I gave the two dollars back to the driver and I took my five dollar bill back.   The driver, who usually seems very friendly, became enraged and proceeded to yell, \"So, you gonna leave me with nothing?! Over a dollar bill?! Really?!\" I explained that his tip was $2 and that if he couldn't give me proper change, I wasn't giving him an extra dollar simply because he didn't have proper change.   The driver stomped off yelling in his native tongue (probably calling me inappropriate names) and soon returned with enough money to give me the $3 I had requested.   Once I calmed down, I called Lucky Star to complain about the driver's rude behaviour. The order-taker said the owner would be away for several months. However, the order-taker took my number and promised someone would call me back. I'm still waiting for that phone call.   No wonder the driver felt so comfortable acting like a jackass... he knows he is not going to be held accountable for his actions. But that's okay, Lucky Kitchen will never get another dime from me."}
{"text":"Happened to be in town to see the Dodgers during spring training.  Alll 3 orders were horrible! !!!   The sweet and sour chicken was BLAND no taste.  They pour the sweet and spur sauce a on a plastic plate then the chicken.   The chicken chow mein, the same..no taste. the noodles were cold and they just placed the vegetables and the chicken on top of the cold noodles on a plastic plate....the beef with broccoli. ..no taste to the meat..the broccoli was over cooked and the hole meal was cold...this was jus a bad earing experience for my family and I.   DO NOT EAT HERE....BUSINESS RUN BY KIDS IN THEIR EARLY 20'S WHO ARE MORE CONCERN ABOUT THE guest not leaving the food on the table...the young lady kept asking us to make sure to take all the trash and left overs to the trash can.    Incredible!    I question all those good reviews,  perhaps they are writing some of them to make us come here.  I know I wont."}
{"text":"Food was great! And the delivery was honestly a good 20 mins! Definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese Food.. I love Lucky Kitchen Since the first time I walked in..excellent service,fantastic food and five stars Decorations.. They got crystal lights.what a good place to relax with friends.. I will rank this 7 out of 5 with my honest. Must come soon and often.."}
{"text":"Everybody else calls because they can't find my apartment, but Lucky Kitchen follows my directions and lands at my door every time.  GrubHub says it'll take 60-90 minutes, but it has never taken them more than 30.  The delivery driver isn't all that cute, but the food is pretty tasty and there's a lot of it.  I usually order 3 dishes for me, my husband, and the cats; we have lunch and dinner for 2 days.  I like the brown rice better than the white rice and the sesame chicken is de-freaking-lish."}
{"text":"I used GrubHub for the first time getting lunch delivered to my work, also 1st time trying this place. Ordering was fantastically simple online, never even spoke with anyone, and my food was delivered in only 20 minutes exactly as I ordered it and super hot/fresh. I give this place an above average rating for what I ordered: 1. House Noodle Soup This was a good portion of noodles, cabbage, bok choy, chicken & pork strips, jumbo shrimp & misc shredded veggies. It was hot & fresh tasting but the broth was bland, so I added some soy sauce and the juice from my Kung-Pao Veggies and it was really good - without the Kung-Pao sauce I wouldn't have liked it though. 2. Kung-Pao Vegetables, add extra mushrooms, medium spicy. This was delicious! I like spicy and this was perfect (I'm glad I didn't get extra spicy). Loaded & great veggie mix with broccoli, bok choy, carrots, snap peas, mushrooms, onion, bean sprouts, celery, red & green bell peppers, some other Asian veggies and whole peanuts drenched in spicy sauce. Exactly what I was craving and tasted fresh too. 3. Jumbo shrimp fried rice (I upgraded my steamed rice that came with the veggies to this for $3) This was average fried rice with decent jumbo shrimp, average being good not great (like most places). Total bill with delivery charge & 15% tip for the driver was $26. Not bad, a lot of food (I barely ate half, I'll eat the rest for dinner) and super quick accurate delivery through GrubHub. I will use them again (just have to remember to get a side of medium-spicy Kung-Pao sauce for the noodles (or just incase) if I try something else because without it I would not have liked it at all)."}
{"text":"Well this is the second time I have ordered from them in the same week so something is right! I am in love with Autumn Court however when I moved out of their delivery zone I started the search for another equally as good restaurant.  Earlier in the week my co worker and I ordered lunch from Lucky Kitchen and I was very very skeptical because I have driven pass the restaurant and it leaves a lot to be desired, anyway this is not a decor review. I ordered the cashew chicken combo and it was amazing! Egg Roll was perfect! Although the crab puff was a little light on the filling, I still found it very tasty not greasy at all...  I will for sure be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how did the negative comments happen. Personally, I love ordering foods form lucky kitchen!!! The fastest delivery that I have never seen before !"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this fine, authentic cuisine offered in a city that does not have many varieties for Chinese food.. The service was efficient, friendly and good.  I ordered the House Lo Mien and was very satisfied by its savory taste. I don't understand why this restaurant had received so many negative reviews."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered it was fantastic, the best sweet and sour I had in a long, long time. Ever since then, they've sucked!  We've tried their hunan chicken, kung pao chicken, sweet and sour pork, and their beef and broccoli. Every dish was a disappointment. I tried them again and again 'cause I kept thinking, \"Well, maybe the last time was a fluke and it will be better this time.\" I was wrong.  Their potstickers are meh, and their dumplings were undercooked. I detested their beef skewers, they had no flavor.  The only good thing is that the delivery guy is always friendly and asks how your day is going, even if you don't tip much, he's always friendly. I wish I had more delivery people like him!  I'm not going to order from here any more. I'll find better chinese somewhere else."}
{"text":"Lucky kitchen may look like a dive on the outside but inside it is clean and the food is amazing, just as a real Chinese person would eat. Yummy. And the prices are unbeatable epically for the portion size."}
{"text":"Super yummy food always fresh and well made. Staff is very friendly courteous and fast. Definitely my go to spot."}
{"text":"Their food is fresh and yummy. Highly recommend this restaurant.  Delivery is very fast."}
{"text":"Classic Chinese food delivery. We order from Eat24 online. Our order is always delivered at lightning speed.   Crab puffs - awesome. War Wonton soup - YES! Get the sauce on the side for the orange chicken if you like the batter crispy.   It's always a fun time when we order from here. Chinese delivery, movies at home, couch snuggling and feasting."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because the hunan chicken was awesome.  I ordered online and wait time said 55 minutes.  Amazingly, they were here within about 15 minutes.  I loved the filling in the crab puffs and the pot stickers were full of flavor.  The only drawback with the lo main noodles, they were pretty sticky.  Overall, it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Food arrived very quickly and was inexpensively priced. The crab rangoons were crispy and easy to eat, but the beef was a bit too salty and the egg foo yung was terrible. They added rice to it, which is not traditional, and made it super doughy and gross and dense. I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Pros - SUPER FAST DELIVERY, convenient online ordering  Cons - Flavorless, bland, and uninspired.   We recently moved back into town and need to find a Chinese takeout place. Lucky Kitchen is close and they deliver. Delivery was super fast and the had great choices. The driver came and swiped my card at the door!   We were super hopeful that the food would be great and we'd have a new go to. We were sadly disappointed. The general cho's chicken was spicy, but it that's it. Plus there was maybe 12-14 piece of chicken in the actual box. The lo mein tasted like a box of ramen noodles and it looked like it too. The cashew chicken should be renamed Chinese boiled chicken with 6 cashews on top.   And please, do not order the potstickers. The main reason you get potstickers is the sweet and salty brown sauce. The potstickers here were tasteless and the sauce was a gloppy mess of 5-spice with some soy sauce.   Alas we keep looking..."}
{"text":"We ordered orange chicken, egg rolls, crab puffs, veggie lo mein, and wonton soup. Sadly the wonton soup was the best of all it and it's just wonton and cabbage. The lo mein was very bland. The orange chicken was soft for some reason and didn't have any crunch to it. The egg rolls were super greasy. And the crab puffs didn't really have any cream cheese or crab in them. The only positive thing and why it got 2 stars was because it was cheap and it delivered."}
{"text":"Great Chinese cuisine, not the best.. but very good. The staff is always very friendly, upon entering the establishment you are always greeted by ALL of the front house staff.       I haven't eaten in house.. I always order to go. I usually stop by on my way home from work so I just want to get home, get cleaned up and eat. They are quick to prepare the order ( don't know if this good or bad, either its pre-made and quick heat or they are just that good. Will never know) Usually without a line ahead of me I'm in and out within 10 minutes  Not sure why other people are complaining about this place.. You get what your pay for. Its no 5 star restaurant. With that being said, being in the neighborhood its in its a far better choice than some other places along this stretch of road.   For about twenty dollars you can feed 3 people. Or a family of four to five under thirty dollars, and not have to worry about getting sick. I'd soon eat here many times over than other places along this stretch of Indian school rd."}
{"text":"This must be the former lucky kitchen. I ordered my meal, got allot for a little money. And they were here under 20 minutes. Food was hot, and delicious. As long as they keep the same recipes, I don't care what their name is!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple weeks ago, but was too preoccupied with being sick after eating here to leave a review. The food is awful. I don't know how else to describe it... brown? Like, everything was the same shade of brown. Mongolian chicken, brown with lots of onions, a little meat. General Tso's chicken, brown and flavorless, except for the soy sauce they buried it in. Sweet and sour chicken, brown and gross. Pretty sad when a starving toddler wouldn't touch it. Fried rice, brown. No flavor. Everything... Just dark brown. No one felt great after eating it. Two adults and 4 kids, none of whom are very picky, were starving after moving homes all day, and so much of it went into the garbage."}
{"text":"Deliver was lightening fast. I ordered a fountain drink and requested no ice, they sent me a cup half empty. I guess to compensate for the ice. I got gen Tao chicken which had virtually no flavor. Side of lo mein, totally dry, no flavor and I would bet money is actually spaghetti. Then I bit into an egg roll and found a long piece of hair.... Never again. Gross."}
{"text":"Had 3 diffrent plates orded to go..3 lacked flavor, freshness and service could have been better,guy acted like he really didnt care what I ordered or what day it was. ..lol"}
{"text":"I wanted some food delivered this evening.  And not pizza; I'm tired of pizza.  I decided to see if I could find Asian food for delivery.  Extra points if I could order online.  I went to Yelp to look for a place that A) had at least a three star rating 2) would deliver and III) allowed online ordering with credit card payment.  The first choice (best rating, closest to me) said they didn't deliver to my address.  My second choice made a new (to me) use of the Internet.  Found the place with Yelp, but when I went to place an order I got handed off to a site called Eat24.  What they did was take the order, with pull down menus for all the options (like, what kind of rice would you like?) and took the credit card information (and presumably validated it) and then passed the order on to the restaurant.  Quickie review follows. The Good:   Ordering through Eat24 was painless once I enabled Javascript.   It got delivered--I didn't have to go out on a cold and rainy night.   It was if not hot, at least warm.   There was plenty.  Enough for two people, or in my case, lunch tomorrow.   The veggies weren't overcooked.   The pot stickers were good.   It smelled good enough to get my cat's attention.  The Bad:   Delivery took a bit over an hour.   It was expensive (at least compared to pizza).  Counting tax, delivery     fee, driver tip and a few extras (more water cress, more pork in the      garlic pork) it was over $30.   It was bland.  The hot sour soup was improved when I added some Apple Cider     vinegar.  If I had some white pepper, I'd have added it too.  The brown     garlic gravy had no detectable garlic flavor.  The indifferent:   It came with a little packet that contained pouches of hot mustard and soy     sauce, a napkin, plastic knife and spoon and a fortune cookie.  I think I'm still in the market for some other place.  I'd consider Lucky Kitchen again if they were a bit more inexpensive, but my reaction to the whole deal was \"blah\", and I'd want more than that for $30."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, the chicken seems microwaved and the appetizers are meh. I've been there a few times, I live in the area and its really hard to find good Chinese food. If your looking for a quick oriental fix I'd say go for it.. otherwise look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is pretty average for a Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but when you go in the dining area itself is very nice. The hostess and other staff members were very welcoming. The food itself was nothing special. I had the Yu-chan chicken. The dish was very spicy - I nice surprise! The dish was okay, but I could tell that very poor ingredients were used in its making.  When I originally called to place my order they notified me that it would be a 50 minutes for delivery. This was very surprising because my order only included 2 dishes and I live just 5 blocks away.... I was even more surprised when I went into pick up my order and found that I was the only person there. The driver must have already been out when I called.   The menu doesn't seem to have anything enticing or unique to the restaurant. Even though it was an enjoyable dining experience, I do not see myself coming back here anytime soon. There are just so many other options in the area to try before I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"Had food delivered, and it arrived in a very reasonable amount of time. Decided on having steamed dumplings, shock were good, the wonton soup, also really good. I ordered the chicken broccoli, took one bite and was disgusted. I called them to tell them that I did not like the chicken broccoli at all. The lady on the phone offered to replace it with another chicken dish,  mind you this was 15 minutes before they closed. I said no, because it was nearly 9pm,  and that I didn't want to spend all night trying to find a dish I would like. I asked for a refund for JUST the chicken broccoli, because I enjoyed everything else. The woman not only refused to give me a refund, but hung up on me as well. All because I didn't want to try to find another chicken dish and wait to have it delivered to me. I'm visiting from denver, and have to fly out early tomorrow. I don't have time to wait all night to find SOMETHING that I would be happy with for supper. If she hadn't have hung up on me, I wouldn't have written a review. But this is beyond rude. And the main dish I ordered wasn't edible by my standards. I will NEVER make the mistake of trying to eat from this place again."}
{"text":"I loved ordering from the yelp app.  Super easy!  They sent new a confirmation right away.  I have enough left over for two days of lunches! I'll be ordering again! Only $24 plus $2.00 delivery (it was worth not having to leave the house) plus tip.  Cheap and tasty!"}
{"text":"Do not order from this place! Siu Wok is 100 times better! Food is inedible or not very well prepared. Our order arrived cold! Buyer Beware! Also, check out how they have MULTIPLE listings on this site trying to circumnavigate the poor reviews!!!!"}
{"text":"After being sick for a few days, my boyfriend and I decided to order out. Using Yelp, I found Lucky Kitchen. After reading some of the reviews I decided to give it a try. The ordering process went smoothly, the gentleman on the phone was extremely helpful and told me it would be forty five minutes or less. I was a little put off by this, but less than twenty minutes later the delivery guy was at my door. I ordered the Sweet and Sour Pork and my boyfriend got the Szechwan Chicken, and both were really good. We also had the crab puffs, and I wish they had more filling, but dear lord they were good. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Since all good Chinese food places are closed on Sundays, we tried, hopeful, to have some good Chinese food from this place, and was sadly disappointed. Service was was nice and fast for delivery, which is the what the one star is for, and that is all the good things I have to say. I ordered a chicken dish, crab puffs, and a few other full dishes and all had one similarity...they were all bland and full of vegetables. The crab puffs had the smallest amount of filling inside, with a large gap of what should be full of said filling, and overall, the taste was this fried, oily, wonton wrap. The chicken dish I ordered had maybe 2 oz. of chicken, (thigh and leg meat only with fat skin still on it and this grey tint that was just unappetizing), and did I say I've never felt like more of a vegan until this meal? Because of the overwhelming amount of vegetables? (nothing against vegans or any one who diets, I eat it all). I'd love to have a Sunday Asian food restaurant I order from, and be satisfied with what I get, but this is not that place. I am only one person, but Good luck to you Lucky Kitchen in your future business."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how this place has any good reviews. It was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. We got cashew chicken, chicken Lo mein and sesame chicken. I threw it all away."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from Utah for work.  Don't have anything like this where I live.  ++ delivery .  Haven't had that in a year from another state. The Good,  got food and fast delivery.  Ordered online and it was at my room within 18 min.  Tastes good, hot, crunchy, not mushy or dry.  The bad, don't have any delivery where I live. Boo hoo for me."}
{"text":"Great delivery service. They were kind and friendly. The sweet & sour chicken was tasty too!"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and it was great! Its a quiet \"Mom and Pop\" restaurant with great lunch special prices. The Egg Drop Soup is excellent and made fresh daily.  Not a fancy place, but it's really clean. The service is excellent! The staff is extremely friendly and attentive to their their customers. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place and went there every couple of weeks or so, but they've gone cheap and removed all their customer services now in an apparent effort to save money: You have to go to the counter to get a menu, then go to the counter to order, food comes on styrofoam plates, you have to clean up your own table.    The food isn't any better and the service and experience is now much worse.  I'm definitely no longer a fan.  The food is good, but it's not not THAT good.  Heck, even Panda Express does better now!  Lost a customer with their cheapness."}
{"text":"Fried rice and crab puffs are great!  Plenty of meat, but you can add more if you wish - just ask.  And they deliver to my area.  Hurray!"}
{"text":"the food was fast clean fresh tasty,house fried rice rocked ,delivery dude was kool . i would do it again"}
{"text":"The food I ordered was not good at all  I was hoping to find a good Chinese food that delivered. But I was very disappointed with the quality of what I received. I ordered sweet and sour pork the pork was jerky texture  The orange chicken was soggy and meh in taste and lastly the lucky appetizer was over cooked the only items that were ok were the cream cheese wonton and egg roll. I won't be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Lucky is how I felt when I found Lucky Kitchen! As a Chinese food addict, I've struggled to find really good Chinese food in Phoenix and this restaurant offers exactly that! The staff is extremely friendly, welcoming, and offers excellent service. The restaurant itself could use a little remodeling inside, but they also offer delivery and pick up - So the food is really what it's all about! I highly recommend the Chicken Egg-Foo Young!"}
{"text":"My whole family ordered from here today and everything except the egg rolls everyone stated was by far the worst Chinese food they had ever had. It is pretty hard to screw up Chinese food. The delivery guy was nice though."}
{"text":"The food arrived quickly but the taste was subpar: far too salty, odd mixture and stale-tasting. I got the chow mein and the walnut shrimp; the chow mein was kind of okay though I couldn't eat it after a few bites, and the walnut shrimp was not good at all. It had an almost transparent white sauce that had a nasty after taste as well as the shrimp itself was not fully cooked and mushy. Sorry, but it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Fastest Chinese delivery in town. I love their sesame chicken and pot stickers. Had them as four stars before, but I think they deserve more than a three star average so I'm switching it to 5."}
{"text":"Super fast, super fresh, supee delicious. they deliver in my hotel room. They called me to verify my room number. Awesome!"}
{"text":"The good: super fast delivery & reasonable prices The ugly: ordered the shrimp lo mein, shrimp tasted spoiled! Never will eat from here again!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Chinese restaurant. It was quiet and the people were very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and very fair priced. I got the general tsos tofu and it was so good! My husband got the curry beef and loved it."}
{"text":"We order from Lucky Kitchen frequently and the delivery is usually 30 minutes before they say they'll be there.  Their War Wonton soup is great, and my folks love the egg drop soup too (it's not my thing).  I like the wontons with cream cheese and the egg rolls.   We have many favorite entrees: beef and broccoli as well as egg foo young. Some dishes have more onions than others and we like them so that's okay.  The teriyaki chicken is two breaded breasts sliced with sauce on the side. Yum.  The lemon chicken is okay as is the Singapore noodles.  I'm not crazy about the sweet and sour chicken or pork, and I don't order fried rice or lo mien anymore.  But I've learned what I like from there from many many orders so I am rating them five stars."}
{"text":"Being that I am originally from the east coast, Boston, to be exact, where really good authentic Chinese food exists, I am a very picky snobby critic regarding Chinese food.    This is my first experience at Lucky Kitchen and I am proud to announce that I am giving it 5 stars.  I enjoyed what I think is the best Wonton Soup in town.  Yes, Wonton Soup.  Very boring and plain Wonton Soup.  However, this soup was very rich in flavor.  The broth was a hearty seasoned broth and not bland at all.  The cabbage/lettuce was delicious and I am not a fan of cooked cabbage/lettuce.  The Wontons were small yet filling.    I also tried the Pork Fried Rice.  It reminded me of back east Pork Fried Rice.  The rice was not sticky at all.  It was fluffy and the grains were separate and firm to the bite.  Great flavor and a generous amount of pork.    I will return again for another visit and try something else, but usually when I try something new, I stick to the same thing all of the time.  Decor and restaurant interior here was very traditional Chinese Take Away, but the food made up for the boring, decor.   I dined at a competitor's restaurant last week, China Chile, and they get 2 stars.  Lucky Kitchen is now my favorite Chinese Take Away in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I retract my 5 star and give them 3. I went in and the restraint smells really wrong, and they charged me $9 for tofu fried rice.... I can't really give them more than two stars."}
{"text":"Got delivery, orange chicken w low mein and my boyfriend got the honey sesame. The food was ok if you don't like good Chinese food. I guess in particular the flavor and texture was lacking, chicken was very breaded and the noodles were all stuck together. The other reviews of people raving over the food really made me question whether they had malfunctioning tastebuds or low standards. It wasn't the worst either, but left much to be desired. Won't eat again."}
{"text":"Even though the delivery is fast the food is not consistent. The Lemon Chicken tastes artificial.  I've ordered Chicken Chow Mein several time because they use big, thick crunchy noodles. This time I received my order with thin, tasteless noodles obviously from a can. I called to complain and 2 different people yelled at me on the phone and said those are the noodles they've always used. I was interrupted several times and ended up hanging up. I will not order from them again.  Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Weird...bland...grey \"chicken\". Tasted nothing like any cashew chicken I've ever had. Now I know why the prices are cheap...it's glorified cat chow."}
{"text":"We ordered  the sweet and sour chicken. And orange chicken... the crab puffs we felt was on the small size, other then that  the food was pretty good.Princing is typical price I feel.  Delivery was extremely  fast!!  I definitely  would choose to eat here again."}
{"text":"All of it is fresh and piping hot. The egg drop soup has a good flavor, the fried items came out great and the curry is very good---spicy even if you order the mild but its yummy!!"}
{"text":"Horrible; this place deserves negative stars. I ordered orange and lemon chicken, fried rice, white rice, lo mein, fried wontons, and crab puffs. With each thing I tried it all just got worse and worse. Everything was incredibly bland. The breading on the chicken was soggy. The fried rice was literally rice and soy sauce (I was expecting things like egg, peas, carrots, etc. to be in it). The noodles were cooked fine, just boring. The fried wontons   unexpectedly had no filling. Eating the crab puffs was like opening a Lay's potato chip bag: more air inside than filling. The delivery only took about 25 minutes, but I'd honestly rather wait a little bit longer for better food.  This was such a waste of money. I should have just gone to Panda Express; I would have spent the same amount of money and had much better food."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about fast delivery!!!!   Sesame chicken was really tasty and their fried rice was yummy, too. The lo mein left something to be desired as it was a bit too sticky and not much flavor to it. Fear not, however, I would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"I got Uber Eats from Lucky Kitchen so I can't speak to any in dining experience. However the soup and the fried rice was pretty good. The egg drop soup was a decent consistency, not too thin not too thick with just egg. No carrots or peas and although I personally prefer that I don't know if others might. I ordered pork fried rice curry style with add ons of mushrooms and fried tofu. The flavor was very good but the fried rice with all the add ons and the curry style ended up being $13 which I think could have been a tad cheaper for what it was. I would recommend at least trying their food and if I'm ever back in Arizona I would come again if I got the chance!"}
{"text":"I used grubhub for the first time after reading another review here and my food arrived within 20 minutes - I live just down the street - delivered by a super friendly, sweet guy named \"Ben\" according to grubhub. It didn't hurt that he was also super cute.   Short version: Overall, decent American Chinese food. I recommend the wings, crab puffs and fried shrimp. Also, use grubhub since it is so easy and fast. I used to frequent another American Chinese restaurant on central near Fez but may be switching to Lucky Kitchen.   Long version: I ordered the Sesame Chicken and the Lucky Platter. The platter was a sampling of their popular appetizers which I selected since it was my first time ordering from this restaurant. Everything on the platter was fresh and crispy. I would definitely order the crab puffs again as they were not overstuffed with cream cheese like some places like to do and I could actually see the imitation crab meat inside. The chicken wing and fried shrimp were great, very light yet crispy.   The sesame chicken was a little disappointing. The sauce was very watery causing the breading to slip off the cubed chicken pieces. However, I could appreciate that the chicken was not overly breaded into unrecognizable boulders like a lot of other places do. The actual chicken meat was dry and tough, though. I can over look this because I know a lot of American Chinese restaurants make these chicken dishes in large quantities and consistency is difficult and quality can depend on when you order it compared to when it's made. I'll have to order another chicken dish at another time to compare.   5 stars for friendliness, service, and the Lucky Platter. 2 stars for the Sesame Chicken which I couldn't even finish. I rounded my 3.5 rating to 4 with the anticipation that my next visit will be even better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the worst I have ever had. Their food is horrible, service is horrible. It is hard to mess up Chinese food but they did it. When I called for a refund they told me I had to bring it in and they could exchange it (I don't drive at the moment and have kids so that is very difficult and I don't want their nasty food). I would not pay any amount for this food. Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"It was kind of a let down.  I was excited when I received a flier on my door.So I called that day only to find out the delivery minimum was $25.00 not $12.00 as posted.  I was eating for 1 that night.  I was willing to try when i have a friend over but after reading the reviews...  No thanks.  Good Luck to you."}
{"text":"Got delivery since Sui wok never answers their phone. Will never  do it again. Their hot and sour soup was so nasty. Just dark brown liquid and nothing else in it. Could not even take one spoonful. My husband loves orange chicken a hated it from this place. The egg rolls tasted horrible too. Trust the reviews on this one and stay away."}
{"text":"This is your run of the mill fast food Chinese restaurant. Nothing here particularly stands out as fantastic, but is all around decent.  Prices are solid, but could have less \"dressing\" and more meat in their dishes.   The reason why they get 4 stars is that they have a very pleasant staff and super fast delivery."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food! Had order to go from here so many times. Their delivery service is also very on time and food is well packaged. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop place with friendly staff, great prices, fast delivery and pretty tasty traditional Chinese food. I mean, this isn't fine dining, it's a local neighborhood joint. It's solid, fast and inexpensive.  And it's 1000x better than a couple other places that Phoenicians rave about (see prior reviews)"}
{"text":"Ordered crab Rangoon (no cream in won ton) lo Mein (all onions and hardly any noodles) and cashew chicken (mostly onions) . Rip off. I would never order from this place again, and especially not through delivery because they drop off hot chopped onions And take 30 bucks ! Joke."}
{"text":"It is a sad, sad day for me to write my first bad review. Having just moved from Miami where cheap Chinese food is damn near impossible to find, I don't think my standards are THAT high for this type of \"cuisine.\"  My party of three went into the restaurant to order takeout S&S pork, sesame chicken, and pepper beef, with egg drop and miso soups, lo mein, fried and steamed rice, so I feel that I can say with some conviction that the food was universally awful, with the possible exception of the lo mein because it was edible. Everything was underflavored, oversalted, and just disappointing. I even took another Yelper's review into consideration and ordered easy on the sauce, but if I could go back in time and advise myself I'd ask for extra, because there might have been more flavor hiding somewhere in the dish.  I would normally give an extra star for the lovely, polite, fast service, but I just can't in this case. I'm sorry Lucky Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've eaten, a buffet is better then this... All the food is bland, tasteless, and down right gross. Please never eat here, go to yins just down the street or order pizza"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly food.  Lacking in taste department.  Reminds me of Chinese take out orders during a wild night in my undergrad years.  Had both the pepper beef and cashew chicken.  Pepper beef was not bad, decent flavor.  Cashew chicken was really bland.  I also ordered the crab puffs/rangoons.  Those were just plain weird.  I couldn't figure out what was in them.  It was not crab or cream cheese.  I would be willing to try again but definitely not on my top 5 Asian cuisine places."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. It was beyond not good. Had to order yourself and pick up the order when it was done. The only good thing that was there was the can of Pepsi I got. There was no one in the place and the staff was rude. Won't be coming back and won't recommend this to anyone. Tried to do something new and stay local tonight but man...."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here from Grub Hub. It was delivered fast, so I assume the food was prepared fast. I had the Walnut Shrimp. It was pretty good. I ordered fried rice.  The fried rice wasn't fried at all. Just basically dried up white rice with a lot of soy sauce. The rice was dark brown and pretty gross. I couldn't eat it and had to throw it away. 3 stars because the Walnut shrimp was ok."}
{"text":"I like Lucky Kitchen. The food is as expected from your typical Chinese restaurant and the prices are average also.  I have ordered numerous different items from them on multiple occasions and each time I have enjoyed my food, and the service.  Their delivery is quite speedy, as is their wait time on to-go orders.  However, I disagree with some yelpers that said the food was not very good for a Chinese restaurant. I am a Southern California native and have lived in SF for four years. As another yelper said, this might leave me spoiled. I might be spoiled, but I do know good Chinese food from bad, and this is certainly good Chinese food.  I would definitely recommend Lucky Kitchen if you're looking for well priced, tasty Chinese food in uptown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Holy cheap Chinese food, Batman!  The lunch hour was totally impressive.  The menu and food arrived within about 5 minutes of each other, was quite tasty, and was amazingly priced.  Hard to get decent food for around $6 these days!"}
{"text":"This place looks a little scuzzy. The food is way salty. I read one review on here about it being close to \"east coast\" Chinese food. But, I didn't think so. At least not Virginia Beach-style Chinese. The general tso's chicken was pretty gross. But, that is just my taste. Others may think it tastes good. It's just not what I'm used to.   It has a dine-in area. It's not bad. Just a little \"hole-in-the-wall.\" The staff was VERY friendly. Can't complain there. And, you can place an order online to pick it up. I placed an order over the phone for carry-out and it was ready within 10 minutes. But, I probably won't be back. Just not what I'm looking for in Chinese food. I'm still looking for that \"east coast\" flavor. :)"}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese food I've had in the valley. The two stars is for the price. But for the cheap lunch special, I'd have given it only one. General Tso's chicken was listed spicy, which it was far from. The fried rice looked like a rendition of browned soy sauce rice, and had no flavor or add ins. The lunch serving itself consisted of 4 little nuggets of meet, and several filler vegetables such as bell pepper and onion. Certainly wouldn't recommend this, even for what you pay."}
{"text":"Good food, super fast delivery and the driver was very nice.  Online ordering was simple.  Minimum delivery order it hard to meet with only one person, unless you're a closet fatty like me!  Will order again!"}
{"text":"Decided to order from this place when they hand delivered very nice menus to our door.   ORDERING PROCESS: Very good. While there's always a little difficulty speaking and being understood to non-native English speakers, the friendliness and eagerness of my order taker was excellent. I called (unknowingly) 5 minutes before closing, and offered to order elsewhere. He assured me it wasn't a problem and urged me to order anyway.   DELIVERY SPEED: Very good. From the time I hung up the phone to the time it was at my door: 14 minutes.   For those wondering, they do ask to see your card at the door. Make sure you have it ready.  FOOD QUANTITY: Bountiful. I ordered the 6.99 order of orange chicken expecting one of the larger white take out containers that fold at the top - the traditional chinese food containters. I received a huge styrofoam clam shell container packed with orange chicken. They also included extra crab rangoons and it came with a medium-sized container of fried rice (egg).   FOOD QUALITY: Decent. This food will not appeal to the culinary snobs, but it will fill you up with hot food that tastes decently good.   Chicken: Orange sauce was good, not spicy and not saccharine sweet. Flavorful without being overpowering. Chicken breading was soft and fell off chicken often. Actual chicken pieces are good quality and good tasting meat.  Fried Rice: The weak point of the meal. Rice lacks substantial flavor but includes egg, carrot, and perhaps the occasional rogue pea. Vegetable to rice density is very low. You'll likely have two bits of carrot and one pea to a box. Rice is moist, warm, and chewy with a slight nutty flavor. A touch of the orange sauce boosted the flavor and made it delicious.  Crab Rangoon: Very thin. While most Cheapinese places serve puffy crab rangoons, these are paper thin and almost resemble a baked appearance instead of fried. Filling was plentiful and flavorful.   PRICE: Total price was more than affordable. With spending 6.99 for a veritable banquet of food, you will be pleasantly surprised by the quality.   They offer 3.99 Rice bowls featuring one serving of chicken over their rice. Perfect portion for lunch."}
{"text":"Everything tasted old! Nothing was good, egg rolls were cold, dumplings cold! The teriyaki chicken was not what I was expecting and we were all so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and could hardly eat it. Lemon chicken tasted like they used lemon pudding, it was so sweet. Fried rice was not edible. Mongolian beef was ALL onions...gross. Should have just drove to Panda Express...waste of $40..!!"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before I ordered, but I was hungry and craving Chinese. It's super easy to order and it was really quick in getting here, but that's about as good as it gets. I ordered Cashew Shrimp, Orange Chicken, and a sampler with a beef skewer, eggroll, wanton, eggdrop soup, some type of chicken wing, and a fried shrimp. The eggroll and the beef skewer were the only things I liked. The \"Cashew Shrimp\" is 90% celery. The Orange Chicken is soggy (to be fair, there was a review that said to order sauce on the side if you like a crunch on this one) The crab wanton wasn't bad, but it barely had any filling. There is a lot of food that comes with it so if you like it then you get a lot of leftovers. Unfortunately now I just have A LOT of crappy food :("}
{"text":"Not the worst, but definitely not lucky... The best thing is that they deliver for much of nothing. But the food is bland and the rice is so dark. It looked gross, but was edible. They claim no MSG but I'm not too sure about that. For the price I would skip this restaurant and go somewhere I knew was sure to please. If you're starving and don't feel like driving and just have to eat, then use this as a last resort."}
{"text":"I've dined in once and ordered take out 3-4 times. Tonight was the last straw. I got delivery and I paid $3.99 for the 8 piece crab puff appetizer. Anyone that orders from Chinese-American restaurants knows what to expect. Except this place is soo cheap with the cream cheese krab meat filling. At first I thought it was a mistake and they gave me plain fried won tons, but sure enough there was a spec of cream cheese in each wonton. It was like the unlucky kitchen took the filling of one normal sized crab puff and stretched it to \"fill\" 8 of them. I feel completely ripped off. Worst appetizer ever.   I also had Hunan Chicken and pork fried rice.   The hunan chicken was ok but it was deep fried. Not what I'm accustomed to getting. And of course it was soggy having sat enclosed in a styrofoam container, steaming, on the way to my house.   Some of their other dishes I've tried before were a bit \"off\" as well. This is not authentic chinese by a long shot. For that try South China on 7th Ave. (now temp closed for remodeling)  The pork fried rice was passable, although very greasy. The menu actually states it contains MSG. Bottom line is I know at least 4 other Chinese places within a 4 mile radius, with far better food.  I don't think Lucky Kitchen is good or even decent. I eat a lot of Asian and Chinese food and this place is below average. Anyone that rates this over 2 stars has not tried much of the menu. Even the soups are disappointing."}
{"text":"The delivery was unbelievably fast ! Fresh ingredients! Huge portion of meat! I won't eat anywhere else if i want some delicious Chinese foods ! Lucky kitchen is the best Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area ."}
{"text":"Great food. Very quick delivery. The brought my food before the expected time that's great.. very recomendable.. definitively I will order from here again."}
{"text":"New in az and wanted chineese and ordered egg drop soup my opinion it was lacking iv been eating it my entire life and it was bland we got potstickers they were decent i liked them better cold the dipping sauce was delish . We got a lo mein with all the meats and again lacking in flavor they also put cellary in it and that's all you could taste. Life or death maybe id go back but i would be excited about it."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and the receipt shows the name of LUCKY KITCHEN! Same address, so unsure why it has two names. The food was descent for its price. Don't expect delicious food, but OK, especially when you want the convenience of having it delivered to you. I asked for soy sauce and chili sauce and was charged- complete rip off considering these are condiments you get unlimited of when you eat there. What's worst is that I wasn't charged when I placed the order and my order was amended after to reflect the additional cost, without my approval!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery... wow they are fast Food was not greasy it was really good. We ordered Chicken fried rice, sweet and sour  Chicken and Pot Stickers.  We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Walked in. Was seated. Went to bathroom to wash my hands. Smelled like animal pee inside men's room. Asked my friend to go back in men's room to confirm. He got back to the table nodding. We bolted out. Not sure what to make of that, but I knew I didn't want to eat there. Lost my appetite. Waiter got mad that we left. He yelled at us, accusing us for only stopping in to use the restroom. Didn't know how to tell him. Oh well.  Dine here at your own risk."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had since living here in Phoenix . I'm a college student so leftovers is a great thing to have and they give you a lot so leftovers isn't a big problem. I like the Beef Fried rice and then I just added what I wanted. The egg rolls are superb and I am going to have to order this again. The prices are great and I can't wait to order here again. Great place and the delivery was fast and the guy was very nice ."}
{"text":"+ : Food was ready in no time.  - : Ordered orange chicken & fried rice. Orange chicken was soggy & fried rice looked nothing like the typical fried rice. Ick!   I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Food was hot. Crab puffs were excellent. Beef egg foo yung was tasty albeit the gravy was a little bland. First time to try them. Will definitely order again. Forgot to ask for real Chinese mustard. Hope they do have it for next time. Very affordable. Good job."}
{"text":"Horrible place to order from. Yes the food is cheap. Yes the food is edible. Today I ordered food online. I have a confirmation email saying that my food is ordered. The delivery time is 45 minutes. After an hour I decided to call and see what the problem was with my delivery. The woman on the line said they have no record of the order. She said it happens alot. Is this suppose to be an excuse for people not getting their order? Is this answer really acceptable? As hungry as I was I asked how quickly they could get it to me. Once again I received the 45 minute response because that's how long it takes the driver to get back. I even asked if it took 45 minutes to cook the food, she confirmed that it's the delivery drivers time! To some it up, horrible customer service, unreliable service, excuses for every reason they restaurant has problems and they never take responsibility for themselves. BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, the worst customer service ever. The fact that I wanted to eat in was my first mistake. Counter service only here. Why they have tables is a mystery.  They should just have a window for carry out or take away only. Sad because the food is good."}
{"text":"Great place!  The food is very tasty - it's just good as-you-want-it-to-be delivered Chinese food.  What I liked even more was the ability order the food online - very easy, very quick - and amazingly, the food was at my door in TWENTY MINUTES!  I live within a mile of the resaurant.    I needed something quick and easy and this was it.  Also, one other reviewer mentioned how nice the delivery guy was...and he's very right...uber-friendly and polite.  Nice job Lucky Kitchen!"}
{"text":"I've ordered carry out and delivery from Lucky Kitchen about 5 times now... Awesome food, with great service. They deliver quickly, and the driver's always polite. When we go in to pick up our order, the staff is friendly and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Not good. Completely blew my delivery and then failed to correct."}
{"text":"The food, specifically the General Tso's Chicken, is absolutely disgusting.  The chicken in the entree was raw and spoiled vegetables were used.  I called the restaurant for a refund or an alternate entree but the woman stated that, \"it is not their policy.\"  I have to place this food in the top percentile of bad chinese restaurants - the food is as bad as their signs and decor.  IN short, buyer beware:  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"I will just list the facts 1. We ordered family dinner with 2 entrees. I told them I could not afford any higher  2. Employee taking order asked me what I wanted for a third entree, I asked to be sure it came with 3 instead of 2  3. My family never even ate the 3rd entree. Yet, when it was time to pay the bill, he billed us for an extra entree. He HEARD me promise the kids ice cream after dinner.   4. When I said I don't think I have enough money he said \"I told you 3rd entre is extra\" then said nothing else while standing over me with his arms crossed. He made the whole family feel uncomfortable. No other customers or men were there. It was two guys versus just me and my kids.   5. The bill also included a gratuity which they DID NOT TELL US ABOUT BEFORE. I had to tell my kids we could not get ice cream, there were no apologies given.   6. My family will never go there again."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the egg rolls. Egg drop soup are awesome. Kung pao chicken are good only with a couple of adjustment when ordering, easy sauce and same goes with sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"Sokay? Sallright! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJiYZ6QIAtY  It *is* sallright. My husband dragged me to this place since it's a few small blocks from our little small new home in Phoenix, we were in the middle of our move and there was nothing to eat in the house, and they are one of the few places that deliver for a meager $2 - online through Eat 24: http://phoenix.eat24hours.com/lucky-kitchen/17730.   For an in-person visit on a Saturday night, the place was empty, scrubbed and .. fine. Nothing to see here. . nothing special. But: clean and smelled like food, not anything not-like-food, which is a good sign. CLEAN IS GOOD.  No fancy anything here, but food seems fresh and made the moment you order it, the way it should be in Chinese places - that's the point of Chinese food a lot of the time. We had potstickers (these were probably from a frozen premade source) and he had orange chicken - I had hot & sour soup (good!), rice and egg rolls (again, probably premade). But nothing was spoiled or old, or weirdly chewy (believe me, I've had some baaaad Chinese food and this wasn't it) and everything reasonably priced. I asked for Sriracha sauce since I am an addict but they have some other brand since I think most people don't ask for it, that's too bad. LONG LIVE THE ROOSTER is what I have to say to that.  Plus Sriracha is more of a Viet thing anyway, I suppose. Damn Americans putting ketchup on everything (ha).   For delivery, when I ordered online (such a novelty for me, but such a time-saver) they were over in a flat 20 minutes with our entire order. Superfast! However, the cook did not cook the egg foo young the whole way through - blech. I had to microwave the patties the rest of the way. Uncooked egg is a major health risk - please be careful about that in the future. okay??  But otherwise.. no problems considering our new tough urban area.  Good service and okay food. I have the feeling that they can sex up you food for you if you beg for it (i.e. extra chilies, extra garlic, ginger, more noodles,etc) for not too much trouble. Not for the gourmet but what the hell. do you want to eat or not?"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars. I was feeling lazy last night and was looking for a restaurant that would deliver, had online ordering, wasn't pizza, and didn't have a ridiculous delivery fee. That left pretty much only Lucky Kitchen.  I placed my order for orange chicken with fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and one eggroll (only because I was like $.50 from the delivery minimum). After I submitted my credit card info, I was super bummed when it said the wait time would be 55 minutes. Not even 20 minutes later, I heard the delivery guy running up my steps with the food. Although I was pleasantly surprised, it made me think of Jim Gaffigan's stand up, \"Chinese food almost comes too quickly.\"  I ate the eggroll first, and although it was kind of puny looking, it was actually really good. I thought my orange chicken was good flavor wise, but it left my mouth feeling sticky. Like I had just finished eating a hard candy. The fried rice was pretty bland. My boyfriend's sweet and sour was good, but it could have used a little more sauce.   While the food wasn't all spot on, the delivery was so fast, I would probably order from them again in the future. Plus, it was only $20 with tip, and both meals were huge portions and left enough for solid leftovers today."}
{"text":"FAST DELIVERY!!! Got a notification saying the food wouldn't arrive for about 45 minutes. Food was here 15 minutes after I had placed the order! We ordered the chicken and beef Lo Mein and an Egg Drop Soup. Delicious! The portions are large enough to be split in 2 meals. We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. The delivery service was pretty long too. The chow Mein had more bean sprouts than noodles and the lemon chicken literally tasted biting into a lemon. This is unfortunate because this is one of only a couple Asian food places that delivers to my location."}
{"text":"Being from NY, I have some high expectations for my Chinese fare. This place misses the mark...by a mile. The sesame chicken was essentially glazed pieces of fried something, the wonton soup was salt water, and the best thing was the egg roll which could have come from costco. I rarely give bad reviews, especially for places that I love so close to, but I can't get around this one.  Overall, skip this place."}
{"text":"I have ordered and had delivery from this restaurant for a long time.  the food is always hot, flavorful, and FAST delivery.  The drivers are always smiling and very friendly.  I would take this take out over any in Phoenix...oh wait, I do!  LOVE the food, the portions are great and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"It's ok. I got it yesterday for lunch for the first time and got Kung Pao Chicken. It had very little chicken in it. Mostly celery and onions etc. I decided to try something else today so I got the Mongolian Chicken and Beef combo. All I got was beef and it still was pretty mediocre. The fried rice was just kinda browned rice, and the Mongolian beef was just huge slices of onion and huge chunks of green onion with a little beef.  Delivery was fast! But other than that, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I live in the area and received one of their flyers. I was skeptical at first from seeing the same restaurant change names over the years. Nevertheless my gf and I stopped in where a tranquil enivornment awaited us. The place was empty except for a older white man, we were seated and immediately attended to. We got the General Tso's Chicken and Kung Pao dual (chicken and shrimp) along with an order of crab puffs. All of my experience with asian cusine has been with Canton Wong, so i was expecting gigantic portions with very little flavor, but to my surprise the dishes were well portion, with ACTUAL vegetables!! Flavorful, colorful, delicious were just a few of the the thoughts i had while i enjoyed the remainder of my dining experience. Try it! The cost is cheaper than most \"chinese restaurants\" and the food is to die for. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is my new go to Chinese food. I wasn't feeling well and got it delivered. Very good portions of food. Orange chicken was great. And we're way quicker than the expected delivery time with a very polite delivery driver. Will be ordering from here again for sure."}
{"text":"I usually order a large hot and sour soup,  andI also order the large egg drop soup,  then I mix them together, because the hot and sour soup is pretty spicy by itself, but when its mixed with the egg drop soup it's amazing and I have plenty for other meals! I love their pork chop suey! Their chicken and snow peas is pretty darn amazing too! I stick with the non-breaded meats because the breading they use is a little pancakie tasting,  like it needs corn starch to crisp it up a bit.  I wish they'd look into getting a different breading!  Other than that, I love this place! Delivery guy is also so quick and very pleasant! ;)"}
{"text":"Shrimp fried rice is Delicious!  The Egg rolls and crab puffs as well! Really fast delivery and your food is still nice and hot when you get it.  I ordered through Eat24 app."}
{"text":"The food did come fast for delivery.  Although I ordered lo mein and it was very dry without much sauce on it.  The food tasted horrible, I ended up throwing it away because I couldn't eat it.  I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I was shocked at how good the pork fried rice was. Every other Chinese restaurant I've gone to out here has been a disappointment but this place was surprisingly decent. Hopefully the next time it will be just as good. Update: Have ordered food a few more times from here and it's still just as good!"}
{"text":"I hate doing bad reviews, seriously. I came in for take out and the servers were very pleasant. Let me get to the point that the food was horrible. I had the General Tso's pork  (which I was told it was really nice) being a culinary student myself I hate to talk badly about another's food.so I will say that I will give this place one more shot so  please get better ."}
{"text":"If I could give this negative stars, I would. I got the sesame chicken and white rice. It was the only thing I ate all day. A few hours after, I started to feel very sick. What were my symptoms you ask? FOOD POISONING!!!! I went to urgent care, explained my symptoms, told her what I ate that day, and you will never believe the response I got. She told me she also got food poisoning from Lucky Kitchen. Buyer beware you will get sick. Maybe not to the degree it made me or the doctor, but please be careful. If you value your stomach, do NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place overall. I got the sweet and sour lunch combo. It came with fried (or steamed) rice, a spring roll, a fried crab puff, and a small egg drop soup. The food itself was pretty decent. All of that food was only $6.05 after tax. However, the customer service is kind of meh... the guy was like \"here's your food, come and get it, take care of your trash when you're done.\" Was good, may or may not be back."}
{"text":"The food here is great and we have been coming to Lucky Kitchen since it opened. Some recently changed, though, that has me to the point if no longer returning. Over the holidays my mother in law and sister were visiting from Texas and I told them about Lucky Kitchen and gave it a raving review. We decided to go there for lunch and to my dismay they changed the format from a sit down restaurant into catering more for carryout orders. The way it use to work when we went here is that you would sit and a server would take your order and bring you drinks - just like a normal restaurant. Now the make it where you order at the counter, get your own drinks and your food is served on styrofoam plates. I don't know why they changed the way the restaurant part functions but for the prices they charge I don't want fast food. I will be going to Desert Jade and China Chili again instead. Although this isn't a huge deal it's just become an impersonal place and couldn't be cost effective to serve on styrofoam. Food is excellent and deserving of 5 stars. Take out must be the way to go, but the restaurant gets 1 star in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good Chinese delivery, East Coast-style. It's now my second-favorite Chinese delivery in the area.  Lucky Kitchen strikes the perfect balance between restaurant quality and delivery style. People who love fried noodles and thick gloppy sauces deserve good food too! Every ingredient packed a lot of flavor and was just the right texture. Roast pork and shrimp were especially good.   Unfortunately, the sauces left a bit to be desired. The dark brown egg foo young sauce was just shy of burnt, and it ended up tasting like cafeteria salisbury steak. The fried rice was also a bit too dark for my taste, and was light on the extra ingredients. I'm guessing the extra-browned sauce was due to ordering in the middle of the afternoon... I'll try again during the lunch rush.   Egg rolls were excellent, as was the cashew chicken and sweet and sour pork. More than enough to outweigh the egg foo young.  Bonus points for allowing online ordering.   And - this feels a little weird to say - the delivery guy really is very charming."}
{"text":"Great place...was served fast, staff was pleasant, and lunch food was wonderful...  This is a huge turnaround from 2 years ago, when they were a buffet style place. Now it is menu driven food. Also the place is much cleaner and inviting inside."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, good prices!!! Orange chicken was great, fried rice was perfect and the egg rolls are awesome! Very fast and friendly delivery!!!"}
{"text":"As I'm rating this bear in mind there are Chinees restuants on every corner.  I am comparing it to these casual places.  That being said I'm sad I moved 2 miles away because I can't get it delivered anymore.  I miss their Teriyaki Chicken and Crab Puffs.  I miss the convenience and the friendly delivery guy. I only went to the actual restaurant once but I got delivery all the time.  I hope you like it too."}
{"text":"The crab puffs are such a disappointment, there is barely any filling. The pot stickers were good though. And while the shrimp Lo mein had a nice amount of shrimp there wasn't a lot of the vegetables that are usually in the Lo mein."}
{"text":"Hoooked! Just moved to this area and even though the Panda place opened today, I am only going mom/pops for chinese in my neighborhood. First, the cook is Chinese and only speaks that. That has got to say something for authenticity.  I had the orange chicken: Great My friend had Sweet and Sour Pork: Loved it I had the egg drop soup: Freshest taste ever Egg rolls: Very good Crab puffs: Need more crab stuff Dumplings: Steamed....sooooo delicious!  Overall, great price $4.99 Lunch/about $6.99 for dinner specials.  Delivery area is very broad, as far East as 24th St and only $1. Minimum order is $10, fairly easy to do. Definitely going back and my goal is to keep them in business!"}
{"text":"The Lucky Kitchen is one of the only restaurants that delivers to my job, and for me that already makes it a winner. But we Yelpers don't care about that! So on to the food review.  I've ordered from here twice and the delivery guy is really nice. The person on the phone is also really nice too and is pretty darn helpful when it comes to figuring out what you want (especially if you can't see the menu).  I've had the egg rolls here and they are pretty good. Sometimes they are cooked a bit too much but it doesn't detract from the taste. The crab puffs are also pretty good but I wish they had more filling in them. The potstickers are fantastic! They aren't super squishy or super crunchy, they are a perfect mix of both with the bottom being more crunchy then the top. The filling is great and doesn't look questionable. I wish the dipping sauce for them was a bit more tart but I still like it. The sweet and sour sauce is pretty good.  The only complaint I have is that if your order the Orange chicken (or any similar kind of dish) it is swimming in sauce. I'd prefer less sauce so the breading doesn't fall off so easy. However the chicken is good quality and so is the breading.  All in all this is a good place but because of the sauce thing I'm going to stick with fried food.   Their delivery is reasonable with a 10$ minimum and a 1$ delivery fee."}
{"text":"A solid alternative for Chinese when I don't want to put pants on.  I've mostly only had their food delivered (and ate inside the restaurant once) and it has been consistently good. Delivery is faster than the estimated delivery time, the food is served piping hot, and the portions are generous. Sometimes I'll order all appetizers so I can have many different flavors in one setting. Mostly, I'll get a sampler app and main course which ends up being enough for two meals."}
