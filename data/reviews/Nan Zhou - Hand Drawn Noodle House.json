{"text":"Ordered takeout, scallion pancakes, oxtail noodle soup, and stir-fried beef with noodles and XO sauce. Fresh, authentic and delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! Came to Phoenix to work for a week. I was craving noodles and Nan Zhou came up. I drove 15 miles to try it and I was sooo impressed with the value and fantastic and tasty food. I recommend seafood stir fried with the XO sauce and large noodles. For $1 buck as a soup! Amazing! Great taste, good quality and fantastic value."}
{"text":"?????????????????????nan zhou handrawn noodles??????????????????????????????????????????????? ?"}
{"text":"Good place to eat Chinese food.  The food is very delicious.  People are very nice.  The hand draw noodles is very cool when they make before cooking."}
{"text":"I love the food! It was good I love the people and the environment. I'll be back soon :)"}
{"text":"The noodles are authentic, homemade, and fresh. I have yet try a soup or noodle stir fry that wasn't amazing. Also, the Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce is delicious. If you want somethin cheap and filling, you can get mung bean and pork over rice for $5. I'm still trying new things too and I encourage you to do the same. The service is always good and the food is always fast too. I would recommend to anyone who likes traditional Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Nan Zhou is fantastic place with gorgeous service, fast delivery service, delicious food. I like to order beef noodle soup and spicy cucumber which are sooooo delicious and authentic Chinese food! I love them so much, and I like spicy. I can put as much spicy oil as possible."}
{"text":"Noodle soup was okay.  I've definitely had better food, nothing to really write about, I wouldn't have log on to yelp them if it wasn't for the service.  Talk about discriminating!  Not sure if its because they don't like children or Chinese, or perhaps we just look cheap because we were in shorts and t-shirts.  Unfortunately they've misjudged us!  Normally we leave at least 18% for decent service, today we left them a 2% for no service. They made no attempt to check on us, made no attempt to refill our drinks.  I attempted to get the waiter's attention twice, and he totally looked the other way and ignore me.  I also asked him for bowls for my kids to share their noodles when he brought us our food, he ignored me as well.  Don't think I'm making a mistake because he keep his attention to the table behind us, they were a table of 5, all Caucasians, he went there to refill their waters when it was more than half full.  Figure he refill ours since he has the water pitcher, unfortunately he walked away and didn't even respond when I said \"excuse me.\"  He went to the other table time after time to check on them.  Disappointing, so had to yelp about them.  The one star is for the food, so do take out only here."}
{"text":"I tried beef noodle soup. It was Ok. However, I felt horrible with my stomach after I came to my home. I dislike the broth."}
{"text":"Noodles are pretty good. Very similar to China Noodle House in Chandler. This would be a closer alternative if you are in Tempe."}
{"text":"Sorry I have to be honest but I got the oxtail noodle soup with hand-pulled noodle. The noodle was not cooked like it was so much chewier than al-dente (tasted like undercooked spaghetti). The oxtail were so tough and chewy I had to use my fingers to pull the meat out and naw on it. When the waiter asked me how is it I was like it's ok but to be honest it was horrible (but I felt bad telling them cuz it was that bad). Felt like I was eating an undercooked bowl of noodle. This definitely killed it for me I don't think I would give it a second chance. The oxtail were so thinly chopped and so tough and chewy. I'm so disappointed. New diners I will definitely don't recommend the oxtail with hand pulled noodles."}
{"text":"I must say this place was hella cool. The food was so authentic and well made. I could taste flavors of the region and that is how you learn about different cultures. Their noodles were perfect. I appreciated their style and service. Fast, delicious and original."}
{"text":"Food was OK. I had the chicken seafood soup wit hand drawn noodle, my daughter ordered the beef stir fried noodle. Anyhow, we were on our way to our usually place but seen this place a few times so we decided to try it. I doubt we'll ever go back. My soup would have been better wit Housin sauce or some kind of flavor, my soup was plain. When i asked for housin sauce they gave me hot sauce and tried to tell them what i wanted but they kept saying oyster sauce, I'm like never mind and tried to enjoy my food. My daughters dish was greasy and also hardly any flavor, blah. So if you'd like to come here,  BRING YOUR OWN SAUCE FOR FLAVOR. DONT GET ME WRONG THE SERVE WAS GREAT AND THE FOOD COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.  JUST SAYING."}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Everything I've tried, from the marinated pig ear to the fried rice, is delicious. The salt & pepper squid appetizer is a revelation. I have to actively stop myself from ordering the Singapore rice noodles every time I go. And, of course, the hand drawn noodles are just so fresh and wonderful any way you get them. The service is always really friendly, and they are FAST. Absolutely a must if you are in the area or craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast. Food is fantastic , you can't got wrong with anything on the menu. I love this place and highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The young lady (waitress) pretty rude. And also service was horrible. This waitress even yelled at me because I need lemon for my water. I have been here many times and this is not the only time she yelled at me. I will never come back. Wish the boss could understand that service is the important part for running a restaurant."}
{"text":"The noodles, the small restaurant atmosphere, lots of Asians eating here, heavenly smells, and all 3 of us ate WITH appetizers for 36 bucks!! The best noodles I've had here in the States! as a bonus, you can watch the noodles being made in the window that looks into the kitchen!  Fascinating!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We had beef noodle soups and mutton shashlik. Strongly recommend them. Unlike Japanese ramen, their noodles are stretched and pulled manually, making them pretty chewy and yummy. Soups are good too with large pieces of meat. Will definitely come back again for the noodles!"}
{"text":"I took my coworkers out for some authentic Chinese food here. It was my first dining at this restaurant. It was so clean &the staff was so friendly. I noticed this is a real Chinese restaurant operated by Chinese from the dining room to the kitchen. Nothing like any other restaurants have Mexican people cooking in the kitchen.The Chinese waitress who waited on us spoke fluent English and she was able to take care one of my coworkers who had gluten allergy.   We ordered the appetizers-salt&pepper calamari, grilled chicken skewers, so yummy! Of course,the hand drawn noodles were fresh made as you order, there is a clear glass window you can watch how the chef made the noodles in front of you. What a unique skill that the chef can master!we will definitely come back for more delicious food!"}
{"text":"YUM - YUM!!!  Food is SO GOOD!!  nice ambience, nice people and a window for watching them make the hand drawn noodles.  Very unusual menu worth many more visits to explore all of it.  Good prices too!"}
{"text":"Ordered Spring Rolls as an appetizer.  Mains were Shrimp with Walnuts which came with white rice, noodles with onion rolls & peanut sauce, lamb skewers.    Quite disappointing were the spring rolls which were delivered sitting in a pool of oil--literally.  I used the napkin holder on the table to pump out wads of napkins in an attempt to degrease them.  No such luck.  Horrible.  Husband refused to eat any of them since he said he would not consume his calories on pure grease.   He enjoyed the lamb skewers which were nice and spicy, and the noodle dish.  The walnut shrimp was well prepared and plentiful.  There were about 12 shrimp surrounded by broccoli.    A good value at $9.25.  The place was clean and the staff attentive."}
{"text":"TREAT CUSTOMER LIKE S**T! This did not happened on me, but I saw it and I was so shocked that how they treated a customer! Around 3pm today (10/9/2016), I was with my friend there to enjoy a meal, the waitresses and waiter were not too polite because every time we said \"thank you\" they just simply walked way, this was actually considered \"a little bit common\" due to some bad emotions and I totally understand, but what happened later was beyond our expectation. There were an asian couple here to have a take out order, and the waitress, a old lady, was very rude and keep blaming the wife for stepping in with no idea what to order! Loudly and rudely!!! That's ridiculous!!! You guys are running a restaurant and it's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to explain because it's you who want to earn their money! Or at leas treat customer politely!!! The husband was so pissed off but still smiling to that old lady, but all the others were so shocked, even the other waitresses were trying to let the old lady to calm down. I was so shamed because we were the only Chinese customers there and there are some other customers were watching the old lady humiliating the customer. WILL NOT GO THERE AGAIN, and I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO AVOID THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you love hand drawn noodles. You must understand that this is a cultural experience and it's not about the best service but the quality and taste of the food.  I have been here at least a dozen times and it is difficult to not want to order the same thing all the time.  The house special stir fried noodles with beef, chicken and shrimp."}
{"text":"We really like hand pull noodles, so we were looking forward to trying this apot located across the street from Mekong Plaza. Servers were polite and helpful.  The thinly sliced pig ears were tasteless - when you have to add chili oil for the flavor rather than the heat, it's not a good way to start the meal. The stir fried beef & XO sauce with wide noodles was disappointing.  The noodles were both wide and THICK which made eating difficult & threw off the right balace of the noodle + sauce.  The dish had very ?ittle beef & XO sauce lacked flavor.  We also ordered the classic beef noodle soup which was nothing memorable.  Even the best restaurants have their off days, but unfortunately, we won't be be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I used to be here at least once a week but we get tried of the service. The server has bad attitudes on most days here.  They usually just takes your order and walk away. They will bring your food and water at the same time. They went back to chitchat. Their chat was loud enough for everyone to hear it in the store. I haven't had a refill of water on their own without trying to find a server down.   If you like good food. Big portion and amazing side dishes. This is the place you comes to.   However, if you want same type of food but much better service. I'll go to the one in chandler."}
{"text":"Delicious beef in oyster sauce! Kids has chicken fried rice & it was very fresh & good. Husband had the dragon soup & I think he licked the bowl clean. Spring rolls are fried with a ton of fresh cabbage!"}
{"text":"We had passed this a few times and decided to stop in.  We were pounced on even before we entered the building.  Not in a good way.  I told the waitress that it was our first time.  We were handed a  menu and pointed to our seat, we were still trying to get seated and the waitress is still demanding to know what we wanted to eat. Husband and I both looked at the menus in our hands, and asked for a moment. Before we could decide what we wanted the waitress (same one) asked us 4 more times. We had a few questions to ask her about what the different noodles were, she just stared at us, and walked away. when she finally came back, we asked about the noodles again, this time she answered.  I cannot even tell you what I ordered. It was dropped in front of us about 5 minutes after we ordered. It was ok. But I have had better."}
{"text":"I grew up just around the corner from this noodle shop but spent the last few years living in China studying and working. While I was there I grew to love Lan Zhou pulled noodles--now they're one of my favorite foods of all time. When I came back from China a few weeks ago I was FLOORED to see that there was a pulled noodle joint right here in my backyard so I had to give it a try.  The fact that they even HAVE these kinds of noodles here is impressive enough, but what's better is the food is great and the environment is comfortable, with warm lighting and spacious booths. The noodles are hand pulled, just like they do in China, and you can see the whole process through a wide window into the kitchen. Part of the fun is just watching the noodle pulling show!  I had pulled-noodle soup with vegetables and ordered a Green Onion Pancake for a side. Both were delicious and I only spent 10 bucks.  Oh-- when I went, the place was filled with Chinese customers. I was only a minutes drive away from the home I grew up in, and yet I was in the minority! How's that for an authentic, Chinese experience?   I will be coming back again and again to try more food."}
{"text":"My wife and I lived near this restaurant for nearly 6 years and we only started getting food from here a year before we moved. I wish we checked this place out sooner. The hand drawn noodles a very delicious. We have only gotten take out here, and they are extremely fast. I usually have my food within 2 minutes. So far, I have only seen asians eat here which tells me a large segment of the population is really missing out on some good food."}
{"text":"Good Chinese Food ?I will back ?and water is so cool and handsome boy. I love here . Today I know it thought the newspaper .that's great"}
{"text":"This place was excellent! The hand drawn noodles were great and so was the fried rice."}
{"text":"I won't comment on how authentic this noodle house is compared to places in China. After all, it's in Mesa, not China. I come here to satisfy cravings that won't get quenched with pho or ramen. Their noodle bowls are simple, usually just a bowl of broth with shaved noodles (or whatever you picked) and some type of topping. It's not fancy, but it's tasty, and it's lightning fast, plus you get to see the chef hand making the noodles.  If you're a Northerner who just got here or go back often, then this place won't be up to par, but if you've been living here a few years and crave a bowl of hot noodles, this hits the spot."}
{"text":"Game changer. Mic drop. I'm from NY I've been complaining for 20 years about the lack of any good Chinese food in AZ. Problem solved. !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We come here about twice a week! The BF is Chinese and from Cali so he's a little picky about his Asian food. This place ROCKS! I always get super fast service, it's clean, and the food is fantastic. They make the noodles in house. My particular fave is the noodles with peanut sauce."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very similar to that Magic Noodle place in Chandler and could possibly be a little better. Located across the street from the Mekong plaza and next to the Wing Lee chicken market.  Really love the simplicity of the inside of this place. They have very comfortable booths and one of those really cool windows where you can watch the dude making the noodles. Up and down he goes while giving them a pull from side to side and then a loud smack on the floured table. Nice!  Ordered the Pan Fried Pork Dumplings and a plate of their House Special Stir Fried Noodle on my first visit. Came back next week and did the Sour Spicy Seaweed and some House Special Dragon Phoenix Noodle Soup.  Everything was very tasty and really enjoyed the condiments that they have on the table. You can easily make your meal more spicy, salty or just give it a splash of some chinese black vinegar. The Seaweed dish was excellent and will be my new favorite treat for when I need some fiber.  Service is very friendly and they are most helpful when it comes time to choosing your items. Usually get there when they open and always get out of there in a hurry and back to work rather quickly.  Looking forward to going back soon and trying out some of their many Chef's Specials and several other items that have not made it in my stomach yet. They definitely have a pretty good sized menu with some Americanized favorites as well. GET YOU HAND OFF MY NOODLE!  4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Across the street from the Mekong Plaza, the Nan Zhou Hand Drawn noodle house was recommended for me to bring my Chinese parents. This place is definitely authentic and I'm very excited to hear that we have a hand drawn noodle place in Phoenix area.   I forgot the exact name of the dishes we ordered because my parents know what the best dishes and they can read Chinese, but I know it was #31 chicken and shrimp noodle dish and #37 beef flat noodle dish. The flat noodles were dough-like. My mom used to make these at home.  We couldn't find it anywhere to eat this at any restaurant until now.   The service was friendly. The waitress gave us extra rice without us asking for some and the food came out super fast. When we commented that, the waitress said \"we're faster than mcdonalds\". I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem, love this place. Food is quality, service is fast and good. Authentic Asian food. The variety of noodles and options they give you is what sets them apart from other restaurants . Huge portion sizes and priced very fair."}
{"text":"Yum. Super yum. This place is a delight. The kitchen is open and you can see them preparing all the food which is always nice. They have many kinds of noodles and their fried rice is great too. Loads of noodles with the soup makes it totally reasonably priced. Seriously worth checking out."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, authentic Chinese noodles, soup and rice dishes! My Chinese roommates regularly ask to go here when they are craving a taste of \"home.\" Service is always friendly and helpful, special requests (rice noodles for gluten free, no egg) accepted without a fuss, and the food comes to the table in a remarkably short period of time. It's always amazing to me how they get it done so quickly! After at least a dozen visits, I can happily say that they are consistent with good food and service, including spice levels on the hotter dishes. This is our go-to place for Asian noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef noodle soup. The flavor was decent and the portion was big. Everything else that didn't have soup came out more oily than it should've been. i.e the fried tofu was oozing oil and the stir-fried noodles as well There was a green insect, roughly 2 cm in the noodle soup. Meaning...they do not wash their vegetables."}
{"text":"I like this place.  When I want noodle soup I used to go to pho place.  This is a great alternative to pho.  I read a review of some \"expert\" guy saying this is pho and comparing it to pho, well the joke is on you because it's not pho. Did I say this is noodle soup and not pho? . Come on everyone Asian knows that."}
{"text":"Delicious with HUGE portions for the price. Noodles were cooked perfectly unlike my other experiences with another noodle house in Chandler that shall remain nameless. XO sauce could stand to be spicier, but it was a solid meal overall. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place was over priced garbage. Poor service didnt have anything i ordered. Waited 30 mins for them to tell me they didnt have chicken lo mein then to come back amd say they didnt have my dumplings. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Nan Zhou despite living in Tempe for 4 years. I ordered the BBQ duck noodle soup with thin hand pulled noodles, the noodles were awesome with good texture (chewy but not soggy) and the broth was ehhh, kind of watery. My friends ordered the beef noodle soup with shaved noodles and the broth was much tastier than mine. Portion size was generous for the price and the service was really quick, our food came out within 10 minutes of us ordering. Overall I'd come back but would probably order something different."}
{"text":"The customer service is terrible. The waiter spilled hot soup all over my pants and pretended as if nothing happened. He did not even offer to make me a new dish - even though half of the soup was gone and on me. This is not the place to go if you want to be treated politely and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant was by far the best restaurant I ate at during my 1-week stay in Arizona. (We ate at 7+ restaurants.) The food was great. :)"}
{"text":"Best hand drawn noodles in town. You get different combinations from beef, chicken, and seafood."}
{"text":"Simple place to grab some noodles which are fresh and chewy.  The two dishes we ordered went spectacular but enough to satisfy your Asian noodle cravings."}
{"text":"Neither warm nor friendly. Our orders were wrong, when we asked for them to be corrected, we were given attitude. Chicken and Duck soup SUPER BLAND WITH ADDITIONS. On the plus side our smoothies were excellent, and so was the coconut milk."}
{"text":"First of all I was not impressed with the serving of beverage. I ordered hot tea and they gave me tea in a plastic cold drink cup. I was expecting tea cups or at least coffee cups with a handle to enjoy sipping while its still hot. But I used napkins to wrap around the drinking cup so I can sip and worst of all they gave me a straw! Who uses straw to sip hot tea?? Noodles was suppose to be the main attraction here but the one I got was overcooked, the taste was unpleasant and chewy. So in my opinion from my experience I give this restaurant a 1 star."}
{"text":"Awesome noodles. You can tell they're hand-made, and you can even see them making them through the window to the kitchen. Their fried rice, pork ear and jiaozi are also amaaaaazing!   Don't forget your watermelon juice, too! We probably come here 2-3 times a week for that alone."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good seafood soup for a while now. I have been craving one and haven't been able to find one anywhere and then I came across this place and it was amazing! I could have cried it brought me so much joy. The good was so tasty and good portion. I was pleasantly surprised. Will defo be going back there."}
{"text":"This is the second time my boyfriend and I have been and we both absolutely love it! Quiet, calm atmosphere, and always great service!"}
{"text":"Great place, nice people,great food!!  Their noodles are amazing. Come here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best restaurant on this intersection. Very friendly staff/ownership and food is terrific.   I used to drive all the way to China Magic Noodle to get food like this. I got to say I love China Magic Noodle but this place is equivalent or better. Very beautifully built restaurant.   Bravo!"}
{"text":"In and out in less than 30 min!! For fresh noodles!!i mean, we usually take more time at a fast food restaurant!   This is our third time here in what, about a week, maybe less.   I found this place on Yelp. Easy to miss on Dobson and Main especially with so many Asian restaurants in the area. We eventually found it after looking for it for a few minutes the first time we went there. In all three times, service has been great. You walk in, get seated, you get asked for your drink order, they give you a few minutes to look at the menu and then they take your order.   This is where the magic happens! If you're lucky enough to be seated on the left side of the restaurant when you walk in, you'll get a glimpse of one of the guys inside the kitchen stretching your fresh noodles. He seems to be a master at what he does because the noodles are always the same size and look just perfect. Less than 5 minutes after that, your food is out! What!! But I just ordered!  We have tried about 4 different stir fry noodle dishes there. All of which we like. My most favorite is the beef stir fry and my husband's favorite is their House special stir fried noodles.   The noodles have a little bite to them which is exactly what they should be like. The veggies are always fresh and yesterday and today when we ate dishes with shrimp, we were happy to taste fresh shrimps! I am always skeptical when I order menu items with seafood in Arizona to be honest but here, I don't even have to think twice.   I am so interested in trying more of their menu options in the next times I visit. I also would like to try their smoothies. I noticed quite a few people order them and they look good.   Overall, very good food and service. Prices for this large potion are also very reasonable. Their stir fries are about a little over 8 bucks. For both my husband and I, we only paid $22 with tip!! The place is also pretty clean and simple. My rating for them is really 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER. The server literally told me she had no time to answer my questions because she had something to do. So then after her a different server came and he was just as rude. I asked for the manager and he said he was busy so he never came. So then I asked him another question about the food and he literally pulled his phone out of his pocket and checked it and said he would be back. Lastly, the food was gross!!!"}
{"text":"This my second time here with my family and it was delicious.  The noodles were really hand drawn.  My kids had the beef flank noodle soup, my husband had the seafood noodle soup, and I had the pan fried dumplings.  We also had the beef chow fun.  It was a little dry, but it had good flavor.  I would totally recommend this place if you were craving noodles."}
{"text":"I am sure the place is good in the day time. I would not recommend going late at night before they close. Our noodles were most likely handmade (like all of the other yelp reviews did say) but they were very cold? usually when you get pho to go or noodles to go, the noodles are fresh (and warm) when packaged separately.   My fried pork was hot yet I have feeling since the noodles were cold the pork might have been old. They also get a star for even serving us that late.   Maybe it is a lesson for when you are hangry and just play it by the first thing you see. If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Based on this visit I most likely would try a different place for hand made noodles and entrees."}
{"text":"Great food, moderate price, super fast service.  The seafood noodle soup is the best with some hand drawn noodles and a bit of added soy sauce. And the teriyaki chicken on a stick made spicy is the best way to start a meal."}
{"text":"Two stars for horrible service & less than mediocre flavor. The fresh noodles earned them the extra star.  Everyone there was rude and seemed to hate their job. When I had questions about the menu, my server just gave me attitude and was not helpful at all. I had to ask for water because she didn't check on us at all.   The sweet and sour short ribs don't taste anything like sweet and sour. It was more like hoisin sauce...yuck. There were 8 tiny pieces of short ribs with fried potatoes and steamed broccoli. It just didn't go together at all. I definitely wouldn't recommend it.  The fried tofu wasn't crispy at all and was served with a basic soy sauce.   The veggie stir fried noodles were decent but wasn't anything special and didn't have much flavor. The noodles were fresh in their defense.  Don't plan on ever going back to shitty food and service"}
{"text":"This place was really good! I didn't have high hopes in the middle of Arizona. The staff and owners don't speak the best English, which was perfectly fine because we brought someone along who could. The potstickers were delicious! Usually I'm not a fan of green onion pancake...but this stuff was finger-licking delicious. The pancakes lasted about .2 seconds at our table. I had fried noodles and they were very good- not too greasy."}
{"text":"I love the hand made noodles! The broth is delicious along with the noodles, their appetizers are really authentic and tasty! they serve fresh cook dishes! I have been here many times and not disappointed once at all!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy good, no, great tasting noodles, this is your place!  It is across the street (Dobson) from the Mekong Supermarket complex. Staff is quite friendly and 90+% of the patrons were under 30 year old asians, a good sign for authentic food.  I had my adult son with me and he thought the sauce on his dish was \"liquid gold\" of great value to him.  When no one was looking and we had just finished eating he raised the plate to his mouth and sipped the remaining juices and sighed \"I couldn't help myself, this was great!\"  He had the Seafood Stir-fried Noodles (shrimp, fish ball, scallop and crabmeat), and I had the Prawn Stir-fried Noodles.  You get to choose the hand drawn noodle, I had the \"regular\", similar to fettuccini and he had the \"thick\" that was a spaghetti as thick as a drinking straw.  Big portions, big taste, moderate prices.  I plan to bring my wife next time.  5 stars, all the way!"}
{"text":"Good \"real\" chinese food at reasonable prices. Tasty food. One of the best noodle places we have been to so far. The soup base is good."}
{"text":"Came out with their food very fast. There is a variety of noodle size they let you choose from. Very authentic and tastes home made. I took my mom here who used to be a chef, and she loved it. Also, this place is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The foods are taste good and the service is friendly?they make the food asap?dumpling and fried rice are popular"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place a while back. When we happened to be in the area, it seemed the perfect time to try this place out.  The curiosity about the hand drawn noodle was sparked by an episode of The Amazing Race many seasons ago. And sure enough, through the kitchen window you could see the cooks making the noodles. I felt like this place was going to be good from that moment! Don't be fooled by the storefront. It's in an unassuming plaza with other Asian eateries, and it actually looks closed.  Service was ridiculously fast. And 2 entrees with an onion pancake only set us back 20 bucks! Their dishes are varied and you pick how thick or thin you want your noodles. There are noodle dishes, rice dishes, soups, appetizers....all on the same extensive menu.  I had the seafood stir fried noodles. It was a huge portion of super long noodles. The flavors are sweet and salty, and blend well with each bite. The sauce is a little thick, but once you realize how deep the noodles are, you'll appreciate the extra bit of sauce.  A great noodle house. Quite a drive for us normally, but if we are ever back in that part of town, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best steamed dumplings!  So big, filled and yummy, you could make a meal of them. Chicken Fried Rice was al dente, and the wok char added the right flavor.  Walnut Shrimp was the best we have ever had. Shrimp were big, cooked perfectly, and not overly coated. Finally, the NOODLES!  That's really what we came to try.  We got the house special, which comes with chicken, shrimp, and beef.  Plenty of veggies. Served with scissors to cut the long noodles.  We got regular, but the have thin, thick, wide, or regular noodle sizes. Really happy with this choice after a busy week. We will be in regular rotation!"}
{"text":"We just ate there on June 14th evening. This food was amazing! They sell spicy seaweed Which we ate at the restaurant and also got it to go because it was so good! We ordered a soup house special beef tripe soup shock was VERY TASTY AND GOOD! The fried dumplings very amazing as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and pricing. Service is par and ambiance needs work, but the food makes up for any misgivings!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after having a couple of not so good experiences with China Magic Noodle's service, which isn't too far away. Right off the bat, we were greeted and seated in a booth! The waitress was extremely friendly and polite and repeated our order to make sure she got it right! Sometimes restaurants have to restock and the waiters/waitresses aren't so polite about reaching over you to grab things or put things back, but our waitress was extremely polite and didn't interrupt our conversations while restocking. Our food came pretty quickly and we were pleased with both the presentation and the flavor!! We also ordered a banana smoothie and it was fairly large! So don't turn away just because it's a pricey $4! We will definitely be returning and this will be our new go-to hand pulled/hand drawn noodle restaurant!"}
{"text":"I will give them 5 star, it's definitely one of the best and most traditional chinese noodle restaurant in valley. I am a big noodle lover and they have done a good job to make the noodle soft but chew, the soup is made well too with less MSG. I favorite dish is beef noodle and salt fried shrimp."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Relax)  Nan Zhou go try it When you want hand drawn noodles Nan Zhou go try it When you want to Yelp Nan Zhou go try it When you want to Yelp When you want to Yelp   Nan Zhou is a new world once you walk in to this place.  I came with a bunch of my buddies and needless to say I felt like the foreigner here.  My fellow Asian brothers were all over this place haha!  We sat and analyzed the menu; many familiar stuff from what I see, but many new indeed.  I shot for the Spicy Pig Ears and the Beef Noodle Soup, while my friends got the Seafood Noodle Soup, Singapore Noodles and some Calamari Skewers.  I didn't really care for the calamaris.  The pig ears had the consistency of a cold seaweed salad, but a lot chewier and had a major kick!  My noodle soup was perfect; hand drawn noodles in a warm beef broth littered with fresh basil and cilantros giving it an aromatic pop.  The beef itself was tender.  I had a bite of some of my friends noodles and for me it seems the noodles here were well drawn and cooked.   Overall, Nan Zhou is a nice little noodle spot and in a perfect location across from Mekong.  Classic Chinese noodle meals cooked to perfection and the service to back it up.  Food here comes on the fly!  I ordered and bang my meal was at the table within minutes! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, as a noodle house you have lot expectations from your customers, but they definitely cover any expectation that I would have. Noodles are delicious, either on a soup or in stir fry. We got today a beef noodle soup, really tasty, beef super tender and house special stir fry noodles, yummy yummy! Service was great, attentive and fast. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Best noodles in the east, hands down. XO STIR FRY NOODLES  Im craving it right now as I think about it. Great flavor, perfectly cooked noodles, friendly, very clean service & fast"}
{"text":"After I saw ROTD on Monday, I bookmarked this place. I love noodles, all kinds of noodles, and when the reviewer mentioned hand drawn noodle, I had to try...  I ordered what was on the ROTD review, #31. They have three types of noodles, flat, thick and regular.  Not knowing what to order, I just went with regular noodles.  I really liked the texture of the noodle, not perfectly consistent in size, it shows they are homemade.  I like the clear broth of #31, nicely flavored but not overwhelming at all, it complimented the noodle.  I also ordered iced tea boba after my meal and I enjoyed not too sweet at all iced tea. I don't like too sweet tea and their iced tea was just the way I liked it.  For those used to sweet tea, they might need to add sugar.  Although I didn't want to do this (load myself with carbohydrate), I couldn't help myself but order fried bums.  I always liked fried bums I had at several Chinese restaurant in Asia, and felt like feeling nostalgia. I like the taste and texture of fried bums and they served with nice (slightly sweet) dipping sauce. I felt like I was eating non sweet desert.  I saw several other noodle dish I thought was interesting. I would like to come back to try those."}
{"text":"A single order of the green onion pancake is tiny. The dumplings were good. The beef stew noodle soup severely lacked flavor. The pork chop with rice was not your typical Taiwanese style deep-fried pork chop."}
{"text":"The noodles were good. The place was also pretty nice too. Overall, I would say it was satisfactory. Usually, I like more complex broth, and theirs were pretty simple. Almost flavorless if it was anymore simple.  Having eaten at tons of noodle places, I would say that while it's good, it's not distinguishing. You do get a lot of noodles, however! And it's made in house! The meat is a little on the skimpy side.  I would suggest other places unless you are specifically there for the noodles. The big part of noodle soup for me is the broth so it didn't impress me."}
{"text":"Noodles was very good and thanks to my best waitress Jojo To and ??"}
{"text":"Ok well the fact that they know me here now is bad but I love it. The food is authentic and they are so pleasant. Pease go here!!! Worth every penny"}
{"text":"Awesome noodle house!!! The hand pulled noodles are Amazing, definitely need to try this place if you like"}
{"text":"Haven't had real hand pulled noodles or Chinese cold dishes since we were last in Philadelphia. All of them were so delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good Hand-Made Authentic Chinese Ramen, the spicy appetizer is also good. You can customize your  favorite style of ramen, thin, regular, thick, round, etc."}
{"text":"I went in and got a soup And homemade lemonade. I loved the soup I got. I also got some fried squid and it was great also. No complaints."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant! Authentic Chinese food! Handmade noodles. I Ordered the Dragon noodle soup and squid appetizer. I was glad that they offered gluten free opinions. It was fresh and delicious! The service was great too! I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"A good place for me to have lunch during weekdays. The waiter and waitress and very professional. The food been served around 5 mins after ordered. Ordered beef noodle and some chicken with rice. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"yeah! noodles.  they good  i like  mmhmm"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves delicious, good sized portions of hand drawn and hand shaved noodles.  Their appetizers are freshly prepared. I recommend their pot stickers , shredded spicy potato salad (Asian Coleslaw) and seaweed salad.  The kitchen which is open to public viewing, restaurant seating area and toilets are CLEAN.....not often found in Asian restaurants.  Eating utensils are squeaky clean and not covered in a film of oil you often find in many restaurants.  If you are hungry, want a clean Environment to eat in, enjoy a delicious meal and quiet friendly staff that won't constantly irritate or bother you this is the place."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, I had the beef noodle, they pull the noodles in front of you so that's pretty cool. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the meat was nice and juicy. The servers are warm and friendly. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Worst calamari ever. We told the manager it was not good and she told us we were wrong everybody loves her calamari, and apparently Chinese calamari is supposed to taste like rubber"}
{"text":"We keep going back when we want Chinese noodle. People here are very nice, we can actually see chef making noodles. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite noodle house in the Phoenix.  The noodles is freshly made/ pull after you order.  The taste is always good and consistent.  They have the best lamb skew as well.  The meat is very soft.  My husband almost goes there  once a week."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic hand pull noodles there is in the Phoenix area.  The location could be better, but it's a family of immigrants that just want to make money, can't blame them for choosing the plaza they're in.  Nonetheless, the food is great and they make a better stir-fry than they do soup noodles.  The price is on the low end and they provide generous portions as well.  The flavor is perfect and not overwhelming and tastes exactly how food tastes in the countryside of China.  If you're not used to this type of food, it can taste bland or overly gamey, but for those that do enjoy this style of cooking, it is exceptional."}
{"text":"The food was nothing great. Just noodles with sauce. There was metal piece in my dish"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch and it was great! I had flat noodles with pan fried pork chop and my son had oxtail soup with thin noodles. The soup was enough to fill me for the rest of the day. A very hearty broth with few greens and the pork chop on the side. I added chili oil to zip it up a notch - just my preference. It was great on its own. This is not your upscale PF CHANGS. The pork chop and oxtail has bones which need be eaten around. I think the chef in back gets a kick of taking the meat cleaver to cut the chop into about 6 pieces. We also had pan fried pork dumplings as a side which put us over the top. The meat was seasoned beautifully and the dipping sauce was excellent. These are not your average sized dumplings but a handful of meat wrapped and fried. This is the real thing made by the real people. I will definitely come back here again when in town."}
{"text":"The answer is 'yes!'. It is the food good? Yes! Is the food authentic? Yes! Is the food cheap? Yes. Should you eat here? Yes!   My wife and I don't eat at Chinese restaurants because we've lived in China too long and can't stand Americanized Chinese food: we can make it better at home. But hand drawn noodles, and knife cut noodles, the soups and the sauces that this place has -- these are things that we just can't replicate.  Try the XO spicy noodles, and the beef noodle soup. This is not crazy weird Chinese food, just really good, authentic flavors. BTW, this is why Ramen is called Ramen. It comes from the Chinese phrase 'La Mian' which means 'pulled noodle' which gets transliterated into English/Japanese as 'Ramen'.   Go and watch the cooks pull your noodles or slice them into the cauldron of boiling water. As we ate, we just kept thinking about how many times we've had food just like this in China!"}
{"text":"Chinese hand made noodles and dumplings! Very authentic, delicious. We had House Special stir fried noodles with Beef, pork and shrimp and the biggest pan fried pork dumplings Ive ever seen- gigantic! This place is just a little 'hole in the wall' in a nondescript, tiny retail strip mall but the food is reasonably priced and good. Nothing fancy. Almost didn't step inside but I'd come back again if I visit Tempe in the future."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Lan Zhou beef noodle!  I'm from China northwest the origin of this noodle so I know what it is supposed to look like. After trying the \"stuff\" they made I have to say I've never seen people make \"Lan Zhou\"noodle like that ! Wrong soup, noodle, taste and even the beef they used was wrong! Nothing was on point. It is so ironic that they put a brief history of \"Lan Zhou pulled noodle\" on the wall but never made a right noodle soup bowl as described ! It is just a normal Chinese noodle house, stop false advertising !  Special warning to Chinese folks, don't expect too much from this place."}
{"text":"I was really craving noodles one day and stumbled across Nan Zhou on Yelp, and I'm so glad I did! Their noodles are homemade (you can even see into the kitchen where they make them) and you have a choice between hand drawn, shaved, and sometimes rice noodles. Though I've only tried their hand drawn noodles so far, they have a great, chewy texture. They have an extensive menu including appetizers, dry noodles, stir fried noodles, cold dishes, noodle soups, and more. Their portions are also large for the price that you pay.   I usually opt for Noodle Soups at restaurants, but I'm super glad I tried their Noodles with Minced Pork, because it's delicious! Their deep fried buns are also soft and tasty, and are served with a side of condensed milk (I believe), which is great to balance out the oil and sauce from the noodles.  I wasn't a huge fan of their beef noodle soup. The noodles were perfect but the vegetables were off-colored and sour.   Their salt and pepper prawns were super tasty and I would definitely order those again.   Their service is quick and attentive, so it's a great place to stop by if you're in a rush! Located in the center across from Mekong Plaza."}
{"text":"Hand drawn noodle house has very good dishes. My friend  recommended them and I thought I would try it out. I ordered the Singapore stir fry noodle while my friend ordered a duck type noodle soup dish. We both wanted to try each others dishes; so we shared a little. He definitely enjoyed both dishes. I particularly liked his more than mine. Unfortunately the Singapore stir fry was a little too greasy. It was drenched and swimming in it. It had the right amount of spice and evenly distributed portions of shrimp chicken. It was just a little too greasy for me.   The service was pretty good. They were fast and attentive. The only awkward thing was they almost kept hovering or watching us eat. They lingered around to constantly check when we would finish eating. Also, you have to order $10 worth of things for you to use your card; so bring options for payment.   I'll most likely come back to try other things but this was my first impression."}
{"text":"Could work on being g a little more friendly, other than great place for noodles and shrimp soup."}
{"text":"Order the #55 Beef Stir Fry with XO Sauce. Ask for the wide noodles. Then drown it in chili oil so you can't tell if you're crying from how spicy it is, or because everything in your life seems pale and dim in comparison."}
{"text":"After eating in Nan Zhou for the first time, I thought it must have been a fluke. The noodles were delicious, and the sauce coated the noodles nicely and evenly.  I went back with 2 more companions to compare this to my first experience. It was even better than the first time. I have since eaten numerous times in this restaurant and each time the experience has been wonderful.  Most of the time I have been ordering # 58, which is a stir fry noodle with fish balls, crab meat, shrimp and scallops. In most places you get one or two shrimp and maybe one scallop. My plate had all sorts of proteins on it including lots of nice, big shrimp. You have a choice of 4 different types of hand made noodles to go with it.   Then, we started to experiment. Companion #1 wanted Chow Fun Rice Noodles with it. No problem. They had no problem substituting the asked for noodles.  Next Companion #2 wanted it spicy. Again, no problem. While the noodles were spicy, companion wanted it more spicy. Again, no problem. They were more than happy to make it as spicy as companion wanted. I tasted companions dish, and it brought tears to my eyes, yet companion was happy.  Next time I ordered Beef stir fry with XO sauce, and again it was perfect.  We have also ordered egg rolls, which were crispy without being over done, and a green onion pancake, which was a little bit dense, but nicely made.   To control the heat, we all ordered smoothies, with companion #1 getting a combination of banana and strawberry, and companion #2 getting mango. I ordered the honeydew and it was delicious.  The restaurant is very clean, and at regular meal times is packed.  5 stars for excellent food, good service, and cleanliness"}
{"text":"The noodles were decent because it was handmade; however, the taste was not special at all.  The waiters were not trained properly and had terrible customer service. Upon entering the empty restaurant, the waiter walked us to the booth with a broken lamp... If that was not dumb enough, it took him forever to give us our drinks and ask us what we wanted to eat."}
{"text":"Hand made noodles and great service, you can't go wrong with either! I had a lovely lunch with the scintillating Carina F. here. We shared the seaweed appetizer and I had the #59 beef with noodles in XO sauce. You have your choice of noodles with many of the plates including the one I ordered. I went with the hand pulled wide noodles.   The orders came out lightning fast. The seaweed was good but a bit too acidic tasting for me. A small touch of sweetness would help cut the acid and bring out more of the flavor too. The noodles were a hefty portion, with long strands of wide noodle, tender beef, and vegetables. The XO sauce was well balanced with the starchy noodle and earthy tasting beef. The noodles themselves had a good \"bite\" to them, not too soft with a slight chewiness.   I was pretty full after eating about half of the noodles so I ended up taking home the rest. Overall it was a good meal and I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Delicious food , fast service and clean environment.   All the noodles are freshly made. We also ordered the BBQ beef on a stick spicy which is so yummy !"}
{"text":"Ordered salt pepper squid, spicy pigs ears, stir fry noodles with beef, and thin hand stretch noodles lamb soup. Squid and pig ears was really good. Stir fry noodles was under cooked and under seasoned. The broth lacks flavor, broth could be a lot deeper in flavor. I've had many Asian noodle soups and this one is my least favorite. For calling themselves a noodle house, I was disappointed in the NOODLE dishes."}
{"text":"I love to come here and enjoy the Soup With Noodles and Egg. Also love their Fried Noodle Dish. Very delicious.   Service could be a bit more friendly (and attentive), but the food is quite good."}
{"text":"this is a good place to go to if you are in the mood for noodles as they have a wide variation on their menu, also a lot of appetizers to choose from as well, no desserts unfortunately but that's ok given that the portions are a good size."}
{"text":"Some dishes were very good, others were not especially good. The scallion pancakes had little flavor. The steamed pork dumplings were excellent. The salt and pepper shrimp we're excellent, whole head on shrimp with great flavor. The Mongolian beef was labeled hot and they are not kidding. About as many dried chilies as other things. Good flavor though.  The most disappointing oddly was the stir fried noodles and beef. It had little flavor. The noodles we're very good but the dish as a whole just wasn't good."}
{"text":"I have no idea what people are eating here but the reviews don't come close to matching our experience. Our food was a mix of searing hot and ice cold ingredients that were all tough. The pancake was basically greasy philo dough. We wondered if we were crazy until the waitress checked on the table next to us and we overheard \"her food is cold.\" Just pass on this."}
{"text":"This is the place to get noodles in Arizona! I used to go to Magic Noodle except I feel like they have been slumping on the noodle part! Really yummy and chewy noodles. I recommend getting the normal sized ones because the extra thick noodles are kinda harder and the texture is not as great! The flavor is amazing with a hint of spice!   If you're into appetizers, I highly recommend the spicy pig ears! They actually give a pretty huge amount too! We've been here a couple of times and had the lamb noodle soup, the normal stir fried noodles, and also other sides the Chinese pancake, fried squid, etc. those aren't worth it in my opinion!   But I'm giving this place 5 stars because I'm mostly judging the noodles! The portions are huge and the service is good and the flavor is awesome! I'd put this on top of China Magic Noodle for right now! Wish they were actually connected with the Mekong Plaza, but it's just across the street!"}
{"text":"Best noodles in the valley. I come here about once a week. Cheap, fast, and delicious. The fried chicken wings and lamb skewers are great appetizers and I highly recommend the shaved noodles with one of the soup noodles. Girlfriend lives the peanut sauce noodles with hand drawn noodles."}
{"text":"This place has a  pretty minimalistic appearance with a nice counter facade and a large window to watch the noodles being made. I came on a Sunday around noon and it was pretty busy. The place was somewhat small so there was a short wait.  At first I didn't get why this place had $$ because all of the items were under $10.  I understood once I ordered the soup noodles with lamb and the wide shaved noodles. The portion size was ok, but there was not that much lamb and most of the \"lamb\" were bones. The soup was tasty nonetheless and the noodles had a nice mouthfeel and were \"springy\" to feel."}
{"text":"Nan Zhou is nothing to write home about, however, I feel very conflicted giving this place just an A-OK. What I find most appealing about this place is that this is the type of food that reminds me of family and a humbling meal.   As a temporary transplant into Arizona, finding Asian food, let alone food that reminded me of my family back in California was difficult. However, with Nan Zhou's simple bowls of food it really tugs at my heart strings and is somewhat nostalgic.  I had lunch here and had the Beef Noodle Soup. It was simple as the menu item, noodles, broth, tender beef, some spinach and garnished with a sprinkling of cilantro. You can definitely tell when noodles are hand pulled and these were and cooked well. The broth though clear, was simple but flavorful. Nothing too complex, but warming. The pieces of beef were tender and made the bowl of noodles more hearty and savory. The greens added more to the dish and brightened up the flavors. For more flavor, dip your beef into the black vinegar with a little chili if you'd like.  Service is typical of most Asian restaurants, but decently clean and priced. Lots of Asians dining here, which indicates this place must be good. The only draw back is that this just feels like a dish you could make at home. Perhaps if I had tried their other dishes or appetizers I would bump it up to a 4, so Nan Zhou will sit at a 3.5 for me for providing a heart warming bowl of noodle soup."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great, restaurant. We went early on a Saturday evening with a group of 4. 3 of us got water and one got a soda (they don't serve alcohol). We only got 1 round of refills,  then the waiter seemed to forget about us completely.  I got the lamb skewers as an appetizer,  and they were great. Lots of cumin, well cooked, and tender. We also got the salt and pepper squid, which was thick cut and satisfying,  and the onion pancake, which was nice but a little boring after after few bites.   I got the BBQ Duck soup for my entree. The noodles were abundant and perfectly cooked, but most of the duck meat was fat or gristle,  very little actual meat. The broth was very light in flavor,  but was good after a heavy dose of soy sauce and a touch of chili sauce. Two at the table got the house noodle dish and one got the chicken stir fry noodles. The dishes all looked a bit oily, but all three cleared their plates and seemed satisfied. None of us really raved about the food, except me with the lamb. Overall,  the meal was good, but the restaurant isn't a place I'd go out of my way to check out again."}
{"text":"My guy and I came here for piping hot bowls of noodles when the weather was cooler and we weren't disappointed.  The bowls of noodles were huge and the beef in mine was tender and flavorful.  (He ordered chicken and I think mine was the better tasting option.)   The value was really good for the taste and quality of food you were served.  I really enjoyed my food, and if it weren't the middle of summer and hot and yucky outside, right now I'd be totally down for a hot bowl of their noodles.    Maybe the next time I'm sick in bed with a cold or flu I can convince a certain someone to get me a To-Go order of yummy hot noodle soup from here?    *waggles eyebrows at him*"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Best point of comparison is to China Magic Noodle House down in Chandler, which I formerly gave 5 stars, but based on dining here, downgraded that to 4.  Still good, but not as good as here.  It basically came down to the broth and value.  We ordered spicy pig ears here as well and for a little more, you get a lot more ears than at China Magic.  Same goes for the volume of the noodle bowls - paying a little more for what seems to be significantly more in volume.  We ordered the oxtail and the beef flank.  The beef flank was a little fatty and I may not order it again, but the noodles in both were nice and chewy and each had a different broth - which was a nice touch.  Mine was a deep, dark, and beefy which matched well with the beefy flank.  The oxtail had a lighter broth to go with the unmarinated oxtails.  The oxtail here were better prepared than at China Magic by a margin, but the broth for each bowl was just more flavorful.    So both are quite good, but Nan Zhou edges out China Magic by just a bit.  We have yet to try the peanut sesame noodles but they look fantastic.  We'll also have to compare their fried noodles to see if this slight edge holds up."}
{"text":"Not as good as other hand drawn noodle places and a had pricier too.  Got beef noodle soup which was pretty standard and wide noodle seafood stir fry. Incredibly oily. The scallops were very fishy. The pan fried dumplings were okay. One order included 6. The green onion pancake was small in diameter. Maybe 5 inches. Drenched in oil. Hardly any visible onion. We just returned that.   Don't expect Much from the boba. Its not chewy in the inside. Otherwise the milk tea tasted pretty standard."}
{"text":"Delicious! We tried the beef noodle Sir fry in XO sauce and the dry noodles with minced pork. Both were great, but I was particularly fond of the minced pork, which was pure comfort food. Service was super attentive. Waitress was helpful in helping us select the best noodles for each recipe (they come in 4 types, we got the regular (kinda spaghetti size) for the pork and one thick, one wide for the beef. I liked the thick best, chewy goodness."}
{"text":"Good environment and friendly staff, but the food taste nothing amazing to me. Too bad I also caught a piece of metal in my noodle, which was dangerous."}
{"text":"Their noodle soup is OK. The soup base is fine, but the noodle is under cooked. Don't even mention the service. The guy waiter has a shitty face and emtramly rude. Won't come back. This place should've been my hand pull noodle place."}
{"text":"Decided to try this hand made noodle place with the family. The service was ok. I think the hype of hand drawn noodles was too high here because not at all impressed. We all got noodle soups and a order of the beef pancakes. The noodle soup was good I think it was kinda bland and the beef pancake was small."}
{"text":"After reading a review in the paper we came here to try it out.  Yes we have gone to China Magic Noodle house in Chandler.  We are also experts on Pho.  By the way the best is across the street at UnPhogettable.  I will say that my two friends ordered stir fry and both said it was excellent and similar to CMNH.  I decided to  try the soup - specifically the Beef Flank steak soup with regular hand drawn noodles.  It may have been the worst Pho style soup I have ever had.  The broth was tasteless and the flank steak that they served in it was inedible and grizzly.    To top it off I ordered water and I think they imported it from a polluted river.  It was awful tasting.  The moral of the story is stick with the stir fry if you decide to go here.  However, there are a lot better places all around."}
{"text":"I came here this evening and WOW!b! Great food (Beef and Noodles stir fry/pan fried Gyoza) and great service(friendly, welcoming, quick). This is the place you didn't know you should go! Don't wait go here now! P.s. the Gyoza was each the size of a small child"}
{"text":"Super good, just need a little fine tuning in the service dept.  The server didn't ask what kind of noodles we wanted when we went in, literally hovered at our table until we ordered, and could care less about drinks or napkins or clearing the table.  We were the only customers aside from the table behind us, and they don't have music or anything so it was just my guest and i, listening to them.... kind of unsettling. Luckily, the food was spot on.  Regardless of whatever kind of noodle they defaulted us with, both meals were very good, very flavorful,  and nicely priced.  I will definitely go back.  Probably a million times."}
{"text":"Order everything. It will be good. I'm not even kidding, I'm have yet to have a bad food item from here. The noodles are obviously the specialty,  but the Chinese broccoli, ribs, and rice dishes are all great. Don't hesitate to try the sea food. It's pretty much as good as I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Excellent noodles! We really enjoyed the food and quick service. We tried the spicy beef wide noodles, chicken & noodles, pork dumplings and chicken fried rice!! All great"}
{"text":"The best authentic Chinese noodle house in Phoenix.   Spicy thin sliced pig ear is a great appetizer and goes well on top of the steamed rice.  The potstickers are meaty and good in size.   Service is clean and attentive. Very rarely will you have to ask for more water.    I am from Southern California and have tried a good number of noodle houses there. The beef stew here easily puts the rest of them to shame, especially with the high quality noodles."}
{"text":"I get that you don't use the highest quality meat to make soup, but the beef in the soup was mostly gristle. The broth was bland. Just not good."}
{"text":"Stopped in today, tried the house special beef combo noodle soup for lunch. I really liked it, compared to china magic, I think this place wins. Bringing the fam back offer the weekend to try the rest. Oh by the way minimum credit card charge is $10."}
{"text":"gotta say that their service is really fast! especially to people who is starving like me, well, and my friends~truly impressed by that~ the serving is really large in size, which is great~ like the fried pork dumpling and BBQ-ed lamb~ also, their peanut butter sauce noodle makes me feel that I'm eating Shaxian Noodles, which is pretty authentic, and it would be even better if the noodle would be more soft..."}
{"text":"This is very authentic Chinese food. Every dish was delicious and the price was also very reasonable. The noodles were fantastic! We also got a few smoothies, which were freshly made with high quality materials and very refreshing. The staff were very attentive and polite. Overall, our experience was excellent."}
{"text":"We got a variety of foods and we were all happy. They make their own noodles and you can tell - they are very good!  Filling! I couldn't 1/2 finish my chicken stir fry noodles #56.  We liked our appetizers also - Chinese broccoli and pancake and spring rolls. See our pictures"}
{"text":"This review is for their dumplings.  Huge, fresh made, best tasting dumplings around."}
{"text":"The portions here are outrageous. They are huge!!!! I have had this place bookmarked forever and finally went a month or two ago. They make their noodles in house and it's quite impressive to watch them making the noodles through I window into the kitchen . The husband and I had wide noodles stir fried with beef and xo sauce.....mmmmmm the noodles were super wide and super long....the sauce was yummy.... I'd definitely order this again. Funny thing is, we probably could have gotten this one dish and had enough for two people....but of course we ordered more. We tried their pot stickers, which were good but huge! Like 4-5 bites per dumpling. I think I like smaller dumplings better, but the flavor of these were good. We also got a sweet rib dish with rice that I liked but the husband didn't (it had the little bones in each piece of meat and he didn't like that). The sauce was good. We also had to get scallion pancakes, which were probably the weakest part of the meal. They just weren't crunchy enough. Anyway,for all of that, I paid around 30$ and walked out of there with enough leftovers for 4+ more meals."}
{"text":"The noodles are so good! It's super cool to watch the man hand draw the noodles.  We always get our food fast, it's always hot, and tastes amazing!  I have been here over 10 times and it has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Went to Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House yesterday with my wife.  It is an okay restaurant.  My wife ordered House Special Stir Fried Noodles.  I ordered Seafood Noodles Soup.  They were okay, but nothing really special.  Nothing that makes this place unique or special.  It is a standard Chinese restaurant.    I have traveled around the world, including many parts of Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.  Arizona is my home.  Still I do not find anything that is truly unique about this place.  It is in a good location for the kind of clientele it originally is serving, but it was a bit of a disappointment.  It may be in a good location, but it is competing with every other Asian restaurant on that strip.  The only way to survive is to be different, take calculated risks, and do some unique and novel things.  I do not see it with this place.  It is very ordinary.    They do have a well managed, clean, and efficient business, but there is no market distinction, and unless they really do something different, I see this place perhaps not being around long term, due to lack of profits.    Take some calculated risks, and do something different that highlights the regional variation of the cuisine and food that you are trying to showcase.  You can experiment a little bit.  Do some daily specials.  This is what I see as a way to compete, and perhaps be more successful."}
{"text":"Order three items..Beef noodle soup and watch the chef tossed the noodle in the air and turn them periodically and pull them so the texture will stay elastically pleasing to the mouth (well done here).  The soup broth is rather ordinary but their 3 item appetizer (pig ears, aromatic beef, and tendons) were cooked, chilled and spice to perfection.  The problem comes when I ordered the onion cake.  It came in very flaky and slightly cooked.  It tasted like chemical with full of preservatives.  I called the staff over and asked why does it taste this awful and she admit the fact that it was bought from the supermarket (oh yuck).  When you come to a restaurant, don't serve me something that I can buy from the store and heat it up and serve it to me.  Chinese food, just like Italian food, must be made fresh.  It was promptly removed from my bill but the taste of bitter preservative smelled like gasoline that lingers for hours.  Will have to give a pass to this place.  It is $2 dollars more per dish from similar restaurants. Will probably NOT return"}
{"text":"Good spot to get authentic Chinese food. They make their own noodles, so the texture and taste of noodle dishes are really outstanding. We tried their beef noodle soup, combo noodle soup, beef with XO sauce with knife cut noodles, and cold cut combo. Everything was delicious. I particularly liked the beef stir fry noodles in XO sauce.  We also had scallion pancakes; not bad for $2.50. However, I have to admit it tasted same as the ones you get in the freezer section at Asian grocery stores. I would love to return and try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Coming from a dense Asian community in Southern California where there are noodle restaurants galore, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good noodle place in Mesa. I actually really enjoyed the minced pork noodles here. The sauce was satisfying and the portion was generous. I also never would have thought I would find a place in Arizona that would sell lamb skewers! And delicious ones at that! If you've never tried them before, I recommend trying them here. The defining flavor is cumin, and it goes so well with lamb. Pan fried dumplings were also great.   I don't get to find many Asian restaurants in Arizona that impress me, but I'm glad to say that this place gets a thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Springy, meaty, hand-pulled noodles with great mouthfeel!  That's what she said.  I love me some la mian!  ??!  So what is la mien, ??, Chinese hand-pulled noodles?  As Wikipedia states, \"Lamian is a type of Chinese noodle. Lamian is made by twisting, stretching and folding the dough into strands, using the weight of the dough. The length and thickness of the strands depends on the number of times the dough is folded.\"  The art of Chinese hand-pulled noodles is about as Chinese as hamburgers are American!  It could be the three glasses of De Luze XO I've consumed so far but I reflect back on my dinner here with a happy stomach and a warm smile.    I got to try the 30. House Special Beef Combo Noodle Soup (Stomach, tripe, and beef ball), $8.50; 49. Noodles with Onion Oil Peanut Sauce, $4.95; and the 9. Spicy Pig Ear, $6.50.  Everything came out hot and sooo delicious!  As I said in my opener, \"springy, meaty, hand-pulled noodles with great mouthfeel\" all around!  Every dish left me craving for more.  You know a noodle has great elasticity when you try to tug a strand free with your chopsticks and it fights back --- resulting in a lot of peanut sauce in the hair!  I love it!  Dare I say, the quality of their noodles are much more impressive than another east valley hand-pulled noodle shop?  YES!  Anyways, on top of amazing food, the restaurant is pretty nice:  comfy booths, younger staff, nice A/C, and a delish-looking Instagram on top of all that!  Unsure of what you want?  Ask the staff!  Come here for oodles of great noodles!"}
{"text":"Took my wife, mother and step-father 5/28 specifically for the hand drawn noodles.  After reading reviews on Yelp I wanted to the try Pig's Ear.  My step-father is a vegetarian and had a potato appetizer that he said was delicious.  My wife had a lamb appetizer that was really good also.  The noodle dishes were the best I've ever had.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"#33 house special noodle, either hand drawn or shaved noodle are great. The soup base is fantastic, always try to figure what kind of spice they use to make the soup, and the sliced beef coming with noodle is highlight."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best ramen and noodles I've ever had. We love watching them make the noodles through the window. My kids love it here. We come at least once a week."}
{"text":"While I travel I am always looking for solid Asian food.  It sadly is not as easy as you'd think.  Maybe it's because I am a north easterner and have preferences based on that locale...whatever it's the way I think!  Man Zhou was a great find.  Simple and clean, filled with all types of people and a friendly staff.  I had two dishes.  First was a cold bean curd appetizer.  I've never had it this way, only steamed wrapped around a delicious pork and shrimp dim sum dish but this was surprising.  It was firm to the bite.  There was a light marinade on it with a few soy beans and veggies.  I dipped it into chili oil and loved the texture and flavor.  Then I had what I came for - a hand puked thick noodle with a very spicy sauce. It was a dry noodle dish with house special Sa Te sauce!  Wow! So many flavors, sort of reminded me of a peanut sauce but way kicked up.  It was noodles, cilantro and sauce. Period.  But so good.  The noodles were the star, my choice was the thick ones.  Chewy and firm with a great chew to them.  All together it was 11 bucks with hot tea and water.  I will be in Tempe for work often and will definitely head back there."}
{"text":"Best noodles I've ever eaten.  Wow.  Just Wow.   I've had soups and stir fry there and I've been telling everyone I know and even strangers about the place.  FANTASTIC!   Amazing - you gotta try it."}
