{"text":"Wow Flame hands down has to be the best spot for shawarma lovers. It's above your average shawarma with more affordable prices. Everything is healthy and made fresh, the staff are always friendly and amazing and if you love shawarma like I do then this is definitely the place for you!"}

Great portion sizes that will definitely leave you feeling full and satisfied, worth every penny! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time trying out the place and it was an OK experience..
Portions are big and food made fresh to order 
Ordered lamb and they said they ran out
Two young guys behind the counter and they seemed a little over whelmed with just a few customers.
Communication between the two guys is not the greatest..
Pretty descent place and would recommend and come back again 
But the two young guys behind the counter need to be re trained on customer service and knowledge of how to make orders with out missing items or how they are made.
They should never short a customer and say that they forgot to mention it or mention that they ran out..
That's my 2 cents"}
{"text":"Not quite happy with their food
Everything is way overpriced especially the salads which have barely any meat"}
{"text":"Mediterranean as it's referred to is one of my go to quick eats cuisines these days.  I'm loving the fact that they are becoming more available because I love this type of food for several reasons.  The food is fresh (usually), you get good portions (usually) and the food is good value (usually).

Flame is more of a fast food, take out type of place.  While there's a dining area their \"echelon\" is more like a food court or food truck kind of level.  To me, it doesn't stand out as high(er) quality or portion sizes are not superior necessarily.  It's more of a fast food type fare.  

I am almost obligated to mention Mr. Zagros because for me they are probably the best in the entire area for all around value, quality, portion size and freshness.  Flame IMO falls below all four of those aspects in comparison not to mention Mr. Zagros makes their own bread.

Recently I've been frequenting a Mediterranean place closer to home (Palmyra) in what is technically Etobicoke (feels like Mississauga but it's not) and after going there just the evening before and it being in my fresh in my memory it's honestly not a close comparison.

The prices for most plates at Flame are pretty much all around 13 or less but all around they just don't seem to be as good as Zagros and are a whole several notches below Palmyra.  For the same money or a nominal dollar or two I can get almost double the food which is much fresher and overall better IMO at Palmyra.  OK they aren't in the same hood but Zagros is in the same area.

My wife had their chicken shawarma and I had gyros as a change.  The gyros wasn't freshly carved (where did it come from???), the chicken was ok but not amazing and I found the salad to be boring and too generic.  The rice was decent but when the rice is the best part of the entire dish there's something lacking IMO.  

Villa Madina or Shawarma Grille Xpress which are sort of the same type of place IMO are both better than Flame in freshness and quality as well.  So when trying to slot Flame into what kind of place they are, I put them as a \"food court\" type place but nothing special that makes them stand out beyond a place like Palmyra or Zagros.  They are definitely in two different leagues with the only price difference maybe a few dollars for plates while the overall difference and experience is really night and day."}
{"text":"Food was not good at all. Placed order through app, when called to follow up nobody answered phone, when they finally did the lady said she was busy...."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here to grab some lunch, try the new place in the area and oh my goodness. The place looks great and one of the first open units in a brand new plaza, on the inside is very nice and new, lots of selection, and so fresh! We met the owner of this location Rosa and she was so sweet and helpful, knowledgeable, and very friendly. The food was made right before our eyes and it tasted absolutely amazing. The chicken shawarma was great, tasted like a bit of nutmeg and all the toppings I got made for the peeeerfect pita. Probably my favourite one ever. My sister got the chicken shawarma salad and it's just as good and fresh. We also tried the falafel which was delicious and made from scratch right before our eyes. As fresh as it gets! I have to say I'm so excited to have a place like this right in our neighborhood with amazing fresh food, healthy options, and with very friendly staff! They also have Instagram @flame_mg and I will definitely be keeping up with them. Thanks Rosa and the team!"}
{"text":"Great food! Quick and simple. The menu is small but to the point. The salads are fresh made to order, the meat is delicious and well cooked.
During a few visits we've noticed our portions were off at times, something that could be improved and has been brought to the attention of the owners. Owners are great, their cool, laid back  and professional and best of all on site.
Their new here and so is the staff, so we can expect some adjusting, but in time I'm sure it will be a hit and a regular spot for many in the area! 
We're able to meet my gluten sensitivity. Never had any reaction. And will be back again when craving some shawarma on salad!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here whether it be new kitchen staff, lower quality meat or something else but the quality has progressively gotten worse 

There is absolutely zero reason to eat at this establishment 

It's that bad especially considering all the competitors so close with better everything 

Avoid"}
{"text":"Sadly the consistency of this place has taken a sharp downward turn.

If you go at certain times (lunch hour) and have certain staff tend to you, the food is just fantastic.

if you go at other times (2:30-3:30 on a weekday, hey some of us work weird schedules!) and get certain OTHER staff members, the food is borderline inedible, and has given me food poisoning once.

I suppose it's because the demand has dropped off in this area at certain times of the day (or it's just certain staff members being lazy) but at some point they stop carving the chicken shwarma fresh off the spit and instead have a giant pile of it sitting on the collection shovel and they throw it on the grill to reheat it.

Please don't misunderstand me, this is common practice with all shwarma places, I'm well aware, and done in moderation it's totally fine, and ensures the chicken on the spit is getting the proper cook. I get that.

But this? It's hard, chewy, crumbly, greasy and lacking in all the subtle flavors. It hurts my stomach. And has made me sick on one occassion when I was too stubborn to just stop eating it.

They take this technique/practice WAY too far here (again only at certain times of the day) and have made it terrible.

If you don't have enough business coming in to warrant your food standards being kept up, close down during those hours. Otherwise your whole business will suffer as word of mouth, like this, from loyal customers, like me, will keep coming in.

This area needs places like Flame, I want it to succeed, when they are good they are great. But this is just super disappointing."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend cause we were in the area. First impression, the place is clean and new. I ordered the shawarma dinner and overall was very underwhelmed. Everything was bland and didn't have much flavour.  It was just OKAY. Nothing more, nothing less. Would recommend Mr. Zagros."}
{"text":"two young guys behind counter. seemed somewhat overwhelmed. lacking customer service skills. 
Only had chicken for Souvlaki dinners, or pitas. He kept saying \"that's all we have\"
So I ordered chicken souvlaki dinner, expecting what the overhead photo showed: CHICKEN, rice, potato, salad.  after waiting ten minutes, I get it and No potato, or mention of its absence.   I asked if potato is under rice or salad, he looks embarrassed and says they ran out.   Annoyed he hadn't told me when I placed order.  Order before mine couple spent $45 and they shorted them on the French fries \"oh sorry\"- \"we forgot to make them\"  
  The smallest plastic fork, and Styrofoam containers to dine in,  needs improvement.  We tried it based on previous Yelp reviews. Regret that decision."}
{"text":"Okay, so I just returned from my lunch outing and man am I impressed! 

We walked in and the guy running the show was so attentive and polite. He wasn't pushy with the menu and waited patiently for my friend and I to decide. He kept us in the loop about wait times and offered in future for us to call ahead and so we could make good use of our lunch hour (the souvlaki takes about 5-8 minutes to cook). 

Another lady came out and asked us how we had liked the service thus far and was making sure we had been taken care of. 

Now to the food. DELICIOUS. Absolutely delicious. The garlic sauce and the tzatziki were perfect atop of my chicken shawarma salad. The toppings were fresh and in small bite-size pieces. They also mixed the salad thoroughly before topping with the chicken which I really liked. The price was good, too. Chicken shawarma salad, four falafels with hummus and a water came to $15. You may be asking yourself why that is a good price; it's good because it's going to feed me for dinner as well. My to-go container looks untouched. I'm going to say it... there is a sh*t ton of food sitting on my desk right now.

All that being said, my one suggestion would be some type of carbonated water like Perrier or even club soda to be made available in the drink cooler.

Can't wait for dinner!"}
{"text":"My friend was hungry after an intense leg day at the Goodlife next door, so we stopped by after checking yelp for mediterranean food. We both ordered our own Chicken Pita, $6.99 each. There was only one person working at the time. He had earbuds in his ears but he immediately greeted us and took our orders. I paid with a credit card and he didn't ask me if I wanted my receipt before moving on to processing my friend's payment, and he wasn't able to issue a receipt retroactively...when I asked for it, he didn't seem to know what to do and ended up giving me my friend's receipt, which she paid in cash, so it was a haphazard attempt to rectify the issue. It wasn't enough to ruin my night, so I shrugged it off and took a seat. He eventually called us up about 5 minutes later. The meat isn't carved fresh (in fact, I didn't even see any spinning like I do at other mediterranean places), but it was juicy, so no complaints here. I don't recall what I filled my pita up with exactly, and it was wrapped in a clever way (unwrap from the thickest part, not the curled up end) to reduce messiness while eating. I remember my pita was warm, the meat was juicy, and the tzatziki hit the spot. 

The only issue is that mediterranean isn't my favourite type of food, so I won't be back too often, but I can still recommend the place for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a one star because I was sick for two days after eating it. I had a chicken shawarma dinner. Seemed tasty but I don't think it was very fresh. The salad was meh! I do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Although I like this little shawarma place, it is not as good as its newer location at Weston road and Major Mack. 

Perhaps it was just a miss day for me, but I tried this location out on a Saturday afternoon and it was just okay. They put a lot of tomato and lettuce as filler, barely any chicken, the hot sauce tasted like lime juice. Edible but not good. 

The customer service sucked too. Don't know if they had new employees running the place, had never seen them there before. It usually the owners running it, who are nice and friendly. 

Anyways, don't come here and have a mediocre experience. Maybe try their new location not much further away from here (literally down the road) for a MUCH better experience."}
{"text":"Pretty standard shawarma place. Brand new and clean. Prices are good and portions are big. 

The owners here are extremely nice and own another location on Islington north of Rutherford. That's how I found about this new location. 

Definitely worth trying out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the gyro meat here. Sure it isn't carved fresh but it wasn't dry like it can be sometimes when it's on the heater all day. It is super juicy and flavourful. The dinner comes with rice and salad. The portions are generous. I also tried the samosas which are nice. Again, not dry and not too spicy. And they are quite large! Staff are really nice and even threw in a couple extra samosas at the end of the day for free. Garlic sauce is delicious and not too overpowering. Would definitely come again. Been hoping to try the calamari dinner!"}
