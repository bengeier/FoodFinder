{"text":"Can only speak to the donairs; a Manager at my workplace recommended the place when I mentioned I was out of ideas for lunch hour. This place was discretely tucked into the industrial park two blocks away. Compared to the donair place next door, they are head and shoulders above. Clean, open with a weirdly homey feel because of the new cabinetry behind the counter. The donair I had was fresh, tasty and I was delighted to see that the meat had been scraped and put into a container in advance, then scooped and served in healthy portions. They didn't fiddle around with a scale and pluck stuff back because it was 10grams over the weight limit, an annoying practice too many other donair places do. Otherwise, fairly routine, with an option to grill afterwards. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"this place is still awesome - they've upgraded their outdoor patio which (although it backs onto Barlow Tr) is pretty great. This place is really trying and the staff are always friendly"}
{"text":"Since coming from Toronto and looking for a great shwarma place in Calgary, my search came to an end when I heard about this place from my friend. The staff is friendly, but the thing that kept me coming back is their meat pies. It's the best thing you can buy here and the value is amazing for what you get and you can fill up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Been 3 times always fresh alway excellent! They put so much meat on donairs you have to ask them to stop. If you love donairs this is Calgary BEST!"}
{"text":"Delicious place to have donairs and chicken shawarma. Their salads are also great. Prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to grab a bite in the NE."}
{"text":"This place has a very friendly staff and delicious authentic Middle Eastern food. Their falafel is spectacular. They are family operated and very personable. Pretty much ate there every day for my work week in Calgary. Thank you so much for making me feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Great service , great good , and great place to get away and feel like you are in a cafe in Beirut ! Totally love it! You have to check out this place! Although yelp has the wrong map, this place is just off of Barlow trail and 37th ave ne. Across from Shaw and next to Bingo palace ."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I can never have too much of Lebanese fusion and the owners are such nice people"}
{"text":"Probably the best place for this kind of food in Calgary. Friendly staff & great food. Fresh vegetable, lot of meet, meals are flavorful and tasty. We go there almost every week - 100% recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place  I eat here on average 1-2 times per week  The food is fantastic  The people are super friendly  The portions are huge  The prices are great!  As mentioned I eat here a lot.  It is consistent and amazing, I have never been let down.  Come try this place for yourself! I'm positive you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Fast service. Friendly. Authentic food. I tried the chicken shawarma and was very pleased. I'm going to try the falafel next time I visit. And there certainly will be a next time. The location is a little weird though. It's in the back of a business center looking place. Makes it a little hard to find. But worth the hunt."}
{"text":"Chicken shwarma wrap good and hearty. It's all grilled for a slightly crunchy wrap which is a nice touch. I'd say this seemed more like an above average fast food joint which wasn't the impression I originally had before I got there. Great friendly staff. Baklava was excellent!"}
{"text":"Not the best placed location for a restaurant but there's plenty of parking! Found myself on a Saturday looking for lunch and spotted this place off of Barlow. The inside is top notch! Spic and Span clean, with a beautiful mural.  I got their regular beef. First off, HOLY MEAT PILE-ON! Their Regular size is most places jumbo. The meat was ok; it had a different spice to it(maybe nutmeg??) nothing wrong with it, just different. Worth checking out if you're in NE Clgary driving on Barlow."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I had a Shwarma and it's the best I've had in years. I had all the vegetables with garlic sauce and a little bit of Siracha. I wasn't sure how I was going to like the beets with it but they were delicious. I'm definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Shawarma plate is delicious.   Chicken is not fatty like most places.   Rice is seasoned beautifully.   Probably some of the best Lebanese 'fast food' around here.   Second time eating here.   Very nice customer service.    Clean new place.   Check it out.   You can feel the love of cooking in the food."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma restaurant I've found in Calgary! I had the calzone shawarma with chicken and beef and it was not only enormous but delicious!   I Highly recommend this place! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for showing me this place when I was searching for a place to eat in the NE!  I ordered the beef calzone, which I thought was unique. Just like any shawarma or donair places, they prepare everything in front of you so the massive calzone was baked fresh which I love. My favorite part was the crust as it was crispy, and not hard nor chewy. The beef was thinly sliced and wide like at Jimmy's. They put the meat into containers to keep it warm after it's been sliced, which is a little off-putting for me.  I would've liked the calzone more if the beef was seasoned more. There was enough garlic sauce when it was put in the calzone but I didn't taste the sauce after it was baked, so a lot of the flavor came from the vegetables, which seemed and tasted fresh.  I would've given this place 3.5 stars. Gonna try the chicken calzone next time!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. The food is really good and the service is great! Every time I come here it's lined up to the door! but the line up always goes fast!  The servers all seem very nice and there is allot of options for everyone!   Very weird location but honestly some really good food!"}
{"text":"I'm always willing to try out a Lebanese / Mediterranean place as I'm a huge fan of donairs, shwarma's etc.  They are usually quick and healthy alternatives to the regular fast food fare in Calgary.  Back to the review.  I'm happy to say I have found a new donair place that has a fantastic donair meat.  The flavour here rivals any that I have ever tasted.  They are quick, friendly and have 2 prep stations... yes, 2 prep stations.  Most places only have one.  So, if you see a line up at lunch don't fret as you can get in and out in no time.  I also like that they have 3 sizes of wraps to choose from so if you're not that hungry you can opt for the small and save a few bucks as well.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good shawarmas!! They are also very quick when you order to go and they have some delicious juices and beverages worthy to try .. service was very friendly and prices reasonable .. if you are looking for a quick, tasteful and good lunch, his is a good option in the area.. I would definitely go back if I'm around and i need a fast lunch ..."}
{"text":"Ordered a fusion pita with all the vegetables, sweet, garlic and hot sauce. The meat was flavorful, the vegetables were really fresh. The sweet sauce was a little too sweet for my preference...would be better if it was tangier I think. Their kitchen and prep station is very clean and well kept. Will go back to try other things on the menu. Oh, they only take debit and visa. No MC or AMEX."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Clean and bright restaurant. The Shawarma was delicious, filling and a great value. I'll definitely be back."}
