they called today and said they were closed for good
Skip It!"}
{"text":"M. Bistro is the place where we bring visitors.  Not because we INTEND to, but we slept late because we were up talking until 2:00 last night, and we overslept this morning, and now we're hungry and where can we go?  And M. Bistro has excellent brunch food at mid-tier prices, and such a HUGE selection of Brunch - seriously, the thing covers about fifty feet by thirty - that everyone WILL find something to eat. 

You come here, they've got the guy making omelettes, the shrimp by the trayful, the pre-scrambled eggs (which, surprisingly, are not nasty from-a-box mixmakers), the waffles, the sweet rolls, the bacon, the everything.

The only real ding I'd give is that the bacon is limp and generally not particularly thick.  On the other hand, if you put butter on one of their stickybuns you will know what true love is.  

The atmosphere is also really, really nice - it's a kind of classical, faux-European design with columns and walls with fake aging, and beautiful white tablecloths and helpful servers.  It's an upscale place, but they will take morons slouching in in T-shirts.  I know, 'cause we've done it.  Don't you do it, though, they're nice people.  

The reason I write this is because the delightful Kimberly M. just posted her list of \"The Best Brunches in Cleveland,\" and I was all like, \"Where's M. Bistro?\"  So take that as you will; I saw a list missing M. Bistro and leapt to the keyboards to write a review.  If that's not a recommendation, I don't know what is.  

P.S. - They do dinners, which were also pretty good when we did it, but I haven't had dinner there in three years.  If it's as good as the brunch, though, you can expect the same - just a hair overpriced, but well worth your attention."}
