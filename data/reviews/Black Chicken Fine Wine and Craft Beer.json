{"text":"What a great place to relax and drink some excellent wines and some craft beers! Chef Jason serves up gourmet finger foods in a comfy atmosphere. Love it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Black Chicken is a great addition to Waxhaw! Perfect for having a few Craft Beers with buddies or a nice date with my lovely wife. The food is amazing and a welcome change from the standard local choices. The service and staff are friendly and warm. Very happy we have them in town and wish them the best of success!"}
{"text":"This wine bar is a great addition to downtown Waxhaw. They also have a huge variety of craft beers. I've been here 3-4 times already and the experience has been excellent. When it cools down a bit in the Fall ill take advantage of their outdoor patio."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy this restaurant. The food is excellent and there is always a fine wine or beer that we can enjoy with our meal. If I could say something to help them, is to encourage the waiters to be more attentive to all the guest, not just those (maybe friends or regulars) at the bar. I would say we are regulars and sadly to this day, we are never greeted with a warm greeting, unlike other restaurants. Even so, I give it 5 stars, because of the food, it is mostly a good time (waiters included) and they are doing better than most of the restaurants in Waxhaw. If they would correct this, it would be wonderful for us, but mostly for them, guest would feel it and decide to come here more than other restaurants. I would not want to deter anyone from coming here though. You will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - this review is based on beverages alone.  

Waxhaw is such a quaint town with a young and artsy vibe, I fell in love with every place I went especially Black Chicken.  Located next door to a brewery, you'd like a place like this would have a tough time surviving...wrong!  You walk into this small and unassuming place and you're transported to your favorite small pub.  

They have several tables set up for people to sit at, as well as a small bar in the rear of the establishment.  We chose to sit at the bar and ordered a few rounds of beer.  My favorite was the Wooden Robot Brewery \"Good Morning Vietnam.\"  

I loved their wall of craft beer.  All beer is reasonably priced and is comparable to national chain prices.  I picked up a few bottles on my way out.  I can't wait for my next visit to Waxhaw so I can return to Black Chicken."}
{"text":"Great place, I always enjoy myself when coming here whether it's for wine or food.  Great seasonal options and I love going in the winter for their root salad and goat cheese, it's amazing!  So many wonderful wine and craft beer options."}
{"text":"Just happened to walk by and was such an inviting atmosphere inside.  Really neat wine bar and good local draft beers on tap.  Not very big but that is what gives it charm.  Super nice staff."}
{"text":"A.may.zing. How lucky are we to have such a fabulous place just a mile from our home! We had really great wine and a delicious  meat/cheese plate. Great atmosphere and service too! Don't wait visit today!"}
{"text":"Awesome little shop. I have never ordered food here but stopped in several times on my way home to pick up a nice wine to go with dinner. They have a nice selection of boutique wines that are not exorbitantly priced.  They also have a great selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, service is great too. Wine and beer selection is always solid. Seriously the best sandwiches money can buy... not joking!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to be able to have a nice dinner of 'small plates' and a bottle of wine that is less than most grocery stores!  Shocking.... wine I paid $24 for at 201 Central was $22 at Black Chicken.  Friendly.... owners are always on the floor looking out for things.  Good food too."}
{"text":"Great little place to get together with friends and have a glass of wine or a beer. The service has always been friendly, every time I have visited, but I wasn't too impressed with the pricing of the food. The pepperita flatbread was like a cracker topped with tomato paste and a few thin slices of mozzarella. It wasn't awful, but I guess I expected more for $12.50.
I will definitely be back, but not for the food."}
{"text":"I rated this place a 1 because of the terrible customer service. Me and my family came here to have dinner and had to wait almost 40mins to when we decided to just pay for the drinks and leave. I have no problem waiting for food but keep the communication open so we can know what we dealing with. It's not like the place was super packed. After we were served our drinks, the waiter just didn't check on us anymore. He didn't say hey you want another drink?  Or Sorry for the wait, you have about this amount time left til your dinner is ready.... none of that. And when I said hey I'm just gon pay for the drinks and check out, He just gave me the receipt and didn't even bother to ask me why? Like who does that? It's obvious you see i have a problem and you didn't even care. What a shame. Never going to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  
Britney greeted us and explained how everything works here.  She is sweet and so adorable!  
I was debating between a Pinot noir and a red blend, so she offered me a sample of each.  Both were very tasty, and I decided on the Pinot.  Hubby ordered an IPA and was happy with it. 
We ordered a few bites: pimento cheese dip w little cracker dipper things and a charcuterie plate.  Dip was as good as they come, charcuterie plate had a nice variety and decent amount of snacks. 
They have a decent selection of wine/beer for purchase to takeout or drink there for a small corkage fee.  
Overall, great little place with a chill vibe due to the staff and offerings.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"No negatives about this place except limited seating at busy times. I love this place and attempt to taste something new each time I go. So jazzed that Waxhaw has such a nice and unique place to relax and enjoy good foods and wines. I KEEP forgetting to stop here when I'm wine shopping instead of at Harris teeter!!!!!  I'm too lazy to drive to 201!!  Lol. Five Stars for sure"}
{"text":"I am in love with the Black Chicken Waxhaw.  Sorry they win! Best place in Waxhaw! First of all, they are warm and friendly, second- the selection of wines ( either by bottle) or by the glass- and the beers are amazing.  The food is always always amazing.  It all pairs well with the wines and the beers.  The prices match the quality.  I love in the summer the Rose' by the glass.  And they have specials sometimes during the week and sometimes great beer dinners!  Love my Black Chicken!"}
{"text":"Stop allowing smoking on the patio!  I love everything about this place except the smoking on the patio. It's tiny enough...so send the smokers to the street and let people eat on the patio without the gross stench. Other than that...sweet little vibe, great food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. I had a small salad with homemade ranch dressing, side of chicken and pancetta skewers and a pimento cheese panini all were darn good. One of the owners Melanie stopped and spoke with us. She seemed to be very interested in our opinion and whether we enjoyed the menu. The beer and wine selection is excellent and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting certainly worthy of a visit for couple of beers, or wine if that is your 'thing' and a meal. We need establishments like this in Rock Hill."}
{"text":"Offshoot of the original. Love this place in the afternoon! !!  First class food, Jason is here Wednesday pm's.  Sommelier extrodinaire.   Wine advice to every question and advise you can take to the bank!  Meeting friends for dinner tonight..."}
{"text":"Our party of 10 had a great time at Black Chicken for girls night out. In addition to the great company, we also enjoyed a lovely wine selection and yummy eats. I had the Panini with cheddar and raspberry thyme preserves and it was fantastic. Several people had various flatbreads and they all looked great. The poached pear salad looked good, too.  

It's a very small place so there's limited seating, but we went on a Wed night and had no problems. The restaurant was spotless and the service was friendly. Great location with ample parking, too. 

I can't wait to go back with my husband!...I see a date night in my near future."}
{"text":"Met friends for lunch today based on a recommendation from a friend. My flatbread was cold and not very tasty. I think its a great place for a glass of wine or beer."}
{"text":"Love this quaint wine bar. The staff is amazing, the wine and beer selection has something for everyone, the menu is eclectic--large, shareable portions and delicious! Our go to place for girls night out or midweek date night."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Food is above your expectations and beer and wine prices won't shock you.  Friendly environment with down to earth people working.  Awesome Playlist going the whole night."}
