{"text":"Absolutely AWFUL, I got the Chicken shawerma platter and it smells and tastes rotten... As in expired food.... I am Egyptian i knoooow what shawerma is like and that was compost.... Outrageous. I also got simid which is supposed to be soft and succulent it was stale and rock hard instead... First and last time to get food here"}
{"text":"I just had my first shawarma, and I was so disappointed of the food and service.
My background is Turkish and I know the real deal.
1.The meat wasn't a fresh cut. The beef oven was turned off and they reheated a piece of meet and cut them into small pieces.
2. The service was friendly but inexperienced and very slow.
3. The shawarma was very cold.
4. I paid for this shawarma $9 and after my second bite I trowed it into the garbage.

My suggestion is stay away and find an other place to eat. I'm 100% sure they won't last more than 6 months."}
{"text":"Even though the area was packed (El Rancho, a few bars) and there was a lot of foot traffic on the street, this restaurant was completely empty. Either way, I didn't think much of it and em decided to give it a try. 

The one thing I liked was that their menu had prices that were rounded - $8, $10, etc. They strategically priced the items so it came out at an even dollar value. I did find a spelling mistake on their menu, which I thought was fairly amateur... I mean, just take some time to proof read it before you advertise!

Anyways, I got the chicken shawarma sandwich, which comes to $8 flat. The service was extremely slow, they take forever to make the sandwich and they are very picky on the toppings too. The meat didn't taste very fresh, and was a bit on the harder side. 

Overall I didn't really enjoy this sandwich, and I won't be back for seconds. Now I understand why it was so empty on a Saturday night..."}
{"text":"Worst shawarma I've had in Toronto, probably the worst of my life anywhere. 

Terrible food, overpriced, this place is empty for a reason"}
{"text":"Came here with the family and none of us have experiences such a terrible restaurant. I do not recommend it to anyone- they are very inexperienced & food is absolutely tasteless

-We asked for a gyro plate and litterly got a plate of gyro strips, no veggies no sauce or anything and just bread to make it a sandwich on our own without anything else. 

- the hummus was dry and was obviously just taken out of a can  and completely flavourless- we even had to ask her to add oil on top of the hummus. 

- the falafel tasted like it's been out for days and it was hard and tasted terrible. 

- the soup is terrible as well they destroyed the concept of Mediterranean food completely ... if your in the area just don't eat there & save your money!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here on Uber Eats. Worst decision ever! The food is over priced and poor customer service. I called to just get one item removed from a shawarma wrap because the person had a severe allergy to tomatoes but the person who asnwered said that he's not making a new one and just pushed the order through. Most rude person ever! I suggest not ordering from here on uber eats or anything from here at all!"}
{"text":"I was craving a falafel on my way home and decided to try this place. Located on the north side of College Street, in what is essentially a row of restaurants, it is a typical shawarma place. There a lot of tables facing the street and then the counter in the back corner with the grill and dryer behind that. Had falafel that was overpriced at $ 8.00 and over salted. If you are going to sell food to the public, taste it before you sell it. I threw most of it out because it was inedible. Before you sell something do your market research and find out the prices of your competitors. $ 8.00 is crazy for a falafel sandwich. With food and prices like this they won't be around long."}
