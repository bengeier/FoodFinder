{"text":"Toronto and all of its charms awaited, but first I needed a quick bite to eat.  Nothing fancy, just some valid calories flowing through the Vital Systems.    May's Deli is basically attached to my hotel and seemed not too busy on a Monday afternoon.  A quick review of the menu showed exactly what I needed:  Sandwiches.  Specifically, a ham and cheese!  Add some chips and a drink.  The lady behind the bar responsible for building my sandwich was quick and friendly and built a perfect H&C Sammy for me.  Since it was past the usually lunchtime rush, I found a seat and sat down to enjoy.  This does seem like the type of place that could become a bit crowded over lunch, so you might not get a seat (get it to go), but the ordering and paying system seems pretty well oiled, I doubt that there is ever a serious wait for food here."}
{"text":"This place is your regular local run shop without any big brand. Food is made by the lady in the location.  Its like ur corner diner which has morning fresh coffee,  cereal, muffins, bagels and egg and cheese sandwiches. Fresh fruit (apples, bananas) and even cut up fruits and veggies.  For lunch she has soups and sandwiches. The place even carries chips and cookies and granola bars and mint and gum.  I have had good quick service always. It isn't very expensive. Ok maybe its more expensive than tim Hortons.  But it has a non commercial feel and taste is good and not industrial."}
{"text":"The folks at May's are friendly and efficient. The food is mostly fresh. Some of the food, like the schnitzel looks a bit frozen/microwaved, but their club special is delicious and real turkey, not deli poultry. Soup seems to be a big fav with the lunch crowd.  My sammy is a Toasted Western on Multigrain with cheddar, tomato and bacon--hold the butter but mayo--to go.  About a dozen tables, mostly for two but a couple for four. 12-2 is a bit of a zoo but the line goes quick.  Decent spot for a quick bite.   Some comfy chairs in the walkway...and now free Wifi."}
{"text":"Convenient for those who work in DBRS Tower -Â but thoroughly unspectacular. May's Deli offers simple sandwiches, mediocre soup and extremely overpriced salad. It's not that the food is bad - it's really neither here nor there. It's just that the fare is almost identical to what you could make at home with a loaf of bread and some canned fish; only at quadruple the price.  The three food courts nearby aren't fantastic, but they're certainly better than this, and not much farther away. Go there instead."}
