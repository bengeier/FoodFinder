{"text":"Bonne sandwicherie. Le sandwich au poulet tandori est bien assaisonné avec des olives et du fromage. Essayez aussi les sauces à fritte de la Centrale Bergham."}
{"text":"The. Best there many that tried to copy bit the the original can never be replaced i go to this place since they opened and now they are all over montreal and laval an Ontario. Its my fav"}
{"text":"I come here all the time because i live around the corner, the food is good but overpriced. Hangover food more than anything. I just xame on here to say that they usually take a long time...by long i mean minimum 10 mins. Avwrgae 15. Right now its been 25 mins ive had time to go outside and smoke, and even to download this app just to write this review. They are unapologetically slow and don't care. Several people have complained and i still don't have my food. Imagine if i was at my work lunch break....ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great late night food spot in Montreal. Gets really packed after midnight. I would definitely recommend their sandwiches. Filling and will help with absorbing the toxins you ingested all night ."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because it is very expensive. Worth it? I would say not really for that price. Too overpriced."}
{"text":"Really good sandwich. My first time here and I got the philly. Very big portion. Fries are made fresh but wish they were thicker. They also have a indoor playground for kids which is great. Will come back to try there other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Before I get to the food, I just want to point out that the young man taking the orders was a 5 Star General...top lad! He definitely recognized we were newbies and was super patient and extremely helpful with explaining the menu.  I ordered the \"Biggy\" their version of the Big Mac and I'll tell ya what, it was the bees knees! It was huge, I had to use a knife and fork and that says a lot cause I have a big fat mouth. And the dude at the cash let me try 3 of their sauces to dip my fries in and it was heavenly. My buddy ordered \"The Red\" which is a play on tandoori chicken on delicious flat bread. It was awesome even though the chicken was a bit grisly.  My only grievance(s) was the time it took to prepare. We waited over 25 minutes for our order and I think it had to do with a group of guys that looked like they didn't work there were hanging in around the kitchen, back door and kept chatting up the employees.  A definite must try if you're craving a better fast food alternative."}
{"text":"Good burgers place (fast-food quality), they have alot of choices and very generous with their portions.  I take this place over McDonald or Burger King anytime If you want to grab a fast lunch."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are juicy and delicious, fries are crispy and the sauces are amazing. THE place to go in the AM. But the customer service is even better!  One time I simply asked for a to go bag for my sandwich and fries and remaining sauces. But what happened was this: the server took my tray, rewrapped the sandwich in a new paper, put the fries into a new bag, and gave me new filled sauce cups that had lids on them for the fries. I DIDN'T EVEN TELL THEM TO DO THAT! These guys go beyond what customers ask for. That is truly amazing customer service.   This is coming from a guy who normally doesn't care about customer service.  That's why I will always tip well here.  tldr; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Went with a few friends and we all liked it and would go back. Friendly staff and very good sandwiches (or meals in some kind of bread). Tandori chicken thing was the biggest hit. Fries only so so though.."}
{"text":"Visited today... had a sandwich at first I was very impressed chicken was nice. Then as I was about halfway through it I found a rock in my chicken..I was shocked and pretty upset having had dental surgery about a week ago.I showed it to the guy at the counter he looked at it he didn't apologize nor did he offer any sort of refund. No one took responsibility for it. Finally to say I will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my boyfriend. There is a lot of choice, after a while of trying to decide I chose \"le maximum\" combo and it was delicious. very meaty and it made me so full I had a hard time finishing the fries that come with it! My boyfriend tried \"le speciale\" which is tandoori chicken and really liked it too. The place is quiet and well lit, nice chairs and tables. It took a bit of time to get the food but its well worth the wait. Highly recommend this place to anyone who's into sandwiches or a quick burger."}
{"text":"Slow service , took 15 min to cook the food and thats only because i was the only one there   Tiny portions for food , maybe worth half what i paid for"}
{"text":"This place is my salvation in Montreal. I found out about it very recently and I vow to come here as often as possible.   It's pretty ridiculous to have a restaurant this good open only during late nights, i mean that to me is such a tease. But that's what makes this place extra special. I don't even know where to start on how great this place can be for the human species in Montreal, QC.   This place seems like a fast food joint you go to when you are not sober and craving some junk food. But I will tell you this place is much much more. Calling Centrale Bregham a \"fast food joint\" does not give the place one molecule of justice.   First of all their staff is ridiculously nice, everyone I ordered from were very helpful in identifying what I would like and they are all very patient with customers. The price is also very fair compared to other Montreal fast food joints.   I personally came here sober at least twice and thoroughly enjoyed my burgers and sandwhiches. It really doesn't matter what you choose, I truly believe everything on their menu will taste good and be mouth watering. They use a special type of sauce in all of their heavenly creations and any meal you order will fill you up. I mean the food is absolutely unique and different from any other sandwhich place or burger joint you will walk into. In fact, this is my favorite place in Montreal and this is coming from a pretty classy guy that guys to upscale restaurants periodically.   Just writing this review makes my taste buds tingle and my mouth wetter than it was before I started writing this review. That's how powerful and tasty their food is. So if you come here, ladies and gentleman, bring extra lower body undergarments because this place has food that will make your body experience something pleasant that you will not forget."}
{"text":"At 2 am, after a night of heavy drinking, the chicken tikka sandwich was absolutely amazing! I think they are open till about 3 and they have a few choices for burgers/sandwiches."}
{"text":"5 reasons why I'm definitely going back  1. Halal meat  2. Tastes so good.  3. Wonderful service  4. Opens late.  5. Give me another excuse to go to amazing Montreal.   It's a fast food place. We arrived late night and many party kids were there. We had a good time."}
{"text":"This place is abominable and disgusting. No wonder the place was completely vacant when me and my friends visited for a meal.  The floor is dirty, the tables are sticky, the employees are lazy and seemed high \"as fuck\". There is absolutely no standards in that place kept whatsoever. Not much meat for what you pay, lazy presentation, average wait time of 25 minutes (and up) for a disappointing sandwich and some fries.  The drinking machines had their caps removed (the little funnel that makes sure the pressure doesn't explode on you when you press the lever to get your drink) and the employee remembered, at 4pm that he forgot to put them on AFTER Coca-Cola splashed all over my friend. Didn't even get a \"Sorry\". Also the wrong drinks were in some of the compartments. How someone would mix orange crush with 7up is beyond me... but as I mentioned before, the guy seemed as high as a kite.  Chairs were squeaky and the place looked disgusting and gross. 95% sure the manager must have blown the health inspector for this place not to be closed down on the spot. It's atrocious and I wouldn't be surprised if they had rats.  DO NOT EAT THERE. I'm not sure if all berghams are the same but this one is definitely an incredible disappointment."}
{"text":"Crazy sandwiches, super generous portions, low price, and good taste. With all these positives, why didn't I give them a 5 star review? My sandwich personally was nothing out of this world (Le Majestic). It was good, yes, but nothing special.  The people I was with loved their food so maybe I had very high expectations from the amazing reviews on this place? Who knows..  Would I go back? Not purposefully, no, but I wouldn't be opposed to it either.  Check it out and maybe be a little more daring in your choice than I was! Maybe that's where the magic lies :)"}
{"text":"If god was to open the heavens and deliver us a fast food joint right  in the heart of the city then this place is it .. let me reiterate if your on yelp and your looking for a place to fill your gullet with the best tasting fast food ever then this place it is .. again 1 more time STOP SEARCHING AND EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I walked in and the staff from afar saw me come in, but they decided not to come to the front counter where I was waiting to order. I stood there for a couple minutes, and with an absence of service, I left. They didn't care I don't think."}
{"text":"Greetings fellow Yelpers!! This is my first time coming to Central Bergham and after enjoying the Classic Sandwich I know I'llbe back! This quiet yet vibrant Algerien owned business is hidden on the corner of beaubien st and langelier. As you enter, you see the cooks at work, families sitting, youngsters talking but as soon as the food is served, all you hear are \"hmm\"'s. crunching into those sanwiches gets better with every bite. It's so good you won't notice  your finishing it! FYI I here there is another one beeing built in the downtown are. Enjoy Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but it took forever to make, don't come here in a hurry be prepared to wait at least 20min for your food."}
{"text":"The algerine sauce is so freaking good. We bought extra of those bottles to take back to the US. The fries with the sauce were dumb good! The burgers are also so great. This place is convinient because its open so late, up to 5am. Very good late night quick grab."}
{"text":"This place is great!  There is a ton of selection and everything is different. it was super cheap. for 2 sandwiches was like $14 which makes it cheaper than eating at subway. When I left I left thinking about what I wanted to order next time I came back. it was very good street food. The sandwiches are messy and hard to eat which makes them perfect for walking around and snacking.   the place seemed clean, user friendly, and very cost effective. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"got the mushroom burger here. honestly, when i unwrapped my burger it looked like a pickup truck had driven over it. it was pretty flattened and beaten up. also, not much mushroom, weak cheese. pretty forgettable. def wasn't feeling it. i may possibly be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas la première fois que je visite une succursale de la Centrale Bergham mais j'apprends de plus en plus à apprivoiser celle-ci située à Laval, donc un avis se devait d'être rédigé! La salle est propre et comporte la même charte de couleurs que les autres succursales, avec 2 grands écrans réglés sur des chaines de sport. Détail excitant: il y a une terrasse extérieure!!! J'ai hâte de la tester quand la température le permettra. La bouffe: superbes sandwichs généreux comme toujours, super frites et super sauces (mes préférées: l'algérienne et la marocaine). Le service est courtois et poli.  Love it!"}
{"text":"J'aime bien faire un tour ici de temps en temps pour un sandwich frites. Mon préféré reste le Rouge, sauce marocaine ou algérienne. Le seul bémol est la constance .. . Que ce soit au niveau du service, des boissons à la fontaine qui manquent des fois de gaz ou de concentré, le gérant (ou je ne sais quel employé) qui vient s'assoir collé à ta table... Si ce n'est pas pour ces détails qui me rendent mal à l'aise et qui amochent mon expérience, j'aurai mis un 4 étoiles."}
{"text":"We've been there twice, always at night.  A quick glance at their menu will tell you why - it features high protein, high fat fast food, perfect for late night munchies. I mean, how can layers upon layers of (halal) meat, cheese, egg and sauce stuffed in a chock full sandwich ever go wrong?  The first time we went, I found myself staring at the menu for at least 5 mins.  So many possibilities! So much calories! I wanted to try all of them. We each ordered a sandwich. I was expecting a giant pile of grub, but instead received a decent looking, neatly packed sandwich. It felt a bit like ordering a Double Big Mac, only to receive a slightly deflated version of it. Anyways, the price felt a bit high, but soon all was forgotten - the food was great.    If you're hungry and most places are closed, I strongly recommend checking out Centrale Bergham.   P.S.They tend to be short on staff at night (I only saw one guy working), so waiting times vary."}
{"text":"Wasn't as bad as I was expecting but bad nonetheless.   I ordered the trio and I liked the fries and the sauce (I got the burger sauce), but the marrakech wrap I got was a weird mixture of flavours. Lots of onions and peppers which I thought I had asked to remove.   I agree with other reviews that the place itself is kinda weird. The chairs are so uncomfortable and it feels a bit gross everywhere. The wait is a bit long but I don't mind.  I went because they have a deal for Concordia Students but otherwise I would've avoided it."}
{"text":"This place has really GREAT sandwiches. Each sandwich is made fresh, none of that pre-cooked steak or lunch meat you get from Subway's, Dawgwood's or Quizno's. They have many different sauces to choose from, all of them delicious. Great for dipping their McDonald's style fries in.   If \"waiting a few minutes\" for food is too much for you to handle, then sure, leave. When it comes to food, I also prefer speed versus quality"}
{"text":"Very good food. Sauces are amazing. Vast selection of items--I'd like to eat there more often but I like limiting my junk food intake. Atmosphere and service is so-so. Decor is beautiful. I highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Meh! This place is okay. The atmosphere is loud and the vibes ain't cool. Placed an order to go. Chicken donner and it took them like 10-15 minutes to get my order. I tried it for the first time and it was not good at all. The chicken still uncooked while chewing. No flavours! Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Fast food Fools- between the front counter staff and the cook they managed to mess up EVERY item we ordered- we ordered take away- upon discovering the multiple errors we tried to call to complain but no one would pick up the phone- tried a few times- gave up and decided to write this review.  30$+ for 2 sandwichs and they messed it up- I was also the ONLY person in the restaurant- it's not like they were busy!   Double check your order, these kids are deep fried fools yo~"}
{"text":"A fast food place that tastes better than most cafes. The staff is friendly, but mostly only speaks French.  Their poutine is also really good in the early mornings!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from this place, it took over an hour for the food to be delivered. the food was cold and my drink was warm. very upsetting for the price, my friend asked for an iced tea but got a sprite. i got the tandoori sandwich, it was decent, but the fries were soggy and cold. i will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"After eating multiple times at this place, the magic of the first time was never recreated. The food was usually bland and monotonously made.  Except for the algerienne sauce there is nothing more to this place. Overall decent to eat in a crunch but that is about it..."}
{"text":"The angelic employee (a reference to his ability and not his appearance) somehow understood my poor attempts at ordering my dinner in French and put an orgasm on a roll, wrapped it in foil and handed it to me in a paper bag.  That's it.  That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Having tried three other Centrale Berghams, this one is probably my favourite! The service is very good compared to the others and it also seems more spacious and welcoming inside. I love their burgers here, extremely filling and juicy steak... My husband always goes for The Maximum which looks huge and is a mixture of chicken, bacon, steak and eggs... Wayy too much for me but he absolutely loves it. Their signature sauces are great and they are quite generous with letting you try them in this location. The only downside I find here is their fries portion is a little small compared to other Burger joints similar to it. Apart from that, South Shore has once again been blessed with another Halal fast-food restaurant!! :)"}
{"text":"We decided to visit this Bergham after going to the one on St Catherine first and checking the reviews only to be disappointed! We were impressed by the Yelp reviews for this branch so we decided to try it out. I ordered the cheese burger and my husband went for the Maximum. Staff seemed friendly and our order arrived super fast despite it being a Saturday evening. I decided to dig in straight away and was instantly put off... My burger was literally cold! The patty was fairly warm but the buns felt like they had just come out of the fridge! I was so disappointed so I decided to take it back and told a member of staff. I would have expected them to create a new burger for me but to my surprise, they just whacked it in a microwave and served me my already bitten burger again... What a complete shock! This made the burger soggy of course and it lost its burger feeling :( My husband's sandwich looked OK but was really messily put together and was falling apart.  The poutine was very good however so at least that is something I enjoyed but aside from that, I would never ever visit this place again!  Their competitor (MStar/Mtl Star) are wayyyy better in quality of food and also customer service. I think I will be sticking to that from now on."}
{"text":"Best fast food in the country. If your a tourist in Montreal skip the restaurants and eat here. Try the special!"}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches, delicious chicken and steak options: the Philly chicken, the Camembert, the majestic (Philly steak), and they were all great. The grilled chicken poutine was very good too. Four stars for the great food and low prices, but only because we got takeout. The restaurant is nice enough, but I'd say maybe three stars if you're eating in. Staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich place.   Pros: for a fast food restaurant, very good in terms of service, food quality and cleanliness.   Cons: food took awhile to prepare. Maybe it was just a slow day. But other than that, pretty good."}
{"text":"I had \"la Maximum trio\" and it was amazing! They stuffed so much meat in it that the bread can barely hold the meat. The taste is great and it only costs $12.xx"}
{"text":"Love going to Bergham. Been to many locations on st-laurent, sources and decarie. Never unsatisfied. They're sandwiches are unique, made fresh and absolutely delicious. A very very filling sandwich. I normally eat half the sandwich and leave the rest for lunch for next day and eat the fries. The fries are just ordinary but their condiments are really good and they have many options. Forget the ketchup, my favourite is the Algerian sauce. Try their fresh sandwiches. Not a big fan of their chicken patty burgers. They have a kids play area. Drinks are refillable. There are 4 poutine options, I've had their steak poutine and their mushroom poutine and both are very cheese and filling."}
{"text":"This place has a very interesting approach to burgers. We came here because of a recommendation from a friend.   I had the spicy burger, a friend got the two meat sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. The only thing we weren't that fond of was the poutine, and honestly it didn't matter since the sandwiches were just that good."}
{"text":"Not sure why the low reviews, this is advertised like a fast food brunch place and it's definitely lives up to its billing.  The location is on a busy bustling street and lots of young people from the nearby university hit this place up.  The service was friendly and the food portions were large.  It's fast food brunch so expect large greasy portions.  It's aimed at the post-hangover crowd and it works like a charm."}
{"text":"Horrible service, wish I could give zero stars incompetent staff avoid this place like the plague"}
{"text":"Si vous aimez épicé vous ne serai pas déçu.  Mon choix: le mexicain . Bien épicé et très goûteux!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Bergham. Their sandwiches and fries are off the chart awesome for a quick lunch combo that comes in around $12. Don't come here for interior aesthetics. It's like a fast food joint on the inside. However the sandwiches are fresh huge and flavorful. They come with thin shoestring fries and with many choices of mayo based sauces to dip those matchstick delights. I usually go for the spicy one. It's great to dip the fries in. I will admit I haven't tried as many sandwiches as Yelper Jason (he's Mr. diversity when it comes to testing the menu selection). I usually go with the rouge. It's zesty tiny tender morsels of tandoori seasoned chicken, lettuce and tomato with processed cheese. For lunch, a quick dinner or late night snack you can't go wrong with the sandys here. I look forward to more locations opening up and hopefully one comes closer to my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Holy Tabarnouche or Sacremouille de ratatouille! (My weak attempt at French humour)  Dammm there are fast food places that one would consider on the edge of legendary... this is definitely a surprising visit. My first selection was closed so I felt like a sandwich and this showed up. Reviews looked promising so I dove right in. Decor of the restaurant is nothing glamorous but their food is a surprise. I went with the tandoori chicken sandwich and it came with delicious light crispy fries. The sandwich was light, flavorful and a bloody heaping serving. I've never had something so tasty and surprising for fast food in a while! The chicken had a light tandoori flavour but was delicious!   I never knew this place existed and Algerian fast food is smokin good!   They give you an option of two sauces. I had both. One is a tangy creamy mayo mustard. The other is a spicier mayo. Both are delicious compliments and great for dipping your fries.   Fantastic place for lunch, greasy dinner, late night or after bar food to lock down that hangover.  All under $10 with a drink? Seriously? How could one go wrong?   I salivate just thinking of when I can go back!"}
{"text":"Tres bon pour un petit creux ! Je recommande vraiment pour les amoureux de la nouritture epicée !"}
{"text":"J'ai pris le sandwich Cabanisme. De 1) c'est huge. De 2) c'est absolument délicieux et extrêmement décadent. Ce restaurant est une parfaite rencontre entre la nourriture (très) américaine et la nourriture du moyen-orient (les épices, surtout. C'est aussi halal, mais personnellement, je ne recherchais pas ça. Par contre, très utile pour les musulmans.). Le service en tant que tel était correct, mais ça reste un fast-food, alors il ne faut pas s'attendre à une quelconque ambiance autre que celle d'un fast-food sur Taschereau."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio, muy amable el que me atendió y la comida ni se diga, apenas para mi apetito carnívoro todo un deleite!"}
{"text":"Been here thrice and overall I like it!   They have sandwiches, burgers and wraps to your heart's content and so far I've tried the donner, the philly steak and the majestic sandwiches. I personally enjoyed the donner the best! They also have a variety of dipping sauces you can eat your meals with, I liked the American one and the Andalouse ones the best. There's almost a dozen options.  Pros :  - The sandwiches were made on the spot and are very fresh. - Lots of variety. - Fries are thin and crispy, just the way I like it. - Free refills. - Staff is friendly.  Cons :   - While I know the food is made on the spot, the wait is somewhat considerable. It's not unusual to wait 15+ minutes for our food and in many cases there was no line-up prior to us. - I'm really not a fan of fountain soda, it simply doesn't taste the same, also, no root beer? Don't be hating. - Price-tag is tough but fair, would like to see it a little lower."}
{"text":"The term \"Sandwicherie\" may or may not have been invented by this establishment, but I'll tell you from looking over the menu panels back and forth I'd say maybe they have the right to. The unique creations using various types of marinated chicken, beef and fish topped with cheese, fresh vegetables and mild or spicy sauces are noteworthy. I commented to the order taker and sole counter person that I would have to come back to take in all the choices. I therefore opted for the first thing on the menu \"Le Rouge\". An elongated pita pocket meets roll, stuffed to the gills with Tandoori chicken in a sauce I liken to butter chicken sauce, with orange cheese melted through it, lettuce, tomato and onion. I figure by now you can imagine this thing dripped on the tray liner, but was worth the mess. In a way a dream come true butter chicken in a bun. I'm sold for another try. The second item is \"Le Jaune\", so who knows where this rainbow of food will end. To note all sandwiches are priced with or without a trio (fries and a pop). The meat is Halal and there is plenty of it throughout the menu. No need to mention this place must rock at 2:30am and all that meat (and some grease) is a great absorber of other items consumed on The Main. Simply put it's a lot like sit down street (truck) food."}
{"text":"Bonne alternative au fast food de franchise habituel, puisqu'il s'agit d'un commerce bien d'ici. Les produits sont frais et halal, ce qui me ravit, d'autant plus que mon chéri est musulman et qu'il mange halal. La nourriture ne révèle rien d'extraordinaire, quoique quelques spécialités exotiques nous changent des Big Mac et autres burgers obscures issus des USA. Ouvert très tard, c'est fait pour chéri et moi qui aimons manger à minuit les w-e. Le service est un peu désordonné mais les excellentes sauces Nawal's rachètent le tout."}
{"text":"Nine dollars plus tax for a small Chef poutine (chicken with mushroom sauce). It started out tasting well, and the texture remained decent (small fries, tho). But in the end, the saltiness was so bad I literally spat out(side) the last mouthful. It's not their specialty (sandwiches), but it could at least have been edible."}
{"text":"Middle eastern spin on sandwiches, burgers and poutines. I went a few days after their new opening- this location is right next to the Mercedes dealership in Greenfield Park- Very visible to the main road in a well lit, nicely renovated space.  A great alternative to your typical fast food joint, Centrale offers a range of marinated meats with many different sauces to complement your sandwich or fries. Choose from their signature Algerian sauce, sriracha based mayos, spicy pepper, bbq to a big mac dupe and a few others. The only thing that would have made this more amazing would be a self-serve option. However you can purchase bottles of their sauces to take home. The staff was nice enough to let us sample all of them. My \"bergham\" sandwich had beef, cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion and egg to top it off- filling and flavorful, I've never had anything quite like it. You can also order elevated poutines with tandoori or butter chicken, mexican type burritos or philly cheesesteaks, there is something for every craving.  Trios are around 10 to 12$, comes with fries and a refillable fountain drink. Food takes a bit longer than average to prepare so they give you a number and you can get seated first until they call you through a speaker.  This is an excellent halal option and with how well placed Centrale Bergham has set itself around the city, I see them going far!"}
{"text":"It takes time to get your order, but then again the sandwich is huge. I had the Bergham and I was barely able to finish it. It tasted good but not super special. Fries are like mcdonald's fries. Difference is you get to pick a sauce to go with it. I tried the algerian sauce and liked it. Go there if you are not in a rush and feeling super hungry. The dining room also have a tv so that was nice."}
{"text":"The clientele, staff and restaurant surroundings are heavily Algerian/Tunisian/Moroccan. The TV was playing an Islamic station on the satellite dish. The staff all had long beards, which were not covered with hair nets. We walked in, felt out of place, did a U-turn and walked back out. No thanks."}
{"text":"Bons hamburgers et sandwichs. Connaissant les grecs et sandwichs fait en France dont ils se sont un peu inspirés, je trouve qu'il n'y a pas assez de viande mais sinon c'est vraiment bon et les frites aussi. De plus, ils sont ouverts assez tard (jusqu'à 4h du matin certains jours) et pouvoir retrouver les sauces algériennes et Biggy, c'est un immense plaisir ahah :) !"}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had! I recommend this place to everyone I know. The Biggie burger is the best."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place last night through uberEats, and the delivery guy never showed up. This is not the fault of the restaurant, as they had given him the order, however these guys went out of their way and delivered another order for us themselves, out of their pocket.  We had the two tandoori chicken sandwich combos, which were very tasty with lots of meat in them.  Overall great service and food, can't wait to try the other items on their menu."}
