{"text":"I can't understand what's the hype about this place.

After reading many good reviews, decided to go there for breakfast. 

First of all, service was mediocre - had to wait about 15 minutes to order. Waited another good 20 minutes for our food, that wasn't all that great: hash brows were soggy (like they were dipped on water and then served), pancakes weren't cooked long enough (tasted like raw batter)  and Maple BLT sandwich was nothing special. 

STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service attentive (the waitress even waited to take my order while I finished a phone call) and the place was clean, not fancy. What more can you ask for breakfast?"}
{"text":"I just get this general dirty feeling from Nellie's... 

Maybe I've been tainted by the disgusting charges against the breakfast diner, but my dislike for the food started beforehand. Though I know people who have always & will always love Nellie's, I just do not like it.  On more than one occasion after breakfast at this restaurant (especially the 17th Ave location), I have felt yucky and sometimes downright awful.  It's just too heavy and greasy, the oil tastes heavily recycled and the eggs always have that yucky smell & taste that eggs can occasionally get.  The food relies on grease and salt to make it taste good.  We make far better breakfasts at home for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the Nellies in Kensington and really enjoyed it. This Nellies was something else. The waitress was so rude! My husband asked for a egg dish that comes with hollandaise sauce. She said that they were out of the sauce and that if we wanted it, we should have got here earlier. He ordered another dish and was presented with only a tiny portion of the usual sausage. He asked if this was normal and pointed out that the other Nellies always gives him much more. She said no, she gave him the right amount and the other Nellies was wrong. How could they be wrong about four times in a row? The other food was okay but not worth the trip. This was nothing compared to our Kensington experience. Our friend, a first timer, said she would never go back and neither will we."}
{"text":"After that news, the last thing I would do is step into a Nellie's again. Maybe this will finally get rid of them, and they can open some decent breakfast places.

Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Took my kids from school to have lunch here. Server was friendly and food was reasonably good. Our server was an elderly lady, possibly an owner. It was a good family environment. However, when we received ketchup it had spoiled and had a bad smell and taste. It was replaced. We ordered a big breakfast meal and a steak sandwich and shared the food. As there were three kids we had our eggs three different ways (the kids are particular).

After finishing the meal, was surprised with a bill of 46.00 dollars. It seemed very high for a 2 plate meal. we had been charged $3.00 each per child drinks $3.00 for a coffee, which seemed high.

What I found to be dishonest, however, was that the waitress decided to add an extra 2.00 charge without notice. She indicated that it was an extra charge for having to make three different kinds of eggs.

We didn't make a fuss, tipped and left.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this diner. On top of the spoiled food 50 dollars is much too high for a 2 plate meal and dishonesty with billing is disconcerting."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst breakfast of my life. Looked cool from the outside, even the inside looked kind of neat. My girlfriend and I each ordered your basic bacon, eggs, hash browns, and toast plate. The scrambled eggs came looking a little pale and cooked without any seasoning at all. Bacon tasted a little funky. Half of the browns were raw the other were cold and soggy, there were visual traces seasoning on the browns, but I believe it was just paprika and was clumpy and just nasty. The toast was okay. Oh and all of that came to $30.00."}
{"text":"Nellie's used to be THE place to go for breakfast, but I think the bar has been raised in recent years by the plethora of breakfast-focussed joints that have opened in town.  The food is okay, but the rating gets dropped due to the general discombobulation of the service (both hardware and human).  Not every table has menus and the various condiments. Last time, I ordered the Ukrainian lunch, but got the Ukrainian breakfast. I'd correct it with the well-intentioned waitress, but was really hungry by the time it came out. If the food came out faster, and you didn't have to wait for a table, it would be decent, but Nellie's needs to work on these things before I'd return."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place...Service is always freindly and attentive when needed...food is usually good with the eggs Bene & Asparugus being a fave of mine..decor is great being nostalgic for me...excellant location for walking after to work it off."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim... My friend looked up the reviews on yelp and we almost backed out. But really it was fine. It looked clean, the staff were friendly, the food was very fast, not cheap, but it's downtown Calgary, so what are your gonna do. 
I had a western scramble. The eggs were great, the hash browns might not have been fresh out of the pan, but with the ketchup and Frank's hot sauce in the table, they were good. Fresh fruit and big portions of toast that wasn't dripping with butter like some places serve it. 
Whoever said they had a tonne of health violations, you're wrong, you can look these things up online.  Their record is not spotless, but its absolutely on par with 95% of the other restaurants out there.
No real complaints, it was good"}
{"text":"This place is quite the dive but I enjoyed it, cheap food and it was very tasty!  Eggs Benny was delicious:) I think the place is cute with the whole place looking like it was all bought from a garage sale but I loved it haha!"}
{"text":"Great experience! The location is easy to find, and in a great area. The service was both quick, friendly and helpful. The menu had such a great variety, and the prices were reasonable. If you're looking for a hip breakfast in a cool area-this is for you."}
{"text":"This Nellies lacks the pizzazz of a \"good\" brekkie place, like Galaxie or Red's. 

The few times I have been there, the food has been uber greasy, causing me to feel like a giant bag of wet garbage the rest of the day.

The last time I went (and I do mean the LAST) I ordered bacon and eggs, with eggs over easy, no seasoning on the hashbrowns and crispy bacon. What came out on my plate was anything but what I had ordered. 

The egg yolks looked as if they'd had a fork run over them, the hashbrowns were COVERED in seasoning, and my bacon looked as if it had been dipped in boiling water, and thrown on my plate. 

I alerted the waitress, who told the cook, who couldn't have been angrier about the whole thing. (I was sitting on the wall facing the kitchen, and heard their whole exchange) The waitress came over, essentially telling me that I'd have to wait for the kitchen to die down, for them to redo my meal. At that point, I'd already waited over 20 minutes for my incorrect meal, and was told I'd have to wait again. I politely informed the waitress that I would be leaving, and she sort of stood there, dumbfounded. 

Sorry, Nellies, you've lost me....."}
{"text":"This is genuinely one of my favorite places in my city. It's the kind of place that gets regulars because of its warm, 70s diner atmosphere. Want to feel like you're in a movie and eat a great breakfast at the same time? Bam. There ya go.  
I suggest this place to anyone visiting Calgary who loves diner food - definitely a must-see."}
{"text":"Just came in to grab a quick coffee but decided to stay to enjoy the old-school cafe charm. Got a dessert and some toast (we were saving room for tubby dog) which were all round delicious and the coffee is on point too."}
{"text":"After a few hours of enjoying the lilac festival, with the crowds and great weather, my wife and I needed a little something for lunch.

We strolled down 17ave looking for a patio that was'nt packed full. We kept walking and walking until FINALLY, there was Nellies cosmic cafe with no line up and a few tables avalable on their small patio.

First I must say the service was fast and attentive. Our waitress looked like she was actually having a fun time serving everyone.
The menu had mostly breakfast items, all reasonably priced.

I had the eggs benny and it was perfectly cooked . My wife had the, ummmm.... what the heck was it again, oh yea, she had the toastata( I think thats how its spelled). It was loaded whith olives,cheese,peppers eggs and a bunch of other stuff. 
Very good food, and terrific service. 
We will be going back soon I hope."}
{"text":"Okay, upon my return to Calgary (and Yelp) I actually moved within spitting distance of this diner and so despite my dislike of it have been coerced into going on a few occasions but not again. The food has gone downhill even in recent months with eggshell being found in breakfast burritos, hair in huevos, and to add insult to injury they make you wait an appalling amount of time for this awful food. 

Skip Nellie's and go to Galaxy just a few blocks away, trust me you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio because it was a beautiful sunny afternoon and was brought coffee promptly. My coffee was always hot and refills were readily available. I wanted to get a Nellie's favourite, so I went with the California omelette. It had way too much avocado in it for my liking, but that's just a personal preference. The hash browns were cold, but the orange and pineapple garnish were delicious. Service was not that great. My friend wanted to have spinach salad instead of hash browns and the waitress responded terribly with great hesitation and lack of confidence. She needed to check with the chef and check for a potential extra charge etc.. My friend simply ordered another item off the menu that didn't involve salad. I like milk in my coffee, but got a crate of cream. When I asked for milk, it took five minutes and I was presented with a basket of solely milk; this won't solve the problem for the next guest having an option. Not sure if I'll give this place another go."}
{"text":"You want the truth on this location well here's the real deal. This location its like 1970's all over again but with sass. I been eating here while  in town. Myself I have mix feeling about this place. The staff is great super friendly sarcastic condescending and fun all the way around. 

The food has been inconsistent depending on time of day. One thing I liked it was always tasty.  Breakfast food with a ghetto chic appeal, and flavors. This isn't your mom and pop breakfast place. You will go There to be seen or just have a great conversation with your server.  This is a quality place to kick back that hangover. 

The owner super friendly and attentive to its customs. The cooks been there forever.
That's what makes this place for me. Happy kitchen staff, happy customers.  

So I give this place a four star because you can't beat good consistencies when it comes to breakfast. This is the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me. Well you know the rest. :-) 

Keep up the good food one egg at a time Nellies. You have my business while I'm in town."}
{"text":"It was fine. After all, its a diner and breakfast! Eggs bene with salmon was well prepared and the hollandaise was fresh.
Service was adequate and efficient.Kitchen is tiny, so it is amazing they can actually manage the entire menu!
And....that is the biggest problem with this Nellie's in particular... There are always people waiting at the door...and due to no fault of anyone, you feel incredibly rushed. Hurry to order eat pay get out!
And thus, this should be known going in.
If this was dinner, or even lunch...could not do it.
Because the prices are high and, I could cook it at home with out the extra push.
But all in all, no reason not to \" pull up to the pump\" at this diner...just be prepared!"}
{"text":"I was walking home, and noticed Borscht on the sign outside the restaurant, so I stopped in to get a cup to go. Oh I wish I had gotten a bigger container because it was amazing. Richard makes the second best Borscht I've ever had. My Baba's will always number 1. If you're ever in the area and the Borscht is the soup of the day get a bowlful you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Two Words: Banana Bread.  It's to die for.

Hubby & I spent one night in Calgary before heading to Banff and found Nellie's for breakfast the next morning.  Feeling guilty from an Indian dinner the night before, I settled for the fruit plate - served with a slice of thick, fluffy homemade banana bread.  They didn't skimp on the fruit and the meal was actually quite filling.  

Service is friendly enough and atmosphere is kitchy.  Plus - we ordered a (still-warm) piece of banana bread for the road."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Nellies today went with a friend to catch up. The food was really good but the server was a complete annoyance she would not leave us alone to even look at the menu just kept asking if we were ready and there was three tables in the whole place filled at the time... and not to mention she spilled coffee on my friend. The booth felt very unsteady as well. Id recommend the place for the food and atmosphere but not the service."}
{"text":"Food not great, French toast and fruit tasted like onions, obviously cooked in the same pan as other food. Hash browns not really hash browns, more like boiled potatoes thrown in a pan for 10 seconds. Sausage overly greasy. Staff were friendly though!"}
{"text":"While running some errands, D suggested we stop here for a bite.  He hadn't been in years, and I'd never been so I thought it was a great idea.  We were both starving and it was very cold out, what with it having snowed the last couple of days, so we popped in and were seated at a window booth.  I tried the hot chocolate and Mr. Boring had water.  The place is chaotic, there's no end of random old knickknacks to look at, so it took me a while to pick what to try and in the end I went with the Nellie's Hash done with chorizo.

When the hash arrived, it was HUGE.  When they say 'mountain' of hash browns they aren't exaggerating.  They were more like fried potato chunks than hash browns, everything was sautéed well, and they were nice enough to do the eggs scrambled for me (I can't handle runny eggs).  I had sourdough toast to go with it, but it was very hard to finish everything.  It's your typical idea of diner food, lightly greasy but in a good way.  I left absolutely stuffed and I needed help to clean off the plate because there was so much on it.  The hollandaise was nice and thick, and there was plenty of it which is always good.

When we were chatting as we were paying the bill she gave us some candy, which seems to be a thing at that place - they have a lot of lollipops and whatnot.  I think next time I'd like to either try the pancakes or one of their omelettes."}
{"text":"Was on (the supposed to be) trendy 17th ave in Calgary and stopped in to Nellies for a late breakfast/brunch. At $33 (not including tip) for breakfast for two to be a little steep considering the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Thinking of the funky Sophie's Cosmic Cafe in Kitsilano, Vancouver, I stopped in here to check it out, but the vibe was very different from the start.
After having eaten breakfast several times at Dairy Lane, OEB, Red's and Galaxy diners here in the city, I ordered the bacon and egg breakfast, but from the get-go it smacked more of a truck-stop than a special place. The breakfast was average decent, but the coffee is regular lower level swill. With such stiff competition nearby who do the job much better, I won't be going back.

Even if I won't return here, if anyone out there wants redneck-oriented truckstop-styled bacon and eggs or hotcakes, may suit you."}
{"text":"First time at Nellies. Not a good experience at all. Had a salad with what was suppose to be garlic toast, but was a slice of white bread with a little butter. They apologized and brought back another white slide of bread which was suppose to be garlic toast, but smelled bad, nothing like garlic. It was expensive, the floors were very dirty. That was my first time and my last time."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast places in town. It's centrally located on 17th, with limited free parking behind the restaurant, so I can easily drive if I'm coming from a distance. 

Don't come expecting classy or up-scale - expect friendly staff, comforting food, and affordable prices. 

Check out the specials board on weekdays - there's usually something interesting there. On weekends, the brunch menu has some tasty options."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast diner. Highly recommend the belly buster, if you can handle it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, sunny atmosphere and great food, Nellies is definitely a solid choice."}
{"text":"Just another greasy spoon diner.  Not a huge selection on the menu, and the food was sub par.  The service was great and the eclectic scenery was entertaining, but for a self-proclaimed foodie I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"It's a place that opens up at 7 am. So, if you need a place for your breakfast meeting early in the morning, this one is certainly a great choice. Lots of options with eggs on the menu. I chose the one with Avocados and Tomatoes and loved it. The ambience is pretty good and there is a lot of parking space. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. Overall, a great option for breakfast."}
{"text":"Walking along 17th St at 11am on a Thursday looking for a diner to eat breakfast at and then Nellies pops up. Exactly what we were looking for. I love the kitschy feel of this restaurant, stuff all over the walls, grandma style tables and a welcoming vibe. The servers were really nice and fast getting our coffee/tea over right away and helping with menu selection. I went with a gluten free BLT + a fried egg. They delivered a triple decker delight. The gluten free bread was actually very good as was the rest of the sandwich. The side salad was pretty plain but fresh and yummy nonetheless. My husband had the hash which was huge and he said was very delicious. Our diner style brunch craving was fully satisfied by Nellies."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest in town but still a good spot. You will most likely find room any time with minimal/no wait. Friendly service and good food (not a fan of the hash-brow to be honest). I think they deserve a way better ranking than currently."}
{"text":"Why do people keep trying to rope me into going here? I know it's downtown and suppose to be 'quaint' but I can't take it anymore! 

The last time I was here was in the fall with a few friends (their idea not mine.) We were seated in a booth by the windows. They had the door blocked open and didn't seem to care that the restaurant was infested with wasps! My husband killed approx 10+ wasps in our short time there and might I mention wasps are nemesis? I HATE wasps. 

The food has never been outstanding, the prices are ridiculous and wasn't it not that long ago that they were shut down for health code violations and fined a bunch of money? Yuck. No thanks!"}
{"text":"This was spur of the moment, first restaurant I saw, moment. When I sat down and ordered I started to read the yelp reviews and became a little apprehensive. I began to inspect the place: it's old, but was very clean, the service was good - a paper in the morning with breakfast and hot coffee. Seemed like there was quite a few regulars. Food came fast and the hash browns were delicious. I had the California omelette which left much to be desired. Over all it seemed like not a bad place, but I would look for somewhere else to eat the next time I was in the area,"}
{"text":"Cures for the common hangover:

Step 1: Roll out of bed
Step 2: Throw on your hangover clothes. Sunglasses are essential. 
Step 3: Go to Nellie's. Order anything.
Step 4: Enjoy.

Nellie's is pure breakfast delicious, and when I crash nearby I love to come visit. I'm a sucker for eggs and pancakes and bacon, smothered in maple syrup. It's pure deliciousness right there. I love the atmosphere: 50's diner inside, and the enclosed patio outside (where the outside air helps your head). I love the choices on the breakfast menu: ommelettes, eggs, pancakes, fruit. Perfect way to start the day without carrying the pain of the night before with you!"}
{"text":"Why does this place only get 2.5 stars?  Service was unbelievable and the food was delicious, we all had different items from pancakes to omelets and poached eggs and all delicious.
It's quite the place to eat breakfast, your diner dive with good food and super friendly wait staff and unlimited pour of diner coffee.

I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Went there for a breakfast on Saturday morning because Galaxies line up was too long. Waited at Nellies for nearly an hour after I placed my order and then when I finally got it l, my soft poached were completely hard. Sent it back and the. My boyfriends wasn't any good either. Only saving grace was that our waitress was very kind and thoughtful. Definitely wont be returning."}
{"text":"We chose this place for breakfast out of convenience and it's location.  I had read some of the reviews about the food being tasteless but jacked It up to just people being too picky.  Unfortunately they were right!  The food is so bland! I ordered the bacon and eggs and the hashbrowns were horrible and the coffee tasted like flavored water.   You could get a better breakfast at dennys!  
 I hate that the food sucked because the girls working were AMAZING!  We had the best service ever!  The cook needs to learn a few things and put some effort in.... also please learn to make good coffee!"}
{"text":"Nellie's... it's alright. I think the lineup at the door is because of the slow kitchen staff and the fact that some people just haven't branched out to better brunch locations yet (there are better).

I was here for brunch today with a couple of friends. It didn't take us TOO long to be seated by a rather surly youth. I'm glad our server was a bright and chipper blond. 

What Nellie's did right:
My coffee... every time I looked down it felt like it had been refilled for me. Awesome!
Our service... like I said, our server was bright and chipper and on top of our orders. We were sitting right next to the order window and heard her send back even orders of toast that weren't up to par.
Food... once we got it, it was pretty good food. I ordered the morning maple blt. It could've used a bit more bacon, but the maple syrup was a great touch to the blt and my hashbrowns were nice big pieces of potato grilled to a crispy outside and soft inside.

What needs work:
The time it takes for those food orders to come out. I'm glad there were three of us to keep the chatter going and that we weren't in a hurry. One couple beside us walked out after they had been waiting an hour for their food. 

Nellie's, pick it up. It's the first time I've been back since the news hype almost two years ago. You're still in business so that part must be a lot better... It'll be another while before I try you again, at least on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from their blueberry pancakes 
Wish they didn't re open  terrible service
Ridiculous prices,dirty environment"}
{"text":"It had been years since I've eaten here.  After all the media attention regarding health concerns I stopped going.  Now being so close, we decided to give it another chance for a Sunday breakfast.

When we arrived I noticed nothing of the decor has changed much, in fact it may not have been cleaned very much either as I noticed layers of dust, 1cm thick in some parts of the wall decor.  The air quality was poor as well so if you have any respiratory concerns (i.e. asthma) this might not be a place to frequent.

Even though being full we were seated quite fast.  The menu hasn't changed much.  In fact, it may not have been cleaned much either as they were sticky and oily.  Our server was prompt in asking us if we were ready, we needed more time.  My wife and I both ordered hash browns with poached eggs and a pancake on the side.  The food came out fairly quick.  After having a few bites I noticed there was hardly any flavour.  I couldn't taste any seasoning on the potatoes and the Hollandaise sauce had no taste as well.  My wife's order also had no flavour (made sense since we both ordered the same, except mine had sausage meat and she had corned beef).  I was going to say something but when the server came by to ask how our food was tasting she didn't bother to stay long enough to hear our response.  Actually, the rest of the stay was like that.  She'd be gone most of the time and then show up to ask us something and then leave without hearing our response.

The pancake tasted really good.  It was about the only real good thing.  It was nice and fluffy and it was huge (considering they charge $4 for one pancake it should be big).  I also ordered my toast dry but it came with butter.  That as well couldn't be rectified as I waited a good 5 minutes before seeing her again.  I decided to just eat the buttered toast instead of waiting any longer.

Nellie's Cosmic Cafe is out of this world all right, luckily the breakfast options on 17th ave have vastly improved and I won't have to go here for a long long time."}
{"text":"First impression Really cute Warm cozy cambin old school diner. 
Excited for my BLT take the first bite of my hash browns which looked very homey greasy confront style I came to realize right away that I was also chewing on a long peace of hair. So that was a bummer. Other then that service was fantastic. Don't think I could eat there again. 
Our coffees where taken care of !"}
{"text":"Have you ever craved breakfast for dinner?  Do you wake up late some Saturday afternoons and realize you've slept past the breakfast cut-off?  Well, worry no longer for Nellie's Cosmic Café will serve you breakfast any time you want!  Whether it's actually breakfast time, or closer to supper time, Nellie's serves their customers breakfast all day long.

Having many different locations across the city, I find 17th Avenue Nellie's to be my favourite.  They have the feel of an old 50's diner, complete with pictures and trinkets dating back 50 or so years.  The walls, and even ceiling, are sprinkled with eye-catching objects and great conversational pieces.  You'd be hard pressed to sit through an entire meal without talking about, or at least mentioning, some of the charms and gems around the place.  My favourite diner-like article in Nellie's Cosmic Café is the individual juke boxes they have placed at each of the booths along the walls.  The only disappointing thing about the juke boxes is that they don't only play old 50's music.  If you want some Madonna or Guns N' Roses just plug in your 25¢ and enjoy.

The staff members aren't necessarily poodle girls or greasers, they don't ride around on roller skates or sing on command, but they are fun and friendly enough just the same.  They are quick to refill your coffee and hold no grudges if something needs to be sent back in error.  Granted, I've never received anything erroneous from the kitchen, but I've seen others send things back and it's never been a problem.

The food selection at Nellie's speaks for itself; breakfast.  They have everything from egg's Benny to French toast, and all that comes in between.  I wouldn't say that Nellie's serves gourmet breakfast, but it has a home-cooked quality which separates it from the other venues.  They also have a small lunch menu, sandwiches, soups, etc., just in case you're not in the mood for breakfast.  Crazy, I know, but understandable, I suppose.  A popular choice for me is the Ukrainian.  It combines breakfast and lunch with your choice of eggs, hash browns, fruit, sausage, and even perogies.  Perfect for those days when you just can't decide between the two meals.

So if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive afternoon breakfast, Nellie's on 17th should certainly be a top choice.  Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day, and Nellie's Cosmic Café understands this.  In fact, it's their motto."}
{"text":"I loved the decor in here, very eclectic but for the most part it's throw back advertisements and assorted stuff of days past (50s, 60s, etc.).  Aside from that, generally an okay place, not sure I'd go out of my way to go back as it's a 10 minute walk from home.  The eggs/panckage/breakfast meat is fine for the price (~$15) and the service was pretty good.  Given they keep the door open to their outside patio, the resulting flies buzzing all around me as I ate kind of brought it down a star or two.  Also, they serve Aunt Jemima syrup!?!  Being from the states, I thought this would be a crime in Canada to serve this stuff in a Canadian breakfast place - waitress noted that given volume serving the good Canadian stuff would get pricey but I'm not sure I buy that, just seemed wrong to me.

Anyway, cool decor and nice people working here.  Good for quick breakfast but coming back would be tough given the high volume of high quality Calgary breakfast places."}
{"text":"What an adorable breakfast spot!! Absolutely loved it. The atmosphere - cheerful, friendly, with that funny decor making you feel dropped down into an early second half of the past century... Makes you feel like Marty McFly is going to pop by any moment.

Food is excellent. Served quickly. Looks and feels like you are visiting good friends who care. Portion size and price are right. Everything is clean, and served with a smile!

How did I manage to make it there just a few couple of times? Should have been way more frequent to Nellies...

Absolutely recommended - especially if you are walking with your kid around the area and feel a bit hungry, just jump in! Wonderful family place."}
