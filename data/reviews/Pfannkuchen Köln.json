{"text":"This is an awesome creperie! My favourite is the ricotta with honey and walnuts - a great combination of sweet, creamy, and crunchy. My kids are partial to the strawberries and cream. They practically inhale the entire thing in one go.  The owners are super friendly and go the extra mile to make you happy.  Highly recommended!"}

{"text":"I like my crepes just the right thickness, not too overloaded with toppings. This place is fantastic. The crepes are just the right texture, presented really well.."}
