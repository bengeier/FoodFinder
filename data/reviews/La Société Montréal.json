{"text":"We had the short ribs with polenta and green beans and they were outstanding.  Service was okay - nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an overlooked gem.  The style is french and the quality is high.  It is now a favorite on our trips to Montreal.  It is much better than many other restaurants in Montreal.  Even the bread was warm and good - we often find the bread heavy and tasteless in Montreal (talking to you Cafe Boulud!).  They have a great brunch with Eggs Benedict and pancake.  At dinner, we had a delicious fresh sole and Croque Monsieur.... Give it a try."}
{"text":"Love this place.?????????very nice service.really nice place to go with friends. Went la societe often when I was in Toronto.i would like to say the one in Montreal is better lol"}
{"text":"Bit overpriced for what it is.. probably due in part associated with fancy hotel.  Food was good and service ok."}
{"text":"This was the best French restaurant that we visited in Montreal. We chose it for the seafood and oysters. The restaurant is in Loews Hotel and looks really nice with ceiling stained glass details. We ordered  - a dozen oysters on the half shell (a bit saltier than Westcoast oysters, but very fresh),  - foie gras terrine (to die for. If only they gave me a few more slices of brioche to go with it)  - lobster tagliatelle (lots of lobster) - French onion soup (good broth, a bit sweet) - 1/2 lobster roll (very fresh and tasty)  - Pork chop (very huge portion, so tender and delicious). - asparagus with ham The waiter was very formal but made us feel at home with our kids. Portions were bigger than what we expected."}
{"text":"Having dined at both the Toronto and Montréal branches of La Société, I think the Montréal restaurant stands out just a tad more in my books. The service was exceptional.  As for the food...  I loved the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were plump, mild and served at the perfect temperature.  They had a nice French Onion Soup: full-bodied and topped with a golden aged gruyere.  I wasn't a fan of the Waldorf salad: the vinaigrette was too rich and overpowering for my palate.  The short ribs were absolute perfection. The soubise was rich and creamy, the meat was incredibly moist and the gremolata really livened up the dish.  The sweet potato gnocchi was also a standout. The brown butter, sage, kale and house-made ricotta came together well in this dish."}
{"text":"I'm always a bit nervous taking a young child into a seemingly formal restaurant, this place took very good care of me and my toddler. We stay at the hotel and eats here everyday, the waiters know exactly where to put us and always show up at the right time to check on whether we need anything. The food is simple and excellent."}
{"text":"Great service, venue was nice. Food was great for a quick bite because we stayed there.  Remember this is Montreal so the competition is tough for ratings."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Les serveurs sont aimables, serviables et avenant.  On s est trompe ds une commande d apero, le nom en europe et canada n etant pas la meme chose, on nous l a change sans qu on le demande. Le plateau de fruit de mer est un peu juste mais tout esr prepare super. Excellent. Meme si je descends ds ce restaurant sans me poser de question"}
{"text":"Montreal is known for its diversity and is reflected in the vast variety of its restaurants. La  Société  does not disappoint . A friend and I had a lovely lunch. We were awed by the décor, the ambiance and the delicious food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have been to la Société many times in the past and the food is always amazing and the service is fast and very pleasant.   Last night I came in for the Montreal en lumiere special. This event is celebrated among many other great restaurants across Montreal. This was by far my favourite menu. The plates were all unique and well seasoned with a nice presentation. I highly recommend the table d'hôte.   The ambiance is very romantic and perfect for something intimate.   I will continue to visit this restaurant as it is among my favourite spots in this city."}
{"text":"Love it. $1 oysters Friday and Tuesday night and they are amazing! Also tried the salmon tartare and french onion soup and will definitely go back. Nice little place to hang out!"}
{"text":"So you look at the menu and realize this is some incredible dining - if you eat like an adult.  If your ideal meal is chicken tenders and fries, don't lose hope.  I was actually feeling fancy, and by fancy I mean plain pasta with butter.  I can feel you judging me but that's alright.  My husband ordered something he found to be absolutely delicious off the menu, ironically, my 16 month old son loved that too.  I went ahead and asked for pasta with butter only and it was actually amazing.  The pasta must be hand made- cooked perfectly and it had a lot of taste for what some might consider a bland meal.  I always appreciate flexibility with my child like love of simple foods and my husband is a foodie so a place that can make us both happy is 5 stars.    TIP: When you order the pasta with only butter, be sure you specify NO CHEESE.  Not sure where this gets lost in translation, but it's always good to be very specific with not just what you want, but what you do not want so the chef doesn't try to \"spice\" it up with his own idea of what would taste better.  The wine menu is beautiful and your only issue will be picking just one (bottle, obviously).    Merci, La Societe!!   (See how that rhymes?  I like that too, especially after that aforementioned bottle)"}
{"text":"Le pire service de toute ma vie! Ma copine et moi somme rentré dans ce restaurant après une longue séance de magasinage au Urban Outfitters et comme c'est à côté et qu'ils ont du steak et des fruits de mer à des prix raisonnables je me suis dit que se serait parfait! En entrant le personnel du restaurant nous ont regardé avec un jugement de valeur qui excède le snobisme comme si ont était des itinérants ou des lépreux. On n'était pas en veston cravate mais on était pas en gougounes non plus. Une hôtesse nous désigne une table après 2 minutes d'hésitation et le restaurant était pratiquement vide. On nous donne les menu et après 20 minutes qu'on était prêt à commander personne venait nous voir pour nous demander ce qu'on voulait donc on a décider de quitter car ils aimaient mieux ne pas faire d'argent que servir des sales hipsters qui ternissent l'image de leur restaurant de snobs hautains bourré de préjugés! La bouffe avait l'air excellente mais je ne le saurai jamais car je ne mètrerai plus jamais les pieds dans un restaurant avec un tel service!"}
{"text":"I dragged my entire shopping entourage with me to this place because I passed by so many times and was always curious about its interiors. So we finally made it in and while I liked the space/decor, it pretty much stopped there. The service is friendly but they appear out ofbplave, slow, confused. The place was practically empty at lunch, but we hardly got any attention. Lunch that was served was just OK. I had the club sandwich and others ordered the burger. The fries that came with our meals were quite greasy and unappealing. So much promise for this  place but I fear without an inventive/creative menu and some strong management discliple, this place may not last long."}
{"text":"The service was pretty ok. Expect for getting forgotten. Our oysters were just about room temp maybe a little bit colder then then that. For the price for everything and the quality it's pretty insanely outrageous. I'd probably never return here. Just not worth it one bit. For six oysters and mediocre Beef tartare and three drinks 138 bucks I think is pretty insane."}
{"text":"Worst service ever !  Resturant was empty, but it took them half an hour to take an order. Ordered a steak and burger, both medium. Steak was charred, burger was under cooked and bun was burnt. So overall very bad experience. Will not Recommend it all."}
{"text":"Came for their dollar oysters on several occasions. Oysters are good, not the best towards the end when they skimp and give you like teeny oysters? Had their cocktails which were well done, one was a mimosa and the other was whiskey based. Decent service, it wasn't very busy but did not get the most attentive service for the price you pay for their food/drinks."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and outstanding service. French onion soup was the best I have ever had full of sweet onions, flavorful broth, hearty bread and cheese. Oysters were fresh and tender. Shared the larger size beef tartare. The portion was actually rather small but came with fries so was more than enough. Casual yet trendy European feel."}
{"text":"This place was really great! We were visiting from out-of-town with some friends and had a hankering for French food, so this is where we ended up. For appetizer we had a cheese board and an order of foie gras. Both were generously portioned and delicious. My entree was a beef tartare which was dressed perfectly. Other items on the table were a steak frites and a beef bourguignon that was rich and hearty, though very salty. Another great item was the duck confit. They know how to do duck in Montreal, and this was no exception. It was cooked perfectly-- moist and tender on the inside, with the skin perfectly crisped. The decor was very classy, and the quiet jazz playing in the background only added to the ambience created by mahogany furniture and copper ceilings. Our waiter was very friendly. The restaurant was pretty empty as we visited on a weeknight, so he hung out to chat with us for a bit. He told us a lot about Montreal and recommended a great wine. If I ever return to Montreal I'd happy return to La Societe again!"}
{"text":"Came here for MTL à table and tried to take different things on the menu with friends. As a presentation, every dish is nicely plated and decorated. The fish soup was good and the fish itself was very tender. It tasted a bit too fishy for me. The oyster was filled with spinach, hollandaise sauce and topped with some salad. It was also pretty good. As for the main course, the sauted seafood was fresh and nicely seasoned without overpowering the ingredient's natural taste. The scallop that came with it was pretty big. As for the desserts however, the nougat was a bit too sweet for us and we couldn't finish it. The donut was good but tasted a bit plain.   The service is quick and the staff is friendly. They came mang times to fill our water without being too excessive and asked us a few times throughout the evening if everything was ok.   The place itself is clean. It's kinda dark in the restaurant but every table has it's own candle lamp so it's perfect for talking with friends.   Overall, the experience was enjoyable. However, it didn't leave an impression strong enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"This is a snapshot review on dessert and coffee.  The cafe americano was really well flavored.  I ordered the banana cream pie and it was absolutely fantastic.  Ive probably only had two better desserts one in france at the chantaclair and other at marea in nyc.  The restaurant is decorated spit on as an upscale brasserie but service is even better than most."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation, it happened to be restaurant week. Easily made a reservation via email, and was really excited to come.   We arrived around 6, a little earlier than our reservation and the place was EMPTY. We wanted to leave but there was no going back as we were ushered to our seats. We were nervous to say the least. Why was it empty?!  Cool atmosphere.   The waitress initially seemed like a stuck up snob, but by the end of the night (2 hours) she was actually pretty awesome. Fast, nice, eventually willing to communicate in English with us (I know, it's your country and you speak French there. Awesome, but help a girl out. My French only goes so far).   It's hard to talk about the food. We've never had this type of cuisine before, and I think we just didn't appreciate it. It wasn't great and I left hungry and disappointed. Again, I think it's because I've never had bone marrow, fore gras....If this was a type of food I liked, maybe I'd have been more impressed.   The drinks were tasty and awesome. I liked the Kungfu Girl Reisling, but was rather bummed that I learned how cheap it is outside in the real world- I definitely got ripped off at La Societe.   The dessert was AMAZING."}
{"text":"I feel weird reviewing this place because it seems like nobody comes here, and the reason nobody comes here isn't because it isn't good, or because the decor isn't nice. Neither of those things are true. It is nice, and the food is actually alright.   I feel weird about writing this because it feels like I'm missing something. The decor is nice and the food is decent, so why does no one come here?  Am I here at the wrong hours? Did something horrible happen here before I arrived, once, or did someone in a local newspaper write a terrible review? Am I in the uncool eat place in town, and somehow, I just don't know it?  None of those things seem possible, really. Société is a pretty damn decent place. Food's good. Looks great too, like one of those French bistros you find in NYC (think Balthazar) where people gather at all hours. The only thing that's missing is the people -- at least, every time I've come here.  Maybe people just haven't found out about this place yet. Who knows. Maybe it's really busy on weekday mornings. I have no clue.   Regardless, in case you're reading this review because you want to come check it out and you're uncertain, you should in fact come. I always end up here on Sundays, once for a brunch with my girlfriend, and another time just by myself for coffee. Both times were nice. The people are friendly and the atmosphere is a cool old fashioned vibe.  And hey, you definitely won't have to wait for seating. At least, not until this place gets discovered. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very impressed. We loved the bacon-wrapped scallops, rack of lamb, lobster ravioli, and opera cake for dessert. Cocktails, whose names I cannot remember, were on the expensive side but really good too. Our server was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Tuesday is $1 dollar oysters!! Amazing deal and they were fresh! Had 48 of them along with shrimp cocktail.   Had the beef tartare and salmon tartare. Also had lobster roll (crisp and fresh). Had the salmon entree and the char on it was perfection. The squid puree was a nice touch as well.   Drinks and staff were awesome. Tina gave helpful advice and made everything simple and wonderful. Staff was very attentive and constantly asked if we wanted anything else.   The ambiance is romantic. The music is relaxing and perfect for the space.   The creme brûlée is a MUST try.  I saved the best for last. The foie gras appetizer is phenomenal. You won't regret it. It is a reason in itself to come back here."}
{"text":"A must go!!!!! We were trying to find a spot for brunch and ended up here unexpectedly.   The service was amazing and everything that we ordered was delicious. Probably the best mimosas and French toast of my life. You should also try the croque Madame and the oysters. Seriously, such a pleasant surprise in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Was super impressed with the braised beef cavatelli !!!! This was really the best meal I have had in a long time, I honestly did not have huge expectations, I was expecting an overpriced French restaurant and was blown away. Share and enjoy if you have something to celebrate :-)"}
{"text":"Ce petit bistro annexé à l'hôtel Loews a été ma découverte cette année à Montréal à table. Petit frère, à peine âgé de quelques mois, du bistro du même nom à Toronto, il présente bien et offre un excellent service.   Le menu qui nous était offert étant conçu spécifiquement pour le festival, je devrai malheureusement, ou plutôt heureusement, y retourner pour me faire une vraie idée. Je dois avouer cependant que je suis en peine de savoir que les beignets érables-fromages-bacon, dont je rêve depuis dimanche, ne sont pas sur le menu.  Comme ils offrent aussi les déjeuners, ce sera un autre arrêt à faire entre copines."}
{"text":"Pro, Food was decent and had a great ambiance.   Con, Service was terrible, slow and they messed up the orders (ordered roast beef sandwich and was treated to half a smoked meat sandwich). Servers are in fact rude. Didn't bother with a drink as they were very expensive and contained budget liquor.   Wouldn't recommend this place for anything more than a coffee."}
{"text":"My friends and I came for their oyster special but were disappointed with the quality. We did not have other food so I cannot comment on that. The oysters did not seem fresh, and were very small. The atmosphere is cozy though, and makes you feel relaxed.  Service was slow as well, even though the place was pretty much empty."}
{"text":"Came for brunch, they had lovely decor and attention to aesthetics. Each bread plate had a different design! Food was standard breakfast fare, not a big fan of their hollandaise sauce (was dry, not really saucy). The price for our dishes were pretty reasonable.  Service was appropriately paced for a social meal, so I can see where the slow complaints were coming from. Host was cheerful though!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place at the Loews Vogue hotel.  It is decorated to look just like restaurants and bars in France.  It's a quiet and nice little place that maybe is overlooked but shouldn't be.  The service is very good and welcoming.  My daughter and I had a very enjoyable dinner here and liked the food very much.  The bar is great too for a spot to sit and have a nice cocktail, beer, or glass of wine and feel at ease.  There is a little terrace as well that is cute.  The food was good, service good.  I have no complaints at all.  I did have lunch here one day and ordered the Croque Monsieur, which comes with a nicely dressed side salad, and it was all terrific.  The sandwich was better than those I've had in France.  My daughter and I stayed at the hotel for a couple of days while waiting to move into a longer-term rental.  Since she had an internship in the city and needed to bring lunch for her first day, I spoke with the bartender about our dilemma of needing something since we didn't know the city at all yet.  They made her a nice lunch the evening before, wrapped up to fit in her lunch bag.  That is amazing service and so kind to work with us for our needs at the time."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce resto avec le passeport La Tablée (Tuango).  Entrée: gravlax. Petit mais dont bien efficace.  Terrine de canard: mélange partait de légumes et de la terrine! Entrée: terrine de canard avec légumes marinés.  Bon sans être extraordinaire.  Entrée: oeuf poché. Wow...texture, saveur, goût. Un mariage parfait et que j'ai rarement goûté. Ça ne goûte pas le déjeuner ;)  Entrée: poireaux et escargot. Trop de vinaigrette. Mais ok quand même  Plat: poulet de Cornouaille avec légumes du jardins. Réconfortant! Délicieux. Plat: saumon avec purée à l'encre de seiche. Excellent! Bonne cuisson.   Dessert: j'en bave encore! Crème brûlée et pouding chômeur...je ne sais pas lequel vous conseiller. Pas de recettes réinventées, mais oh combien bien exécuter"}
{"text":"The food here is great and they have a decent amount of gluten free options if you ask.  Sadly the service is often lacking and wait staff have been rude or not attentive.  You'd think with most of the restaurant patrons being guests of the hotel, that they would make sure their service is always dp"}
{"text":"Always a delight to eat here. The food is carefully prepared in their kitchen, everything is homemade and the combinations in the meals is well though out. Excellent service. We recommend eating outside."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I had the steak and it was very good, but it does not make up for the very poor service. Only two other tables of customers in the entire restaurant and yet service was incredibly slow. Cold bread, disappeared for a long time after we arrived so we didn't order for a while, and very inattentive. At the end, I was charged for 3 cokes because I had gotten two refills. Was not told refills were not free, and I find it very unusual to have to pay for refills unless explicitly told (soda prices are not even listed on menu). When I asked the waiter about it he was VERY rude--said refills might be free somewhere like McDonalds, but they are not so at nice restaurants. I have never once been charged for a refill at a very nice restaurant without being told, and having to pay is an anomaly. I certainly didn't appreciate the rude way he told me, especially after such a slow and unhelpful service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Like the bar area. A nice place to chill after a long day or work and have a glass of wine. The service was very friendly - I'd say outstanding as they were so friendly - but the sometimes we a bit slow.  We had the onion soup (nothing spectacular), the meat and cheese tray (okay- I liked the selection of cheeses from Montreal).    Overall, I'd come here for a glass of wine and relaxation, but probably not the food."}
{"text":"I only came here for the drinks, so that's all I'll be reviewing.  We wanted to get some wine in a lounge type atmosphere and since it was pouring, we stopped in our hotel's bar, La Societe. It has a very 20s style vibe inside.  We sat at the bar and ordered champagne (Moet Chandon) to start. Adorned with a small strawberry, the champagne was quite tasty. Next, I chose the Rosemopolitan, which is a cosmo with rosewater. YUM! I love anything rose flavored so this was such a delight. It had a nice rose scent and didn't taste very cosmo-ey. My friend had a midori sour, but the bartender never made one before so it didn't come out as expected. But the drink was still a good one, whatever it was :)  We also enjoyed the barbeque potato chips (house made) that were gratis at the bar. A little salty for my taste, but a nice departure from nuts.   All told we spent a pretty penny on the drinks. But the cosmo was well worth it."}
{"text":"Went to La Société Montréal tonight with a friend, we are on vacation in Montreal and have been cooking our own meals for the past few nights, but decided we wanted to go out and have a nice meal. We chose La Société after looking up many well-rated French restaurants in the downtown Montreal area, so we were looking foward to the nice decor, and supposedly amazing French food.  Unfortunately, the food AND the service was bad. My duck confit was terribly dry. I loved the the Leek and Vinaigrette appetizer, which was the only redeeming part of the evening. My friend's hanger steak and frites supposedly was alright, however it needed more salt, as opposed to my duck which was too salty.   What really gave this restaurant one star was the service. We waited and waited for our waiter to come and ask us for our orders and also for any sort of refill on water or drinks, even though the restaurant only had two other parties present. My friend was charged refills on her soft drink and when asked about it, our waiter mentioned that \"Mcdonald's might do free refills, but nice restaurants DO NOT.\" Whether that is true or not, I would say it's very out of turn for a waiter to mention that. Plus, I have never experienced a nice French restaurant that charges refills on a Coke of all things. They took the refill charges off, but the attitude given was not appreciated, wrong or right.   Overall, sad experience for a place so highly rated."}
{"text":"Very nice, classical French Bistro, from the zinc bar to the music (Piaf, anyone?) Attached to the adjacent Loews hotel, it may pass unnoticed, but the food was delicious. Had onion soup, endive salad, steak frites and tarte tatan (French upside down apple tart), everything presented in a typical French Bistro manner. The also have a prix fixe lunch for $19, but I didn't have it, just the dishes described. The service was warm and attentive, the bread and butter, on point. Full service bar with classical and new cocktails, and an extensive wine list by the bottle, but limited options by the glass. Also, lovely decor; you will feel like in Paris!"}
{"text":"Came here for the $1 oysters. The service was below average.  During our entire meal, our waiter did not smile at all, not even once. Come on... We ordered 18 oysters, half of a lobster sandwich and my friend got the lobster pasta. All the dishes were delicious and the oysters were so fresh too. They were my favourite ones from PEI.  The waiting time was soooo LONG even though the dining room wasn't even half full. It took at least one hour for them to prepare our main courses.  Will still be back for the oysters but not anything else because of the long wait."}
{"text":"\"A true brasserie....relexed setting great seafood\"   La Societe is located in the lobby of the Loews Vogue Hotel in Montreal. The restaurant features an intimate setting with a small bar and both indoor booths and tables as well as a small patio when the weather is good. They feature a selection of shell fish and a smallish menu with emphasis on appetizers and other small dishes.  The Sea Bream was excellent, however I would have preferred to have the Tuna Nicoise salad with pieces of seared tuna rather than a few clumps of a canned tuna fixture.  The service is quick friendly and efficient without being to pushy or having that perception arrogance that sound French brasseries carry. They are also very accommodating allowing you to sit in the larger benches when the restaurant is not busy."}
{"text":"Everything is made by them. Had the smoked meat with maple syrup mustard which was exceptional. Get the fries. The banana cream pie is a must for dessert."}
{"text":"Eh, the food isn't amazing. Average for setting.  The French onion soup is good but on the sweeter side. I wanted to try somthing different and went with the pork chop given that it is local.  The meat itself was good but the sauce was bland and the sides were pickled.  I wouldn't order again. Should have gone with the beef or lamb. Bread is bland.  Servers are nice though."}
{"text":"Pretty solid food, I had the Tuna Tartare and the French Onion Soup. The French Onion soup was thick, and the cheese was good quality. Has a very nice rich taste, very heavy. The Tuna Tartare was interesting in that you crack a raw quail egg into the tuna, and mix it around. The bread could have been better, and I thought the tuna tartare was a little bit too mild and mashed, good quality but didn't have much flavor. I would only eat here again if I was too tired to venture out of the hotel.."}
{"text":"Came to La Sociètè for a classy French dinner while visiting Montreal for a bachelorette party. It was quite good with the best part of our meal being the Seafood Plateau we ordered as our appetizer - for $95 we got a lobster salad, lobster tail, mussels, oysters, salmon tartar, and shrimp + a bottle of prosecco - it was amazing. Otherwise, amongst our group we ordered the salmon, steak, and burger and were pleased with our choices. The restaurant itself wasn't the liveliest of places, which can possibly be just because of the type of establishment it is or maybe because it's connected to a hotel."}
{"text":"The decor is very pleasant and vintage. The service was great. We had oysters, raspberry point from PEI. The mignonette was on cue. We had The French onion soup which was excellent. The foie gras on a raspberry coulis was amazing. The steak tartare was well done. We really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Sunday night and super quiet, 8 people in the whole restaurant. The bar on the other side seemed to have more of a buzz.The Habs had a home game so maybe that had something to do with it? Still, it had a relaxed and warm atmosphere. We ordered the beef tartare as an app. We had it spicy. 80g portion was good for sharing. If you've never had tartare and want to try it for the first time this would be a good choice. It had more stuff (parsley, onion, lemon) than other Tartares I've had and didn't look/taste as 'raw' - it was tasty- would get again. We also had the duck confit. Portion size was adequate as an entree. I thought it looked and tasted a bit dry but D said he was happy with it. I ordered the scallops and pork belly. When the server brought it out, I was shocked at how small the portion was. Ummm,  $32. For 2 scallops resting on 2 small pieces of pork belly???? Anywhoo, I ate it veeery slowly and I have to say all of the flavours were amazing! The sweet, salty, smoky and the crunchy and smooth textures of all the ingerients were a true delight. One more scallop and pork belly on the plate would have been perfect for the price point (I'm not a pig, but I'm no bird either and I don't care much for dessert). If u do order dessert you'll probably be full. Service was okay, food came out in a timely manner. No one really checked on us, so I wasn't really feelin' the love, but no biggie."}
{"text":"I asked for egg whites in my Benedict eggs and they told me it was not possible, (first time in my life that they can't do it) I had to order something else! Really?"}
{"text":"Great place and conveniently in the Loews Hotel which is awesome especially if you're staying here ;) we had dinner at the bar and the staff is simply perfection: friendly, accommodating and warm without being pushy or hovering ever, so we were able to enjoy talking and eating and the company. The $1 oysters (I think Tuesday and Friday's only) are fantastic and the veggie pasta was rich and creamy and filling unlike most vegetarian pastas I've come across. Definitely comfort food after a long day of travel and a cold night in. The duck confit was Devine. We are happy to have this place in the hotel for the duration of our stay."}
{"text":"Je suis fan de ce restaurant! Je l'ai essayé pour la première fois avec une amie parisienne, pour lui faire découvrir un bistro français authentique à Montréal. Tout d'abord, nous avons été charmées par l'intérieur du restaurant. De larges banquettes en cuir foncé, un plafond de vitrail magnifique et coloré, un présentoir pour les fruits de mer. Nous avons été accueilli puis servi par le gérant de l'établissement. Nous avons débuté par la soupe à l'oignon et les poireaux vinaigrette. La soupe était délicieuse selon mon amie avec une épaisse couche de fromage et en ce qui concerne les poireaux je pense ne jamais en avoir manger de meilleur. La sauce épaisse et sucré ainsi que les escargots se mariaient très bien. Puis, nous avons poursuivi avec le tartare de saumon, une large portion pour seulement 23$ avec une grande quantité de frites en juliennes et une salade avec une sauce asiatique surprenante en bouche. Mon amie a pris le demi homard sur grill, une portion généreuse d'un homard cuit à la perfection et juteux. Puis, nous avons terminé par un mix de desserts: le petit gateau au chocolat, une soupe de fraises et basilic et la crème brûlée. Je salive juste à y repenser. Les 3 choix étaient sublimes. Bref, je ne peux que recommander cet endroit, un service courtois, professionnel et une ambiance intime parfaite pour les couples ou meme pour les familles comme l'établissement à une grande capacité (si je ne me trompe pas jusqu'à 195 personnes)"}
{"text":"Very happy to find this little gem.  French onion soup was good, though not the best I've had.  It's definitely better than 95%+ of what I had the misfortune to try in NYC. I felt compelled to rate the place pretty high just on this soup alone, not because it was earth-shatteringly great but just because I've been struggling to find good French onion soup.  He small seafood platter was very good.  Oysters were shucked and cleaned properly, without the sand that is often left over at oysters up and down the east coast. Shrimps were cleaned and deveined.  Mariana sauce was meh but I like the shrimps dipped in the dressing in the lobster salad.  The lobster salad was distinctly unFrench with its heavy use of cilantro but it worked pretty well with the dressing.  I recommend the small platter for sure.  Beef carpaccio was very fresh and very delicious.  I think there was maybe a tablespoon or half tablespoon too much oil but it was well within personal preference range and my wife really liked it.   Duck confit was very nicely done.  The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was still tender.  The roasted veggies below the duck tasted good, albeit ordinary.  I'd have taken a little more time to torch the edges of the creme brûlée but the middle was already a little too burnt so I guess whoever did it just needed to be a little more careful.  It was still a pretty good effort and the custard had just the right consistency and amount of sweetness.  Overall an excellent dining experience for this price point."}
{"text":"So far, from my week long stay in Montreal, this place was my least favorite. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't great. We went for brunch and I ordered the lobster benny. The potatoes that came with the dish were pretty excellent, but I was unimpressed with the benny. It was put into a broiler which over cooked the eggs and gave the hollandaise a hard brown crust on top. When I order eggs benedict, I look for that buttery sauce. It was more like silly putty over an egg. : / the OJ was good and service was decent."}
{"text":"I'm the midst of the Loews hotel lies this excellent restaurant. Normally hotel restaurants are hit or miss (usually a miss), but Le Societe is far from that category and provides a great dining experience from the food to the service.  There is a bar section that houses a few tables on the side, then there is the actually dining room that has an open set up with booth type seating. I took to the dining room and got an order of Moules Frites (mussels and fries) for lunch.   The dish was excellent. The fries were pretty standard, but the broth the mussels were coated in was delicious. It was my first time having this combination and I must say they did a hell of a job.   The service was very professional, which matches the overall caliber of the hotel. Having a place like this on site makes staying at the Loews hotel a must. Makes for a great combination."}
{"text":"While Schwartz is an amazing basic smoked meat sandwich, this place... oh this place makes an amazing elevated smoked meat sandwich, the addition of the maple mustard is the key. I recommend getting a side of the mustard for your fries.  The smoked maple old fashioned is as amazing as it is dangerous. After my third I realized I was quite intoxicated and having a good time. The music they play is fantastic and the staff is the best!  Thank you for the good time and I will be coming back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant inside of Loews Hotels. I enjoyed the burger although it could have been better. Everyone always raves about how amazing the food is in Montreal, this restaurant was a bit less than I expected. Fries were good.   I didn't understand the Caesar salad. I absolutely love Caesar salads and this one just didn't do it for me. The dressing was so so and I really didn't like the fact that I had to cut it my self."}
{"text":"So I've discovered why (maybe) this place isn't that popular.. It's only been around for five months..! Hopefully people will start coming more often though because their food was excellent. My sister and I both had the eggs florentine with a side of potatoes, and it was one of the yummiest eggs I've had since moving to Montreal. Not on an English muffin, but on toast, yet still remarkably satisfying and filling you to the point where you're not going to burst..! Good portions, relatively good prices, and great service! Definitely coming here again..! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation for 3 and the waiter has given us a really nice place. The restaurant is beautiful with nice decoration. I went here for the breakfast, the brunch is between 11 am and 3 pm, but I was more interested in breakfast items (eggs, potatoes, salmon bagel). Service was quick, waiter and waitress were really nice. The waiter who took our command forgot our toasts, but we also forgot, so nevermind.  The food was good, I liked the potatoes, they're a little crunchy. My breakfast sandwich was, in fact, an English muffin like the ones served at McDonald's, although much better.  To sum up, we paid $60 including tips and taxes, it's ok for 3 people, I would come back!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Lowe's ..came down for breakfast. Awesome server and hostess! Gabriel was the one of the sweetest person I have met! So polite and patient!  I eat Oatmeal everyday at home and even when I travel! But the oatmeal I had here for breakfast is the best ever! I can't wait to try this place for dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the Seasoned oatmeal and my fiancé had the Le classique. Mine was ok and he said his was good. The fresh squeezed orange juice tasted like the oranges weren't the greatest/ripest or that it was fresh squeezed mixed with carton orange juice. The service was good :)"}
{"text":"We're staying in the hotel and this is the restaurant in he hotel.   The food is  unexpectedly good. Had the bagel and smoke salmon and lobster roll and shared an onion soup.   Decor is very stylish."}
{"text":"Wow. This restaurant is amazing. Our waiter Pasquale was fabulous- kind and informed. I won't even bother to write what we ate because it was all amazing (although I had the lobster and it was Devine). I'll just say- when the conversation stops when the food arrives and you forget to drink your wine - you KNOW it's amazing food. 5 stars all around- including a beautiful, comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant hidden at the base of a hotel with reasonable pricing. Stayed downtown Montreal for only one night and wanted to find some decent food in the area. The hotel down the street recommended this little restaurant. I didn't know what to expect since it was at another hotel so thinking it would be small portions and super expensive. To my surprised I got the lamb and it was reasonable at around $27. The food was excellent, the lamb was super tender, the rice was nicely flavoured. The fries which I had to pay extra came in a decent portion and it looks like it was lightly seasoned with cinnamon.   I would recommend coming back again."}
{"text":"Had dessert and drinks with my dad at Maison Christian Faure....here are my thoughts:  Ambiance - this place is VERY cute. Really loved the cozy atmosphere.  Service - very friendly and desserts came out quickly.  Desserts - I couldn't partake in anything because nothing was dairy-free, but my father, who never likes anything declared his Napolean \"wonderful.\" He also referred to his cappuccino as \"excellent.\" Since he rarely compliments anything this was an amazing surprise.  Overall - Although I wasn't able to eat anything at Christian Faure, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this restaurant by a client and now he is a friend. The food is superb and the service attentive but not overbearing. I had the NY Strip cooked to perfection with a starter if PEI oysters. The other members of my party had the lobster roll, minimum mayo with a sprig of fresh dill to make it new and interesting. Did I mention the brioche roil? House made and Devine. Very close to a French bistro understanding we are in North America, so go, enjoy."}
{"text":"While staying at Lowes Hotel Vogue, we went for lunch here. The restaurant is adjacent to the hotel and also is serving breakfast, dinner and has a full bar. Tre vibe is simple but very comfortable and welcoming place. The waiters were quick to take our orders, and made sure our plates always had fresh bread. Their French inspired menu is simple, but everything we tried was delicious, not over salted or too buttery. Their duck pate, the salmon over garden vegetables and the vegetarian pasta is highly recommended, it's tasted and looked beautiful."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We were a group of about 10 people and it took over an hour to get our  brunch food. They are not at all flexible in adjusting their menu. For example, I asked for their menu item \"eggs in a basket\" but for the eggs to be well done because I'm pregnant. They said they can't do it. A friend asked for \"eggs in a basket\" but if they can replace the sausage for something else. They said they can't substitute anything, so he ended up with a tiny portion meal and after waiting so long for it. Finally I ordered a \"herb omelet,\" well done with additional mushrooms. What I got was a not well done omelet with no mushrooms. They never refilled our water glasses. They ran out of whole wheat bread and fruits. The menu is also very limited and they don't have usual brunch food like regular eggs and crepes. We all had a bad experience. Would never go back!"}
{"text":"Classic French with a twist of looong wait times....it wasn't even worth the wait. Mediocre at best.Complete letdown."}
