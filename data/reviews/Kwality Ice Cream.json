{"text":"Flavors of India. Very different then cold stone! Butterscotch, pista and cassata were my favorite of this stores. Good sitting space for families."}
{"text":"This is awesome place to try Indian flavors of ice creams. Lot of options and reasonable price. Place is clean and owner is very nice."}
{"text":"Love the flavors! The ice cream tastes so fresh and the flavors cater to all ages! My favorite combination is a scoop of orange pineapple ice cream with chocolate ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A special treat in the boring world of froyo and chain ice cream places, kwality ice cream mixes Indian flavors into fresh ice cream. They were nice enough to let us try a bunch of flavors and everything was so good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was recently in town, and had to stop by again with the kids! They have amazing flavors and the service is really friendly and helpful in choosing new flavors. English Toffee is my favorite. The kids enjoyed shakes."}
{"text":"Amazing varieties of ice creams. I have been to Kwality outlet twice and sampled a few. My favorites are paan masala, fig & walnut and tiramisu. Nice ambiance to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"This is some of the most delicious ice cream!!! Such cool flavors like the guava and lychee that I got!"}
{"text":"Awesome Ice cream parlour for young & old! A lot of amazing indian & tropical fruit flavors. 
The best I liked was butterscotch & Malai kulfi! 

I will definitely be back for more soon!!"}
{"text":"1st time here.. Wow!!!!!! Fresh,soft ice cream!!!!!!! With flavors I haven't ever seen like orange pineapple    price is fair for what ur getting... Awsome place. B."}
{"text":"Very expensive, small portions, excessive pricing.  Charging different prices for different flavors when the ingredients are similar is unusual.  $0.75 for a machine made waffle cone is excessive.   Won't return"}
{"text":"SUper awesome experience. Everything I tasted was phenomenal. I loved all the flavors."}
{"text":"Ice cream is delicious especially with different unique flavors and the manager is very nice!

4 start: quiet and needs music to keep the place lively. Almost wanted to nap while eating. Also the price per scoop is a bit to much, paid almost $9 for 3 scoops."}
{"text":"Good to have a locally owned and operated ice cream parlor to go sit down in. Some of the most unique choices I've ever seen and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Kwality Ice Cream. 16th Street and Bell Rd, Phoenix. Simply amazing flavors! The choices are likely 50% ones you know and 50% ones you must try. This is the definition of a hidden gem that deserves a large loyal clientele. Our city is full of popular ice cream joints with a gimmick. No gimmicks here. I'd argue its the best tasting ice cream in the valley. You owe it to yourselves to try it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!! Most delicious ice cream ever! Even the non-Indian flavors are so tasty and better than any other ice cream place around."}
{"text":"My beloved homemade ice cream store!!! 

I'm a fan of their lychee and chikoo flavor!! I just can't get anything else. It's a bit expansive but you get what you paid for I would say. There are small chunks of fruit in the ice cream which assure me that the owner does use fresh fruit to make their ice cream. 
Service was good as well! I wanted to buy a big box one day and couldn't decide of whether to go with lychee or chikoo and the owner offered to made me a box w both flavor! Mayb it's something simple for them to do but she made me feel like she cares much! :)"}
{"text":"Went there for sitafal icecream which was not available. Good place but needs more variety."}
{"text":"I love how unique the flavors are, and how different spices are incorporated into the ice cream. I highly recommend this ice cream shop!"}
{"text":"Good creamy ice-cream in many exotic Indian Flavors. 

The ice-creams are all natural and don't contain eggs.

I didn't know what flavor to order here. I tried a sample of one of the more colorful flavors. Maybe it was Mitha Paan? WOW! it was so intense. I wasn't ready for it. It had so many flavors going on that my brain couldn't process all the flavors going on and it ended with with a fennel flavor finish. So different and interesting.

I wasn't prepared for that kind of excitement so I went with a lower octane flavor of Lychee. It tasted just like Lychee with chunks of Lychee in it. The Ice-cream was creamy and delicious.

My husband had the Butterscotch. It was also very good and tasted just like Butterscotch.

Interesting sugar-free options are on the menu too.

The atmosphere is clean and bright.

 Plenty of easy parking.

The woman working there was cheerful an helpful."}
{"text":"Wednesday, 8:15... and no signs of life yet the signs states it's open till 9. If they are going to close early, they should have a sign up or something. Not sure why they aren't open but it's completely black inside"}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. They had a bunch of different flavors. Regular flavors and Indian flavored ice creams. I had the thandai and coconut. Sooooo good. My boyfriend got the blueberry cheesecake and orange mango. I tried his and they were super good too! The lady was patient with me when I wanted to try the different Indian flavors and was super nice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. High quality ice cream and a large variety of flavors. Don't forget to try the Cassata. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"The 3 stars isn't for the ice cream. I thought it was really good. My issue is with the value for the money. One scoop was over $3. Add.another 0.50 cents for sprinkles that were barely there, and it pushes you over the 4 dollar mark with tax. It's a little outrageous for what you get. I could buy a premium ice cream at the store for that price and have it for a month. Nice people, good ice cream, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have already been a few times. This place is exceptional for me as I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and so I've been forgoing sweets ever since. We stopped for my wife to get a falooda...one of our FAVORITE Indian/Persian desserts ever. While waiting it was pointed out that they had SUGAR FREE ice creams, so I tried them. Expecting the worse I was surprised to say the least that they are amazing. My first truly sweet treat in almost two months as I order a small scoop of all three flavors - we returned the next day for another sample :)"}
{"text":"Kwality Ice Cream is part of a mini-chain that serves well, \"kwality\" cream that's heavily inspired by Indian flavors. The menu offers a combination of traditional ice cream flavors with those that actually might be intimidating if you're not familiar. It's located in that plaza across the street from Spinato's and Codfather. You know, the weird one that looks oddly out of place with the rest of Bell Road.

My girlfriend and I stopped by here since I received a 10-dollar gift card from a work colleague. The lady working the counter didn't really have much input about what to recommend, let alone about what were the most popular flavors.

We sampled several. I actually regert not getting the chocolate, which has a bit of a unique flavor. I ended up playing it safe and going with mint and chip, while my girlfriend ordered the coconut. The ice cream itself was fine, but not really anything spectacular in comparison to other places. The mint in mine tasted natural, as opposed to the artificially enhanced flavor that I've actually grown accustomed to the point where I'm ashamed to admit that I like it.

Perhaps the real appeal lies within its Indian-inspired flavors. At some point, we'll probably return to check them out again and dig a little deeper. 

On a side note, I didn't use up the entirety of my gift card balance, so they gave me the remaining amount in cash - which was kind of odd.

Anyway, they're worth a try and definitely a place we'll return to at some point down the road."}
{"text":"This place had the most unique and delicious ice cream flavors I've ever seen! Such an impressive and surprising treat. I had at least half a dozen samples before I made my choice, and each sample made it more and more difficult to choose! 

I finally went with a shake made with orange/pineapple and vanilla. It was like the best creamsicle ever. So refreshing! 

Even more sweet and refreshing were the owners. They were helpful and patient, even though we showed up 10 minutes before closing time! Will definitely be back when we are in the area again"}
{"text":"Not your typical ice cream, but that doesn't make it any less delicious! The place is always clean and whoever is working is always so polite. They let you sample the many different flavors before you make a decision. I recommend the kulfi. It's kind of like an ice cream, but the consistency is more solid. Difficult to explain, so try it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I'm always happy to find real ice cream places!

This little shop has some interesting flavors like lychee as well as the popular flavor options. Some sugar free stuff too.

My milk shake was small for the price; about the size of a tall drink at Starbucks.

Nice addition to the area!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream place i have visited in recent times.  This place is a must visit to taste their unique falvors. 
* Rajbhog, Paan masala etc. tastes perfect
* Sugar free ice creams with such great tastes
* Nice faluda
I personally loved this place because of their sugar-free ice creams. 
Reducing one star because their website shows a huge variety of flavors, but in reality only 50% of those were available in store. Some of the flavors can be more creamier."}
{"text":"Awesome stuff. Paan ice cream, Malai Kulfi just like Parsi Dairy in India and the Kulfi Falooda is like Kailash Parvat. I would die for the Cassata and love the fact that all the ice cream is low in sugar and made without eggs. They also have sugar free options and contains 50% fruit. Go get your scoop!"}
{"text":"Delicious and exotic flavors of icecream.  Very creamy and decadent.  The owner and employees are super friendly. A little neighborhood gem for sure. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place after eating dinner at the new Indian restaurant. We got to test a few flavors and the person helping us was very friendly. I had the lychee ice cream and it was on point. Loved the bits of lychee. I'm excited to visit this place again to try more flavors! They had a lot of unique flavors - many that I didn't recognize but am open to trying. Their pricing is also very fair too! 

The space is clean with lots of seating. It's nestled in a fairly random plaza, but truly is a gem!"}
{"text":"Good variety. Ice cream was a little hard and took a while to soften. Good quality overall."}
{"text":"Since we avoid sugar, it's really great to find decent quality sugar free ice cream in interesting flavors. Flavors is what this stripmall ice cream shop offers, flavors you won't find other places along with some of the standards. Owned by Indians, this is a unique dessert location, one I hope will get the customer base someplace this unique deserves. Clean not too fancy and friendly; I say put Kwality into you life."}
{"text":"Best organic ice cream in the world YAMMY I never had the  ice cream better than this one
 Every time I come here I'll get the best ice cream"}
{"text":"Kwality Ice Cream had been on my list for a while, since they have a lot of Indian flavors that you can't get elsewhere. The woman tending the shop was nice and let me try a few different flavors, which I appreciated. I liked the variety of flavors, ranging from butterscotch and chocolate mint to the more exotic apple custard and kulfi. However, all of the flavors I tried had a very grainy texture that was really off-putting. I didn't finish my scoop of apple custard ice cream because it was so grainy (but otherwise, the taste was great) and my group had a similar experience, unfortunately. Because of the texture, I don't think I'd be back, unless one of my non-egg eating coworkers is really craving ice cream. (They don't use eggs here)"}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream with a great variety!! My favorite is the Ferro Rocher chocolate ball ice cream. Definitely a repeat customer here!!"}
