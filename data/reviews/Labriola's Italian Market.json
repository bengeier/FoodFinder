{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE. The OWNER is RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS.  Twice I tried to walk in to see what they got to offer and walked out almost swearing at them. I went one night, walked in- and it stunk like old mill. There was an old man in front of us who just walking around there. A rude Italian lady came and yelled at me and kinda kicked me out saying the store is closed and then started talking to the other customer who was there! How rude and RACIST!  I tried to give it a try again, and went in broad daylight! This time I was looking for Imported Italian nutella (usually costs $6.99) but all the ones they had was expiring in 10DAYS. I asked if they had anymore in the back, the girls who were at the cash register gave me a lecture its like a freaking piece of gold coz they got it from Italy.... and ignored the fact that the product was expiring in ten days. The owner was called, ,literally five min of waiting, a whiny Italian man came and said no discounts for the piece of crap that needs to be consumed in ten days! I was not will to pay $7 plus tax for a jar of nutella, so stormed out fuming in anger. They are rude, and I will never ever walk in there again. If you want Italian stuff go to PENNMAC in Strip district. Don't waste your time walking into the nursing home smelling store where people are making you feel like they are doing you a favor by letting you in in there damn stinky store. My boyfriend is FROM Italy and he is disgusted by them also."}
{"text":"Great grocery with hard to find products. This is an old school kinda place. Prices are reasonable, not great, but its worth it for the quality. I read the 2 and 1 star reviews and they're absurd. Everyone here is friendly, maybe they're just not familiar with Italian hospitality."}
{"text":"just finished eating the rolled eggplant.  pretty good.  had to be heated up and has some ricotta in between the rolls.  it was a good lunch and it's so affordable here.  i'm sold on lab's!  i may have to start picking up lunch meats here as well....."}
{"text":"Great Italian market with a variety of premium pastas. Great imported cheeses. Namesake sauce is good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I usually have a pleasant experience in terms of finding what I need. However, the staff are not consistently friendly, I've found. Not to mention, you will walk away paying more more than you intended, at no fault of your own. The younger boys working the deli are sweet but I honestly don't have a lot of nice to say after my last visit here.  I called in advance to see if they had baccala, which is salted cod typically carried around the holidays in most stores. It's pretty hard to find outside of peak season. To my surprise, the woman on the phone said they carried it. When I got to the store, everyone look confused behind the counter after I asked for one pound--at $7/lb. Hesitating, the young man went to the back and grabbed me some fresh cod that looked delicious. However, he told me that the smallest incriminate he could give me was a pound and a half, which he insisted they were not able to lessen for me. Um why couldn't they just cut it? I didn't complain... Just took my cod and left.  I walked out paying THIRTEEN DOLLARS --double what I intended--for almost 2 pounds of cod that I didn't even want. What happened to going over and beyond for the customer?   The most disappointing aspect of this incident is that the other ladies behind the counter (one of whom had to have been the one I spoke with in the phone) remained tight-lipped and unapologetic for the inconvenience. It was one of those feelings where you know as soon as you turn your back they will all roll their eyes at each other. I vow never to return there for my cod-- and that's a shame because we, unlike most, buy it all year round!   Next time, I will make the extra trip go to Global Food Market, where their cod comes frozen and is 10.99 per package for something I don't have to soak 7 days straight just to de-salt!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this market.  They have lots of wonderful specialty Italian items.  However, this evening I went into the store 10 minutes before it was going to close.  Just needed to pick up two things. We asked the young man at the door if it was too late to pick up a few items and he said no so I went in and looked for my cheeses.  Everything was fine - one of the other young men in the store even asked me if I needed anything else and I picked up a packaged cheese rather than have him slice me any. Then, an older gentleman appeared and said to my husband and I \"Can you finish up because we want to close up\"  - after two other people had told me to take my time.  For cryin' out loud, it's three days till Christmas - could he not have been so rude?  I wanted to put everything back and walk out, but paid for my items. I felt really insulted. I don't think I will go to Labriola's Italian Market again.  I will stick to my original plan of going to the strip. Customer service is everything."}
{"text":"Great Italian market and deli. Lot's of Italian specialties. The have a wide selection of dry goods, canned goods, baked goods just about everything Italian. Great deli, and prepared and frozen foods.  When you enter, the smell is marvelous. Walking in the extensive freezer case is on the left with everything from deserts to pastas. The deli is all the way in the back, so you get to walk down one of the fully stocked aisles, causing you to check it all out on the way back. We went in today looking for one item and left with a dozen, including some hot sausage. Labriola's was a nice discovery for us. I am sure we will return."}
{"text":"Love this store. A one stop shop for me. So many pastas to choose, fresh breads. Just wish I could buy my red wine here too but that's PA"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more credit. I am from Pittsburgh originally and LOVE going there when I come for the weekends. I usually stop there and shop for my Bubba en route to see her. It is always such a great place to find unique foods. However, yesterday my experience was less than poor-fair.... it was AWFUL! As I was checking out, a product was mis-marked, so the cashier and I went back to double check and all of this product was mis-marked, so I was concerned because they were all mis-marked but I was being charged DOUBLE. When I asked to speak to a manager, he became very aggressive and rude, stating that I \"needed to take it or leave it\" at the price \"really\" was. I was so taken aback by his rude tone and personal space invasion! Then he added \"You knew it was marked wrong anyway, you KNEW it was suppose to be more.\" I could not believe it! I think I was treated terribly for a mistake that was not mine! After being a long time customer, I WILL NOT BE going back here or to the one in Aspinwall, PA EVER again"}
{"text":"Wow, I've never seen such a huge selection of pasta and tomato sauces in one place as I have in Labriola's.  We frequent this place at least once a week to stock up on pasta and sauce.  We've even sent the sauce to family in the south. Love the large selection of  frozen foods already prepared."}
{"text":"I can't complain about a thing here - except that it's so popular, the wait at the Deli line can be a while during the peak hours. They have lots of staff who are more than eager to help, and you can do some shopping while you wait on your orders. Everything is fresh and high quality. Because of this, we do NOT buy any deli items at the supermarket during our weekly trips, and always make a separate stop to get them at Labriola's.  Another plus of this place is that their selection of Italian specialty items is impressive. Of particular interest is their range of authentic Italian pastas, of which we are big fans. Again, freshness is of the utmost importance, and they deliver on this promise. The freezer case is full of amazing things, like tiramisu, wedding soup, high quality ravioli, and lots more - certainly a big draw for our family.  Finally, I have to give a special nod to what makes these stores truly special - the PEOPLE!!!! Service is always with a smile and always with significant knowledge on the subject matter. No matter what my recipes have required, the folks at the Monroeville and Aspinwall stores have always helped me get what I needed in the most friendly and professional manner possible. (I did see another interview where they felt the folks at the Deli were a little cold - maybe it's because I'm a \"regular,\" but this has never happened to me. They're great. Of course, I shall be back again! Probably in the next day or two - even though I went yesterday! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I stop at Labriola's often but must admit, feel like an Irish/German outsider, especially at the deli counter.  Everything I've ever tried I have thoroughly enjoyed, even if I didn't pronounce it correctly.  Or quickly enough.  The deli staff is not a warm lot, they are a busy crew.  We love their hot spaghetti sauce, every deli offering that we've tried, Australian licorice (at the checkout counter) and their frozen selections - especially the wedding soup meatballs.  I will never EVER make my own, again!  There is a lot jammed into this little store, but it's definitely not a come-in-and-browse type of store; more like a hurry-up type of store... but no place has the flavors of Labriola's so when in Rome...  Hurry up!"}
{"text":"A must stop pretty much everytime I'm food shopping in Monroeville. A nice smaller store that carries specialty Italian goodies. Everything is always fresh, from the bread (Breadworks, Mancini's, others) to the deli selections, cheeses, and a lot of delicious desserts (most in small 2 slice containers so you don't overdo it - they are delicious!). Try the imported prescuito, or the daily made pepperoni rolls. They also have a nice coffee selection. Specialty kitchen ware lines the wall near the entrance...so buy a Bialeta expresso coffee maker - you won't regret it. Great store!"}
{"text":"Yeah yeah yeah!  Extremely well-stocked.  Decent size.  Right by Target.  Easy parking (they have a lot).  For me a much more pleasant Italian market shopping experience that I have had in Bloomfield.  Deli counter in back makes ginormous sandwiches, but be specific about toppings or you won't get any!  Love the frozen meatballs.  A big container for under $6.  An easy dinner for two or more.  They make and jar their own sauce.  Haven't tried it yet but it looks great.  They also have their own house brand pies.  I've got half a dutch apple in my fridge right now.  Make that a quarter.  The other quarter is in my belly!"}
