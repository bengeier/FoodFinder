{"text":"After receiving a much needed facelift in decor and menu, the Field Club has entered the 21st century in style. We dined here with friends who are members (we belong to Longue Vue across the river) and we were thoroughly impressed with the service, food, wine selection, and atmosphere. We had an incredible, reasonably priced Meritage wine, delicious salmon with rice, roasted tomatoes and arugula, and homemade sorbet. The chef brought our food to the table and it was a beautiful touch. After being outdated for some time, the Field Club has stepped up their game and has delivered an elegant and fresh dining experience."}
{"text":"Getting there can be kinda of confusing if you're not from around there. Thankfully our group put up signs letting us know where to go. It's a beautiful old building and we had drinks before our dinner and awards. We went out on the deck and looked out on the golf course. It's a nice view, nothing to get too excited over.  After drinks we went inside for our dinner. We had 3 choices, steak, salmon, or a vegetarian dish. I got the steak and I like my steak well done. Of course it was still mooing. I picked at it and basically left hungry.  We a yummy dessert though. The room was freezing too!  We had a great award ceremony! The night ended and we started our 2 hr drive back home. I'd come back, but I'd try to get a server's attention next time and ask to have my steak cooked more."}

{"text":"Have you ever toured some old mansion or castle in Europe, where they have everything set up just as it would have been? Do you say to yourself \"OK, that's what the height of luxury looked like back then, but it seems kind of dated now?\" That's pretty much how I felt about the wedding reception I attended here. I'm sure for my grandparents' generation, this place was as classy and high-falutin' as it gets, but everything feels like one of those exhibits, stuck in the past.  Granted, a wedding reception is a staged affair that changes the vibe of any venue, so take that for what it's worth. The blandly fancy-looking plates, silverware embossed with the club's initials on the knife handles, and the usual big event food and wine that you'd be disappointed in at a restaurant but accept because they're cooking for 100 people all at once... it's all what you've seen before, probably what you expected a country club to be like. I just don't find it all that impressive.  I will say the patio overlooking the golf course is a very pleasant place to sit and enjoy a cocktail, but that's a small saving grace for what is otherwise a stodgy and stuffy palace of privilege. To each his own, though, and the married couple looked happy, so that's what counts."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the restaurant.  Ummm, what's the word I'm looking for?  Oh yeah, underwhelmed!  I really wanted to like the food here because I was going to have a client event here in a few weeks, however I can't justify choosing this place over all of the other options in my fine city.  It's a private country club and one of the most respected in the area so I thought it would be really good.  I had dinner here on Tuesday with my friend Gus, who is a member.  We started with a scallop appetizer that was pretty good, but the sauce could have covered up some of the freshness.  Gus ordered the crab dip which was probably one of the best things we tried served with toasted pita bread points.  I tried the vichiouse (no way I'm spelling this right) which can be delicious when it's well seasoned or can basically taste like cold milk when it's not. This tasted like the latter.  The entree I chose was the red snapper which was overcooked and underseasoned.  I've ate here before after golf at the bar and had much better food.  Overall, this is a good place to grab a burger after 18, but stay away from the \"fine dining\" options.  I don't know what the members pay for the food, but based on this it's too much."}
