{"text":"The name for this restaurant has changed.  It's now known as Deer Garden Signatures.   Which is the same one located at Time Square.  

Advertisement was showing $8.75 per bowl, well it came out to be closer to $15 per bowl.  The advertised price was just the basic, where you select soup base,  2 meat/veggies and choice of noodles.   Each additional add on was about $1.50 each.  Bowl of noodles came with a basic drink as well.  If you wanted to upgrade, cost will range from $1 - $2.

There was also side dishes to order as well for about $1.95 each.  We ordered the Maggie sauce pork chop and chicken wings.   Both dishes were pretty good but small.   Lol

I upgraded to the house special green milk tea.  They offered free tapioca for me.   They also provide free chilly oil sauce that evening.  Which was pretty good as well. 

For the actual noodles and soup, I ordered thick rice noodles with tom yum soup base.   Not a big fan of tomatoes in soup but surprisingly it was not that bad. Ordered beef brisket, fish slices and choy sum.  I would say the portions were pretty decent too.

All in all not that bad.  Strong fish smell in restaurant but that was expected. 

Will I come back... to be honest, food was not that bad but I would rather do pho with spring rolls :)"}
{"text":"I dropped by this newly open restaurant out of curiosity. Ordered the original fish broth with vermicelli, fish balls, and sliced beef brisket. Soup was hot and delicious. Fish balls awesome. Beef brisket was too little to appreciate it - I only got one slice which was broken into 3 smaller bits, almost didn't notice it in the large bowl. Another slice will be perfect but is it worth the extra 1.75? There are no veggie options but they do throw in one free crab stick cut in half, 3 pieces of daikon, cilantro and green onions. Service was friendly. Overall good. Will I return? Maybe."}
{"text":"Was deciding what food to try in this strip plaza, and decided to check out this joint. My bro and his gf decided to go for the hot pot fish soup with many toppings in there, and my gf and I decided to go for the pick 2 topping with noodle soup. We also got the fresh fried fish skin as apps and it came with a fresh fish soup. The fish was crispy and light, and the soup was very tasty broth. Also their tom yum soup is pretty good too!

The service was quite good and friendly staff. Will surely visit this joint again!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was very lovely and the inside looked really nice. Food was excellent, but the best thing about this place was the service! Definitely going back soon"}
{"text":"The decor is really nice and and clean and they have quite a few servers.  The food was not that big of a deal.

For $7.95 You can pick:
1 x Soup Base (Picked fish soup)
1 x Noodle (Picked Flat rice noodles)
2 x Items (Picked pork neck and sliced beef brisket)

Soup was REALLY bland, Thank God for chillie oil, makes everything tastes better.  Beef brisket tastes like cardboard and must've been days old.  The only reasons I am giving them 2 stars is because the place was nice and clean and the servers were very attentive.

P.S.  When they initially brought us the tea cups, it smelled / tasted of bleach.  But the servers was really nice about it and promptly changed it for us.

Repeat:  NO."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but I based my review as 2 stars because the pricing for their menu items were deceiving. For some fish noodle soup, it's about $7 BASE COST. Because it's a large bowl, typically the size is good for one person. However, this gets costly.... fast. 

For ~$7 you get your base selection of soup (their specialty being the fish soup, hence the name), choice of noodles (vermicelli, thick noodles, udon, ramen, etc.), and 2 toppings included (some toppings are $0.50 more, such as squid balls). For a combo (ie. a drink and 'reduced' price appetizers, it is $0.50 more to get the combo but an additional $2/3/4/5 depending on what appetizer you choose).

Here is the kicker though, ANY topping over the 2 you choose is $1.75 more. My sister chose 4 toppings (2 standard, 2 of the $0.50 ones thinking that the latter only costed $0.50 and the $1.75 would apply to any additional standard topping). However, when the bill came, it came to a whopping $4.50 more just for 2 MORE TOPPINGS (ie. for a few more squid balls and tofu balls). The reason is the squid balls costed $1.75 being over 2 toppings AND the additional $0.50 listed on the sides. This was very unclear and HIGHLY misleading based on how it's listed on the menu (and let's face it, customers can easily get confused when you have these different add-on prices in the same section). So basically, your basic $7 can become a not-so-cheap $10-11 bowl of noodles. Uhhhhhh.... WHUT.

All-in-all, the food is alright and it is a good size portion (enough to stuff you). I must admit their squid balls are quite good, though NOT for the price. Even with the so-called authentic fish soup claim, if I wanted fish-based noodle soup, there are plenty of Chinese restaurants that do a decent job without costing this much.

Food didn't wow me, and the price mishap is enough for me not to revisit here. I'm pretty sure eating elsewhere in this plaza would cost less!"}
{"text":"I love the fish soup! It's not 'fishy' as I was a bit hesitant to try initially.

I ordered the soup noodle with fish broth, fish balls, and deep fried fish skin. The fish balls are made in-house. The fish skin is super crispy and pretty good eaten dipped or un-dipped in the soup.

I also tried the sake clams. It's worth every penny. I wanted to drink the sake broth, but didn't want to seem rude.

I'd definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"We were there on Apr 28, 2013 Saturday 7PM. I ordered curry beef with rice, my wife ordered fish noodle soup. I know curry is their specialty, but I just want to see how bad it is. It came with 3 big potatoes, tiny portion of beef, may be 2 spoonful of beef for $7.95.  Curry  taste like one of those Japanese re-packaged curry. 

 Fish soup is a very fishy smelly, not as good as used to be. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Once in a while I like to treat myself to fish soup noodles.  Today was one of those days!  I was in the area and decided to try out this newer location.

I ordered the Noodle Soup Combo for $7.95 (choice of soup, noodle, two toppings plus $1.75 for each additional topping).  I chose original fish soup, vermicelli, fish paste, fresh sliced tilapia.  My vermicelli noodles looked wrinkled, but otherwise everything was super yummy.

The food came quickly.  I was pleasantly surprised the toppings included more than just the two that I had picked.  It also had imitation crab, mushrooms, snow fungus, parsley, green onion.  

The restaurant is very nice and clean with a quiet atmosphere.  Service was excellent, no problems changing noodle type last minute.

Will definitely return to try other toppings.  I suddenly remembered why I like fish soup noodles.  It's healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, it worked out to 20$ for two people without drinks. However, I found one staff extremely rude. She was rushing us to leave (even though there were lots of tables) and I did not like how she stared at us when we pay the bill. Probably will not go back since there are so many other fish soup place. Also, the place is pretty dead for a Sunday night where parking was hard to find in he plaza. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I came here for the hot pot with my mom and her friend and let me tell you that the hot pot is not worth it. It seems like the noodle might be, but the hot pot was ridiculously expensive. They give you a pot of of their fish stock for $14.99, and some basic stuff inside that wont be enough to fill a person, and then you have to order on the side. Every item is $3+ and the portions are tiny. The fish you order came with really tiny six slices and was really unsatisfying. They also dont have the hot pot dressings...

The service is good and the decor is beautiful. I'd come back and try the fish noodles, but def not the hot pot."}
{"text":"Fish Soup Noodles Supreme as the name suggests specialized in soup noodles... and the menu reflects that. 

You choose 
soup base: fish, chicken or Thai 
noodles:udon, vermicelli, flat rice noodles, glass noodles, etc 
2 toppings for free: beef, briskets, pork, fish, dumplings etc extra toppings $1.50 each 

Then you have your custom soup noodles!!! 

The above does sounded familar?!  

I was sad when Fish Soup Noodles House http://www.yelp.ca/biz/fish-soup-noodles-house-thornhill closed down in Thornhill and replaced by another HK style cafe. But I am glad that it reopened as Fish Soup Supreme!

The deco here is way way better. So many booth seats and the high ceiling with the nice neutral colour theme....

Lunch Specials for $7.50 that includes a bowl of their famous fish soup and tea/coffee.

Fish Soup Hot Pot! I want one of those... I will be back... I want one of those...."}
