{"text":"i've been coming here every other week but i'm done now. the tacos barely have any taste and the baos are simply put... not good. i had high hopes for a filipino spot that did tacos and baos, seemed like a match made in heaven for me.   today i got the beef lengua (tongue) taco and the fried chicken bao. the taco was decently made but after i finished it, i realized it had no flavour what so ever. seemed like it was missing something.  the fried chicken bao... such a disappointment. in my first review i mentioned how the portions were too small and after a few tries.. still no change. as soon as i unwrapped it i knew right away that i was going to be disappointed. the fried chicken was as big as my thumb. and the rest of the ingredients were just poorly put on. disgusted with the fact that i had such high hopes for these guys but clearly there's been no effort to improve."}
{"text":"Fell into this great new spot in the neighborhood yesterday. Food was great. Had both pork and chicken tacos, sopas, and a bao. I'll be back this week for another sopa...maybe twice :) Space is a little \"empty\" feeing, but the food and service definitely makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp tacos, were delish- spicy, perfectly cooked and juicy shrimp. Also had their vegetarian bao which was crispy deep fried goodness. The owner said he just added a new vegetarian seitan taco as well, so I look forward to trying it on my next visit. He's perfecting his recipes before their grand opening.  I wish they had tap water available because I hate Dasani, and also they need recycling bins for all the cans and bottles. Drink selection quite limited, but they said they are looking into a license to serve beer. Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I hate to say this because this place is right in my neighbourhood, but the food here is super underwhelming. If you want decent tacos, go down the street to El Asador, if you want decent Baos make the trek down to Mean Bao on queen. We had the steak and fried chicken baos and some tacos. The fried chicken had a slob of mayo some cucumber and carrots that were not pickled and some like warm and greasy chicken. The tacos were just slopped into the container and spilled everywhere (we weren't offered a fork) and the meat was chewy, there wasn't enough salsa and they were decidedly bland. Again, it's disappointing because this COULD be a decent neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Got some guacamole and a few tacos for takeout. We tried the chicken al pastor, steak asada, and pork sisig, and all were really tasty and filling. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got 3 tacos and 2 baos for two people.   Cleanliness & Interior 5/5  Service 5/5 fast & efficient  Food 3.5/5. We didn't get any lime for our tacos. Overall, the taco meat tasted a little on the drier side and a bit bland. The tacos didn't wow us over.   However, the baos were tasty, especially the fried chicken one! Would definitely come back for it.   Would come back to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great place for some quick eats. We tried a bunch of items on the menu as we heard this place had good tacos and good baos. I ordered the sisig bedded(on rice), seasoned fries , taco al pastor and sekky fried chicken. As someone did mention on yelp that they had one of the best fried chicken baos I would have to agree. It was crispy on the outside, super juicey and was marinated very well, it wasn't just a piece of fried chicken with batter (good job Tacos Baos). The al pastor is pretty good as I don't see a lot of places serving tacos al pastor on a rotiserrie. The cilantro cream jalepeno sauce that comes on the pastor they have is awesome....(I asked for an extra side of it) I dipped my fries in them until it was all gone lol. The price was $4.25 for the bao and I think around $7.50 for the pork sisig on rice. Wish they had more of their items available as I wanted to try the longanisa egg boa but they had ran out (guess its a popular item). I would have given them a 5 but they didn't have the longanisa bao. :( Will come back for more."}
{"text":"Sekky bao at $4.50. Chicken taco at $3.50. Fries at $3.  Hot but clean!  Great customer service!  My son liked it.  He prefers it over Taco Bell. As some yelpers have indicated on their reviews; the chicken was dry but flavorful."}
{"text":"Great new shop that has a new take on tacos, Baos and asada fries. We totally love the asada fries and the fried chicken bao (i forgot the name). The pork taco isn't a normal feature on the menu (its relatively new and maybe the menu is still evolving?) but it should be.   The food is great and so are the flavours. The place is credit/debit only and does not accept cash. Also you have to listen for your name to be called so it's not the most convenient place, but the combination of great food and cheap prices kind of makes me overlook that."}
{"text":"Delicious. I want to go back and eat everything off the menu. Explosion of flavours. Tacos baos is fun to say and eat."}
{"text":"Great spot for some casual street style tacos! The food here have some Filipino influence from the owners, so you'll find stuff like sisig tacos and sisig stacks (thick cut fries) on the menu - which is great and really differentiates them from other places.  They also serve steamed baos here, and the one with fried chicken is a must-try! The chicken is crispy, tender and juicy on the inside. Yum!  During my visit some items were not available, such as the Lengua (tongue) tacos that I really wanted to try. Probably just because they are brand new and still working out their inventory. Would have to go back to try them at some point.  Definitely worth a stop!"}
