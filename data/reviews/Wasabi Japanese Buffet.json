{"text":"Can I select No star?  This is the worse AYCE restaurant I've ever had.  The price is unbelievably high ($40), but the selection is so limited. Sashimi and sushi are not fresh at all.  The service is terrible!! they have no smile to the customers but the tip is automatically charged at the bill.  There is no reason to visit there again."}
{"text":"There are several good thing about this place:
- the place is clean 
- food presentation doesn't look bad comparing with other buffet restaurants
- the service is average
- personally i like the salad bar

However, there are several negative things as well:
-this is not a place for sushi. Sushi have to be ordered from the waitress. and they always come cold. i mean always! Sushi doesn't taste fresh at all. 
- the soy source for sushi is too salty, which made think that it's not for sushi, but regular soy source. 
-chinese food is too salty and oilly

{"text":"Not bad, but not overly superb either. It's a decently priced sushi buffet. But the menu is quite limited, and there's not a lot of selection. The staff are nice, and they are always accommodating when we need to host a 40+ party. I wouldn't really return here on my own, but I wouldn't mind going for a social event. There's much better AYCE sushi places out there."}
{"text":"What's good about wasabi?  All you can eat sushi, a nice modern decor, reasonable dessert selection.  

What's bad about wasabi?  Let's face it, in a buffet place like this, food is not going to be comparable to a restaurant with a good chef that spends a little more time to prepare your food.   But what strikes me as odd about wasabi is that the japanese food, they're average in every sense, Naha is close by, much cheaper and taste better.  Sure wasabi wins with the decor hands down, but the place is jam packed with people and the atmosphere feels like a crowded subway train, in spite of the decor.

The only good reason to come here is if you skipped breakfast and lunch and are so hungry that you don't care how the food taste.  The fried fish are never fresh, the tempura batter has the wrong texture.  The fact that these things are cooked in bulk Shows.   

Sushi is the one thing you can't completely ruin, as long as the fish are fresh.  Tonight, the fresh salmon tasted like smoked salmon, which makes me wonder how did they process the fish.  Not a good line of thought in a sushi place.

But the most annoying part of eating dinner here is that they automatically add 15% to your bill.  Hello, its a buffet, customer has to go hunt for his own food, and waiters always forget to brink your glass of water, the 15% tip is not earned here.

Anyway, I hope I don't have to go there again.  E.V.E.R."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Wasabi for years, what a difference, for the worse!  It was a Friday night and no lineup, first bad sign.  There is lots of MSG in their food.  After eating here, I had a migraine for 2 days, so another reason to stay away.  Didn't have one bit of snow crab legs, tray was always empty.  A lot of items ordered in terms of sushi was \"sold out\"!  By 9 o'clock, they came around to say they are closing up the food by 9:30!  Too early for a Friday night!  Definitely not worth the high price.  Would never go back!"}
{"text":"If there's an option of none star, I would be happier. One of the worst experience of dining ever. Other then the bill was cheap, everything else is unacceptability bad. Sashimi absolutely isn't fresh, a lot of food to choose but none is good enough to motivate me to get one more round. Greasy floor and food counter. Slow food refilling. Very very poor service with a lot of very very impolite people in the area, with kids running around all the time."}
{"text":"All I have to say is doshite? 

The sushi pieces were falling apart, and it seems like the chef's hands weren't as experienced with smaller nads as he was with long sushi rolls. 

To be frank, the tentacles, as well, were a tad salty, and not in a natural way. There was a strange slimy substance coating them as well. 

Frankly, the atmosphere was uncomfortable. The decorations were tasteless and vulgar, and the staff clingy. 

All in all, it was ok."}
{"text":"Good spread. The sushi is served to your table (for dinner) and the staff can be a little slow.  There is also a lot of Chinese dishes as well."}
{"text":"I came here with my family back in February and I have to say it was not worth the trip out to Richmond Hill. We came here specifically for the sushi buffet although they also serve standard Chinese food meals. 

The sushi was mediocre and service was terrible. We requested a number of items which were simply NEVER served, despite repeated requests to staff! They gave us a 2 hour limit at the table and I would say we ended up spending half that time waiting for individual plates to arrive. Terrible!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and let me tell you this: do NOT go on a weekday or for lunch. This place only deserves 4 stars for their weekend dinner. Service is not the best as the waiters very often forget your sushi order so you have to keep asking for it. Sometimes they remember to bring it half an hour later (after you've already ordered another one) and you end up with too much sushi. Their menu is great because they offer buffet style chinese & dessert AND AYCE sushi Ã  la carte. Of all the AYCE sushi I've been to, they have the best white tuna sashimi by far."}
{"text":"The sashimi are no where near fresh.... The salmon rose have no mayo how can a big sushi chain make mistake like this.....  Plus 2.75 for pop is just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Gotta say that I've been here more than once and after the first time it was not by choice.

This is standard buffet fare: Sub-standard food that is over salted/sauced to compensate for the time spent sitting in serving trays. The sushi bar is something to pass over as it is half decent and doesn't compare to places whose specialty is AYCE sushi sadly enough. 

This is really a place to go to if your goal is to over fill your stomach. not much else to do here chatting with friends is hard as its very noisy and more often than not, the eating of food gets in the way of talking."}
{"text":"I've been here 3, 4 times...the good thing here is they have variety of everything. Also,the place is nice and clean.

The thing I hate the most at this place is too early for last call and closing time. Most of the time we booked there for a birthday party & gathering at 8:30pm to avoid the line up, but by 9:15 to 9:30 they already tell you it's last call ...meanwhile the place closes at 10pm......they ask you to take extra food to leave on your table, and they stop making fresh food already...food would get cold and doesn't taste good no more .... After so many times like that, we told ourselves that we would never want to pay for a service like that no more.... Rush to eat, with cold food...ect...not worth the money at all....

If the time close is 10 pm. Then they should wait until 10pm to clean up like other places....right? I guess they are making lot of money already, so no need to give customers what they want no more...

However, there's a nice sushi all you can eat right on Woodbine & Hw7 near the Costco..They have lots of good food that Wasabi doesn't have...I really like it there...for the money, good food , good service...:)
Try for yourself...."}
{"text":"We came here for my daughter's birthday, on the 1st of January. It was very very disappointing. Both me and my wife were shocked that this sub par buffet cost 21$ per person, and there hardly was much to chose from. There were some piddly pieces of sushi to chose from, no better than the 5$ trays from the supermarket. Terrible. 

There are many tasty ACE buffets in Toronto and Richmond Hill. Find another one. There is no value to be had here. We've been here before and this place has really really gone down the hill.  We will definitely not return here."}

Whoever told me Wasabi is one of the better AYCE Japanese spot is a big fat liar. Plus the fact that it's located in Richmond Hill gave me the wrong impression that it'd be better than some places located in downtown (just because).

First of all, I want to point out that Wasabi is not a Japanese AYCE place, it's more of Asian AYCE just like Mandarin. Just because the name of the restaurant is Japanese...don't be expecting all Japanese food here!

For Adults, it's $12.99 for lunch on weekdays and $15.99 for weekends. For dinner, it's $21.99 for weekdays and $24.99 for weekends. Restaurant is huge, bright and spacious with lots of seating everywhere- green color theme was happening throughout the restaurant.

Just like every AYCE buffet spots, they have sashimi, sushi, hot foods (Japanese & Chinese), salad bar, fruits and dessert section.

To be honest, I don't really remember anything from this meal- except the fact that I left really full. No specific dishes stood out to me from....all that food I had (which is bad).

Summary: I enjoy AYCE time to time but food at Wasabi is below average and it didn't work out for me. This place might be good for large group gatherings...but if I was to have one of those, I would look really hard to find somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came here because it was an hour wait at another restaurant we wanted to dine at. I was really feeling sushi, so I thought this might suffice. I think the price was a little steep for what they offered. The buffet food was mediocre, I barely touched any of it because of how unappetizing it looked. 

The sashimi  and sushi were pretty good, but the rolls were unacceptable. I feel like we were given the drags of the night. The sweet yam was green in colour and the white tuna tasted really fishy.

The dessert was good, I really enjoyed the hot waffle and ice cream. 

Would I ever come here again? No."}
{"text":"Great choices for a buffet. Plain bad selection of sushi and only mediocre quality. Most of their pan asian - japanese inspired chinese food dishes were tasty for buffet. Price was reasonable for amount and quality of food in general. 
However, their sushi selection is pathetic and and quality is unmemorable at best. All you can eat limits you strictly to the selected menu items. i.e. they have tuna (ahi, it seems, not maguro) available for nigiri but not sashimi. their fatty white tuna was some what mysterious fish which definitely isn't but almost as white as otoro...   
Service was a bit variable where level of spoken English (and not even talking french) as well as promptness, friendliness and mistakes being made varied depending on server.  The facilities is clean and very presentable for a buffet. I was impressed w their decor (i mostly dun care but...) The place accommodated our larger group (9 peeps) rather smoothly.  I found parking to be somewhat problematic in the crowded shared lot in the mall which required some waiting and stalking. 
I'd eat there for general food but would not recommend for sushi eaters, unless medium quality sushi of limited selection on cheap hits the spot."}
{"text":"This place tries. Enjoyed the variety of food stations, however the taste of the food is mediocre. Best dish was the teppanaki beef cubes - be prepared to wait for it though."}
{"text":"One of my old Ryerson Urban planning classmates suggested we go here for lunch.  I figured since 2 of my friends live in York Region, I would take the trek up there.  

After reading the reviews I was hoping for all you can eat sushi.  Since I'm allergic to shellfish (ie shrimp and crab), I could not enjoy the feast.  Even that there wasn't much to select when it came to the sushi.  I only got to eat the spicy salmon roll which it wasn't), california roll and the salmon sashimi.  There were some items such as teriyaki beef and chicken, tempura battered shrimp and veggies.  The rest I guess were typically what you would find at Mandarin such as onion rings or pizza - for the kids or mungies in the family.  

The restaurant environment itself looked very modern with very young wait staff.  At least I don't have to hear someone tell me \"Welcome to Wasabi\" every 5 seconds before the long walk to my table.  For $14.99, the lunch special was just OK.  

If I'm in Richmond Hill or Markham I may consider the place but I know it didn't leave a lasting impression with me to suggest this as a place to eat."}
{"text":"Nothing special in my opinion, yet, it is a place my family frequents when we have large family gatherings, or out of towners. This place is always busy, and one time, my family came here early for Saturday buffet (I think like 11:30) and it wasn't busy for sure...but there was also no food out yet 

Seating can be pretty back-to-back but it goes with the territory. So does the mad rush to get to the dishes as the buffet area is quite small. Once, I was waiting for someone to finish scooping their ice cream, as the choice I wanted was on the other side of the glass sliding doors...and this man from out of nowhere was so impatient that he picked up the scooper and went to go for some ice cream. Unfortunately, he banged the closed glass door and made a dent. Vanilla ice cream at Wasabi is not THAT worth it...

My fave stations are definitely the sushi/hand roll station and the udon noodle bar. The food here is mixed with Japanese (sushi/sashimi), Chinese (dim sum type of dishes) to Western (salads, fries, fried potatos). It really does cater to everyone. When there is a seafood special, the place goes mad.

Good for large groups. Hustle and bustle and loud.

9/30"}
{"text":"This place confuses me. On one hand I like it because, although its a Japanese AYCE, it offers Chinese food. What I don't like about it is... it offers Chinese food! I don't think they mix well in my stomach.

Everything they serve up is just OK, from the sushi, salad, tempura, to the Chinese food and desserts. If at an exact moment I become painfully hungry while in the vicinity of Wasabi while knowing I'd get immediate seating then there's a good chance I become a customer. At that point I wouldn't care much about quality; I'd just wanna eat, and fast.

As mentioned in other reviews, they have a more typical buffet format where most of the selection is already cooked and served. You just line up and get what you like. There's a pretty good chance that the good dishes run out by the time you get your turn which is a little turn off."}
{"text":"It's a pass. 2.5.

I like the crab legs, I meant the cold ones at salad bar. I don't really like the reheated ones, why? Because it's not like it's from fresh live crab, it's previously frozen anyways. And I found them usually salty.

The sushi are just meh... The hand roll are better, but it fills you up faster...
Hot food items are okay, too bad it always has a long line up for it, or you have to fight for it when it comes out.
The grilled items are hit and miss, and alot of time it's really bad.

Oh, the red wine they have in stock, is cheap and horrible wine at it's best! 
(Or the most expensive cheap red wine vinegar that I had smelled in a long time...)

I mark it for 3 stars instead of the 2, is because that this place brings back a lot of memories..."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for family functions and it's definitely not my favourite sushi buffet.  This is a good place if you have family members that don't eat sushi as there is a wide selection of cooked foods.  I would much prefer dragon legend but it's also pricier than wasabi.  Sushi rolls weren't fresh but sashimi was pretty good.  The first time we came the sushi was order off the menu and it was better.  Last time the sushi was left out and you help yourself.  Cooked food also not the greatest.  Your typical buffet quality food."}
{"text":"Never again, poor quality. Sushi and maki rolls are overpacked with rice."}
{"text":"not bad not bad..
for a buffet sushi, it wasn't all too bad..
cooked foods were o-k, but i thought it was pretty decent for a buffet..
and really hapy that they had green tea ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"The plaza that this buffet is located in is very congested and it was difficult to find a parking spot. We went during the lunch buffet hours and it was uncomfortably full inside. I guess all buffets can't really do much in terms of organizing lineups for each station but it is still annoying to have someone just swoop in out of nowhere with a serving spoon from a different dish attacking the chafing dish in front of you. 

The service was good. We got our drinks right away and our bill came within minutes of us asking for it. The restaurant is clean but in terms of decor everything was simple and the layout was typical buffet style.

The lunch buffet prices was quite decent @ $15 per person. The quality and taste of the food was also very average. My coke was flat. One thing they needed to improve on was replenishing the dishes that were empty right away - I noticed that they let some trays sit empty for quite some time before it was refilled with food.  The desserts were typical staples such as ice cream, tiramisu, two bite brownies, etc.  I would recommend the cookies and cream ice cream as it was very creamy and consisted of a perfect balance of crushed cookies and vanilla ice cream.

Overall, 2.5 stars. I think this restaurant's atmosphere, service, and food is simply mediocre. Nothing spectacular about it and not really a place I would go out of my way to dine (ie. you could probably find another buffet similar to this one anywhere in the GTA)."}
{"text":"I mean food was okay. A lot of choices as per buffet goes. And the sushi was good

It's the customer service that brings it down to 2 stars. I got 2 free dinner coupons from my mom and I showed the hostess before we came in and she said they were still valid. So we ate and come time to pay, our waiter said that you can only use one coupon per purchase. Since I live downtown, I don't have time to come back often and these coupons are expiring, I asked if we could just split the bill. In my mind it works as 2 purchases if you split. The manager came and told us their computer can't split 2 bills. Which makes absolutely no sense. Why can't they just put in one adult dinner for each bill? 

Anyways manager was not helpful at all and the hostess failed to mention that only one coupon can be used per table.

Closes at 9:30 on a Friday night. Repeating 5 song playlist gets annoying. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE coming to this place. It's got a really unique style of all you can eat, of course it's more of a Chinese style where you go out to the buffet area and grab appetizers like cold shrimp, mussels, crab meat salad, seaweed salad, regular salad etc. Then jump over to the hot area where you can get some sweet and sour pork and mixed vegetable stir fry. Sounds like a China Buffet King right? Well, at your table you can order different types of rolls and sashimi. As well they have a whole row of tempura and other assortment of deep fried goodies. 

The best part about this place is the noodle station. I am full on Asian and I love me my noodles in soup. Here you can create your own concoction by adding shrimp or beef or baby mushrooms or lettuce in udon or ramen noodles. 

For dessert there was an ice cream freezer full of different flavours and an assortment of pastries and for the more \"health conscious\" (who go to all you can eat buffets) there is an assortment of fruits like grapes, oranges and melons. 

Everything is still top notch, but I find that the quality of the sashimi has decreased drastically. And they are set in what they have on the menu. If they don't have unagi and avocado rolls on the menu, sorry too bad, they cannot make it."}
{"text":"I occasionally partake in the gluttony of buffets...especially one that involves sushi and chinese food. So I can't say this place has any service. It is a great combination of sushi and Chinese buffet but a bit pricey at 24.99/person.

But what better way to reaffirm your abdominal fortitude than to order massive amounts of sashimi at a buffet. 

You have your server question your seemingly insane order and suggest that you \"hold off\". You catch the glint of contempt as they lay down tray after tray on your table, chuckling as they expect you'll NEVER finish it and then they'll get their pay back in the over-order charges.

Then the coupe du moment as you hand them back empty and relish in their astonishment of your eating prowess. 

Take pride for a moment. Then finish it off with a few Chinese buffets items, some fresh cut fruit and a touch of dessert. Whew, I'm stuffed."}
{"text":"The  restaurant is attractive and is situated in a 'restaurant mall'. We went there after we had sought out a Korean BBQ, that was closed.

Let me start by saying that it combines an all-you-can eat sushi menu (served at the table), and a pan-asian buffet. They also limit you to 1 1/2 hours, as they want to turn over the tables.

Their sushi is OK, but they, in our 2 visits, they inevitably screw up the orders. You are usually 'shorted' some items, and 'bonused' other items that you did not order. Their servers are surly, and generally unpleasant.

This is what drives my rating. If the service was better I would have given it 1 more star. The pan-asian buffet specialties are not so good, with the exception of fried smelts. There is a lack of 'high end' items, on the buffet. It is my theory that they service you poorly, so that sushi/sashimi orders are contained, and 'force' you to the buffet.

We did give them another shot with no change. I would recommend Maison du Japon or even Syogun, if you are in a 905 all-you-can-eat sushi/sashimi and more mood. I hope they get their act together, or they will be history."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Tuesday- $13.99 each, which is a very good price considering the substantial variety and offerings presented. There is sushi, Teriyaki, dim sum among other Asian food. While there isn't a huge selection of sushi you can compensate with the plethora of other foodstuffs lining the serving trays and well kept service stations. 

PROs: Clean, efficient and tasty food which doesn't leave you with that \"heavy\" feeling right after (don't get me wrong, you'll still want to take a nap after). Try the General Tso (just a few pieces chubby!) and the shrimp tempura.

CONs: So it appears that profit margin is off the alcohol; I had to ask for a refill of water even though I did imbibe in a beer or two. Be forewarned, there is a 10% service charge, which may be standard, but it does seem a bit underhanded.

Overall, a reasonable place to go for lunch!

-R"}
{"text":"Omg they now have sashimi during weekday lunch!  Aside from that, it's the same place as always - a few new desserts, good selection of Japanese, dim sum, and misc grill and western items as well.  A tad pricey at $17 per person but because of the AYCE sashimi it's worth it.

Great service though (went as a group of 32 people), good ambience, tastefully decorated, parking a challenge when you come too late after noon but there are options to park across the street.

A few of the dishes are a little surprising (onion rings?) but I suppose this is to appeal to everyone.  No matter what you like, you'll find stuff here you like.  But definitely a heavy focus on Japanese and Chinese.."}
{"text":"I can recall coming here when this place used to Club Papparazzi.  However I've had a bad experience at Wasabi years ago, so it was necessary to see if it had changed.

Though getting to the restrooms was a task, walking up a flight of stairs into a turn of hallways lol...the place is actually quite reasonable.  There was a lot of food to try, from chinese dim sum, and japanese sushi, western food, and to your typical chinese buffet selections.  The waiters were fast, friendly and efficient.

Desserts, are sub-par, not the best, after all the quality isn't usually present at most buffets that I've been to.  

Overall experience was a 4/5"}
{"text":"This place used to be far busier when it just opened and my take is that the crowds are catching on. The restaurant itself is quite nice, decorative and the prices they charge match that. The food, however, does not. 

In terms of the Chinese items at the buffet, I've had better quality at my local dim sum place during tea time. That's got to say something for a restaurant that mainly caters Chinese food, in an area filled with competitors. 

The upside is the sushi, however, I can get better quality at any AYCE sushi place in Richmond Hill or Markham. 
I ordered sushi here during two visits, and both times the server came once and never returned again. Also the time limit is sketch, and definitely not something you want to point out to a group of people.

Why oh why would I pay twice that of a good sushi or Chinese restaurant for ambiance, and ambiance alone?"}
{"text":"wasabi is an AYCE (all you can eat) japanese buffet restaurant that also offers a bit of chinese cuisine as well. i liked the modern decor and overall cleanliness of the space, and the food was pretty good as far as buffet food goes. the sushi is made to order, and there are placemat menus for you to reference when placing your order with the waitstaff.  in addition to prepared food, there is an udon station and a grill station. for dessert, you can choose from various sweets including cake, mochi, fruit, a chocolate fountain, and ice cream.

oh and there's pizza if you're not in the mood for asian food. or i guess for the picky eaters/kids in your group.

dinner was about $28/person, and drinks are additional."}
{"text":"I ate here last week and will never return. There is a minimal food selection for a buffet. Everything is fried.  Desserts were still in the store bought packaging and stale. Service staff is not friendly and the prices are ridiculous- very expensive. 

But that's not the worse part...bathrooms are a trek to get to and I witnessed my waitress leave her stall and merely splash her hands with water...no soap."}
{"text":"This has become my new favourite all you can eat restaurant. On the outside it looks like a house and on the inside its just amazing. The decor and the modern look and did I mention the variety of food omg! Now don't let the name fool you its not just Japanese food, there is a wide selection of chinese, japanese, and a little selection of canadian food i.e chicken wings and pizza.

Now there is sushi which you can be made to order from your table. However I was not a huge fan of the sushi, for I already have a favourite sushi place and I don't go to Wasabi for the sushi. 

Now I only go for dinner because they have a wide range of seafood from crab, shrimp, scallops, squid, salmon, mussels and other fish as well. If you have two plates of seafood you basically get your moneys worth. Another nice thing thing they have is their made to order soup and made to order grill. All in all a great buffet, and amazing friendly staff. 

Things to definetly try:

-seafood more specifically
-spicy grilled squid
-the grilled shrimp skewers
-beef with mushroom rolls from the grill"}
{"text":"The good: Good selection of sushi, sushi's fairly decent, the place looks nice, trendy, and clean, sushi hand rolls that are made fresh in front of you at the buffet, and green tea ice cream, nuff said.

The bad: Drinking glasses are tiny (I'm talking kid sized), chocolate fountain is nasty, quite expensive. You also have to order sushi instead of simply going up to a buffet and getting some (the hand rolls are an exception to this rule).

The verdict: A really nice restaurant to hang out at as long as you can afford it. A definite must try for any sushi lover."}
{"text":"Quick and dirty review:
Not the greatest anything, but all you can eat of it.
Nuff said. Seriously..."}
{"text":"Pro: 
Large variety of cooked and raw food
It is the only buffet that allows you to take as much seaweed salad as you wish yourself
Children price is applicable upto 12 years old and is at 50% off.  This is a great deal considering a 12 yr old boy can eat a cow
Weekend lunches INCLUDE sashimi
Decor is nice
Lots of big tables for big groups
** There is an accessibility washroom on ground floor **


Con: 
Freshness of raw fish is just okay (but never horrible)
Some cooked food is too oily

I feel quite neutral about Wasabi.  The food does not wow you like Sushi Legend, but its variety can't be beat.  It embraces the spirit of all-you-can-eat completely, so it is predictable (aka dependable).   Other than that it is slightly on the pricey side, I have nothing bad to say about Wasabi, because, on my book, it is a safe bet as far as AYCE goes.

Wasabi is the only AYCE I know that has an accessibility washroom on ground floor.  Therefore, it is convenient to people who use walker or have other mobility issues.

Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"If you have not yet tried Wasabi - don't bother.

It's expensive and the food is disgusting. You have to order the sushi at the table, but everything else (i.e. salads, soups, cooked food) you can get up and go get it yourself.

The food is very bland, the sushi does not taste like anything - not even sure if the fish is fresh.

On the weekends, everyone seems to be there for the snow crab legs - if that's what you are coming for, forget it! You have to fight/wait in-line to get it. It's probably easier to eat it at Mandarin.

If anyone suggests to go there, I highly recommend you go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I came back during dinner because I enjoyed it so much for lunch but I think after raving about it and insisting my friends go here I was slightly embarrassed that it is actually not as good as I had originally thought.  The hot food is a lot like a gross cheap greasy Chinese food and the higher dinner price is not justified by the extra seafood items.  These special items like crab leg are brought out sporadically and everyone just jumps on them and grabs the best pieces.  I don't want to pay money to fight for food... just my thought.

And a lot of the dinner menu items that has to be ordered is just not impressive.  The dessert items were the same as for lunch and I tried some green mousse item that tastes exactly like mouthwash - gross!  My advice is if you're going to go here, go during lunch and not dinner for the best value."}
{"text":"Another buffet? Sigh, alright.

Not sure where to start on this place; it's either really busy with a line or nearly deserted. And pricey: $20-25 for dinner depending on the day of the week.

Sushi is served by serving staff that is attentive when it comes to clearing away old plates and asking for drink orders (obviously not included in the AYCE price), but not when it comes to ordering the sushi (included in the AYCE price), shown on a menu on diners' placemats and can only be ordered from the wait staff.

A tiny salad bar hides behind the inaccessible sushi bar- except for hand rolls which can be ordered at the counter. A teppanyaki table sits in the middle serving up overcooked teriyaki, yakitori and some kind of fried udon dish. Always check first though, sometimes the udon dish is made with kimchi- fermented cabbage- and is only for the thoroughly disturbed palate (OK, OK, some people like it).
A row of the same cooked Chinese dishes time and time again sits beside a steaming counter with a hot pot station. Fried items (mixed appetizer, Asian, Western, and dessert) sit across from a cold dessert station and ice cream.

All in all making for a rather strange combination of definitely Chinese, including some intended solely for the serious Chinese food consumer, Japanese and some token Western dishes. Must tries: whole grilled saury, teppanyaki dishes (hit and miss, but frequently hit), and anything in the steamed section. Sushi is average to below-average. Don't expect to be able to order sushi more than once.

Not sure if it's worth what they charge, but can be made worth it in quantity."}
{"text":"Gross gross gross.

Went here last night for my mother-in-laws birthday.  There were 6 of us that went here and by the next morning half were sick with food poisoning.

We've since called Health Canada and they are now investigating.

Also, one other gross thing was we saw a long piece of black here in one of the buffet dishes everyone was eating out of.  Not sure if it was a customer or the cook but very gross and unhygienic.

I will never return here and sincerely hope Health Canada shuts it down by year end to save others from getting sick.  

I think it's time for Paparazzi nighclub to come back to this spot!"}
{"text":"Some of the selection was alright. but our group was majorly annoyed as the waiter & waitress took a while w/ the rolls/drinks and kept taking away our dishes before we were even finished. so most of us were eating sushi w/o plates. There was still an hr till closing & they were already giving us warnings about the buffet closing and began cleaning up (hello vacuum cleaner) trying to clear away everything. We were given the bill before we were even ready and were asked to take care of it NOW as the cashier was closing... Are you kidding me ? The place isn't supposed to be closing for another 30 mins @@. Service was just horrendous. I would give the food about a 3 but the service was way below a 1. When we questioned our waiter nicely, re: 'fast service', the waiter responded in a condescending way.... well we have to eat too you know?. Did we hear right? Yup. We were going to tip them but... changed our minds after working out the math. It just didn't feel right. 

Never eating here again! Worst AYCE ever !"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this place was pretty good! My mom was craving a Japanese all you can eat buffet. We have been to another Wasabi before and my parents really liked it. This place is much bigger though, and there is actually a full buffet with salad, soups, dessert, fruits, and a lot more options. We went on a weekend for dinner, so it was roughly $26-$27 a person. Drinks are additional charges. The place is huge, and it's pretty clean. 

My family really liked sashimi, so it was one of the reasons why we wanted to go. I don't like it that much, but I like sushi rolls. The good thing about this place is that they have a lot of options. Even though my family ordered a lot of sashimi, I was able to go around the buffet and still have a food. There was a lot of seaweed salads (I remember being a wet and dry seaweed salad), noodles, chow fun and mein, peking duck, tempura, soups (sweet&sour, and egg drop soup). There was a lot of other stuff, but I try to avoid fried chicken and french fries and stuff so I didn't check that aisle. There were about ~4 aisles of food to choose from. One of them is basically dedicated to DESSERT! Lots of ice cream (self help -- so all you can eat!) flavors: cappuccino, mango, green tea, vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream. The other desserts they had was cookies, mango pudding, tofu dessert, rice dumplings, fruits, and mini cupcakes, brownies, and candies.  

For the actual SUSHI/SASHIMI though, the sashimi is pretty good (for a buffet especially), and the sushi is kind of...disappointing. You have to actually order the sushi/sashimi from a waiter/waitress, and they bring it to you.It's still unlimited, but you just have to order it instead of walking to get it. Also, they will charge you if you don't finish. It's like $1-2 depending on if its a roll or just the rice or something. We ordered a lot of both. The rolls were in general kind of sucky. We don't know which one it is that we ordered, but it was a roll and inside the roll was basically all of the tempura scraps (like the crunchy tempura, but THAT'S IT. It was fried tempura scraps, seaweed, and rice on the outside. The other rolls were better, but we didn't reorder any of the sushi rolls for sure. It was worth trying once, but we didn't care to reorder. The sashimi was actually pretty good. Everyone definitely enjoyed it. The white tuna and the salmon is very buttery and my favorites. Also, the salmon rose is really good. Salmon on the outside, rice on the inside, and very pretty to look at. 

We didn't really have a problem with the service. They took our empty plates away pretty quickly and refilled our teapot in a timely manner. But one thing I didn't like is that when they take your order, they don't really print out what you ordered and cross it off as they bring it to your table, like how a lot of restaurants do it. Cause a few times we didn't know what kind of roll they brought out and what else we were waiting on to come out for the rolls/sashimi. Oh yeah, the bathroom is also upstairs. No seating upstairs though. Only the bathroom. I found it a little odd, but didn't change my opinion much of the food/restaurant. 

Either way, my mom is definitely hard to please, especially when it comes to restaurants (she needs it to be clean, good, cheap, good service or she will start complaining), and she actually enjoyed it here. We took a few business cards, so it looks like my parents definitely want to come back the next time we are in town. So eat up!!"}
{"text":"It's a mad house with tons of food. 

It's Japanese Food!
It's a Japanese buffet with decent Japanese food offering. There's sashimi, dessert choices of rolls and fried stuff to fill you up. I find dessert to be less tasty compared to other buffet restaurants.

If you love food, Wasabi is a place to go in Richmond Hill. If you love Japanese food and you're hungry...this is the right place. 


Small for the crowd
It reminds me of Asia - over populated. The crowd inside is humongous, everyone is hungry and impatiently waiting for their turn. There is one big buffet area and would be nice to see them split. It's a mental work out battling for three pieces of sashimi. 

If you go to buffets a lot, you may not mind the chaos but if you're used to sit down dinner... braze yourself...it's quite a ride. But food is plenty."}
{"text":"When you first walk in looks like a regular buffet, but when you dig in, you see the real goodness. Don't worry about your drinks, they will get there. There is a small variety of sushi but whatis key to this station is that you can ask for the fish without he rice. Yes, buffet sashimi! Then there is a variety of staple Chinese items like beef chow fun and steamed vegetables with tofu or beef. There were also dim sum items but they were not that plentiful and were average tasting. The cooked food was by far the busiest  but could have been because of the prep time in involved. There was a few items that didn't really match bt were good (mackerel, pizza, and and some other fish stuff). Along the back wall there were a number of deep fried foods like spring rolls, fries, won tons, tempura, etc. For the desserts, there was ice creams (12 varieties) fruits, jello, and cookies. 

Everything tasted good. I didn't care much for the deep fried items but the sashimi balanced that out. 

The price for lunch was $15.99 from 11:30 to 2:30. 

At the end of the day, the service was good and the food was too. My only gripe would be about the lack of parking."}
{"text":"You would expect fresh food, or at least average when it comes to a dinner ayce for $26.99. Beyond details, the food was stale. This was not my first visit. Last time was over a year and half ago. I did not expect this place to go downhill when it comes to food quality. This place used to be packed on a Friday night. It was half empty, there is still a wide selection but Mandarin has fresher food than this. Should've taken the emptiness as a hint. Disappointed, will not be back."}
{"text":"Often go there when I am in the area, decent for the price & concept \"all you can eat\"."}
{"text":"I am generally not a buffet fan but I have to say, I think the selections were very good and it is quite delicious. When I went here, they served nigiri sushi, sushi rolls as well as SASHIMI, which is a rarity from when I came from. The food cost is certainly higher with the sashimi. You have to order your sushi with the server though but that ensures that the sushi remains fresh and that people don't take what they can't finish. I also loved the durian fritters and the green tea ice cream. I'll give them an extra star for serving sashimi in their buffet. I highly recommend Wasabi Japanese Buffet if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I haven't been back since last year and remember the better days of their buffet. The salmon sushi was not fresh and very stiff like it was purchased frozen. The dessert was nothing to brag about nor recommend. I do have to give them credit for their varity and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Always enjoy an evening outing with my family or friends to Wasabi.
Main reason why we go is the all you can eat salmon & tuna sushimi.
Have been going there for the last 5 years and never had a problem with their food.

Haven't tried their lunch yet, but with the reviews, it does not seem like a good idea.

Value for the money, can't beat it.

If you want to avoid the line ups, best to go @ 5:30 pm, otherwise, you have a 20-40 minute wait during the weekends."}
