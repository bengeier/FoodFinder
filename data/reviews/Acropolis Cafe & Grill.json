{"text":"The food was actually delicious! I had the calamari and the gyro platter with rice and everything came out hot and oh so good. It was cheap and good. The service was very nice as well. Check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was a Quincey's steakhouse in a past life. Now it has a lovely Greek decor. The menu is on point, desserts look terrific in display case, has a private dining room that would make for a nice rehearsal dinner option for a medium size wedding party & a nice bar. Every visit has shown to have consistently good food, some dishes were great. However, if you have an interest in real Greek wines, you need to ask for the wine list. The only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is that while good natured, the wait staff can be a bit slow & forgetful. My husband asked for Parmesan cheese for his Grecian pasta & he ended up leaving the table to ask for it after our server passed by several times. Otherwise-Oopa!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner I had the pastitsio greek lasagna. hubby had the seafood pasta dish with shrimp and calamari in spicy marina sauce. came with salad and bread. everything was delish. nice and hot. nice variety on menu Greek, pizza, chicken, and sandwiches. will be back again !"}
{"text":"Acropolis has its own crowd.  It is a crowd that looks for generous portions, abundant choices, familiar foods, and low prices.  Acropolis seems to provide all of those, and it draws large loyal crowds.  Some items are much better than others.  The Greek fare seems much better than most of the diner fare, but the Greek fare is quite good.  The service is prompt, efficient, and friendly.  The bar produces excellent drinks at great prices.  Fine dining it is not.  It also does not have the quality of Greek food one can find in bigger cities.  But if you are looking for generous portions, abundant choices, familiar foods, and low prices, Acropolis does those well."}
{"text":"Really varied menu with something for everyone.  Soups, hummus, rice pudding, Greek potatoes, rice pilaf, breakfasts (can order 1 pancake if that's all you want!) and Greek salad terrific.  Very reasonable prices, nice portion sizes, really convenient location, and accommodates groups easily.  Traditional Greek food as well as American, Italian, etc.  Big enough that it is rarely noisy.  Female servers particularly good.  Can accommodate almost all food plans and palates and we've taken people there from out of town.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you're in search of excellent Greek cuisine, look no further. We were seated and served almost immediately after walking in. Service was very warm and friendly and the food was even better! The Spinach Pie was to die for and we finished with a French Silk pie. I have no complaints regarding my food or the service. I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Driving up from Georgia and decided to stop by and try it. Ordered pork souvlaki, falafel, and gyro. Pretty darn delicious. Nice spot and servers. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"We tried Acropolis for the first time this week.  The menu is huge, so there is a little bit of everything.  I had the greek spinach pie with the Greek salad.  Both were great and full of flavor.  My wife originally ordered the burger, but was told that they only cook them well-done.  The waitress claimed that this is a NC law, but we have not heard that anywhere else since moving here in August.  Anyway, she changed her order to the grilled chicken sandwich with green beans.  This was a great choice.  Both had really good flavor.  The decor is definitely old school, which I love.  There is a full bar and they seem to be capable of handling groups of any size.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Nice casual ambiance, and extensive menu with both authentic Greek and Americanized foods, including half a page of vegetarian options, all at reasonable prices and in huge portions."}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast I have found in the cornelius / denver area. Very good food. Reasonable prices. Nice associates. Big restaurant so you don't have to wait for a table on a weekend breakfast trip.  Healthy choices"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good omelette, or really any breakfast item, you are at the right place. Service is sometimes less than par but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Love Greek food and always had. But for some reason this place just doesn't do it for me.  Service is slow and the food is so so."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is very good. Great wait staff. I love the cookies you can buy at checkout."}
{"text":"Nice surprise!  My husband and I were staying in town for a few days.  We come from a diverse state where there is lots of ethnic food to be had.  We've moved and we miss Greek.  Had a taste for GRYOS.  YUM!  Acropolis is bright, clean and comfortable.  The service is super (Teresa and Marbin).  The food was so good, had to come back three days later to try other items on the menu.  Oh, and did I mention the desserts-OMG!  We'll be back when we're in town again."}
{"text":"I have downgraded my review after my most recent visit, which was for breakfast.  After ordering my omelet \"soft\" it came out very....... very ......very...brown.  Brown eggs stink and are dry, that is why I don't eat them.  I was given a discount, but I came in for breakfast, and I don't mind paying full price for my meal, but I could not eat it.  I guess I will have to stick to lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink and burger at the bar. Theresa works at the bar on Friday night and and is a pleasure. Breakfasts are very reasonably priced and decent. Can't say it's my favorite place to have an omelette because they're a bit dry, but you get a good portion for the money."}
{"text":"Eat here at least a couple times whenever I'm in town.  Great pizza, salads, best lamb chops I've ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food! The hummus is the best anywhere. Not fancy, just a nice comfortable atmosphere and great staff!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I went in to have dinner and do some work on my laptop. I was not even finished eating my dinner when I was asked to move to the bar because someone else needed to be seated. I was completely offended.   Add to that the food is mediocre and the place is dirty."}
{"text":"This was our second visit for lunch to this restaurant. I had the large Greek salad with a 4 ounce blackened salmon added. My wife had a Falafel. The meals were fine with the exception of one flaw. I didn't realize until I was about a quarter through the salad that they forgot to put the vinaigrette dressing on the salad, but other than that we enjoyed both meals. I'm not much of a connoisseur being I didn't miss the absence of the dressing so I probably shouldn't even bring it up and I don't think it would happen again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch. The village salad was delicious! Very flavorful and the small size was definitely large enough for lunch.  My daughter got a greek salad with grilled chicken and she couldn't come close to eating it all. It was huge. Service was average."}
{"text":"If I did not say this before...the chicken and rice soup will cure anything! It's delicious but it will also cure a common cold. Love it! The rest of the menu not so bad either!"}
{"text":"Good portions and good value. We had simple breakfast food. Eggs, potatoes and french toast were yummy. We will be back."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service! Sad to see this place close to make way for another gas station.  Hope the owners are able to find a new location!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. The menu is big and diverse. The prices are great for food AND drinks.  The buffalo hot wings were surprisingly amazing. Some of the best I've had, and I've had a lot. It's my guilty pleasure. The village salad with added salmon is a nice light choice. You won't get better beer/wine prices. My new go to neighborhood restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is pretty average here but the service was super friendly. I ordered a falafel plate and it was decent though a tad bland and kind of soggy.  It was a decent value though there wasn't anything particularly spectacular about this place. I've only been once so I'd be up for trying other items on their menu but their falafel was lackluster."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cute little place that I stopped at for Breakfast while in the area for the TFW Summit.  The breakfast was really good and amazingly priced.  Spent about $6 for the Country Breakfast and got Free coffee with it which was much needed after spending all night on the red eye flight.  The service was pretty good but totally old school diner feel.  If I'm back in the area would go there again definitely for breakfast.  Was an easy walk from the Hampton Inn was staying at and had a good amount of TVs as well which was cool."}
{"text":"Food is great. Menu has a mix of Greek middle Eastern and fajitas. Ambiance is OK. I tried beef kabob plate with rice. Great Mediterranean flavor and well cooked pieces of steak. Chicken salvoki is really good too."}
{"text":"If I could give NO stars, I would.  Absolutely the WORST experience I have ever encountered at a restaurant.  The hostess was beyond rude, she was downright disrespectful and cruel.  I watched her mimic me after we were seated to a group of other waitresses and hostess.  I watcher her as she made facial expressions and body movements as to copy my reaction to 1. A private conversation I had with my husband as we walked in and had to walk our three children right through a cloud of smoke as the \"smoking section\" is literally at the door to enter this establishment.  If people chose to smoke, that is their business but I should not have to walk my three young children through a cloud of second hand smoke and if I do and then have a conversation with my husband, I should not have to watch someone mock and mimic my reaction.  2.  As we were standing there to be seated, another customer entered the establishment and was greeted and sat before us.  When another waiter approached us and asked \"why we were still standing & hadn't been helped\" my responses was \"your hostess just sat someone who came in after us\" again, a conversation between myself and the waiter but as I sat at our table and watched the hostess stand at the main station at the front door and talk out loud and mimic me, I was shocked.  On our way out, the owner/manager did approach us and apologize and seemed sincere but to just \"send this hostess home\" is not a solution.  In my opinion, she needs to be let go.  That type of behavior is hateful and should have no place in an environment where you are trying to build a loyal customer base.  We will never step foot in this restaurant again and I will be sure to share this story with all of our friends.  When there are other posts about rude hostesses, there are clearly issues.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"good service , nice ambiance...terrible pancakes"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, great food, and good service. I live a bit far from this restaurant,  or I'd dine here more."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place but felt so blah after eating their food... We had tried their gyro plate and falafel plate. The gyro meat along with the tzatziki sauce was not good at all and the falafel was plain and soggy. I've only been here once, so maybe there's hope to try it again when I'm really craving greek food. I may not be an expert in greek food but I'm from Chicago and have had better gyros and falafels from restaurants that were much smaller family owned businesses..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. My boyfriend stumbled upon it one day and is a huge fan of Greek food so we decided to try it out tonight for Dinner and everything was so delicious and filling. Our server was on point with drinks, refills, and bringing out our food promptly. The chicken lemon rice soup was absolutely wonderful. And they have so many choices for dessert as well. Their menu is very expansive with Greek food, to pasta, sandwiches, salads, dinner plates and everything in between. There is something here for everyone. Definitely a must stop if you're in the area and we will be coming back regularly for sure."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a gyro, you can't go wrong with this place! We ordered take out from here I got the gyro with a greek salad as a side. It was simply delish! The gyro meat was so good, and the pita was very soft, and the tzatziki sauce complimented it all nicely. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We love noshing at this traditional Greek restaurant located in the bustling little lake town of Cornelius whenever we have the opportunity. Although its interior is somewhat dated (okay, a lot dated), the food is always excellent and plentiful. As is the case with most Greek restaurants, the menu is huge and everything we've tried over the last 10 years had proven to be very flavorful and satisfying. Supersized portions also easily provide lunch the following day, which is always a huge plus in my book.   My favorite dish is simply the chicken parm served with perfectly cooked spaghetti. Their marinara sauce is vividly delicious - thick, chunky, slightly sweet and cooked to the perfect consistency. My wife's favorite is the Chicken Athenos which is grilled chicken, with spinach, feta cheese and diced tomatoes in a light white garlicy sauce over rice pilaf (so savory, that my mouth waters just writing about it.) They also serve as an occasional special, Seafood Diablo. When available, get it! It is shrimp, scallops, fish and squid in a spicy light red sauce. Fabulous!  Most entrees are served with perfectly constructed \"side\" salads (which are really too big to be your run-of-the-mill side salad) accompanied by their made in house dressings. Bread is also included but is nothing special; the iced tea however is. Served in 32 ounce glasses with good sized lemon wedges, it is indeed southern which means it is sweet (or is as sweet as you want it) and makes the typical restaurant price of $1.95 for teas almost justifiable, especially if you leave with a cup to go without ice (and trust me... I always do!)  I know too well that the desserts strategically calling to you behind the glass displays as you walk in is an old Greek trick to entice you to indulge, yet I happily fall for it everyone (and I dare you not to.) Usually included are several cheese cakes, coconut cake, tiramisu, chocolate cake, canoles and eclairs. All are made in house and are reasonably priced (another Greek trick that makes avoiding them impossible.) Just as challenging are the clear boxes of confectionary sugar  topped wedding cookies that beckon in the windowed display at the checkout counter. Yep, you may have guessed it... we bring home a couple of those too.  Service has always been good to excellent for us and we have never experienced any of the occasional surliness that I have read about in a handful of other reviews. Sanitary rating is always in mid-90's like we require.  TIP: Not that you need any additional incentive or enticement, but they also happily accept Go-Play-Save Bogo Free coupons as of this writing.  In summary, we love this place but, thankfully, we don't live closer as it is definitely a diet and cholesterol buster."}
{"text":"Good Lamb Chops, Breakfast is a bit Heavy  Not to keen on their breakfast offerings.  We normally go on Sunday after Church and the breakfast menu is a bit on the heavy side.  Dinner however is a different matter. Love the Spartan Lamb Chops and my wife has been known ot pickup an order to go for me when her Church Group meets here.  Great Salads other Greek delicacies as well.  Service is always good and atmosphere is more of a diner and nothing really jumps out as striking or memorable."}
{"text":"What a menu! I have never seen this many items on a menu in my life. It's like sitting down at a table and reading a book. Italian, Greek, American...it's all here.  My favorite items so far have been the Chicken Parmesan sub and the Greek lasagna. I wish I could say I have tried more things, but I just can't get past these two dishes. They are excellent, and the healthy portions will have you asking for a take-home box.  There is also a dessert cooler near the front lobby with all manner of cheesecakes, marble cakes and other scrumptious goodies staring you in the face.  Unfortunately, I have always been too full to partake of these delectable confections, but one day...  If you like rich Italian and Greek food, this is a great place to go for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best things about this place is that there is rarely a wait. There's a bit of everything here, and I am sold on their breakfast. I recommend going simple and pick up one of their specials: zeus, hera, etc. I really liked their scrambled eggs and home fries.  Prices are very fair for what you're going, but stick to breakfast. Quick, easy, and cheap.     Coffee is virtually bottomless. They're constantly walking by to refill your cup.    Parking is easy."}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome service. I could tell that the Baklava was homemade. If you love Greek food, you don't want to pass on this restaurant. #Acropolis #CorneliusNC #Charlotte"}
{"text":"I've only been here during breakfast. My grandparents seem to enjoy it so that's our spot every few months. The service is always great. Food does seem to take a while to get to the table- busy or not. It is worth the wait, so it's fine. Sometimes it's extremely cold and we've mentioned it to the server, which she replies that they have turned the heat up, but it doesn't really feel any different."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what or why but I ordered the Gyro with a side salad (in separate bowl) but the main plate my gyro was covered and by covered I mean covered in a oil like substance. I've never had so much oil or even close for that matter in a gyro. I'm perplexed why it was even on my plate which saturated my pita making the gyro very hard to eat. On the plus side the side salad was delicious!   The establishment could use some updating especially in the decor department - feels very diner-ish. A modern touch would really help!"}
{"text":"I was in from LA for the day. I saw a sign that read \"Acropolis\", so I got off the highway exit and thought i was going to some mediocre strip mall gyro shop. Boy was I wrong. Nice people, nice expansive menu with mostly Greek and other specialties. Great breakfast pizza, greek soup, grilled chicken greek salad, chicken salad, and really good gryos. The dressing was really good for the salad as was their freshly made tatziki yogurt sauce. If you are in the area, it is worth the stop"}
{"text":"So my brother and my future sister in law go in for breakfast. First off it took 5 minutes for the server to come over and even greet us. Then I ask for a bloody mary. He obviously didn't know how to make one. Then leaves the bar area with my glass which was sketch as crap. Overall it was an horrible experience and I'd recommend they get a better server staff that actually makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Eclectic mix of Greek, Italian, and American specialties. The spot of a joyous evening celebrating the hub's grandparent's 60th anniversary. 60 is a real accomplishment and can you believe they still act like newlyweds? ;-D  Cost to worth it ratio: 3.5 (many main items under $10 and portions are generous)  Highlights: - Variety: something for everyone from Greek classics like lamb and soulvalki to Italian pasta and pizza items, to steak, seafood, and sandwiches. - Portions: many items could make it through 2 whole meals.  - Moussaka: like a Greek shepherds pie with ground meat on the bottom and mashed potatoes up top. Meat was seasoned nicely with the traditional savory yet added cinnamon spice but the silky potatoes mixed with bechamel sauce were divine. Eggplant slices were embedded as a layer and marinara sauce circled the plate. - Eggplant dip: I'm not even trying to spell the name of it, but think it starts with an m. Large boat dish filled with processed eggplant slightly chilled and mixed with dill. Very refreshing and on top of warm pita triangles, a perfect start to a meal. Only suggestion here is that they bring the out with more pita pieces, as the default amount only could assist you in consuming a fourth of the dip even if you were a liberal topper.   - Good for groups: they have several rooms to accommodate large groups and were very helpful and friendly with our boisterous crowd of 50. - Dessert carousel: fun to gawk over the various items and plan for later. Continuing on the Italian Greek theme, tiramisu is in that mix and they also have a tray if baklava to the side if it. - Wine: house options aren't bad and you can get them by the glass or carafe.   Lowlights (my flip side to highlights): - Prime rib: just ok--a bit dry. - Side room size: a nice spot, but a bit cramped for 50 if you want to mingle.  The family will probably be back for a dinner or another group celebration."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Just came here for dinner and the hostess that sat us was very rude. We all were having a great night until we came here. Walked in and wasn't even greeted. She just stood there until I went up to her and asked her to be seated. She then rolled her eyes and grabbed the menus. Without saying a word she walked off so we followed. She took us to our table. We all sat down and she threw the menus and the silverware on the table and walked off. We was not going to tolerate that so we simply got up and walked out. I understand everyone has a bad day once in awhile but that no way to treat your customers. I'm a waitress myself so I understand that some days aren't so great, but I wouldn't treat any of my customers that way. Just hoping we caught you guys on a bad night."}
{"text":"Stopped in real quick, first time visit.  Ordered the appetizer platter & fried calamari...the best!  Ate food I never eat.  Coming back to dinner with rest of family very soon.  The waitress, Jennifer, knows her menu & how the food is prepared!  Must ask for her."}
{"text":"Acropolis has a little bit of everything.  The menu itself is enough to scare you into making a hasty dinner choice, but the serving sizes are big, and the quality is good.   I went for some of their Greek lamb specials and it was decent.  I could tell the meal was made earlier in the day, but with something like a lamb or roast, that's to be expected.  The boss had their chicken and spoke highly of it, though I was busy trying to take down my own plate.  The little yelper had their spaghetti (one of his faves!) and when he was done with that, helped mommy and daddy finish their plates!  I'm sure if he could review them, it would be five stars (though he likes ANY food, like Mikey)! We went to the Acropolis with friends late one evening, so we stayed for dessert.  OMG!  They have some really, REALLY good desserts; homemade cakes and other sweets.  They also serve S&D coffee; a local roaster (and my personal favorite, second only to D&D). The service was a bit of an issue.  It wasn't too crowded, but I had a problem trying to get my drinks refilled and the inevitable new fork/spoon issue that comes with a 2-year old.  The lack of any sort of personality or helpfulness really brings this to 3 stars.  If they could fix that, it'd be just right! Good food, good prices, good portions, not-so-good service.  We'll try it again, as I hear they serve a good breakfast! Noosh!"}
{"text":"Had the eggs Benedict, eggs were over cooked, way way way to much H. Sauce.. Ok taste overall. Seasoned potatoes were ok. They need to rethink the dish.."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a couple times and it's a real unique experience. It has a family feel and our waiter who we've had on each visit was a really fun guy who made the experience even better which is a rarity these days. The flaming cheese appetizer (saganaki) is a crowd pleaser for kids and big kids like me!"}
{"text":"One of my parents favorite restaurants. They are frequenters that go at least every other week or so. I, however, have only been once. I had a really great experience though!   The menu had a little of everything. Even though it's a great restaurant, they had a few Italian dishes, which is great if you're bringing picky kids.   I tried the Pastitsio, which I've had at other places a few times before. It was the first time I've ever seen it with the noodles mixed in like that before, but I really enjoyed it. The portion size was great, especially for the price.   Pro tip: Get the reward card! You can get BOGO deals!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for lunch and dinner; both have been very enjoyable, compared to other CLT Greek restaurants.  Portions are generous - plenty for leftovers.  Service was very good both times.  All the desserts (on display) look ridiculously good; we shared the Baklava cheesecake - excellent and not too rich."}
{"text":"Stopped here randomly while staying at local hotel. Really nice server who happily seated me near a plug for my dead phone.  Had chicken souvlaki in pita with Greek salad."}
{"text":"Traveling through town, stopped for quick bite.  Gyro was almost more than I can eat, and very tasty.  Good service.  Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, huge portions and reasonable prices. Ask for Helen - she is the best waitress!!"}
{"text":"Well all i can say is their Gyros are sub par and their rice pilaf is bland and bleh.  The gyro is Kronos brand, didnt mean anything to me until today, but future places i will ask.  The meat did not look fresh cut... rounded edges.  I dont see what people like about this place.  Have they never left town and visited a good greek place?  Find another is my advice.  Granted all i tried was the gyro but it was bad enough to not return.  My wife said the tziki sauce was also deploreable.  Advice... go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday for Mother's Day.  We were seated right away and our server, Marvin, was very good.  I had the chicken souvlaki and my wife had the rib eye. Mother-in-law had the pork chops and kids had gyros. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Portions were big.  Furnishings  could use a little upgrade.  We will there again when in the area."}
{"text":"Decor is waaaay outdated, but the food is very good!  Lamb chops are great"}
{"text":"One night a week we were coming here because an evening appointment let's us out after most other area restaurants are closed.  The food is average but I know what to order that works for me.  Thursday night I ordered takeout instead.  The bill came to $24.00.  They know we're regulars.  I asked if they included some tzatziki (yogurt sauce) and the cashier said she'd have to charge me if I wanted to add it.  I said, \"Really?  Even though I ordered gyro (meat as an add on to a salad)?\"  She said, \"Yes.\" That's it.  They've a lost us as customers. So short sighted."}
{"text":"For a Greek Restaurant in central NC, the Acropolis is as good as any that you can find.  As other reviews have indicated, they aren't just a Greek restaurant, they have dishes from across the Mediterranean, as well as some ubiquitous american standards.  We took my brother here recently for a celebratory lunch, as he has studied Greek and done some academic work in the Greek Islands, so wanted to share with him an experience of that food (and see how much he actually learned).  We were visiting during the Sunday lunch hour, so the place was pretty busy, but we had a reservation and were promptly seated.  After deciding on our food and placing our orders, the service, which had been prompt up until that point, went down hill a bit.  We had ordered several appetizers, and saw our server make two circles around the dining room with our appetizers before we were able to flag him down and politely ask if he was looking for our table.  We also had some mis-communication over who should receive what salads with their dish, and then who ordered what, so there was a bit of a delay in getting our food.  The food quality itself however was quite good, probably four star worthy; most of us had the Gyros or Pitas, and the meat was tender and flavorful, and the sauces not too salty.  Overall a pretty good choice for Mediterranean food; it's a place that I'd visit again, just perhaps not on a busy weekend."}
{"text":"Great restaurant,  was immediately seated, had an excellent meal.  I had the Reuben with the soup of the day, french onion.   The sandwich was warm and melty, the soup was savoury and had a lot of melted cheese on the top.  The price was only $6.75!  Very satisfied and I intend to come back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly service. The food is not really Greek, though. It is American with some Greek items. For example, we had potato skins for an app., chicken sub and a tuna melt."}
{"text":"I had the gyro, not much meat, pita not grilled or toasted. Nothing special. Good service. Nice diner style surroundings"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and I really enjoyed it. I have an early lunch (around 11) so there weren't many people there besides me and a few older folks...this could be the reason for my prompt service...it started to pick up a lot on my way out.  My server was Maryana and she was super sweet and attentive. I got the blackened chicken salad with the reccomended sweet n sour bacon dressing and an order of the hummus/pita bread...everything was really tasty! Chicken was moist and flavorful, dressing paired perfectly with it, pita bread was warm and the hummus was really good too. There were a lot of traditional Greek options that I don't find at very many places, like the stuffed grape leaves. They had some good priced lunch specials, but I had a taste for salad so I went with it for $7. I had to knock off one star because when I got there, instead of asking how many in my party or if I would be ordering out, I received \"is there something I can do for you today?\" Then there was an awkward pause before I said I was dining in and she seemed surprised...kinda took away the welcome appeal...then when I was leaving, the guy at the register seemed like he had just gotten dumped...they should probably get some friendlier people at the front, but other than that, good food and great table service."}
{"text":"We are always up for trying new places, so we decided to try this place last night.  After reading some of the reviews I was worried about running into the hostess from hell thats been described. Luckily we had a very nice hostess.  The waitress, while pleasant, was less than attentive. Not horrible but not good.  The food was blah. The calamari was rubbery and had little taste.  The lemon chicken soup had a lot of lemon but no spices. Very bland.  The mousaka of was bland. Couldn't taste the eggplant.   Overall not bad food, just not good food."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting. I went specifically because I had a coupon for BOGO entree. I was placing a to-go order . The hostess was friendly. I like that they have a dedicated gluten free menu although there was at least one error. The rice was labeled gluten free but I was later told it was not.   Our order came out within the 15min time frame we were told. My son ordered the broiled cod with fresh fruit and Greek potatoes. I ordered the baked ziti which came with salad and bread.   The fresh fruit was probably the best part of the meal. While all of the portion sizes were generous the food lacked seasoning.  It wasn't horrible...just meh. Based on this experience I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Great little place! Our food was excellent, and our server was a delight! Plenty of food served, and desserts were amazing with delicious coffee! Can't wait to stop back again  :)"}
{"text":"Acropolis is a Diner.. and it's a good one!  You probably don't ever want to order something super fancy, or come here on a date night, but it is always a sure thing for a good drink and a yummy meal!  They have great sandwiches, pizzas, pastas...etc!  Everything I have had here is good, I just wouldn't say it's anything too over the top either!  Also, my husband and I often order take out here and it seems to taste just as delicious from home! ( some take out just cannot be done but here it can!)"}
{"text":"Huge menu with anything one could wish for. House special chicken & rice soup is excellent. Greek salad was excellent and large with added gyro meat and grilled chicken which both were moist & flavorful. Not the best vinaigrette dressing I've ever had at a good Greek restaurant but still recommended. Full bar, good selection of draft beer and wines. Prompt service, big portions,tasty very reasonably priced menu. I want to tried the family recipe \"baked spaghetti pie\" next time...."}
{"text":"Good Greek food. Friendly service. Affordable. Laidback atmosphere."}
{"text":"Greek food is specialty, of course...but the Greek salad is outstanding! I had tilapia dish, cooked well. Reasonably priced...I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had simple Breakfast - eggs, bacon, home fries, toast.  Eggs & home fries were tasteless.  Service from Pat was below par - left me without coffee for 15 minutes.  Bacon was paper thin."}
{"text":"Thank you Acropolis for helping make my daughter's graduation party a success. We rented the lovely room up front, with the fireplace, and there were about 20 guests. The food was delicious, the waiter was wonderful, and everyone had a great time. Also, Joanne, the manager, helped me figure out my tech issue for the presentation I was presenting for my daughter. Thumbs up for this wonderful restaurant. I have been coming here for years and have never, not even one time been disappointed. I made the right decision selecting Acropolis for this special event! Thanks again :)"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here last Sunday...had an excellent experience!! Service was great, food was hot and tasty and the prices were awesome...can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"They have one of the best dolmatas I've ever had cause they are stuffed with meat and rice. However this place has very poor customer service. I'd never dined in, only take out and the person that takes the phone order NEVER gets the order right. And when confronted with mistakes, they lack sympathy and care. They are unimpressive and lack customer service. It's a shame cause the food is actually excellent. Management needs to look into hiring better staffs or train them better to protect their brand."}
{"text":"Was a wonderful Diner. Loved the food, the staff. Sorry to see it closed but glad I got in on the last day. Another gas station is just want we need. lol. Good luck to the owners and thanks for the memories"}
{"text":"Reminds me of most of the old time eastern Greek diners. Soup was great, most of the entrées were good but one had too much salt. The waitstaff was outstanding and immediately replaced it. Best feature however is the cake selection. Definitely not to be missed is the cannoli cake."}
{"text":"Tucked on the side of I-77 (exit 28), I think this place has been around forever... it's a Greek restaurant, which means besides Greek dishes there are the typical Italian menu, and the burgers and sandwiches.    I won't say the menu is huge, comparing to other Greek owned places in and around Charlotte.  Prices are ok ($12-15 for entree).  But you are talking about me, who is all about budget dining, so that is a little high for a local causal place...   Now the highlight: Gyro & Greek Potato Salad!  Gyro in Pita (you can get it served over rice, but why???) is plentiful... lots of meat, warm and soft.  The potato salad is lightly seasoned in olive oil, lemon juice, dill... and the whole thing is $5.50!  This is where my 4-stars come from.  I cannot say for sure if everything else is good, but gyro & tater salad was 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"We were sitting at home and in need of a last-minute to-go dinner. I realized that the little Greek place down the road from us did take out and we decided to give it a try.   I called the order in and the employee was knowledgeable about the menu. I was told it would take about ten-fifteen minutes to be ready. I arrived and the cashier was friendly and brought my order out. I was able to take a quick glance at the interior and it seemed clean and spacious...definitely didn't remind me of the Greek diners I knew from back in New York.  The food was still hot by the time I got home. I ordered the Greek Pork Chops, but decided on the single 8oz chop for $8.95. Let me tell ya, that was plenty...there is no way I would have been able to eat two of those chops plus all the fixins. The pork chop came with three huge Greek potato slices (pretty much cooked with lemon), a mixture of mixed veggies (a little overcooked and mushy for my taste), a decent sized side salad and a slice of bread. The pork was cooked well...not too dry or tough. The salad was composed of romaine, onion and tomato with the house dressing on the side. All in all, $8.95 for all that food is a steal, as it was decent and kept my belly full.  The missus went with the Spinach Pie ($8.95) which was also really good. She got a huge portion of the pie which was filo dough, spinach and cheese-layered. Even I liked it, and I'm usually not a fan of spinach. Hers also came with a salad, but it was bigger than mine was and came with feta cheese, olives, tomato, onion and iceberg lettuce. I was a bit confused as to the differences in our two salads, but she was happy, and that's what matters.  It's a simple Greek place putting out solid meals. I haven't had any Greek down here otherwise so I can't really compare, but it was pretty decent compared to New York Greek I've had. Acropolis isn't mind-blowing but it does a good job, and the price is right. Wouldn't exactly go here for date night or take out of towners here, but when we need a quick bite close to home this will be one of the front runners."}
{"text":"A nice small place by the exit 26. Tried it after reading the Yelp reviews and glad to say that I did. Had the salmon fillet, it was fresh and juicy. Highly recommend the baklava, a pure delight and a must have. Will surely go back again"}
{"text":"Acropolis is a great Greek place. We've been coming here for years now and we will return often. They've recently expanded their menu, and it does not disappoint!   Our favorite starters include the avgolemono, which is a lemony chicken and rice soup. The dolmathes, which are grape leaves stuffed with ground lamb and seasoned rice, have just the right amount of tanginess. The saganaki- Greek cheese served with flaming brandy at the tableside, is as impressive to behold as it is to taste.   Moving on to the entrees. The chicken Dyonaises is lovely, with lemon and tomato over pasta. The gyros are served piping hot with the usual accompaniments, one of which is a delightfully creamy tzatziki. The leg of lamb is always tender and delicious, and the side vegetable is not an afterthought; the fresh, garlicky green beans stand on their own.   Tonight, I tried an entree from the new menu. It was a grilled salmon filet served on a bed of sauteed spinach, laid over three thick slices of garlic crostini and smothered in a creamy dill sauce. Now mind you, I am extremely picky about my salmon, and almost didn't order it because I wanted to keep liking this place. Well, I'm glad I risked it; it was delicious! Perfectly cooked, flaky salmon, crisp and garlicky crostini, and the spinach was tender but not overdone.  And I saved my favorite dish for last. The pastitsio is out of this world. It's kind of a Greek lasagna, with pasta and ground beef served on a bed of marinara, topped with a bechamel sauce that is almost custard-like, it is so rich and creamy. Not for those that eat lightly; it will leave you totally stuffed, and with leftovers for lunch the next day!  Jimmy, the owner, is incredibly nice and always comes out to the table to greet us in person, even though we only live here in the fall.  I take off one star only for a few minor reasons. A few of the \"freebies\" seem perfunctory; the bread that is brought to the table is a little bland and uninspired, and the house salad is typically American, with iceberg lettuce, big mealy tomato slices, and a puzzling addition of shoestring potatoes. The service is usually quite good, but on occasion I've gotten a server who was inexperienced or distracted. But overall, I have very few complaints.   I see that many folks have given negative reviews based on the pizza...um, why on earth would you order pizza in a Greek restaurant, anyway? My advice: Jimmy knows his Greek food. Stick to the authentic choices, and you'll love this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"I see another reviewer had a similar experience and also walked out. The dysfunction greets you as you see the front door propped open by a giant ashtray/trashcan and walk through a smoke cloud to enter. The \"hostess\" was devoid of any hospitality, overtly surly and argumentative. As hungry as we were, we walked out and spent our money at Mac's.  The owner did at least see our obvious distress, followed us out, offered to buy us dinner if we came back inside, said he'd \"send her home\" but I will never set foot in this place again. Start with demoting that hostess to dishwasher (where I started in the business) until she figures out the difference between hostile and hospitality. Get rid of the smokers station in the entry and be happy to see someone when they walk in. It's that easy. Nice enough guy, but he's letting the inmates run the asylum."}
