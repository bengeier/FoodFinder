{"text":"The sis and I needed something fast, and we were stoked to try a new restaurant on State Street. The atmosphere is casual, upbeat modern. I liked the simplicity of the menu: you choose your protein, which ranges from pork and chicken (breast or thigh) to salmon and tofu. You can also opt for veggies. I was happy to see that I could order chicken thighs: not only are they cheaper than breast meat ($8.25 for the meal), but they pack a lot more flavor, IMO. You order white or brown rice and the dressing for your salad (you also have the option to order extra rice and no salad, or extra salad and no rice).

The service is very friendly and reasonably fast. We picked up our bowls from the counter feeling very optimistic about the meal: the presentation was lovely, and--to me, at least--it seemed like a lot of food. I loved the sesame dressing on the salad. BUT. The teriyaki sauce was just...BAD. And nothing will suck the wind out of your sails in a bigger hurry than yucky sauce. I ate all of the salad and about half of the meat and rice, then tossed the rest into the dustbin. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time, I was quite impressed.  Chicken breast teriyaki was very good, nice serving size for lunch and a small salad to go with it. The teriyaki sauce was so tasty!"}
{"text":"I went to Glaze with a few friends during a business trip to Madison, WI, and the food can be simply summarized as mediocre. I ordered a tofu bowl with the carrot ginger dressing for my side salad. The presentation was nice, but I personally thought the terriyaki sauce was way too sweet and the tofu could have been prepared better. The ratio of food was also a bit skewed; I ended up having about 2/3 of the dish being brown rice. 

The staff was friendly and the decor inside was modern, but the food definitely was not special. Glaze is an inexpensive restaurant, so be prepared to get what you pay for, but I'd say skip it since there are so many other restaurants to pick from on State Street."}
{"text":"Their teriyaki sauce tastes like spicy ketchup, and I don't think they have an air conditioner...  Their bench seating is uncomfortable too.  It has these tiny little cushions that cover only like half the bench."}
{"text":"My vegetarian friend and I were looking for a place to eat. No grilled cheese today! We stopped in on a Monday evening. I had the tofu teriyaki with salad.  I chose the spicy option and ginger carrot dressing.  I also got gyoza. 

The teriyaki tofu was okay but the spicy option of sauce (which came on the side for mine but mixed into my friend's dish) was too sweet. The salad dressing was good.  The best part of the meal was the gyoza.  It was crispy and filled with pork.  The dipping sauce was perfectly salty. I got a berry lemonade soda which tasted just like a 7/11 slushie."}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I ordered food from this restaurant. I got the Salmon salad. They were out of Salmon. So, I had to get tofu. The salad was very, very small. If you can count the lettuce; that's a problem. I paid $14.00 for the salad (including tip and delivery fee). Ridiculous. I thought they made a mistake and gave me a side salad. It literally took me 30 seconds to eat it. I'm still starving. I now have to order food from another restaurant. My friend said that he did not like his food either. He said the dumplings were deep friend. The teriyaki sauce did not taste good at all; per my friend. We will not be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I didn't really know what to expect with Glaze Teriyaki, but was surprised when we walked in to find out that it was a more of a fast, casual restaurant where you order at the counter and seat yourself. It seemed to be very popular for take out, as many people came and went in the time that we were there.

Despite the fast food-like feel of the place, the food was pretty good! I ordered the salmon with brown rice. My only complaint is that the teriyaki sauce seemed a bit salty for my taste, but the salmon was delicious and cooked perfectly. 

The best part of Glaze, in my opinion? They have a Jones Soda machine, with a variety of Jones Soda flavors. This is the first time I have ever seen one of these and was pretty stoked!

Overall we had a good experience, and will probably return if we happen to be on State street again soon. I could see it being an incredibly popular take out restaurant for those living nearby."}
{"text":"The glaze that they used was way too salty. I don't their price was worth what i got. Also they didn't have regular water in their machine, they only had sparkling water....like why??!!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Madtown midday this past Friday. We got a recommendation to try Glaze from a friend who lives here. When we asked for directions from the hotel desk people they reiterated the recommendation! A good sign. We both ordered \"chicken thigh, brown rice, spicy\", but they have a several options for protein & rice. It was just the right amount of food for us. The spicy option IS spicy, so be careful before you order the extra-spicy options. We liked this place so much that we went back today. We ordered exactly the same thing as the first time, but today one of us added \"Option B\" to get the wok-steamed vegetables. Yumm! The included side salads were even better today. Try it out."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Particularly enjoyed the wok vegetables. Front door sticks pretty badly. We saw three different groups of people try to get in and ultimately give up because they couldn't get the door open. Also saw two students have a lot of difficulty trying to leave! Suggestion to the owners: fix your door and you'll get more customers :) Suggestions to potential customers: pull HARD!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and had good experiences until tonight. My girlfriend (a vegetarian for almost ten years who has gotten sick the last time she ate meat) discovered small strips of beef in her Tofu Plate as she was halfway through eating it. I offered to the cashier that other restaurants have replaced a spoiled meal in the past with no charge - all we received was a grin and a superficial \"sorry\". If I decide to eat there again in the future, I plan on speaking to the manager. Cross-contamination is an issue for some people, and I expected that you'd be more receptive than that."}
{"text":"The teriyaki at Glaze is solid.  Not the best teriyaki I've ever had, but far from the worst.  I had chicken thighs in spicy sauce with Gyoza, a fairly classic meal.  The chicken was good, the sauce not overly spicy.  The gyoza was ok, but they served it with just soy sauce.  Don't have much to say about the decor, it was alright.  Very friendly staff.  Look, bottom line...Glaze is a superior midwestern teriyaki venue, however they need to step up their sauce to take it to the next level.  3.85/5"}
{"text":"Food was fine - nothing special, but you could tell the ingredients are quality. I like the interior and modern feel.

I think this place is trying too hard - I'd rather they notch up the menu to something more unique or substantial then just rice + chicken + teriyaki sauce for $10. I can make this same thing in 20 minutes at home for half the price. Bored."}
{"text":"Smell that? The nice smell of the teriyaki is on state street. The beef teriyaki tastes really great and authentic. It's a real healthy meal, you can double your meat or actually switch them with veggies too. Always a great choice if you want a healthy meal without breaking the bank on state street.Side of dumplings also tasty and crispy. 

It's always pretty pleasant to sit in this really modern and chic designed place. It's a self serve joint and so it makes person dine alone also feel welcome and comfortable. 

However there's so many fruit flies in this location that is just really bothering your whole eating experience constantly. A bit of a shame really ...."}
{"text":"Overall, I had a positive experience with this place. I ordered a Tofu-Salmon combo, and the salmon was really good, and the tofu was pretty dope too.

Even though I had a nice experience here, I don't think it was nice enough to justify the price. Additionally, the severely crushed the rice. If there is one thing I know about rice, its that you never tightly compact it - EVER. I watched the people working there really pack it in, almost as if they were trying to do you a favor by getting those extra kernels in there. If you - the people who work at Glaze read this - please do everyone a favor and don't crush the rice. I ended up throwing away a container that was covered in crushed and squished rice pieces that would have taken a half-hour to remove and eat one by one, and that's just plain sad.

Just to note, my 1/2 tofu slab, small piece of salmon, white rice, and salad I paid $11.62. Seems a bit high, no? Not that I have vast restaurant running experience, but it seems Glaze should be located somewhere where the rent isn't as high as State street, and should be charging less per meal. It could have been a big lunch crowd puller for academics but nearly $12 a pop is kind of expensive.

I did do some research, and found that a nearby shop location on State St. is selling for ~$140K, for reference."}
{"text":"Foods awesome always the same great quality, always know you're getting the same great food each time. You can personalize your entree with some simple twists but if you like teriyaki this is your spot."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good ambiance, quick, meh value. Got the steak w white rice and spicy sauce, drink, and side of dumplings for $18. There was a bit too much sauce on the steak, but those dumplings were sooo crispy! And tasty, which is hard to find for vegetable dumplings. Annoyed that spicy teriyaki cost $1 extra when regular teriyaki is included. Salad and dressing were tasty, fresh and crisp. And they have a jones soda machine! Yum. Overall good but expensive."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was adequate.  This is an order at the counter and they call you name type restaurant.  Pick your protein, pick your rice or salad, pick your sauce, and then pick you spice level!  A few vegetarian options to choose from.  All pretty good for a decent price.  Ill be back for more."}
{"text":"Despite going on the first day it was open, standing in line for about a half an hour, and it being a chain, Glaze was one of the better dining experiences I've had in awhile! 

For their first day of operation, Glaze ran a \"pay what you wish\" fundraiser for Olbrich Gardens. From eavesdropping on those around me, most people (aka college kids) paid about $5; I gave $10 for a $13 meal because I am an Adult and it was a good cause. Why bother telling you this? I don't feel the slight discount I gave myself affected my perception of my experience. 

The restaurant is attractively designed and decorated; it's bright, it's clean, and I actually wouldn't mind a similar theme in my home. It's modern but warm and a lot homier than your typical fast-casual place. Do I eat Qdoba? Yes. Do I want to eat in a Qdoba? Not so much. At Glaze, I wouldn't mind getting my meal to eat in at all. 

Service: on point. Being their first day I expected hiccups but there were none that I encountered. The line moved efficiently, the cashier was the sweetest, most polite kid ever (\"May I offer you a beverage?\" he said with a small arm flourish), dine-in dishes were cleared quickly, and aside from the pile of people waiting for food and weaving out the door onto the street you'd have no idea it was day one. 

Now, the most important part: the food. 
+ Chicken breast teryaki: a very large portion of perfectly-trimmed chicken (no gristle/fat/connective tissue/whatever) on a huge bed of super sticky rice and dressed with a sweet, thick sauce and a sprinkling of sesame seeds. Enough for two lunches, easy. It reheated reasonably well. The sauce was a little sweet, but it grew on me. They have add-on options for spicy sauce which I may explore down the line. 
+ Salad with honey lemon dressing: the dressing was super tasty, but the bit that seeped into the chicken did not mix at all with the teryaki. In general I'm not a huge fan of mixed greens, and serving them in the same container as the hot teryaki makes them hot as well, and that further compounds my dislike. The salad comes with the meal, so it's not a big deal, but for me the combo doesn't really work.
+ Vegetable gyoza: so crispy. Loved them. I didn't sit down to eat until about 30 minutes after I got my order and they were still perfectly crisp even after sitting hot in a closed container steaming away. The filling was similar to what you find in an egg roll. One order is enough for two people with a meal. 

Other observations: they have a Jones Soda fountain soda machine (how have I never seen this as an option before?!) and \"premium\" bottles - Sprecher, WiscoPop, etc. To-go boxes are the kind of cardboard I believe you can compost. They are open until 10 which is nice when you need a late-night bite. 

If Glaze maintains the same level it did upon opening, it'll easily become a go-to for a quick and filling meal. However, one thing I've noticed around town is that many places that start with generous portions when they open slowly shrink their servings over the course of a year and the ingredient quality often follows. Yes, even half a serving would be plenty of food, but part of the appeal is getting so much for what you pay. I'm way more interested in two meals for $9 than one. 

Fingers crossed they stay the course!"}
{"text":"Glaze is my favorite go-to place to get something fast & delicious! Portions are small considering the price but you pay for quality. Im extremely picky about steak & I absolutely love the steak here because it's never dry & overcooked like most restaurants. & The teriyaki sauce is bomb: However, I wouldn't recommend the lemon dressing with your meal unless you like the taste of lemon meringue pie with your teriyaki.
 
Also, I'm in love with the ambience of the place; it's so quaint & cute!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the fast casual concept and I had been looking forward to trying this place for a while-- it seems like there's been a \"coming soon\" sign up for ever. While there was nothing wrong with it, I can't see myself coming back any time soon. 

What I liked:

+The space is really quite nice. Definitely a notch or two above Chipotle, Naf-Naf etc. 

+ I ordered a chicken breast teriyaki combo with the hottest sauce, which is appropriately named \"the hottest.\" I'm happy to report that the sauce is quite hot. Actually, it was really, really hot. My nose ran. My mouth opened and gasped for air. It hurt. This is a good thing. 

+Service was fast and polite (although I did visit during an odd time when it was pretty much empty. 

What I didn't like:

- The menu is limited. With the exception of a few sides, you're left choosing between a handful of proteins, white or brown rice, and one of three salad dressings. 

- The food was kind of boring. If it hadn't been for the sauce, it would have been quite bland. 

- ****The big problem*** The value is absolutely terrible. For $9 you get a nice-sized mound of rice, a modest amount of protein, and a small side salad. The \"combo\" doesn't come with a drink. It should. Nor can you choose not to buy a salad, which I didn't really want in the first place. (They'll let you sub extra salad in place of rice, but you can't skip the salad and get extra rice.)

The previous reviewer said that she got two meals out of this. That wasn't my experience. I got one meal, and it really wasn't a particular filling one. 

I did like that hot sauce, though."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better places to eat in state street.  Then again it's one of the few varieties available.  Serious question, how many burger places does this city need.  Back to the review.  The flavor is there.  The presentation is nice.  The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and the lady at the counter is super friendly but while the flavor is there and blah blah blah.  The rice is definitely being undercooked at this place."}
{"text":"Despite looking like an upscale sit-down restaurant from the outside, the restaurant is more of a casual take-out place. You order at the counter and sit wherever you'd like. I feel like a few people were expecting a nicer place rather than \"fast food\", and that's why this place has lower reviews than I expected.

On the topic of their food, it was delicious! Extremely flavorful - I REALLY enjoyed the honey lemon sauce. The service is fairly fast, so I will definitely be coming back here when I need a quick meal in the future. Overall, a great place for a quick delicious meal. While it's not \"authentic japanese\" if that's what you're looking for, it's not a bad price for the unique experience and good food. I definitely recommend trying this place out! 

P.S. I really don't think it's $$, it should really be more $..."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for a while, as the exterior had been finished long before it opened. Similar to what other reviewers said, I was quite taken aback when I walked inside and it felt like a Chipotle because the exterior design makes it seem like a nicer, sit-down dining experience. Nevertheless, the inside was bright, clean, and quite spacious. I went up to the counter, ordered, paid, and sat down. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be ready, which is a little longer than I would expect from a fast food place but shorter for a dine-in experience. 

Food: Mediocre. I ordered the teriyaki chicken on brown rice and it cost about $9. There was a decent amount of food, but in between one and two meals. I wish that there was an option for a half-order because I don't like to take home leftovers when I go somewhere to eat casually. The food itself was average - nothing spectacular about the flavor, texture, or meal itself. The brown rice was cooked well, but this is hardly a compliment on such a simple base. The teriyaki chicken is exactly what I would expect from any hibachi grill, but there is nothing that sets this place apart menu-wise that would make me come back. 

Atmosphere: Casual! Nice place at the moment because of its recent opening, but will be interesting to see if they are able to keep this up. Employees were also dressed very casually and this gave the place a fast-food vibe. The natural lighting from the large windows are nice, but the seating is uncomfortable and I would rather take the food home to eat. 

This could be a healthier alternative to getting QQ's from the other side of campus, but not sure if it's worth the price. Glad to have tried this place, but I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"I love Glaze!  I've had it before in a few other cities, and I'm so excited it's finally here in Madison.  It's absolutely delicious, not too heavy, and a nice change of pace from a lot of other quick food options.

Highly recommended, but I especially recommend the salmon teriyaki plate."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Food is really hit or miss, but I've had all hits-haha! 

I've only been here for lunch and it's never too crowded, so I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something to eat on State Street.Both chicken and beef entrees are good and the brown rice is amazing! Glaze is also very affordable compared to your usual sit-down Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki chicken breast. Chicken was dry and the food was in a cardboard container. It kind of reminded me airplane food. Teriyaki sauce was not very flavorful and its taste was so so. The charred ribs,as a side were supper fatty. Overall it was disappointing for the $15 I spent.  Low on value and taste."}
{"text":"I think they were having a bad day when I stopped in. No chicken, no forks. My food took a verrrrrrry long time to come out, but it was delicious and I felt like I got a lot of protein for the price. I knock points off for the lack of forks, the giant puddle of water on the floor that didn't have a wet floor sign, the 30+ min food wait, and for the staff arguing with a fellow diner who wanted a refund due to the wait.  Tasty food, but I would make sure there is not a line if you drop in."}
{"text":"My first experience with Glaze Teriyaki was today, and I am very impressed! I ordered for catering for a work meeting. First of all, finding restaurants that offer this type of food as catering portions is nearly impossible. Sandwich shops, pizza, pasta... it gets old. So when I saw that Glaze was delivering catering I was eager to try them out. 

I ordered online, super easy. The delivery driver arrived exactly on time. The food was hot and packaged well. They even included little description cards for each dish so everything was clearly labeled. They threw in plates, cutlery, some extra sauces, and chop sticks! 

The food itself is super yummy! We got white rice, chicken teriyaki, wok veggies, and pork goyoza. It was a big hit and everyone says it tastes awesome. I will absolutely continue to order catering from this place! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Was in Madison a couple of weeks ago to visit a friend and I've been to other Glazes so I was excited to check out the new one (I love love love love love good Teriyaki). Bad Teriyaki is steamed or only slightly grilled and with food-service type sauce rather than thoughtfully made sauce! 

I wouldn't necessarily have a modern home but enjoy visiting Glaze since it's bright / clean...good to eat there or take out if wanting to eat in private. We forgot to ask if this location does catering because my friend wants to have a party for a Badgers' game this fall and doesn't want to BBQ for a lot of people so Glaze would be perfect. 

I like my chicken teriyaki grilled a little longer / crisped a little more than some people and they were happy to oblige my request! The lemon dressing was on point as usual, it's pretty darn refreshing on the greens after taking down the combo meal. 

Pricing is on the mark, not as much as NYC or SF so that's helpful. 

But when will they come to Seattle? I travel a decent amount for work (nothing amazing but do get to visit NYC, SF, Chicago, and other big cities so pretty fun) yet they don't have a Seattle location. I'm not mean enough to deduct one star for that though as it HAS to make it's way at some point right?"}
