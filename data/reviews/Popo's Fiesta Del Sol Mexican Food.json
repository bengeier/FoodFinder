{"text":"My family has been going to Popo's on Indian School Road since the 80's, so it was great to find out that one opened up closer to El Mirage.  This is probably my favorite Mexican Restaurant. The prices are decent, the service is good, and the food is consistently tasty. It's sad that I have to leave El Mirage, a city that got its start as migrant farm worker's housing, just to get great Mexican food, but at least it's only 15 minutes away. I highly recommend the bean dip with fried flour tortilla chips. Can't comment on the bar (I don't drink) but I've never had bad food."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite restaurant for years, but the last few visits the service has been terrible. The hostesses at the front desk are disrespectful and rude, they spend most of their time arguing with one another and the floor manager instead of tending to the customers. No one says hello or thank you, not even a smile. When we checked in she only said \"name\" and handed my husband the buzzer, no wait time was given or anything. They are the face of this business, so I'd like to suggest some teaming building or house cleaning."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had the Mexicana salad. Food and service was great. You definitely get a lot of food for what you pay for! This was our second time visiting and we will continue to come her when we go out for Mexican food. Have been to a couple other Mexican restaurants in the area and nothing compares to popo's!"}
{"text":"Hosts are completely amazing! Went above and beyond for my unprepared self. Always great food here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in AZ!!!! We drive from Gilbert for this stuff! We usually get the chicken chimichanga and tacos. Always great food!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are in the mood for some Sonoran style Mexican food. Lots of good sauce and melted cheese.... The tacos and enchiladas are great. Good for groups and kid friendly. Very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been going to Popo's for over 15 years. Sadly the food just isn't the same anymore. They used to be the best place in town but now just tastes bland... I order lots of chips and salsa to go and let's just say it wasn't what it used to be. Flavorless and boring is now what comes to mind when I think of them ."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Sonoran Mexican food. Chicken chimi with jalapeño cream cheese was excellent. Large portions. Great homemade salsa. Was busy but seated in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.  Management and the team used to be SO much better.  Over the past few years it's gone to crap.  The hostesses act like they are too good to seat you.  The servers act careless and hate their job.  Sometimes we get a great server. I wish they'd pick up their act.  Something always goes wrong when we come here. Great memories from here. Pick up your act guys!"}
{"text":"Popo's is my favorite restaurant!  We've been coming here for years.    I especially love getting a chimichanga with guacamole and jalepeno cream cheese.  It's the best Mexican food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The wait staff and and manager were the worst I have ever seen. We waited 15 minutes before the waiter came by to take our order. Never saw him again. Called the manager over and she got a new waiter who was ok. Manager never checked on us again. If you go here and get a waiter named Jeff G. walk out! The food was good once it was ordered and arrived."}
{"text":"Service was good. Chimi's were very good. Everything tasted fresh and not overly spicy. Just right. Atmosphere was very pleasant and appropriately Mexican. We'll be coming back. Cost was reasonable."}
{"text":"Their menu says machaca this, and machaca that. Only they don't have machaca. They have shredded beef. Sorry, but that isn't machaca. Machaca is air dried beef, that is pounded into fine fibers, and reconstituted. I am not knocking their shredded beef, but come on guys, say what is you serve.  Does anyone in Phoenix serve real machaca anymore?"}
{"text":"Tried this place over the weekend.  The service was Excellent!  The chips and salsa were good.   I had a red chile burrito enchilada style.  With all of the rave reviews of this place I was expecting a lot more, but it was just OK.  It was the same as all the other red burrito's I've ever eaten.  Beans and rice that came with the combo was about the same as any other place I've been to.  Beer was nice and cold, and the service was great!  I'd eat here again, but next time I'll try one of thier specialties."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Popo's for some time now when there was just the location on Indian School.  The food has always been really good, but this last visit wasn't great.  We ALWAYS start with the chili con queso, because it is AMAZING!!!!! If you haven't tried it, you must!!  the chips and salsa were great as well. The only thing I can say about the salsa is that when we have gone there its not always consistent...sometimes its a little too spicy and other times its just right.   I ordered the carne asada burrito ala carte and my husband ordered steak fajitas.  My burrito was just o.k.  I had more pico de gallo in the burrito than steak! It was served on an extremely small plate with garnish on the side, the typical lettuce, tomato, etc.  I decided to eat my burrito with a fork and knife.  When I was trying to cut it up everything was falling off the plate due to the plate being way too small, the table was a mess!! My husband said his steak for the fajitas was way to fatty/chewy and he could hardly chew it.  The more he ate the more he was put off by it.  Not the best experience that we have had there.  We will go back but maybe to the Indian School location next time."}
{"text":"One of the worst place I have ever eaten at!  We ordered soup to start; Albondigas and chicken tortilla. Both arrived barely warm, but were inedible due to overabundance of salt!  Ordered that sample platter and chicken chimichanga. The chimichanga was sent back due to overabundance of salt. Most of the sample platter was taken home in 2 boxes.   This was on a recommendation, but will never return even though the rice and the water were the best thing!!!  AVOID"}
{"text":"Portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. The salsa is tasty and the specials are good. Had the chicken chimichanga and it was pretty solid."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food place to eat at, I've been going here for over 20 years! I love this place I eat here all the time and I've never had any issues."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in the valley. We have been to both locations and love them both equally. We always receive excellent service and great food, without fail."}
{"text":"I had their Albondigas soup, which was very good.  Not at all greasy.  However, I was charged $2.70 for a glass of soda water!  Ridiculous!  And our waiter was sullen.  :("}
{"text":"When your a hostess you need to make sure your guest are not listening or paying attention before you start talking crap about them as soon as the turn around!! At least wait until we leave! Seriously so rude, after someone thanks you!!"}
{"text":"Third time back.  Ordered the two flour Spinach Enchiladas special with pico de gallo, topped w/Baja sauce, served with rice and beans for $10.49.  I could only eat one and it was delicious!  The Enchiladas were stuffed with lots of fresh spinach & little cheese. Yum!  Also ordered a Carnitas special which came w/a ton of slow roasted fall apart pork, pico de gallo, sour cream guacamole and tortilla for $12.99.  Have also enjoyed the Chimichangas Machaca, Mexicana  Machaca Salad in a flour tortilla bowl, and Fajitas.  Food is amazing, Plates are delivered hot right out of the oven, and so is the food. Service is great & the waiters are flexible with ordereds!  Love the large free basket of warm chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. Can also order refill baskets of chips if you run out! The pop is in a huge glass and it comes with refills. The only issue I have is that the tables are made of wood and are very \"sticky to touch\"!   That is the only reason why I've given it four stars. Been around 45 years and have another location in Phoenix. Can also order take out."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and it took 20 minutes just to get drinks. Requested someone to find our waitress twice to no avail. Put our food order in and mentioned we only had an hour lunch. Waitress responded that she could try to expedite our food. We are now 40 minutes waiting on food since going to lunch.  Great food but would not recommend this place if you have to eat in an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"Very good food here if you like Mexican-American food!   Salsa is amazing, especially since i judge my Mexican food restaurants based on the salsa and chips they serve and theirs was very fresh and flavorful. I ordered the chimichanga dinner with red chili and it was outstanding! Very authentic (taste just like home) and the portions/plate was more than I could handle in one sitting (definitely need a box to take remainder home).  My service from my waiter was outstanding and the place was packed for a Sunday evening too.  He was very attentive and provided quick and courteous service. BTW this was my second time eating here at this location and both times the service AND the food went above my expectations and this says a lot considering i just relocated from L.A. where there is a Mexican restaurant on just about every corner you look.  Sincerely, Bookmarked for return"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after driving by a million times. I got two enchiladas and my fiancé got a carne Asada. Both were very good. Chips & salsa were great as well."}
{"text":"The food is your standard fare. The service by Jose was terrible,  very unacceptable. I must also say the past two times there the mens restroom was dirty and flooded floor.nothing like walking in water in a restroom before eating. I dont think I'll be back"}
{"text":"I met up with my boyfriend and his family for lunch.  We ordered from the regular menu however.  I had two items: green corn tamale & beef taco with beans & rice.  The chips and salsa were ready as we sat down.  The service is excellent and our time at the table was not rushed.  The other guests had the fiesta, chk fajitas &  another machaca specialty plate.  Everything is delicious.  We topped it all off with fried ice cream.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came with family and our waitress, Julie, took our order, left and then came back to recommend a different way to put the cream cheese sauce on top then add cheese to melt it. It was so sweet for her to come back and give her advice.  I chose to try it and it was amazing. The cream cheese sauce was under the cheddar cheese and it was warm and creamy!  Thank you Julie!"}
{"text":"First two times we went, we liked it.  Just your basic old school Arizona type Mexican food.  Third time, went with friends, and the meat was so salty it was almost inedible.  At best it was not enjoyable.  Last night it was just my husband and I, so we thought we would try again.  Sat in the bar, had good service, but the Mexican Pizza with shredded beef and the carnitas plate was crazy salty again, especially the beef. Last night I woke up with a horrible stomach ache, this morning I was definitely ill.  Leftovers going in the trash.  Two stars for the good service."}
{"text":"I have been going to Popos for years and tonight was the first time that I would say that I did not have a good experience. I am very use to the long wait but when we got our food the waiter acted like the food was just prepared and how hot the plates are. Yes the plates were  hot but the food was cold. I give it 2 stars because the service used to be good but the service that I got tonight deserved -5 stars."}
{"text":"Extremely good food! I was pleasantly surprised by there steak, and service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is old and dated. The entire inside needs to be professionally cleaned from the lamps down to the tables and floors and seats. The food was okay."}
{"text":"The jalapeño cream cheese is amazing!!!!! The service is good and I love the margaritas"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and have tried almost every Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  Popo's hands down is the winner.  I have been here at least 20 times since we discovered it about a year ago.  Never have I had a bad meal or bad experience.  The portions are huge and the price is VERY reasonable.  The only down side is that there is always a wait during dinner hours, even on the week days.  I defiantly recommend everyone try this place out at least once."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the Valley! I grew up eating at the OG location, nothing comes close. Get the #1 or Pop's complete. Monday is all you can eat tacos/tostadas. Their Mr. Pibb is the best I've had. The free chips and salsa is great too! I love sitting out on the patio."}
{"text":"This was pretty good service. I thought the food was good the red sauce was good but not excellent. The three tacos and rice were stellar. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Finally got around to eating here after many co-workers telling me how good the food was. It definitely lived up to the hype. The food was really flavorful and the service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"First off, my rating has nothing to do with the service.  Our server was nice & attentive and he received 20%  I've been here before with a large party of family for a graduation & wasn't pleased then, gave it a second try and should've known better not too. unfortunately have nothing good to say about the food. The chips and salsa were ok, beans tasted like paste that had been sitting at the bottom of a container for a few days.. I felt sick a few hours after eating here.. Go down the street to some other Mexican restaurants and you'll be happy you did. :("}
{"text":"Service and food was AWFUL...the whole dining experience...from the time we sat down to the time we received our undercooked chicken (that we tried to send back and the manager was a total b**ch about it); THEY EVEN KEPT IT ON OUR BILL EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T EVEN EAT A BITE OF IT....WORST RESTAURANT EVER....totally not the same as the original....NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO THERE...."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The first time my wife got sick and won't return. The second time my son got sick. The food was very greasy and salty.   The chips and salsa are great. I wish the other food was equally as good, but it really isn't."}
{"text":"I love POPOs!! I have been going here all my life.  I love the salsa there. Everything that I order is always amazing.  I recommend the machaca enchilada with a side of beans."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful atmosphere! Prepare to bring home your leftovers! A lot of food especially for the cash! Be prepared to wait during rush hour times but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" has HORRIBLE customer service!!! Called in an order for pick up. Stood at the counter waiting as two young girls were counting the register drawer. Another young girl asked if she could help. I said i was there to pick up an order. She snapped, \"Oh, I cant help, they'll (pointing to the two girls at the register) have to help you.\" One young lady asked how she could help. I said i was there to pick up an order. She asked for the name. I said the name and immediately she said, \"We don't have it.\" She asked for the name again and said the same response. She said two or three other names and i said those were not it. The whole time, neither of the girls made eye contact with me. I had to drop my head to the counter and get their attention before they looked up. She argued with me the order was probably at a different location. I said i didn't think so and again she said, \"Well, we don't have it!\"  That's it, end of conversation. She didn't offer to place another order, offer to check the back, etc. That was it as far as my order was concerned.   I placed the order again, but the price was different when we first placed the order. When i brought this up she said chips and salsa were extra. At that point, i simplified the order. If it was my choice, i would have walked out. Then another young girl walked up to the counter and snidely responded, \"the order was at the other location.\" She walked away, turned, tilted her head with a smirk and said, \"and we cancelled it.\"   I asked for a manager and the teenage girl said she was one of the managers. I told her she needed to talk with her employees about how they speak to customers. Sarcasm, rude comments and poor body language do not belong in the service industry!"}
{"text":"This place is not too bad. Got some good drinks and some unique menu items. Chips and salsa are quite good though. Other than that I have nothing else to say. Nothing really stood out the few times i was there."}
{"text":"Come hungry because you get a lot. The food was delicious and the salsa tasted fresh. I think we found our new mexican restaurant home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the sister to an old favorite place on W Indian School Rd. The food here is as good as at the original, which is the best Mexican food in the valley. My wife and I have been going to the old place for over 30 years. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We were asked to leave for being too loud. Our waiter Gaybriel had attitude from the start. We were on the patio by ourselves watching football and when I asked the manager Suzette her reasoning she explained that an elderly couple said we were loud when we walked in. Huh? Well the Cardinals had just spanked the 49ers so we were pumped. Wow what a bunch of crap for a place we have been going to for over 20 years and a total lack of respect. There were seven of us all long time customers and couldn't believe it. We even know the owner and asked him to review the video but he stated that \"maybe we should just part ways\". Popo's service has been going downhill anyway for some time but we just felt dedicated to the place and had a lot of good times there. We will take our business to Mixteca for a much better experience. Sorry Mario but your business practices just aren't up to snuff anymore."}
{"text":"The food here was not anything to write home to mom about. The wait for a table was extremely long. My daughter ordered the nachos that were horrible. I ordered a grilled chicken burrito that was filled with raw veggies. The veggie pieces were huge. The onions were so large I just could not eat them. There queso tasted like it came out of a jar or can. My husband had the chimichanga he stated he liked it and ate every drop of it.  The beans and rice were good.  I will give it one more try and maybe order something different."}
{"text":"i got the taco platter and the steak was nasty. The steak was dry, pale and flavorless. I think it was reheated. the rice was good but the beans seemed like they were under a heat lamp for a long time. Great salsa though. I have had this in the past but my steak seemed like it was pre made and then put on the flap top. I just feel there's no excuse for 13 dollar tacos."}
{"text":"We tried Popo's for the first time for dinner last night, and it was delicious! I ordered takeout, and it was ready for pickup in 15 minutes. The portions are huge, and the food was amazing. My husband pretty much ate himself into a food coma! We both ordered the #3 combo - green chicken enchilada, chicken taco, and rice & beans. We also ordered chips and salsa, and the chips were warm and fresh. We will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we have been treated like I should have went to Taco Bell at least they don't lie to you like here I asked for booth she said 15 miner said ok then I saw a lot of my tables so we asked for one and were seated that's when we saw 4 open booth not in use I asked if we could have one she said no people wating for them no one there so we asked for manager 15 min more still no one there So don't go if you like to be lied to the whole event went south so we left and went next door"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the service and the food. Meet up with a friend for lunch. It took them forever to get our drinks, then to take our order, by the time we got our food it was an hour and they were not busy. It was very greasy I had the chili rellano it was just awful."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. What more can you ask for? We've been there for lunch and for dinner and have enjoyed the food both times. The Mexican pizza is very tasty. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Chips and salsa were great! Will go back soon! Food was good price and came out hot. Shredded beef was tasty and chicken tacos were good for great dinner out!"}
{"text":"I just finished my first time at po pos. I was told to try their chimichanga with cream cheese and it was the worst one I've ever had. I've had cream cheese chimis at a lot of places and not once have there been any tomatoes or any veggies in them for that matter. Upon telling the waiter what I came for and that it was my first time I got a carne Asada chimi and it was 80% tomatoes with there being no warning in the menu. The waiter and manager claimed that anything with carne asada comes with pico (by pico they mean only tomatoes) but even with being told it was my first time I was expected to know their menu. They refused to replace or even fix my order and the way the manager handled the situation was unprofessional and they will never have my business again."}
{"text":"The service at this Popo's is not that great!   The original Popo's we never had to ask for anything.  At this Popo's we had to ask to be served, and this site feels like a chain."}
{"text":"My family has been eating here since 1974. The best Mexican food in America. The food is consistent and always amazing. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating. Seriously, the best authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"My family have been going to the original one on Indian School since before I was born, I noticed this one opened not to long ago so today my brother and our friend went to eat here, I know it's the Holidays and waiting was a bit longer, that was understandable but we got seated after a hour of waiting, which we just got seated no one came up to us till about 10 minutes after just because a man was walking by, he saw we didn't have drinks so he offered to help. Then our actual waitress came and she gave us chips and salsa we sat and munch on those for a while I mean a GREAT WHILE, we sat and ate all the chips and waited again for about 30 minutes for someone to come up and ask us if we are ready to order. So we put our order in my brother got the exact same as me and our friend got two little things. We waited almost another whole hour to get our food and when we got it MY BROTHER'S FOOD WAS COMPLETELY WRONG! he was very upset and the waitress that dropped it off just took off so we all waited to see where she went so he could get it fixed about 20 minutes later she comes back finally and asks us is everything okay? My brother explained to her how she gave him the wrong thing and she just rolled her eyes and then tried to play it off like laughing and said oops. That's all, she was going to grab the plate but my brother told her never mind since it might take another HOUR to get the RIGHT food even then it could still be WRONG. So we just decided to stick with what we had since it might take another hour or longer to get food. She didn't even offered to take it off the bill till my brother explained that it should be since it was wrong and he didn't want to wait again for another hour. So she rolled her eyes and just said okay I'll do that. After that no one came to refill our drinks or ask us how our meal was NO ONE. She only came back to hurry and get our bills and get them done to move us out. I know at the original Popo's this would have never happened."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars??!! Unbelievable! This place should be 5 stars. Great food. Great drinks. Nice ambiance. Driving to our hotel room we came across this Mexican restaurant and it looked alive. Great lighting and great service. Thank you Craig for serving us and giving us great food suggestion. Food was yummy!! :)"}
{"text":"Love the margaritas,  good chips and salsa.  I personally have only eaten the folded chicken quesadilla...love it!!  Service has always been good.  My biggest complaint, here and all restaurants, the stinky, smelly, carpeting....please rip it out and use tile!!!!  Every time upon entering here the smell just gags me,  yuck"}
{"text":"The best green chili burrows we've ever had- and I grew up on Mexican food. We'll definitely be back. Everything was really good. Prices not bad either."}
{"text":"I love Popos. I have been going to the Indian School location my whole life. Living in North Phoenix, i was stoked to find out about their new location. I finally tried it out last night.  I got my regular- Green chili Burrito Enchillada Style with r/b. It was excellent as always. The service was very fast. They re-filled my drinks quickly.  It was very clean and nice in the new location.   Rec a million times."}
{"text":"I used to go to there location on Indian school with my grandparents as a kid there bell rd location is all was packed   many old people I see why the food is so full of salt it crazy all of it that we tried chimi, fajitas and the tacos and the server just sucked she only came ones to take our order never say her again the guy that brings the chips did all the work he failed the drinks the chips and brought out the food I wish a had cash that day I would of tip him instead won't go back"}
{"text":"Popo's is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants. The food is so delicious and the salsa is one of the best I've had! Service was great too! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My very favorite Mexican food place the best salsa in town. They changed the price on Taco Thursday it was just hamburger meat taco for 99 cents which was great now a 1.99 not as good now. But their cheese crisp are really good also. They have always been great been going their for about 5 years...."}
{"text":"Nope, not coming back....the only good thing I can say about this restaurant is they have good chips and salsa.  We were dying in our pants when my kids said we should have called the fire department when they brought the fajitas. So much smoke which eventually meant burnt chicken. The steak fajita was just ok, but the beef was chewy and hard to cut.    My daughter said the rice tasted like Mexican minute rice out of a box and my son said his enchilada tasted like hospital food. Jalapeño poppers, save the $6...cooked from frozen. Blech!  Really wanted to like this place....but it just wasn't happening. Left the restaurant pretty unamused that we spent $70 on food we didn't even box up to go. Bland food, overwhelmed staff and tired decor. Still wondering why we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"OMG.....WHY do I get talked into coming back here?!!!  My wife was craving mexican food and had a shortened lunch break so needed something close by, hence a trip to Popo's.  I figured I would go with something simple, a cheese crisp, so I wouldnt be too disappointed...THAT DIDNT WORK!  Let me digress....upon walking in one of the workers was hanging a sign for Cinco de Mayo and advertising Modelo....so I ordered one....the waitress came back and said they had no Modelo...WHAT??  So I stuck with water...then when the cheese crisp arrived it was room temperature and the jalapeno poppers my wife was eating were even colder.  She didnt have enough time to complain and wait for them to be remade so she dealt with it and let me go thru Yelp!  This has not been my first rodeo with Popo's my neighbors and friends have sang their praises for as long as I can remember and we just havent had the same good luck or experiences...but one thing is for sure this WILL be my final visit!  I dint even get into the disrepair of the restaurant such as tiles missing from the wall as well as food that never got cleaned from the walls and booth from previous patrons...and the bathrooms were worse!"}
{"text":"I ordered a machaca beef burrito for lunch.  Had excellent service.  Barely made it home to the east valley before having stomach issues...later tonight I reheated my leftovers and cut into it to find the was chicken also in my burro!!!  Cross contamination much??!!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch. SOOOO YUMMY! Even the reheated left overs were delicious! Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place and go fairly often for margaritas but the service on the patio or in the bar isn't good. They don't seem to have a sense of urgency and you end up waiting longer than you'd like. Went today and ended up leaving because we waited 15 minutes after being seated for someone to at least come over and tell us they would be with us soon. It wasn't busy but there were several large parties, still disappointed."}
{"text":"I rarely go to a place more than once.  Now having made that statement, I have been to Po Po's 3 times in the last 3 months! I freakin' love this place! Happy Hour margarita's are only $3.00, yummy, tart,  and strong! My limit is 3 and I'm seriously schnockered. The food is what you'd expect from a place such as this, basic Tex Mex dishes covered in cheese (not necessarily a bad thing), the portions are large and the food comes out hot. The salsa is some of the best I have ever had and I eat the entire bowl every time. I had one of the salads the last time we went and I swear there was half a creamy delicious avocado on it. What a treat!"}
{"text":"We eat here on a regular basis, typically at least once a week for dinner.  Food and service are always good and consistent.  2 item entrees are always good, as is  the green chile plate, which is very flavorful, but expect some heat with that one.  I love, Love, LOVE their salsa, which always has just a little zip to it, but husband prefers the smooth hot sauce, which really isn't that hot.  Plan to go early, before 5 for dinner, otherwise yiull wait.  This place is very popular and will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food place. Great prices and food. I love their chips and salsa. And everything on the menu"}
{"text":"This place is close to home and is usually very good.  The service is usually good but the food can be a hit or miss.  I have tried several things on the menu.  but the two things I would not recommend at all are the fish tacos or the steak fajitas.  The fish is breaded way too much with a little bit of lettuce and tomato ( no cheese at all), and the corn tortilla shells were cold.  On the fajitas, every piece of steak was full of fat and of the very little meat that was left was incredibly tough.  It was the worst fajita dish I have ever had.  On the other hand the spinach con queso dip is fabulous along with the Chimichanga and grande taco.  I may just depend what you order.  The good items are really good."}
{"text":"Out with hubby for a casual night ! Ice cold mug of beer,  and great tasting tacos!!! If you go I want to know and give me feed back"}
{"text":"Nope, I can honestly tell you that DelTaco has better fish taco's then this place. My husband didn't enjoy his food either and we both felt 'off' the next day.  Plus after we paid the server, who was very nice, but he forgot to give my husband his credit card back."}
{"text":"I literally am dying. Threw up 6 times at work and then came home and it came out the other end after eating at this place last night. Maybe it's just me, but I HIGHLY suggest you don't eat here."}
{"text":"First time at the famous Popos! So happy to finally try it! Went in for lunch. chips and salsa right away drinks shortly after.chips hot and fresh and perfectly made salsa.  Our server took some time to take our order but it was a busy lunch time. Food didn't take long at all. Over all great food good service. Gonna come back soon!"}
{"text":"Worst service of any restaurant. Called from parking out to see what the wait would be. Lady said there was no wait, twice. I walked up took maybe 45 seconds then they say 20 minutes, After 35 minutes I just gave the stupid buzzer back."}
{"text":"I love it, food was great, the mix and match was perfect enchiladas was big and cheesy love it along with the spinach queso.."}
{"text":"The ambience sucked the waitstaff couldn't even walk straight. The food sucked over priced food over priced drinks!!! Salsa was watered down chips were stale. I will never make that mistake again. Yuck"}
{"text":"Been here several times, and Im always happy with the amazing service, and excellent food. When my inlaws came to visit,  we ate here. They said everything was great,  and the best salsa,  I agree. We each had a dish, then mom asked for fried ice cream...it.was.huge! 4 of us shared it, and there was some left over. We even had two Togo boxes filled with leftovers."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! The margarita's will kick your a** and the food is soooooo good. Not authentic Mex but the best American Mexican (even better if you ask me)  you will find in Phoenix!!!!  Huge portions and value priced."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!! It's always busy and they don't take reservations but the food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really, really love this Popo's. I have never had a bad experience here, and everyone I have brought here has loved it. They have THE BEST salsa I have ever had. Loved it so much we bought a quart of it! Their lemonade is also very good. The food is definitely above average. I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the last time I'll ever eat at this restaurant which is sad because I really love the food. I have been a regular at Popo's for a long time and have had this happen once before but overlooked it. My husband and I sat on the patio and waited over 25 minutes before notifying the front and leaving. Not once in the 25 minutes did anyone working there make eye contact with us let alone take a drink or food order. We asked two separate servers to see if we could order drinks and each time they said yes but was walking back in the restaurant to do something and never returned. We watched three other tables be sat and they all got service and we just sat there. Before notifying the front, we also let the servers we originally asked service for know as well. The servers and hostesses didn't really seem to care. Like I said, the food is great but the service was awful."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Tonight was the worse it has ever been. The original one on Indian School is so much better. Waited 30 minutes for an appetizer and almost an hour for food. Why is this one so different from the original?"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was absolutely delicious. My toddler and I came on a date and ordered the popo special and the kids quesadilla.  The food was very delicious, fresh, and hot.  The place was very busy & I could see why. Total price with his juice and my water was $20.  Chips and salsa were complimentary and fresh too. I would definitely come back and recommend to other people."}
{"text":"The drinks and atmosphere are great. Service wasn't bad either. Very friendly staff. Beautiful decor and clean restaurant. The food on the other hand ... I was not a fan. Maybe I'm spoiled coming from Houston but I thought it was well below average. Cheese dip was way too thick. Too much sour cream. Salsa tasted like straight tomato paste. And our fajita meat was way overdone. Maybe it was just a bad night in the kitchen. Don't think I'll be giving it another try though."}
{"text":"Honestly the WORST margarita we've EVER had.  Yuk. Had to put it on the bar and walk out."}
{"text":"American Mexican: I hafta admit I went in be a little nervous given some of the reviews.. but I thought it was good... Salsa was great and not watered down like a lot of chains, the guac was better then most places too and not loaded with fillers.. I got the Mini Plater and there was nothing mini about it I left with a ton of food and super full.. My friend was happy with her house margarita... but not so much the empanadas which looked like deep fried tacos and not any kinda empanadas i ever saw before.. she said they where fine but I wouldn't order expecting a empanada.. My Ice tea was basically water.. Service was just fine ... but I am one who doesn't want a ton of interaction with my server and he was pretty busy.. did I mention I am full reallllllly full... Salsa is a big deal to me and there Salsa is better than most places Ive been in the chain department... okay I hafta go lay down Im so full..."}
{"text":"First of all my take on the food is it is Awesome!  We have always liked the food.  BUT the service really really really is very very very BAD.  They left us at the table with glasses empty fo longer then they should have especially after having spicy mexican food.  Also when it was time to get the check or pay they just completely disappeared.  Service has steadly went down hill."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad \"Mexican\" food and extremely lackluster service bordering on contemptible indifference. I was forced to retrieve my own menu for my husband and I because one was never brought. We had to ask them repeatedly for things we'd already ordered. Final count was 7 times.  2 margaritas clearly had almost NO alcohol in them. Not a good sign to start.  The salsa was laughably bad. It was like  watered down Pace picante sauce but without the flavor or spice.  Chips were adequate but nothing special.  The meal was borderline gross and flat and my daughter felt nauseous after 2 bites of her nachos platter.   Hard to believe this place stays in business but it won't for long based on this terrible experience or maybe people no longer know the difference between good service and truly bad. Maybe in the grander scheme of things it doesn't matter to anyone.   Avoid like it was cockroach infested and literally on fire."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now.  One of my fav Mexican restaurant in the Valley.  Great margaritas as well as food and if you come on a Tuesday they are only .99!  The chicken enchiladas are a personal fav, but the abondagas and chicken tortilla soups are to die for!"}
{"text":"First time here, we got off the plane and we were starving. We heard about the Mexican pizza they served here and we were sold. We were seated quickly and the customer service was awesome. Our drinks kept being refilled and our waitress checked to see how we were doing regularly. The food came out quickly. For a sit down restaurant the prices are very reasonable.   We ordered chimichangas, pizza appetizer and enchiladas. The pizza is more of a meal than an appetizer it was pretty big. Just imagine a pizza with a thin crispy tortilla crust and all the toppings you would find inside a burrito. I really enjoyed the pizza. For my entree I ordered a chimichanga and you get a choice of two toppings. Which included guacamole, jalapeño cream sauce or sour cream. Rice and beans can be added for an extra fee. I chose to use shredded beef \"machaca\" in my chimichanga with guacamole. It was a big chimichanga I only finished half. It was so flavorful and the meat was so tender.   Great place for a cheap sit down dinner. The service was great and the food was awesome. We'll be back! You also get chips and salsa at your table for free!"}
{"text":"food is fantastic everything enjoyable entire family loved it. Service was spectacular even won a free cheese crisp."}
{"text":"Good piping hot food, great flavor. Service was good and margaritas were tasty. We'll be back in again."}
{"text":"We have gone here twice now. Once after they first opened & then again tonight. The food was good, no complaints. I ordered a chicken burrito; my boyfriend ordered the 3 carne asada taco plate. Both were great, I think he ate half of my burrito but that's nothing new! The chips and salsa are delicious and the margaritas are Yummy! We used to eat at the original Popo's on Indian school when I was growing up so my family was excited to see this one open on our side of town. Good food, reasonable prices. We will be back!"}
{"text":"No bueno.  Came for breakfast.  Place was dead and probably wont be around much longer.  Chips and salsa were weak.  Asked for hotter salsa and it was even weaker.  Albondigas tasted like plain broth and came with almost no vegetables and two small meatballs.  Menudo was whack.  Tortillas were raw and unedible.  Sprite was good.  Enchilada style sauce had no heat or spice.  I would recommend not eating here to anyone who is thinking about it.  There is an El Pollo Loco in the same parking lot that is a hundred times better.  RIP POPOs."}
{"text":"I have been eating at PoPo's for over 30 years and it is the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix! Service is excellent and nice atmosphere at the Bell location. So reasonably priced and I have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Plate dinners average $10. Big turn off. They were understaffed and not that busy, yet it took them a while to take our order. The food is ok, nothing spectacular to cause me to do cartwheels over. I know a better place just up the road from them with better prices, better selections, and fresher ingredients."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the lunch and food here. I was very disturbed by a photo that a customer had put on yelp and that led me to go vegetarian on this day. I think I had the number 9 which was a red cheese enchilada and chile relleno with rice for about $11. They do not have lunch specials on Saturday. The place was pretty full and we got a funny waitress as well. The relleno was superb and it was even missing it's tail. It had the white cheese inside and a good egg coating while the rice was classic Mexican dark brown. For openers, the free chips and salsa were hard to stop eating and the $2 side of guac was served in an edible shell and was very creamy and smooth. This place has been around for decades and despite that photo and my trauma from it, this meal worked out well."}
{"text":"Popos is my favorite Mexican food in my area. It is good quality, standard Mexican American food. Their enchiladas, green chili burritos, beans, and tacos are delicious.  Most recently, I had their Wednesday special. For $6.99 you get a burrito filled with your choice of red chili, green chili, machaca, chicken, or ground beef. This is served enchilada style and deep-fried if you choose. The machaca is well seasoned shredded beef. I've also had the green chili and it is a good traditional mild green chili pork. I always add a side of beans to round up my meal. The beans are well seasoned and light on the lard.   The chips are good and the salsa is just okay. I always ask for a side of hot sauce. It is more flavorful and delivers a bit of a kick.   Service is friendly and prompt. They seem to really care about their customers. The decor is nice and inviting.   Overall the food is good and consistent. It is definitely not the best Mexican food ever made,  but they do do some things great."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp fajita burrito enchilada style. Amazing. Shrimp was plenty and good size. Encholada sauce was a bit salty   Service came and went. We were waited on by 4 different people. It was confusing and at times lacking. Margarita was not good at all."}
{"text":"The food was good. But I'm not impressed with the service. For one thing if it is you job to interact with the public. You need to speak clearly and make sure everyone understands each other. The server spoke broken English. We had to keep repeating everything. There was an issue with the enchiladas being too tough. We asked for something else. It took two tries before they got the order right. On top of that  it was just warm  not hot. Aribas has it right. The menus have pictures. Just point."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced Large takeout order was 25 minutes late and they Didn't even have forks!! Girl working at the front didn't have a clue, she wasn't on top of things at all"}
{"text":"We were craving good drinks with a nice patio where my boyfriend could enjoy his football game. The service was amazing from the moment we walked in. The drinks were tasty and generous in size. We enjoyed strawberry and pomegranate margaritas. We were a bit concerned that I would not have food options as I am vegan. We were pleasantly surprised that they could accommodate. I had a delicious veggie chimichanga. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Stay away. Tried this place and the chips salsa and rice was good but the chili con carne enchilada sauce is very salty and then my replacement plate had a piece of plastic in my rice. This place doesn't have good dishes."}
{"text":"Not very impressive for the size of this place. Went to front desk and because we wanted to sit outside the hostess simply gave us menus and said to seat ourselves. No escort to the area, etc. gave us some old, torn menus. After we sat down a lady came over, no greeting, welcome or anything. Simply dropped off napkins and forks in a pile and left! After we ordered beverages she came back and just put the straws on top of our nacho chips! Ordered food and it was delivered in under 15 mins so we guessed it's pre-cooked. We were right. Food not good at all. The rice was re-heated in grease, pork was dry and beef was cooked probably yesterday."}
{"text":"I think when it comes to Mexican food, it's hard to impress someone who's from Southern California. I've tried plenty of Mexican restaurants out here in the valley and by far Popo's Fiesta Del Sol Mexican food was the best one I've had. The chips and salsa that came to the table shortly after we were seated reminded me of one of my favorite Mexican spots in LA. The server was awesome. I can't remember her name sadly but she was the best! Even the guy who dropped off our chips and salsa was great. We didn't have a wait when we came in. Our server was attentive and super chill; had a good laugh with us.  I did dock them a star because she forgot a couple of stuff we asked for but honestly her personality and how she dealt with us overshadowed the small mistake. My friends and I will be making another trip back this direction if we ever want good Mexican food. And I'll be sure to try something else on the menu. And I'll probably do an update review."}
{"text":"As many of the previous posts have said it's pretty run down and dirty. The best item we had was the cheese crisp. The machaca chimi was just ok, my sons \"huge\" burrito was big but somewhat dry. The margarita's were from a mix. Lots of small kids screaming. Not the most enjoyable dinner.  The service was average or even a bit slow. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Popo's I am really sad that I am giving you this rating:( but I have to be honest. I am a long time customer, worked for you briefly in high school as a hostess in high school, my parents worked for you, and my uncle worked for you when they were young. We have always been coming to the restaurant and this post isn't going to stop me from coming, I just want you to know what my family has experienced the last few visit. Three visits ago my husband and I were seated on the left side of the restaurant. Our server kept forgetting us, we were brought out chips and salsa after quite some time and after we received them my husband requested warm chips, it took about 20 mins for us to receive them, we ordered a cheese crisp, it took a very long time to come out and came to the table cold. We had also ordered a mini platter for a main dish, which we wanted to eat after the cheese crisp mind you, but it took so long for him to return it came out before we had a chance to. We didn't see our server for refills on our drinks and by the time he did return to the table and we mentioned the cheese crisp, he said he would get another one made. We had waited so long that we ended up just saying never mind, ate the mini platter and paid for our dinner. I won't go into detail about the second, however, the last visit was just a week ago. I ordered one of my favorite meals the cilantro avocado chicken salad and my husband the machaca Chimi platter and we both ended up sick to our stomachs when we got home. Since we had different meals, I'm wondering if the oil hadn't been changed. I love, love, love Popo's and don't want to stop going. It seems like you have become overstaffed and aren't paying the attention that you once did your customers. Your prices have truly skyrocketed, making it a bit difficult to enjoy bringing my large family to big family dinners like we once did on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place is not the best in my book. Food is not all up to par. Atmosphere is ok . I will only go hear if I have to. Beer is good. I hear margaritas are good. But food wise not my best choice."}
{"text":"Portion size was huge, and at a great price! Had chicken enchilada with a chicken taco and would highly recommend it to others.  Lots of spice but not overwhelming , watermelon margarita was also a great compliment to the enchilada"}
{"text":"Let me just keep it simple. Popo's should be named poopoo's. The only people that could possibly enjoy this food is someone very intoxicated."}
{"text":"Finally, a nice sit down Mexican Restaurant where you order from the table.  Nice decor and clean.  Service and food was excellent.  Been looking for a place like this for some time.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"My dad an I love this place! Friendly waiters and waitresses. Very helpful. I asked if they have smoothies and my waiter said no but he could give me a virgin strawberry daiquiri. I appreciated it a lot. Salsa is great. I recommend the fried ice cream. Delicious! Staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Food and service is pretty good and they have great Happy Hour drink prices 7 days a week in the whole resturant, not just the bar. Popo's has plenty of servers to take care of the customers unlike a few places we go to."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's parents took us out to lunch the other day! I'm sure glad they brought us here!! The chips and salsa were great. A little hear to the salsa but nothing my spicy-intolerant mouth couldn't handle. I ordered the carnitas. They were amazing- very tender and flavorful!!  My boyfriend ordered the taco grande. The machaca was also amazing! Some of the best meat I've had in a taco. I also liked that it was on a fried shell. I will definitely be back to this place to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Did someone say Machaca!? My all time favorite Phoenix Mexican food restaurant (Notice I say Phoenix and not authentic! So don't attack :) )! I don't tend to stray from my Machaca Chimichanga with Christmas sauce very often. But when I do, I don't miss my regular too much, because everything is so good. All their ingredients are top notch and super fresh. Nothing ever sit's under the heat lamp for too long (very typical in Mexican food restaurants.) They have happy hour every day from 3-7pm as far as I can tell its only drinks, but their menu is reasonable all the way around so no worries. Their Margarita's are on point. They have tons of dinning, bar, and patio seating. But expect a wait if you come around 7pm. This place is always busy. The staff is always friendly and keep up pretty well for how busy they get. But lets get back to the Machaca... the most tender, juicy, flavorful beef you will ever try. Seasoned and cooked to perfection. I recommend it for any of their dishes. I of course prefer it wrapped in a tortilla, deep fried, and covered in both red and green sauce. If you haven't tried it... do so NOW! You wont be disappointed.   Great place for families, a casual date, lunch, Happy Hour, dinner for one, and pretty much anyone. Unless you are looking for a fancy, quiet meal. Like I've said, its always busy."}
{"text":"The place is alright. I am trying to think of something special about the visit, but I can't think of anything.   It was average service met with average food at average prices.  They did have a happy hour. When I asked what was happy hour they didn't know. The waiter told me to tell him what I wanted and he would check if there is a special.   So.....average it is."}
{"text":"This place is awful! First off we had a cross between a Voldemort and a ken doll  looking waiter that had cold, soulless eyes piercing down at you who was very rude! The food tasted meh. The soulless waiter got our order in a rude and mean tone and that's all. The busboy gave us a refill on chips and the some other person gave us our mediocre food. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time. Very impressed. Excellent salsa, not too hot. Combo plate very good ate two items bringing one home."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new spots. Great happy hour. Fire pits outside on the very large patio. Great place to take the family, hang with friends or entertain business clients and co-workers. Haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"I love this place, and always go back.  Helps that it's right down the street from me.   Service has always been fast and I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table.  Food notes:  ~ Beans are ok,  my mother in law's are better. (but then, she was born and raised in Mexico! Hard to beat that)  ~ Mango margarita was awesome, but not enough booze in it. ~ I ordered a virgin margarita on their .99 margarita night... turns out they charge you FULL PRICE for a friggin virgin margarita, when I could get a loaded one for a dollar.  I was pretty irked with that. ~ .5 lb carnitas fajitas were amazing... be aware that it's a ton of food and you will likely have lunch and possibly dinner for the next day. ~ Carnitas plate was also humongous. ~ I do like to order the chicken and veggies plate quite a bit.  The veggies are nicely seasoned and well cooked.  **Gluten/Celiac FYI: red sauces are thickened with wheat flour rue, stick with the green chili or the simple sauces. Other sources of gluten are obvious."}
{"text":"Whoever said perfection doesn't exist has been greatly mistaken.  This is by far the best Mexican food I have ever had. Popo's turned me into a hater into a lover of Mexican food. I usually get tacos (perfection) with rice and beans - so warm, rich and delicious! I've never been disappointed with the food, and have rarely had any problems with the service.  Chips and salsa are yummy and if you ever have a problem with how something is cooked- just let them know and they will fix it, regarding meat, chips, tortillas, etc.   This is an all-time favorite and one of my favorite places to eat. Beyond quality food."}
{"text":"It can be a little too much grease for me, but if I limit myself to one very delicious shredded beef taco (and unlimited chips), I leave incredibly happy. The rest of my family loves it, too, which doesn't always happen with us and Mexican restaurants. =)"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time back at this restaurant. I tried their Monster Steak Burrito and boy was that ever right. Two perfectly done burritos stuffed with rice, beans, pico de gallo, grilled onions, bell peppers & cheese and of course steak. DELICIOUS! And big so much food I had to take the leftovers home. As far as my Margarita was concerned that too was large and served in a nice Margarita glass not a crummy ball jar like other places serve. I'm hooked this is my new goto for great Mexican food. OLAY!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos. Serving size is huge, well worth the price. Service was friendly and fast. Salsa was white people spicy."}
{"text":"The food is always great at both Popo's locations. I have been a fan for over 35 years. The restaurant has never been known for great or even mediocre service. Our server tonight must have been the reigning Arizona Hide-N-Seek Champion. We could not find him to save our life. Good luck in the regional qualifier against Big Foot."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Long waits though. I hear you can do reservations in advance. I will need to look into that. House margarita are amazing and even better on happy hour prices. They do have open bar seating that is first come first serve. If you don't have a big party, that might be the answer to avoiding a long wait. Staff is great no matter which area you sit in."}
{"text":"We decided to try it out for Valentines day.  I can easily say we won't be going back there anytime soon.  The service was terrible, and the food was far from traditional.  My Chicken Lime salad was just a salad with chicken in a tortilla bowl with ranch dressing."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars because its one of my fav's for Mexican. The chicken tortilla soup is amazingly scrumptious!  Huge chuncks of white meat chicken as well as other veggies!  On the lunch menu I always order the buckin burro with chicken enchilada style.  Oh my yumminess!  You get beans and rice as well. The chips and salsa are good too... If u like spicy you can ask for the hotter stuff. Service can vary depending on your server but most are pretty good. Had chicken fajitas too. Came out on sizzling plate as usual.  Pretty good but not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner last night after a shopping trip at the Winco.  We ordered the machaca beef chimichanga.  Salsa was very good, and the chips were pretty good (needs a bit more salt).  The hot sauce was also on point and had a bit of kick.  The chimichanga was one of the best I've had in a while, primarily because they seasoned the meat!  Most places don't season their burrito meat anymore (I have no idea why).  It was deep fried to a perfect golden brown crunch.  The guacamole was also very good.    They were pretty busy on a Thursday night.  Service was a-ok.  They do charge quite a bit for the bean dip (Garcia's still gives it for free).  All in all a great experience, and I will be back.  Better than Macayo's, which is just down the street."}
{"text":"Walked in around 10:00pm. Waited 15min and still not greeted by a server, to top it off the silverware had old food deposits on it. Absolutely unacceptable in my book. Did not hang around long enough to try the food."}
{"text":"Forgot to take pics of the meal... Place was packed and as usual food delicious. Why 3 stars, the most unfriendly waiter I have ever had! I truly believe he does not know how to smile.. Was getting 3 orders to go after meal and I had to repeat it to him 4 times at different times! It was like pulling teeth to get him to talk and not mubble his words... Ugh..."}
{"text":"First time for us. Raves on chips & salsa were correct.  Wife tried tortilla soup then ordered seconds for tomorrow's lunch. Seafood enchiladas were top notch  as was chicken fajitas.  We'll be back.."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, but I cannot wait for a return trip to Phoenix for a do-over! I had the chimichanga with ground beef and the works. It was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Had a really good time with family and friends tonight..... as always the food was really good..... I ordered an enchilada but got a tamale instead......I will go back for there tamale's......This has to be my favorite Mexican food  restaurant in the valley................"}
{"text":"The chicken fajitas were so delicious but next time I would dump them onto a plate because a lot of my onions got burned  but that's okay because the sizzling part was so much fun! Excellent guacamole. I'm doing a fat loss challenge right now so I didn't get to taste very much but what my husband had he gobbled up fast -  machaca taco, machaca enchilada (but he didn't like the tortilla) and tostada. The refried beans for quite delicious and the salsas were very good even if you just eat it with a fork!"}
{"text":"Popos is a nice family atmosphere ...great food and service. Been here several times and have always left full! Only negative I would say is they do not offer to go cups so you can't take your tea or coke with you if you didn't get to finish it!"}
{"text":"Used to visit the original location when I was a kid and took my family there.  Tried this location (which used to be a Garcia's) and it is just as good if not better than the original 67th and Indian School location.  Food has the same great taste I know and love."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Gabriel is an awesome server!! No matter how crowded the place is he makes the visit as pleasant as possible! Love the atmosphere and the patio!! With Gabi the experience will be enjoyable!! Go Gab!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night with a group of about 10. We sat out in the patio area and it was nice with a breeze blowing through but it was warm from the firepits out there. We ordered a chicken chimi and we told them we were in a hurry as we had an event planned after dinner. Our order came out pretty quickly, however, a friend of ours who arrived before us and ordered bean dip waited almost 40 minutes for bean dip! WTF Popo's... what are you doing picking the beans, soaking them, cooking and mushing them - how can it take that long to get an appetizer to the table? You should have a bucket of refried beans in the kitchen ready for go, add cheese, microwave for 30 seconds and done. Tisk tisk... Also, another irritation was that the prices they wanted to charge us for drinks did not match the prices advertised on their website nor the pricing they had received the week prior. They wanted to charge us all $1 more than advertised.. after a quick meeting with the manager they honored the pricing advertised but again, c'mon Popo's... you're not Mexico - you can't advertise pricing for something and then charge another (watch out for this customers).  So the food was good and I thought the salsa was tasty. So yes, I'd go again, but I'll be aware of pricing switch-ups and will probably not order the 40 minute bean dip."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with Popo's on 59th and Bell Road. My friends and I were enjoying a nice dinner out & we got an uninvited guest.... A cockroach!!  To make matters worse, It was crawling on Jamie. Nasty  right?!  So, We called our waitress over and notified her of the incident. She didn't even look for it, she simply apologized and stated \"I'll go get a manager\". The waitress came back with our checks with $10.00 discounted off (no manager in sight). So one of Jamie's friends said to the waitress\" just let your manager know that it is very unprofessional of him not to come over and apologize, also I will be contacting the health department.\" The waitress once again walked away. After sitting there a while the manager came up to the table while we were all talking about it and stared at us with out saying anything to us or introducing himself. Finally Michelle Marquez said \"are you the manager? it's right over here\" we made sure the cockroach didn't get away by placing a cup over it. The manager did state they had recently sprayed. After the manager finished picking up the Roach with a napkin we explained that the roach had crawled onto Jamie and her meal should be comped. The manager was bothered by that stating \"are you her Advocate?\" \"ok and you guys can wash her car\" I didn't understand his logic).... Here are some videos of what went on tonight. We will never return to this restaurant not only because of the Roach problem, but because of the lack of professionalism.

{"text":"Our first time here we were told it would be a 10 min wait for a party of 2...after noticing everyone who came in after us were being seated and 25 minutes later we checked with the hostess and she never even put us on the list! Not surprised considering they were are chatting and socializing behind the counter majority of the time. The food was great and service was nice. I'll give this place a try again soon but I can't get over the first impression."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food!  That's why there's often a line.  This is my  favorite restaurant in the Glendale area."}
{"text":"Popo's is one of my all time Mexican food restaurants! I've been going there for 20 years, unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and even though they were packed we got delicious food! We had to wait a while for a server but when he did come he was very patient with our table despite the business of the lunch rush! Will be back for sure and when I get the kids name who helped us I'll update the post! Loved all the chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken tortilla soup. It had 2 little chicken pieces but about a cup of rice. It was too much. I don't remember it having rice. Chips and salsa are always great!"}
{"text":"Ate at the original shop for years and loved the place, still do actually. Ate on the patio here the other nite and loved the atmosphere, the professional wait staff and incredibly fast and efficient service.  Had the red burro enchilada style and it was spectacular! Highly recommend.  Hop on over to Popo's asap."}
{"text":"I keep going back and forth between three and two stars on this one. Like I said before Popo's isn't the best or most authentic Mexican Cuisine but you can usually count on delicious salsa,  warm corn chips and the strongest cheapest margaritas in town. This is a budget Sonoran Style Restaurant that gets very busy very early. You can get there at 5:00 and the place might be packed and on a half hour wait.  I usually get the Chicken Fajita salad because it's usually tasty. It differs slightly every time I order it but it's usually OK. One time a big piece of bacon was dropped into it and I let them know about it. They said they don't have any bacon in the restaurant so it must have fallen out of someone's sandwich. That time I lowered them to two stars because that is what I consider to be a slop house.  I decided to try a chile relleno. Usually chile rellenos are very tasty. Not always but they usually are a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with cheese then batter dipped and fried and served with sauce. I think I tasted what seemed like a canned chile stuffed with cheese, topped with cooked egg whites and covered with a green chile sauce that tasted liked the canned green chile and then topped with a thick blanket of cheese. I ate as much of it as I could but my stomach locked up. It might have been the worst thing I ever tried to eat. I do note that I don't know if the green chile was canned or fresh but it tasted canned to me. This was very unappetizing to me.  I also ordered a side of vegetables to go with the chile relleno. I thought the vegetables looked and tasted great. But they were piled on top of a dried out old piece of steak. I thought that was terrible again they are a slop house AGAIN to me.  The last two times I was here I did notice that they changed the guacamole recipe and it's not as good as it used to be. It now seemed like it's made with frozen avocados. The taste and texture is different.  I used to think the super strong margaritas were fun but now they just make me sick they are so strong.  With all that said Popo's does have some redeeming qualities. They make very good carnitas. The chicken fajita salad is usually tasty. Delicious salsa. Service is usually good."}
{"text":"Visited last night for dinner. It was excellent service and food. Also witnessed a group of 20-25 people leaving very aggresivly and hostile. Tipping trash cans off the outside entrance way, tossing cups, cussing up a storm. Just acting like animals is flat out how they were being. I also waited for a table along side of them outside before the ordeal and witnessed alot of this behavior. Honestly felt so bad for the staff who had to deal with these these barbarians. But wanted to leave a review because the staff delt with the situation the best they could in a very calm professional manner. After witnessing this and having an outstanding service myself I will defiantly be returning to support this local diner!! You guys rock! I'm sorry you all had to deal with such crappy childish people! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"So been coming here for quite a while... Food is good.. Service is hit and miss... But tonight the service was horrible... I cannot believe this waitress(ceci)has a job!!!! The worst service from any restaurant in a long time. On a good note... Bus Boy Michael was outstanding.. Saw I was frustrated, notified the manager and made sure I had everything I needed.. The first time... The waitress had to be told a minimum of three times on everything... Not very busy so no good excuse except incompetent at her job. I think they need to promote Michael and demote Ceci!  I tipped Michael quite well.. As far as Ceci.. Here's your tip... Find a new line of work and don't eat yellow snow!"}
{"text":"I was excited when my row mate on the plane told me that Popo's had opened a second location taking over an old Garcia's. I was totally bummed that this Popo's was kind of poopy compared to the original one in Maryvale.   I ordered a cheese crisp and it was so sad I almost cried. The chicken taco was decent and the rice and beans were the requisite decent as were the chips and salsa. What totally sucked was the fact that their \"guacamole\" is something green (not real avocado mixed with sour cream). False advertising and I can just imagine what any lactose intolerant person would have to deal with if consuming this (thankfully, not one of my issues). I managed to order a couple of sides of avocado slices, some lemons and used their decent salsa to make my own guacamole. I grew up on Arizona Mexican food. This was not right on so many levels-except for our server who was adorable and accommodating."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place 5 stars. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is really nice however to service is terrible. The wait staff is so slow. We were sitting for 15mins before we were asked for our drink order which wasn't even our waiter but a bus boy. When we finally were able to order the food came out pretty quickly but trying to get our bill and pay it was a fiasco. I do recommend this place but be prepared for a lengthy stay."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Me and my wife have been clients since we where children. Recently the service has been unbelievably horrible. Last night we visited the restaurant and there was no one at the front door to sit us down. We waited with another 3 parties for like 8 minutes. After going into the back of the restaurant all the employees where sitting behind the bar counting their tips. It only went down hill from there. I had to get up several times for drink and salsa refills. On top of that they start cleaning next to us stirring up dust into our plates.  If the owner is reading this my advise is hire new staff. The Asian girl who claims to be a manager is horrible. All she says is I'm sorry sir."}
{"text":"For the most part, I really like their  food. However, I went there this past weekend and ordered some of the guacamole with my meal. It tasted stale/old and I mentioned it to my waitress. Instead of taking it off the table (I did not eat it) and taking it off my bill, she came back to explain that the kitchen said that it all depended on the quality of the avocados from day to day and that I had the bad luck of getting the bad avacodos. Not her exact words, but her sentiment.  Wrong answer! Her tip reflected it.  I will be hesitant to go back in the near furture and will definitely not have the guacamole again, which is an upsale because I always order extra with my meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. We don't eat out much because I am a very good cook and typically just cook at home because it tastes better and saves money... But Popos... I couldn't stop going here! Their chips and salsa is the best around (and I've been to all Mexican restaurants) plus it's free! I always get a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style, the portions are huge so I always have a nice lunch for the next day. I'm vegetarian except for their tacos LOL.. I don't eat any other meat, but when I tried to stop eating their tacos it made me sad. So I caved in. Their beef tacos are so delicious! The atmosphere isn't my favorite but it's not bad. They did just redo the front waiting area, but being in AZ most people don't sit outside in the heat so that was kind of silly.. I do and would highly recommend Popos!"}
{"text":"The original is better. Food was ok.Sat at the bar and service was ok nothing to brag about. Won't be back to this one. Original only."}
{"text":"I grew up next to the original in Maryvale, this Bell location just enlarged their patio and now needs a BETTER happy hour........Nothing goes better with salsa than a great Margarita or Draft Beer......fave is Enchiladas with egg.........."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really great atmosphere.  The chips and salsa were very good.  Our waiter was so friendly and was always smiling.  The chili con queso appetizer was delicious.  Would definitely recommend it!  We weren't crazy about our entrees.  I had a taco and a flauta.  They were good, but nothing to write home about.  My husband had the enchiladas and only ate a couple bites of them before calling it quits.  He said he wasn't a fan of the red sauce.  Our waiter was nice enough to take his meal off our bill, which we really appreciated!  Overall, great service, great atmosphere, and mediocre food."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant in Arizona this place is really good. Its truly an American version of Mexican food, but the taste factor is very well executed. Kudos to the management staff, Your service staff is truly on its game."}
{"text":"Still the best Mexican in the Phoenix area by far. Family owned and local since opening 50 years ago. Went to the Westside location and the Bell location recently and both are still awesome. If you don't like PoPos, you're probably a fan of Filabertos and Taco Bell"}
{"text":"I grew up going to the original PoPo's and looked forward to trying the north location. Boy what a disappointing experience.  1. For our three children, we ordered 3 cherry sprites. They came out in small glasses. We asked for a refill for each. Much to our surprise, when we received our bill, they charged for each drink $2.85 for a total of $17.10. The waiter didn't tell us refills were not free nor did they provide the drink in a normal soda glass. When I pointed out this to my server, he could of cared less and used the excuse that one time someone got offended when they explained the drinks didn't come with refills. He didn't offer to reduce the charge and work with us even though we had ordered 6 dinners and an app. Such a bad experience. We could have bought 3-4 bottles of grenadine for what we were charged 2. Food quality was not what we were used to. My carna Asada was extremely salty. I've never said that about any food in my life. It was 5x the salt that was needed. In addition the chips were not as fresh as we've had at the original location every time nor were they warm which is the standard. The seafood enchilada is as bland as could be 3. Service was NOT good. We asked for items and didn't receive them (salsa, water refills, hot sauce, etc..). Our table was stacked with dishes and the server or his helper did nothing about this when they came to the table.   I paid the bill, left a 15% tip and then went and told the floor manager how bad this was. They seemed frustrated with our experience but offered no way to address. But then again, I made it clear this would be my last time.   Not worth the money or the time. Sad to say"}
{"text":"The hostesses are not the best kinda feel it's a bother you even walked in. But Diego our server was great fast friendly and good. I'm happy we got his section."}
{"text":"Visited this place last week when my folks were in town,  It's an older style family restaurant, I ordered some carnitas tacos and a Chile relleno. The tacos were ok, the Chile relleno was good, and their rice was excellent, really enjoyed it.   I was terribly sick about a half an hour after leaving the restaurant and it lasted a day and a half. By sick I mean making sure a bathroom was within running distance.  Wish it didn't happen, but that's life. Won't be going back. :("}
{"text":"Been coming to Popos for 2 years but have been coming to this location for a few months. So far so good :) if your not sure what to get I recommend the chicken chimichanga."}
{"text":"First time I ate here I had a bad experience because the waitress was new. I have been here at least 10 more times and love it. Food is always good. Salsa is delicious. Service is fast. Hostesses are friendly! And I'll be eternally grateful for them returning a lost ipad my toddler dropped under the table. There's different areas to sit depending on atmosphere you want, so it can fit anyone's needs"}
{"text":"Not bad! I've been here a few times for their $1 beef taco lunch specials. Some days the beef is more flavorful than others, but it's never bad. Great portions and you always get chips and salsa which is nice. I've walked out of here paying $6  for my meal (4 tacos) + tip and left full and happy. This place gets a little busy around lunch time, but they do the best they can to serve you as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Usually enjoy this place, but this time food was undercooked and they must have changed the beans. Was disappointed since I recommend this place. Hopefully the kitchen staff just had an off day."}
{"text":"Great service, food came with huge portions. Only thing is the restaurant has very poor ventilation. When you walk in the restaurant, you can immediately smell the deep fryer. Imagine walking out after eating and your hair and clothes smelled like \"fried oil\".  Try sitting outdoor next time."}
{"text":"Well I went in with low expectations for a Mexican chain restaurant and actually had to further lower my expectations. Their chips and salsa are good. Their enchiladas taste like the sauce was dumped from a can, tacos were greasy and the lettuce on it was brown. Why do crummy restaurants bring their food out on such hot plates?...Because the nasty stuff just sits under a heat lamp drying out. Their rice and beans were far from authentic. So bottom line is gross and WAY over priced. Waitress was attentive until she pushed our check super fast in our face and then disappeared. They, I guess, are like every other gross Mexican chain restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"Last night I went to popos I usually have a good experience but last night I did not. I order the taco platter and they only gave me my tacos and forgot the rice and beans. I didn't realize till I got home since I did take out. I won't be returning for awhile $10 for 3 tacos that isn't right..."}
{"text":"This is the go-to for a casual date or night with the family. Outstanding decor, well-presented meals and something for everyone--even my picky nephew got chicken nuggets.  The chicken tortilla soup is a favorite. Others: the lime chicken salad, the chims, and the fried ice cream  All of the specialties are big servings, but not big enough to forgo the margerita.   The service is nothing to write home about,  but go for the food."}
{"text":"Been eating at this restaurant for over 30 years (between both locations). Pricing is good, atmosphere is great. BEST Mexican food in the valley!"}
{"text":"Good service with mediocre food. Chips and salsa were good, wasn't offered any hot sauce though. I ordered carne asada tacos which were served to me at room temperature. The flour tortillas tasted like a cheap store bought version. My boyfriend got the fish tacos and he said by the looks and taste they were made with frozen fish fillets. So many better options in the area. This was our second time here and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Last night me, my wife and two children went to PoPos for dinner which we do frequently. We go there at least every other month or so for a couple years now. When we first started going there they had the best food and service for reasonable prices. Place was never crowded and you left as full as could be. Me and my wife could split a monster burrito for for 10 bucks. Delicious. But this past year or so the place took off. Good luck trying to get a table on a Friday night or Saturday night. It is always packed. Which is absolutely great to see. However last night was the worst experience I have had. They raised all their prices the monster burrito is now almost 13 dollars, the service was terrible. We saw our waitress 3 times once to order once to drop off food and the other time to give us the check. The busboy was very distracted with flirting with the hostesses. They charged us an extra 1.50 for a scoop of pico de gallo. I was so disappointed with one my favorite go to Mexican food restaurant  that I might not go back again."}
{"text":"Not too much for vegetarians so I ordered seafood (yeah yeah my very occasional seafood consumption technically makes me a pescatarian). The enchiladas were good but the beans, rice, salsa and chips were excellent! My hubby has been going there for 35 years and orders the same damn thing every time - shredded beef burrito. Solid fare; quick, polite service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We've come to Popo's for several years now, but tonight the food was terrible.  I thought the fish in my taco came from a fish stick box.  The beans were from a Rosarita can.  My son had a beef chimichanga, it was half onions and two small pieces of peppers.  This is NOT a very good restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, and nice people.  The machaca is great, and the salsa they serve with the chips is good.  Always a good lunch crowd, but you never have to wait long to be seated.  The restaurant could use an interior face lift.  Some of the booths are worn and a couple of light shades above dining tables are obviously cracked and broken.  A basic refurbishing would really go a long way.  At times the tables/booths are cleaner than other times.  Maybe it depends on whoever's bussing that day?  Overall, it's a decent place for lunch and dinner.  We go back whenever we're craving that machaca.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Been going to the original location on Indian School for a while but the new location is just as good. Waits were a bit long, even on a weeknight, but the service is friendly and the food was just the same. Unlimited salsa and chips, and the salsa actually tastes like someone made it rather than opening a jar."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  I used to go the the location on Indian school Rd. But this site of Bell Rd is so much closer to me now."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love their hot sauce and red chili. The tamales were good too."}
{"text":"Our platters were served on a very hot plate that kept our food warm.  The food was great but not memorable."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on Monday night and it was very busy. Luckily we didn't have to wait long but the bar is open seating with both tables and booths so you could always jump in there for a full service menu.  Our server was an older gentleman and he was amazing. He was super friendly and quick service and you could see he was busy jumping from table to table but smiling the whole time.   Food was good. I wouldn't say anything was amazing but we were happy with everything. My husband got a carne asada chimichanga and I got the pollo especial. Anything with that happened cream cheese on it is delicious!!!  It was my husbands birthday so they gave him a complimentary fried ice cream which was tasty.   Overall good and service was good and we will come back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pretty good dining.  I ordered a Taco Platter - 2 carne asada tacos and 1 fish taco.  I thought the fish in the fish taco had waaay too much breading.  The rest of the food items were typical of any large chain Mexican restaurant.  Lots of food, chips, salsa, which could have been spicier/hotter - was tame enough for small children, but I think adults prefer more kick.  Service was fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the price is amazing for the amount of food you get. I also love the patio upgrades that they did."}
{"text":"Has to be the best Mexican restaurant around. The salsa is terrific and you can even buy it for use at home. Nice and chunky and not too hot. Big portions and reasonable prices. Our new go to Mexican restaurant. Very roomy and nice patio and dining space."}
{"text":"Love the sea food enchiladas and the complimentary chips and salsa.. will go back again."}
{"text":"Bought a platter for a family gathering. Food was hot and fresh! Chips and salsa were great!  Everyone loved the variety of the platter:mini chimis, flautas,& mini tacos. Glad it was a easy clean up!:)"}
{"text":"I called in a simple go-to order of queso and hot sauce.  When I got home, 30 miles away, I realized I got salsa and not hot sauce.  It was very disappointing.  The next time I placed an order, I ordered the queso, a pint of hot sauce and a half pint of salsa.  What I got was spinach queso, a pint of salsa and a half pint of hot sauce.  It seems like it would be easy enough to get these orders correct, yet Popo's is 0 for 2.  I'll stick with the original location on Indian School."}
{"text":"I love eating at Popo's. The food is amazing-fresh, hot and delicious. We usually go for lunch. I ordered the Mexican style pizza with shredded beef. It arrived hot with melted Mexican cheese, tomato, green onions, peppers and black olives. My husband ordered the burro with shredded beef-enchilada style and beans and rice. The food was delightful. The service wonderful. Popo's has fantastic staff, who treat you right. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is good. But when you have things that you can't finish they do not give you any hot sauce or salsa it without charging you for it. That's ridiculous. Also the bar is very hot. It's 115° in Phoenix turn the air conditioning down please."}
{"text":"Have been to this place before, didn't feel it was full of frills but always good hot food and good service. Went there last night and could not have been more impressed with the new entrance and patio. Whoever your contractor was, they did not miss a beat! Give them a bonus! Misters, heaters, fire pits, fire bowls, air conditioning. Wow! I felt like I was in a Scottsdale \"esque\" venue and only had to drive to 59th ave. We were absolutely impressed. We felt like we were on vacation in your new space. Can't wait to come back. You're officially my new favorite mexican on the west side!"}
{"text":"Me and my family absolutely love this place! ever since 3 margaritas went down a few years back, we were looking for a good replacement for Mexican food. Their food is always piping hot, their drinks are good and prices are fair. My suggestion would be to get the spinach con queso or the spicy queso dip. They always come out hot. The flour chips can be a little on the raw side... The service here is kind of fickle. Usually we get good servers, but the last time we went here the guy wasn't as attentive and seemed... lost. The food is worth going back for again and again. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here so I give it 5 stars. Everything is delicious and quick to get to the table. On Tuesdays they do 99 cent margaritas. One of the better Mexican food joints. I prefer this location to the Indian School one."}
{"text":"My family and I just ate here and the food was not good at all. Just your average American style Mexican food restaurant. I would not recommend this place, nor would I come back."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Food wasn't very good; beans were extremely dry and burnt, tortillas were stale. Restaurant closes at 11pm, arrived with a party of 13 around 8:45pm and was treated as though we were causing an inconvenience to them. I'll stick to the 67th Ave location."}
{"text":"In the area looking for a nice patio style mexican bar/burrito,my friend and I sat at the bar. We were automatically greeted by this wonderful young bartender that was very patient with two old ladies, and took the time to recommend the best drinks and choices of what to eat. The service was excellent and would definitely recommend you coming to see Martin, the server/bartender that helped us out."}
{"text":"Yummi Tacos and great atmosphere. Came here with my Mexican buddies and I am in love with it. Must try out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We met some friends here for dinner while visiting Phoenix. Very glad we came here. I ordered the steak picado and it was perfect! Great chips and salsa and everything else was cooked perfectly. It's a pretty busy place and you will see why once you eat there."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped for dinner.   After waiting for a bit & watching others walk in after us & then be seated before us,  I was a little irritated.   I went up & said something to the girls & was seated almost immediately.   The table that we were seated at was sticky to touch.   We were seated very close to the other tables around us (not enough space between chairs).  But then to see what I think was ground beef on the table from the customers before us..........GROSS!  We are long time customers of Popo's, both restaurants.  If this is what we are gonna look forward to from your restaurant, then I think maybe we'll find another Mexican food restaurant to eat at!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointing. The only plus side of this whole experience is the portion sizes, that is if you are a big eater, which I am not. I ordered the Chicken Picado, and made sure to get the mild one with green chilis , but it still had fresh jalapeño. My mouth was on fire. When asking the server, he said that it was the green chilis but they must have thrown some jalapeños in there too. Wow. That meal, which I could only eat about 1/8 of due to the size and the heat, cost $14! My husband's ordered the Pollo Especiale. It was better than mine, but the chicken was dry. Not going back. Our lunch for 2, with no alcohol, cost $40."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times and loved this place. The last two times I've come there has been a hair in my food. I thought maybe it was just a one time thing so we came back again, there was a hair in not one but TWO things I ordered. In our appetizer and my margarita. I am completely turned off from this place I can't say I will be back."}
{"text":"We came to this place based on a recommendation from a family member who has been to the original location. We went there for happy hour but when we asked the server what the happy hour specials were, they didn't exactly know. It ended up being $3 for a 24oz. domestic draft, which is pretty good. There were no happy hour specials on food, but we ordered the Mary Lou from the appetizer menu. It was a quesadilla with red chile con carne. It was pretty good and definitely very filling but nothing spectacular. Overall, I would say that this place is just kind of forgetable."}
{"text":"Real good Mexican food. Have been to this location 3x's and their Phoenix location 2x. Good salsa and chips. They don't have hot though if that is what you like. Love the chicken tacos and the burritos. The service is very slow though. All 3x the service was not very good. Service at the Phoenix location is really good."}
{"text":"I always get a cheese crisp...so yummy!  Tonight we got fajitas to share and the flour tortillas were delicious!  We were able to get seated right away and our food came out quickly as well.  We'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Saturdays and Tuesdays are $1 Margarita days. (Oh and the food is really good too.)"}
{"text":"We adore PoPo's. I love going here because everything that we've had thus far has been pretty much perfect. The flour chips with the queso spinach dip are so effin' tastey and the shredded chicken is up there with the best ever. But there is one down side to at least this location...Manuel. He is a server that apparently hates his job or at least he hates the customers. His answer to what is the \"green sauce\" like was.... \"it's like the red but green\"............. This is on top of terrible service from him in general, l so if you go stay away from his section and you should be fine :-)"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is nice, could use some updating as far as remodeling. A little grungy. We ordered the 1 LB fajitas for two. Very good flavor but it should had more meats definitely not a pound and it must of had at least 1 LB of onions on the fry pan. The price of the meal is not good for what is served. We had three wraps a piece and the steak and chicken was gone. Then all we had was a giant heap of onions. Disappointed for sure. Not going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. My wife and I frequent it weekly. Great service, ice cold beer, tasty food. My one complaint is the Salsa. Now its always good and free...who complains about free, right. Its never consistent. For a few weeks its perfect a little spice and salty. Then all of a sudden its deathly hot with no flavor, then no spice at all and bland. We will always come but please fix the salsa issue."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a relaxing Sunday early dinner and we left Popo's VERY unfulfilled!  We like to visit new places and today we decided to try Popo's.  When we walked in the door we were given a bothered greeting from three individuals hanging out at the hostess stand.  Once seated, it took the waitress 10min to greet us and get our drink order and then another 10min to get delivered the drinks (ice tea).  We ordered the chille con queso dip which was delivered in a timely manner and was pretty good (I could tell it was made fresh from shredded cheese and not from a can) and we also really enjoyed the chips and salsa.  Granted, you have to ask for the hot salsa or they will only give you the regular salsa, so thank goodness I overheard the table next to us asking for hot salsa.  After the rough first impression we got, we were willing to put that aside and anticipated our entrees to be great since the app and salsa was.  Joke was on us, because the tables around us all got their food, paid, and left before our waitress came around to appoligize for the wait.  20min later... still no food, so we walked out after an hour and a half very dissapointed and we will not be returning to Popo's.  We will continue to go to Arriba's at Arrowhead mall because the service and food is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Nothing stood out to me.  Prices were good and lots of food, enchilada and taco were fine."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Popos! Their margaritas are the BEST! And strong!  my husband and I love this place! it's our go to for Mexican food! The service is always on point as well!"}
{"text":"Rude staff!    Rude hostess!  We generally go here once a month of so.   Well tonight they lost 20 customers.   Could not accommodate us and blamed us!    Snobby hostess came over and berated us twice.    Both times we asked her to go away and just stop talking.    Manager refused to come over and called the cops.   We were having a birthday party for a dear friend and we were never rude or in any way out of line.    Cop was super nice, asked us to please get out stuff and leave.   He made sure no one paid for food only the alcohol as we only got half of what was ordered.   And that half was messed up.     Shame on you popos!    Officer Gonzalez even advised that we find a new place to go and that he won't be eating there either!    If you decide to go, don't complain.  Don't ask for a manager.   Obviously he's afraid of customers!!!    Both Popos are off my list of restaurants.    I'll stick with Ajo Als or Top Shelf."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in town if I can't get to the southside! I loooveee Popo's. Extremely fresh, hot and flavorful!  Get the el pollo especial! To DIE for! Dont forget the strawberry margarita! Frozen!"}
{"text":"If your looking for extremely high sodium then eat here! The red sauce is thick like gravy with very little meat, then seasoned with high salt and possibly MSG !! HORRIBLE quality, wont be back. We all felt sick to our stomaches for hours after eating the small amount we were able to. Cheese seemed processed. Better off going to Arribas. Corn tortillas are rubbery and greasy! Nasty!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband really likes this place. This was where he wanted to go for his birthday. I am neutral about this place. It can be pretty good, but its not the freshest, most innovative mexican. There are not very many healthy options. Everything is very heavy, greasy, huge, and covered in cheese. Now this type of food can be appealing, especially if you had too many drinks the night before. I still like to find healthier dishes though, and it is hard here.  The service is friendly though. Be warned Peorians/Glendalians love this place and it can get pretty crowded so you might have a bit of a wait.   One thing I absolutely do not like is that most tables are raised, so the high chairs are either too low or have to be stacked on top of each other. They are also sticking out in the path of the waiters. Last time we went, a waiter carried a sizzling place of fajitas right over my babies head. OMG I almost had a heart attack and just kept her on my lap. It was so scary.   Basically, its like normal American style mexican food. I just feel that I am in Phoenix, and can get more legit mexican elsewhere."}
{"text":"this is my favoriteee place! always fresh food  and great customer service!!! PLUS they have the BEST margaritas at happy hour from 3-7pm ... must try!!!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Mexican food you can get in Phoenix.  THis location USED to be a Garcia's, and when it closed down, I was glad to see it remained a Mexican restaurant.  I had many happy memories there when it was Garcia's, from when I would come home and visit my family while on leave in the Army.    However, as PoPo's, the food is WAAAAYYY more improved!  They also have build out the patio and as much as I liked it when it was Garcia's I like it far more now as PoPo's!  Very good food, always friendly staff, and the portions are huge.  You will almost always end up asking for a take home bag or box.  Shredded beef tacos are awesome there, as are the chimis and chili rellano!"}
{"text":"We use to make the drive to the ghetto (67th and indian school) for their great food and now they have taken over a Garcia's in the burbs.  This place is always busy!  The food is your standard tasty mexican and prices moderate.  Much better than its former the Garcia.  Check it out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past couple years. The atmosphere is nice and they have a good size patio to enjoy at all but the hottest times. I would not consider the food \"authentic Mexican\" but the value of meals was good despite that ranging aroundgood $7-11.  Recently the menu changed and the prices increased $3-4 for almost everything it seems on the menu and everything is now $11-15... it's a bummer and I dont think I'll return for anything other than happy hour."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Americanized Mexican restaurant for the area. Our group of five was seated promptly (although it was very early, so no crowd yet.) Our server Manuel was very friendly and efficient, chips and salsa came out right away. I ordered a Fiesta Special which came on a big oval plate filled with refried, rice, and guac salad with a chili relleno and a machaca taco. The chili relleno was just OK, the shredded beef taco was delicious although could have used a little more beef. In all there was a lot of food on the table, they do not skimp on the portion sizes.   Negatives: not much of a Mexican beer selection at all, they had mostly lighter domestic beers. Also, there didn't seem to be any really hot sauce to be found; the salsa was very mild and the 'hot sauce' they brought when asked was barely medium. So if you are really into that, bring your own bottle of hot sauce to put on their great food."}
{"text":"I've only been here once myself, and I wasn't impressed. The service was great, staff was very friendly and helpful, we waited for nothing, even though they were pretty busy with the game 6 crowd.   We got chips and salsa right away, the salsa was fresh but kind of boring, we asked if they had any hotter salsa which they brought out right away. This honestly seemed less spicy than the original and tasted more like ketchup. Stick to the original.  My boyfriend ordered the taco grande which was huge and tasty by his account. another star. As a vegetarian I didn't have many options, the only beans they use are refried with lard, so I ordered the veggie fajita burro, enchilada style which sounded pretty great. Food came out quickly but I have to say my burrito was a little... Taco Bell? Sauce was bland, the burrito was a lot of puffy flour tortilla and the veggies were too large to be consumed. I ended up ditching the tortilla and chopping up my vegetables with lettuce and the house salsa. Would have been a pretty average experience if I hadn't gotten violently ill on the way home. Not sure if even the veggie burro is safe for vegetarians. Sorry Popo's, I really wanted to like you, but I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"First time trying this place since it's always so crowded & the parking lot is always full.  In spite of that, the wait was short & we were in & out in an hour!  Service was very fast...sat down, drinks were there within a minute or so as well as huge bowl of chips with good spicy salsa...ordered & food came very quickly...we got the bean & cheese burrito, carne asada taco plate, rice & beans (huge portions)....all very good but would have preferred the crunchy type taco shell. In spite of it the carne asada was wonderful & the flavor really came through when eaten on its own like an entree, putting the heavy layers of corn taco aside.  Their rice is the best I've had....usually don't eat rice, but I always try it & ate more than usual since it was so light, fluffy & nicely seasoned.  PoPo's isn't authentic Mexican if you're looking for that...it's more Mexican-American style, but very good & the service from front desk to the waiter & server was exceptional.  So fast & efficient we won't let the crowded parking lot or wait deter us anymore."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. This place looked dirty on the inside and had cheap chairs and decor. Our waiter spilled a lemonade on our table and just said 'opps. Now what would you like to order?' and was just going to leave it. We had to use all of our napkins to clean up his mess and then had to ask for additional ones from him without him offering. The food wasn't all that great and my mini chimis came out to the table cold. The whole time I was sitting there, I was just thinking 'What would Gordon Ramsey say about this place?' because it was just so ghetto. This place needs a major upgrade. On its decor and its food."}
{"text":"The absolute best thing about popo's is our bar tender Jeff! He is awesome. We never have an empty glass. And he is so fun and easy to talk to!"}
{"text":"Love Popo's! Awesome  authentic Mexican food. Huge portions. Great happy hour with margaritas and beer. Food and drinks are always consistently good. Will continue to make the drive from Anthem."}
{"text":"Well, first I love their ambiance.  Went with a group on Friday night, and the place was jumping with people and good vibes.  Not too loud, also, so I could hear my table companions. Their chips are fresh, thin and not greasy at all which is a super plus, and their salsa is spiced just right for me anyway (sorta on the medium side).  Loved that. I ordered the half order beef fajitas, which were just okay.  The two rings of green/red peppers weren't cooked at all which was surprising, since I never have had raw peppers with fajitas.  But they do serve a huge serving of caramelized cooked onions under the fajitas which was nice. The fajita meat, however, wasn't so hot, cause I had too much gristle in mine.  Yeah, that was really ladylike looking of me trying to wrangle a piece in two that was about 4\" long at the table...really?  Not cool at all PoPo's.  They need to buy better meat for sure. Everyone else seemed to be happy with their meals, and some of them were absolutely huge portions compared to what you normally get at a Mexican place. I would go back, but I wouldn't get the gristly, hard to chew fajitas again.  Maybe some nice spinach enchiladas next time is the ticket."}
{"text":"The original PoPo's location (on Indian School) was and continues to be immensely popular with my former work colleagues. Originally, based on my naive gringo standards, I embarrassingly considered PoPo's the best Mexican food in all of Phoenix! Thankfully, I've learned a thing or two since then.  Initially, I was glad this location opened up, as it's in a slightly less dangerous area that reduces the likelihood of me being shot or stabbed after sundown. The food and service are pretty consistent, which isn't really anything spectacular.  PoPo's falls under the \"dirty\" Mexican restaurant category in the sense that, you shouldn't really expect anything fancy. In the past, we've had stale chips, crumb-covered booths, and menus splattered with the prior guests' salsa droplets. These are things that you just kind of have to overlook.    I usually order their chimichanga. While good, I've found that the the chimi con queso at Carlos O'Brien's is a much more exciting way to enjoy this form of deep fried decadence. My girlfriend always orders enchiladas, but always winds up wanting them to taste much better than they actually do. Their rice and beans are just standard.  What I do like, strangely enough, is their fried ice cream on the dessert menu. Although not really a \"Mexican\" dessert per se, it's become a staple with Americanized Mexican cousine. You can blame the old Chi-Chi's chain for that. Anyway, we've had bad versions and good versions. PoPo's actually does it better than most, aside from a single botch job where they apparently forgot to bread the damned scoop!    Consistency, people! Get with it!  Most of these Mexican places on Bell Road are pretty average. PoPo's isn't really any different. But after expanding my boundaries in recent years, I no longer consider it to be one of the better options in Phoenix compared to its competitors."}
{"text":"There are so many great things to say about this Mexican restaurant. Not only is the authentic Mexican food great, but the people, prices, and environment. I go here at least once a week, and if I can talk my husband into it, then on occasion twice a week. On weekends they serve the best tastes menudo you've had. They have happy hours that beat prices just about everywhere else you go. We've gotten to know one of the servers, Jose who I rate the best at Popo's! He goes above and beyond for his customers, and truly cares to get to know you. I recommend asking for him when you go, because you should really go!"}
{"text":"Basic mexican food. It wasn't anything special but it wasn't horrible either. We always come here when we are in the area cause there isnt a another option for mexican. The machaca tacos and hotter salsa are good."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm one of those that hit the original Popo's on Indian School circa 1979 or so  (remember the Meat Block butcher in that area? How about DoubleWheel, Skagg's, and Luckys!)   Anyway - we'd long since left that area and relocated North.   When I saw the Popo's replacing the Garcias on Bell Road - well, I was ecstatic to say the least.     Long story, short:  Went to the new Popo's religiously for about a year or so.  That is, until we had an incident with long hair in the salsa.   I'm not going to rip them for that - it happens, I understand, we're all humans.  However, mentally, it ruined the restaurant for me.  I can't eat there for the time being.    Perhaps one day I'll get that detailed image out of my head and go back (and if I do, I'll edit this review and make further notes if I can).  But until then I will still recommend it to others because that incident, while traumatic, was the only issue I've ever had at Popo's.    The shredded beef is seasoned quite well (un-like Macayo's no-flavor shredded beef tacos).  Shredded beef Chimi's were good (but see my other reviews for my true fave).    Shredded beef tacos were good as well (I can eat 3 in one setting - oink!)"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I order the mini chimi appetizer as a meal. It's the perfect size. And omg don't get me started on their frozen margaritas... AMAZING! Every flavor is bomb! I LOVE that they're huge and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Been to this location more than a few times and never disappoints! Got just the rolled chicken quesadilla! And was very good as usual. One of my go to restaurants. Starts off with that bomb a** chips an salsa that they keep filling up! Omg so good!! Only down fall is i couldnt taste any alcohol in my alcohol!!!!!!! Waiters seem to be real busy cause the bus boys seem to be the one refilling your drinks and chips an salsa!! Staff always seem so nice but busy!! Always a good spot!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was good. Came out quickly and super hot. The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the ground was pretty filthy. Lastly, don't come here if you want a relaxing dinner. Very loud environment, and tables are close together. Fun place to go though!"}
{"text":"We were there today around 2:30 and sat in the open bar area on the patio as the dining area was busy. It was our first time eating here and we will definitely be back! My husband had the Carne Asada Burrito and he said it was really good. I'm not as big a fan of Mexican food as my husband so I always just ask for a plan Chicken and Cheese Quesadilla and our waitress was very accommodating and left off the pico de gallo. ( my quesadilla was the rolled kind) Melina our waitress was very attentive and came over to make sure that my food was okay and that I liked how the quesadilla was made as usually it comes with the pico de gallo mixed in. It was very good and they didn't skimp at all on the chicken! Another lady came over a little later asking if I liked the quesadilla ( not sure if it was a cook or ?) Melina was very friendly and very attentive making sure we had everything we needed! Would definitely recommend this place! Food was great, good sized portions, chips and salsa very good!"}
{"text":"Met up with some people for happy hour and had an OK time.   First the Good: Their happy hour is 7 days a week! And the usual free chips and salsa! The decor is appropriate and they have TVs for watching sports.   The Bad: its kinda just the same greasy Mexican food that everyone else offers. And even though they were showing sports, they had a Hockey game on the speakers, the game ended and they still kept the sound on, so we heard the boring after show and then they let it run for some fixing up cars show that almost put me to sleep. And last, the service was very polite but not very attentive, we found ourselves asking for things like water multiple times. And we had an exact party of 6 so they added a gratuity and never told us about it, we are pretty good tippers but it's kinda irritating when you try to slip another one in.   Overall I would only go back if I were meeting up with someone there, I have a Valle Luna even closer to me and its the same place pretty much so, I have that to look forward to."}
{"text":"Finally...a delicious Mexican food place that seats more then 10. The food is soooooo so good. Every time we go we have something new and it's always hot and fresh. Also their margarita selection is outstanding. I am a regular customer now and so is my whole family."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've received in a long time! Waiter did not pay attention to me when I was ordering so of course my order was wrong. They brought it out a second time still wrong then an additional waiter wanted to argue with me about the situation and the manager is too busy to address the situation. Completely unacceptable! I will never come back and will recommend to all my friends in the area to avoid as well.  UPDATE:  Mr. PoPo came to my table and addressed the situation. Completely changed my opinion of this place. Good save Mr. PoPo. Thanks for your time and rectifying our situation."}
{"text":"I have been getting more food at Popos recently as I settled on them being the best Mexican food in the area.  There are quesadillas at Cafe Rio. But those are not as good as the Rolled Quesadilla here. The meat is better here and the tortillas are better - even the sour cream is better here lol. It does cost more at Popos but it's worth it in my opinion.  The carne asada burrito is pretty affordable here at $7.75. You can get burritos from places like: Pollo Loco, Cafe Rio, Mixteca, etc for a similar price. It's way better here. This burrito doesn't have weak fillers like beans and rice.. it just has guacamole and pico de gallo. The way it should be ;) plus the meat and tortilla are better here.  I've been doing carry out more which has been quick and easy. They seem to be ready within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"More like just-OK, came here today after hearing good things about it the other day from some friends that love the downtown location.  The atmosphere was the same casual look of Garcias and the service was very good as well.  The food though was just OK and maybe I was disappointed from all the hype.  I ordered a pollo fundido (called something else though) and my wife had a combo which included tamale, tostada, & enchilada.  My fundido was pretty good but Carolos Obriens still blows it away and my wifes tamale was a little dry and she wasn't impressed with the tostada or enchilada either.  It's hard to say if we will be back since Macayos is so close to this location and that is just slightly better than this place.  I was still tempted to make the drive to Carlos Obriens the whole time i was here.  Salsa was just OK also, but i asked for hot sauce and they brought me some pretty good stuff that mixed well with the salsa."}
{"text":"So disappointed, no longer our go to place.  No ambience, no authentic Mexican and I would love to return the hair they put in our dishes. My family member took a bite and stopped to pull out a long piece of hair in her mouth."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner for Thanksgiving Eve. Delicious Santa Fe salad with Chicken and Cilantro Lime dressing. Good cheese quesadilla. Outstanding steak fajitas with all the fixings. Sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole, cheese, lettuce. Fast service. Our order was correct."}
{"text":"Chris is a great bartender and server. Never disappoints. Food is old fashioned authentic Mexican Food. Great happy hour and friendly atmosphere! Viva Popo's!!!"}
{"text":"Uggh.  From the start, we should have gone somewhere else.  But my brother likes this place, and we did eat here once before (years ago) without a problem.  \" 5 minutes\" is what we were told, to wait for our table. 15 minutes later we got it. \"Can I get you anything to drink\" and then we rattled off our drink orders and she says our waitress will have to come get that for us as she stared at us with a dear in the headlight look.    Then the 1st waitress came and got drink orders, lost again, then our real waitress came and got our drink orders and again she was lost.  \"Margaritas on the rocks, salt, Cuervo,\" is what she was told 3 times.  \"You want a margarita with side shot of Cuervo\" she asked twice.    And we hadn't even gotten to the food yet...  I really wanted Mexican food.  Living in Hawaii, I don't get good Mexican food.  Guess I don't in Arizona either.  Nobody finished their plate.  My enchilada verde was not green.  It had no sauce on it at all.  Or maybe it had evaporated from sitting under the heat lamps on the line while waiting for the rest of my tables food.  Because the cheese on my beans was browner than the beans.  Got to find a new Mexican joint to eat at for next time we visit."}
{"text":"We're addicted to this place. We eat here at least once a week.  Great service. Great food."}
{"text":"Your typical Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, but it was pretty good. We sat in the bar and our server was excellent. The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had. The regular salsa was full of flavor and not watery, while the hot salsa was just hot enough, but not over powering.   We split the steak fajitas. I would have liked a better mix of onions and peppers, instead of mostly onions. The corn tortillas were really good! I am normally not a huge fan of corn tortillas, but these were different. We were both craving black beans, but unfortunately they are not on the menu.   Overall, great place if you have a craving for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the original location as far back as I can remember... I do think it's slightly better than the one on Bell but it's super close to my mom's house so when we visit we go here. The food is decent... Drinks are good. Portions are big... I always have left overs."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night..The food was awesome, best meal we've had at this location since it opened. Had the green chili burro tasted amazing and very tender...Wife had tostada, taco dinner, excellent! Frankie was our server and he did a great job. Only one complaint, the back ground music was a tad loud.."}
{"text":"Outstanding service by Gabriel! We were promptly greeted and served our drinks at the bar. We ordered tacos and a cheese crisp, which came out quickly. We will definitely be back to PoPo's. Request Gabriel!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Popos how I love thee...let me count the ways. Awesome chips and salsa and friendly service.  But it's the seafood enchiladas that make this place my favorite restaurant.   They are the best I've ever had.  Just spicy enough and not fake crab meat tadting like so many others.  My little one enjoys the chicken tacos and hubby always orders something different but especially loves the cheese enchiladas.  My in laws celebrate everything here because the food is so great.  Mexican food is my favorite and I litterally ate her weekly when I was pregnant.   My favorite restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Went to Popo's last night with the family for dinner and bowling on 59th ave and Bell. Despite my sisters warning me they got sick the last time they ate here I figured I had never got sick in the past and thought it was good Mexican food. Silverware came out with food still on it my daughter told me to not be that customer who complains but it the knife was gross I was hushed up because it \"was probably just water spots\" and to not say anything. Skipped bowling afterwards as we were not up to it after our meal. Next day (today New Years 2018) SICK!!!! I feel terrible for ever suggesting to eat there and will NEVER EVER again. If I can save at least one family or even one person from what this place might do to their insides with this review you're welcome!"}
{"text":"I have to admit my husband and I are almost weekly regulars. We first started going here because of their prices being so much more reasonable then our usual Ajo Al's down the street. But, we have been pleasantly surprised with their food. We usually get their \"complete\" meal and eat enough chips and salsa we almost take the whole meal home and then it feeds us both a big lunch for the next day. Chips and salsa are some of the best and you can't beat their bucket of five domestic beers for $10.00.  We almost paid that for two beers at the other place. I am sure we will be regulars for along time to come."}
{"text":"great tex mex mexican food! the area it is around does not look promising but it is worth trying it out."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and the salsa that comes with the chips is fresh and delicious. My server Craig was so nice and thoughtful; I appreciated him. Diane and Susan were very sweet. Restrooms are very clean which I always notice where ever i go!"}
{"text":"It is ok. Food is good not great. Prices are average. All and all very average in all respects."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is very bad. I was ready to take my food Togo and the lady that is cleaning dusted the carpet with a broom and the dust went on my food. So disrespectful first time visiting this restaurant and they can't wait to clean when there is no customers present food is expensive and not even worth it. Expensive food and bad service this place deserve a 1 star."}
{"text":"Came in on St Paddy's day with family and friends.    It's deserving of it's 3.5 star review.   Average food.  The wait staff seems polite enough  I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again but if I was in the vicinity and starving may drop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I think I am going to coin a new term for this type of \"mexican\" food: WASP-Mex.  It's where restaurants take mexican food and what they think is Mexican decor and put an anglo spin on it.   I know some people like it and that's ok for them, but for an authentic experience Phoenix and the rest of the valley offer so much more.  When I went I had a green chicken enchilada and taco. The flavor was bland and lacked other seasoning too. The green chiles tasted canned, the corn tortilla was tough, and the taco was greasy.  It was just not good.  I find it sad because Mexican food has so many regional varieties and wonderful types of cuisine to choose from, but this type of restaurant really bastardizes the food and flavors that deserve to be among some of the world's best cuisines."}
{"text":"I took the whole family there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and there was about a 20 minute wait to sit down.  Figured it was a good thing that we were not the only ones there.  The chips and salsa were good and the waitress was super busy but still took good care of us.  We all ordered some form of chimichanga and they were all good.  They messed up my order and brought me beef instead of chicken which was ok because the beef had a little kick to it.  The kids had minichimis beef and chicken and they had no complaints.  We will definateley be going back.  Maybe next time we will take advantage of happy hour."}
{"text":"I love this place. Had family in from California and took them here. They loved it, and there is some really good Mexican food in Cali."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was \"eh ok\" we asked for chips and salsa to go with our to go order and they said no we don't do that. We had to ask twice for plates and silverware and took sometime before we got our beverages. We like the food...just didn't have a good dine in experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Popo'ssevera times and alsways sit in the bar area, which is perfect for happy hour and a frosty beverage. The food is pretty good and the staff is always friendly. Not sure if I would go here for anything other then happy hour or a casual drink or bite to eat. Fun place to watch a game and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We ate an early dinner at Popo's after a Spring Training baseball game at Maryvale Park.   We arrived at about 4:00 p.m., which was a good thing because the parking lot was almost full and there was only a short wait to be seated.     It was a Saturday, and thus Popo's served .99 cent margaritas with dinner.   Each of us had a specialty salad, complete with sliced meat (chicken or beef) and sliced avocados.   The salads were fresh and plentiful.   They were delicious.   Our server was prompt and attentive and we finished our dinners by 5:30 p.m.  To top it all, our meal came to only $23.00 plus the tip - an almost unheard of price for dinner these days.  The fine quality of Popo's food and their prices showed in the many people who were already eating at Popo's when we arrived.   We don't hesitate to recommend Popo's to anyone who wants fine Mexican food at affordable prices.  Popo's is located in a reasonably safe neighborhood on West Indian School Road.   We will eat there again when we next visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today at lunch with a huge group. The service was quick and professional, chip bowls and drinks were never empty. The chips and salsa were delicious! I had the southwest salad with shrimp and was content. I'd love to try a burrito there....everyone at the table loved their food!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mexican food. Whether it's from a hole in the wall place, Chipotle (this is somewhat Mexican right?) or a fancy place, I can always find something that I will really enjoy. My personal Popo's favorites are their margaritas, enchiladas and chips/salsa. Margarita's during Happy Hour end up being less than 4 bucks and come in a bunch of different flavors! Prickly Pear is a good one as is the Strawberry. The portion sizes of the enchiladas are outta control. The enchilada meals come with 2, and if you think you want a third, I applaud you. Machaca and chicken are my two personal enchilada favorites. My friends also really enjoy the fajitas and the chimichangas.   Last but not least, my favorite thing at Popo's has to be their chips and salsa. These are complimentary and the salsa is CRACK. It is also bottomless essentially so the staff are always refilling them for you. So good!  All in all. I really enjoy Popo's. The wait CAN be long at times, especially on the weekends but I think it's worth it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This food is most excellent and the greatest service you could asks for. Very comfortable atmosphere. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We entered on a Monday night. Its appearance is tired. The bar was pretty full.  We waited and finally had a waiter.  All the time we were there (5:00pm), we felt like they wanted us to take the food and eat it in the parking lot.  At one point the waiter actually threw our desert on the table and ran back some place. He was obviously taking care of too many tables, and not doing a good job of it.  To say the food was bad, isn't exactly right.  The cheese crisp was soggy and needed a few more minutes, the tacos needed to be crispy, the tostada was too wet to pick up.  The red chili burro tasted sort of like the chili had not been cooked out and was  chalky. The margaritas are made with a mix.  The best part was the salsa.  That was really good. We wanted to get some to go, but it just didn't happen. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place smells terrible & I didn't enjoy the food at all. Very disappointed & am still trying to find good Mexican food. Great salsa though. Just looks like it needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times with this being my second check in. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Saturdays and Tuesdays are $1 Margarita special.  I personally prefer the one on Indian School it feels homier. But this place still rocks!"}
{"text":"Crowded, loud, and long wait. Surprise, 30 minute wait turned into just 15.  Good fresh chips and salsa. Strawberry margarita was weird, but tasty. Servers were extremely busy, but food and drinks came out without undue delay. First the food was very tasty. For me, a good line between that fancy spicy and bland chain stuff. Balanced flavor over spice, tasty. My meal: beef machaca enchilada, machaca taco, plain ole tostada. Tostada: I can't put my finger on it but somehow they made a plain food item tasty. Must be the way the tortilla was cooked before it was stacked, well done. Machaca taco: big and fat, with tasty shredded beef. Another home run. Machaca enchilada: Holy crap, this thing was almost as large as most other restaurant's chimis. And it was full of shredded machaca beef, no fillers. The machaca is lightly flavored, so you are not overwhelmed by heat or spices. You get to actually taste the beef! I never eat enchiladas out, but I now have a new favorite. One Star Carlos Obriens on Happy Valley could learn a lot from this place."}
{"text":"The quality of service has definitely gone up since it first opened. The best meat by far is their machaca beef. The fajita burrito is excellent as well! Great traditional salsa but the hot salsa is basically chili sauce and lacks flavor."}
{"text":"Service was slow and slightly rude. Food came out cold but waited 25 minutes so didn't send it back. Server was friendly but needed lots of help. Would not come back. First and last time here."}
{"text":"A Sunday family luncheon took me to Popo's Fiesta Del Sol - Maryvale (6542 West Indian School Road, Phoenix, AZ 85033). While waiting for our food to be prepared, my family enjoyed the toasty corn chips and lively salsa. An avid fan of comfort food soups, I ordered the highly recommended menudo, which came with a choice of flour or corn tortillas. The spicy, red soup was loaded with delicious hominy and tender meat and was made complete by adding the provided garnishes of oregano and fresh cilantro and onion. (Note- The menudo was listed on the menu as being available only on Saturday and Sunday.) The affordably-priced food was delivered in a timely manner and piping hot. Ample parking was available on both the front and back lots. The facilities were clean, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Holy buckets this place is delicious!  I've been here three times now and every time, no matter what I order, I am very pleased with the meal.  Every dish is delicious and the portions are large for the price you pay.  Service is either good or great...never poor.  All in all, great atmosphere, good people, and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome.   But the service in the bar is horrible.   One bartender to take care of bar, cantina portion of restaurant, while manager and waiters spend there time joking and watching the game."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Place was crowded-good sign.  My pops has been going there for years, so it must be good.  Salsa and chips were good, best in PHX so far.  The meals were huge, everyone is taking a box home.  Prices are fairly cheap, not too bad.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Places needs more servers or a better way to take care of their busy times. I sat in the bar to avoid the 30 min wait for a table. Mistake! One server was handling the full bar and patio. We all suffered. When the manager was approached by another customer, she seemed unaware of what was going on. She did approach tables to ask about the wait and acted accordingly, so that was good.  I think the food is decent. Be honest, after awhile all basic Mexican food pretty much tastes the same. Beans are beans. Rice is rice. Seriously? If someone took the pictures from various Mexican restaurants at this level (Gracias,Macayos etc) and asked you to match the dish to the restaurant, we'd all probably fail."}
{"text":"Good restaurant and cheaper than other mexican places. One thing they could improve on is not over heating the food"}
{"text":"It's 6:50pm on Saturday November 28th. This is the single worst service I've ever had. We've had to ask for everything multiple times, from water to salsa. Our waiter came to our table three times total: to get drinks, to get food order, and to clear plates. One of the things that got missed since he didn't check on us once our food came out, was that one of our plates was chicken instead of the beef that had been ordered. Verbatim conversation:  Us: \"So we sat around waiting for awhile, and my food was wrong, but I couldn't flag anybody down. So I eventually just ate it. Waiter: \"Do you want me to take it off your bill?\" Us: \"That would be nice.\" Waiter: \"Well you took a bite so I'll get you some sort of discount, but I can't just zero it out.\"  So why'd you bring it up?  Disinterested, slow, unhelpful. We can just order this food to go, you know.  Edit: I wrote this review while waiting for the check to come, that's how long it took. In the meantime we complained to a manager and they took the incorrect food off the bill. They apologized for the waiter not checking on how our food was, and he was honest enough to tell his manager that he hadn't. It helps, but that should have been done without hassle. And, ideally, they come over after the food comes out and catch their mistake."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. The service was quick and the food tasty. The lunch menu is very limited and with an iced tea the meal was over $10 before tip. It is however one of the few restaurants in the area where you can have a sit down lunch and be back at the office within an hour."}
{"text":"The cheese crisp is bomb.com. Chimichangas and enchiladas are also good."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was!  Every time we have tried to come here there is a serious wait to get in. I would suggest making reservations. We finally decided to stick it out and wait because Popo's is so close to our house and we needed a good Mexican restaurant!  I'm so glad we did! My husband inhaled the chips and salsa; our poor waiter had to bring chip refills about 5 times. They were delicious! I ordered the combo plate with the Green Chicken Enchilada and Chicken Taco (with rice and beans). So much food for such a great price! And all so good! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I can't wait to go back and try something new... or I might have to order the same thing because it was amazing   We left with happy bellies and a happy wallet!"}
{"text":"Will give this one star only because we can't give it zero. Terrible service, Mediocre food .. the waiter shoved a hot fajita pan into my daughters hand while trying to hurry and fro food at our table and then he NEVER even asked how she was or offered to get her ice or looked at (he hand immediately blistered)  Took more than 15 minutes to get a couple of glasses of water..   Just. Awful!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Oregon.  Came in for dinner.  Service was just okay.  We had to ask for silverware to eat our meals.  Of the 5 things we ordered, the taco pizza was the best!  Next would be the street tacos and Spanish rice.  Fun entrance and outdoor area.  Also has an open air bar!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always had a pleasant experience here. 99¢ Margaritas during their Happy Hours and their fajitas were delicious. Chips and salsa are always delicious too. The only thing I would give as feedback to the staff is to take orders a little better and more frequently - I ordered a frozen margarita, got an iced margarita and I wanted to get more than one but by the time the waiter came back to our table to check on us my husband and I were ready to go. Other than that I really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Yay went here on Father's day. Love the service loved the food. The salsa was perfect hot but not too runny. The hot sauce was good too. Had 6 of us eat and only $60.00 perfect setting for us for Father's Day. We go back often. Tried the chicken taco grande will try the chicken enchilada's next my youngest said they were really good."}
{"text":"Great Reverse Happy Hour - Salsa and hot sauce very good. Try the Mary Lou cheese crisp, red or green, both delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are new customers here but think that the food is great and especially love the chips and salsa!! Their chicken enchiladas are amazing!! They seem a little over priced for what you get but it is good quality food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night with my best friend Bree and shared the starters of the platter and bean dip and it was plenty for the both of us. Had an amazing server Diana and she kept conversation was attentive, polite and made our experience worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone was so friendly, and everything was so clean.  Even the leaves in the plants were dusted. Clean clean place.  The food was amazing.  Couldn't finish it though.  Waiter was very prompt and informative. I had the combo platter 2. And the honey deep fried ice cream.  My fiancé ordered the fajitas, and they came out sizzling up a storm.  The spicy bean dip is also worth checking out.  But mind you it's a meal all on its own. Big! Defiantly will come back here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his grandmother, and I decided to go to lunch last Tuesday. She agreed on Mexican cuisine and chose Popo's Fiesta Del Sol Mexican Food in Glendale, AZ. We walked into the restaurant at 11:58 am and were greeted by the hostess. She confirmed our party was of 3 and we inquired about a booth which she was happy to accommodate. We were seated right away, free chips and salsa were brought out to us, and the restaurant seemed very busy. Our server approached us within two minutes of being seated and asked for our drink orders. My boyfriend's grandmother asked for an iced tea, I asked for water, and my boyfriend asked for a coke. The server asked if we would like lemon in our water and iced tea. He brought the drinks out very quickly and asked if we were ready to order. We told him we needed a few more minutes to decide. He was very friendly and smiled a lot.   My boyfriend's grandmother ordered the pork carnitas ($13.85), my boyfriend ordered the seafood enchiladas ($14.65), and I ordered a chicken chimichanga ($9.55). Each of our orders came with a side of rice and beans. We waited for about 15 minutes, and our food still hadn't arrived when our server approached the table. He explained that our seafood enchilada dish was taken by another server by accident because they assumed it was a spinach enchilada dish for their table. He said they were remaking the seafood dish for us right away. We asked if he could bring our other two meals out so they wouldn't get cold while waiting. He said yes, disappeared into the kitchen for about 5 minutes, and then came back with all 3 of our orders.   Our food was decent though a little cold from the mix-up. The meals were large so we each used take-home boxes to save our leftovers. Our total before tip was around $40. We paid and left at about 1:30 pm. At this time the restaurant seemed empty from the lunch rush being over. We took a few complimentary candies from the hostess booth up front. I noticed a hostess sitting behind the booth on the ground using her cell phone. Overall it was a nice lunch with a few hiccups. I would recommend this restaurant to others and will probably visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Food has definitely gone down hill, everything is overly salty. Music is too loud, you feel like you have to eat to the beat of the fast songs. Gives me anxiety. Phoenix location is way better. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Community place, family owned and Authentic Mexican food. Great Happy Hour specials. I'm not a huge appetite person for me it's always the kids plate which is a perfect size or the appetizer as a meal."}
{"text":"We like this place. For the price, it is outstanding. We have always have super good service! They have daily specials, so check their website for the details.  I love their rice! Their salsa is very good as well. Their portions are generous.   Yep. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and this place is wonderful. The Chimichangas dinner with Machaca is great. Friendly service and overall reasonable prices. Great for happy hour as well with their house margaritas and inexpensive domestic drinks. great atmosphere and overall place!"}
{"text":"They nickel and dimed us. We asked for queso fundido and the waiter didn't know what that was. Should have been our first clue. We ordered a cheese dip with spinach any it's worse than the spinach dip you get at a grocery store, and it didn't come with chips. When we asked the waiter he said that only the bowl comes with chips, not the cup. Were we supposed to eat liquid cheese with a spoon?  Then we ordered the half pound of fajita and my friend wanted flour tortilla and I wanted corn so we asked if we could have half and half he said that's not allowed. I said how many come with the dish and he said 5. I said ok, then can we get 2 corn and 3 flour. He said no, he'd have to charge me.   Not coming here again!"}
{"text":"I would have to say that this restaurant is average at best. If it wasn't for the bust boys it might slip below average. The service is downright slow. We had to catch other servers as they flew by to try to get things like refills or some more napkins. As far as the food, it is not anything that I could not get anywhere else. My beans were crusty on the edges so I guess the plate had been sitting out under a heat lamp for a while. The salsa is a mild salsa with a strong garlic taste. I would say do not bring small children as their kids menu is really small so if your kid doesn't like the little bit of variety that is there, then they will just have to eat corn chips. Everyone was friendly, but I do not think that is enough to bring us back here."}
{"text":"Arizona is one of the few states that does Mexican food right. This place apparently did not get the memo. The experience wasn't all bad. The margarita's were good, and the chips were good as well. That's about as good as it got. The salsa was flavorful, but lacked any sort of spice. I did get a side of \"hot sauce\" but it tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chili seasoning (not spicy at all).   I ordered the mini chimi's, chili con queso, and a cup of tortilla soup for my daughter and I to split.   The tortilla soup was terrible! It lacked any sort of flavor, and had more tortilla strips and cheese than anything. Very few vegetables (no avocado?!?), and hardly any chicken. I've had better soup from a can to be perfectly honest.   The chili con queso dip was average, but nothing special. Pretty sure it was the Velveeta with Rotel chili recipe.   The mini chimi's were greasy! Upon taking my first bite, grease literally came out the other side and ran down my hand.  GROSS!  The service was decent, but not memorable.   All in all, I wouldn't recommend Popo's to anyone who had high expectations for their Mexican craving."}
{"text":"Bummer back again on my birthday... the food was better then I remember thought I had two margaritas this time. You can't just order drinks in the bar which I think is bizarre. So we went to the bar to get drinks ourselves. The table we were seated at was dirty. The bar waiters are rude... thankfully our waitress was good. Though we had to ask twice for waters halfway through dinner. I won't be back... I'll stick to Manuals or Macayos..."}
{"text":"I was hoping for some good Mexican food as this place is close to my work but that was far from what I got.  I felt the sevice was the only good thing at this place.  I judge a lot of places by their salsa and it was just lacking bold flavors or spice.  My meal was just average at best and I highly doubt I will be heading back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see Popo's open on my side of town,  having grown up with the original location on Indian School.   Thankfully the food was just as good as the original.  They make the best chicken tacos bar none,  their rice has perfect flavor,  and their staff is excellent and attentive.   If you love Mexican food,  you have to go to Popo's Fiesta del Sol."}
{"text":"Chippppppppppp and salsaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!! $1 Margarita for the win.   They have two location, I like this place wayyy better :)) great customer service,  friendly and constantly filing up my drink!   I loved my veggie burrito,  with rice and bean. And if I wanted to,  I take a chip and dip it in the bean and rice. Yummmm.   I shall come back."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with Popo's on 59th and Bell Road. My friends and I were enjoying a nice dinner out & we got an uninvited guest.... A cockroach!!  To make matters worse, It was crawling on Jamie. Nasty  right?!  So, We called our waitress over and notified her of the incident. She didn't even look for it, she simply apologized and stated \"I'll go get a manager\". The waitress came back with our checks with $10.00 discounted off (no manager in sight). So one of Jamie's friends said to the waitress\" just let your manager know that it is very unprofessional of him not to come over and apologize, also I will be contacting the health department.\" The waitress once again walked away. After sitting there a while the manager came up to the table while we were all talking about it and stared at us with out saying anything to us or introducing himself. Finally Michelle Marquez said \"are you the manager? it's right over here\" we made sure the cockroach didn't get away by placing a cup over it. The manager did state they had recently sprayed. After the manager finished picking up the Roach with a napkin we explained that the roach had crawled onto Jamie and her meal should be comped. The manager was bothered by that stating \"are you her Advocate?\" \"ok and you guys can wash her car\" I didn't understand his logic).... Here are some videos of what went on tonight. We will never return to this restaurant not only because of the Roach problem, but because of the lack of professionalism.  Michele Eaton Judy Haller  #cockroach#AZhealthDept#fox10news#Popos"}
{"text":"I will have to say that the food is excellent, the service is really good and the wait is not that long.  I have eaten here five times this year and I if I have a choice of a Mexican restuarnt to go to I will choose this one."}
{"text":"I visited Popo's for the first time a few weeks ago while visiting Phoenix.  I ordered the machaca chimichanga with jalepeño cream cheese.  It was really good!  Our waiter kept our drinks filled, as well as our chips and salsa.  We were really impressed with our waiter (I don't remember his name), one of my friends had left something at our table and he ran out into the parking lot looking for us to return it!  That is amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Firstly, the people posting 4 and 5 stars are the only intelligent ones. Let me explain. The others are saying that the food is the same greasy Mexican food you can find anywhere. Evidently these people don't have a very developed palate. I don't think they can distinguish between fresh and frozen goods, proper spices and just extra cheese, or anything else. This was the best Ameri-Mexican food I've had in a LONG time.  As for the service, we sat at a table in the bar because they were so busy and we were served CONSTANTLY by not one, but TWO servers.  ....This place rocks, the haters just came here with a predisposition to not like it...."}
{"text":"68 reviews (to date) and only 1 other reviewer mentioned the horrendous FLY problem here? I guess we just got lucky to come here and spend our entire meal swatting at flies... Management, PLEASE buy some pest control!!!  Otherwise, the food is average American/ Mexican, the salsa is very good and the well rum tastes like rubbing alcohol. The .99 Margaritas (on Tuesdays with a food purchase of $7 or more) and fresh salsa were definitely the only +++'s."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I had to ask the waitress 5 times to please turn off the fan right above our table. Every time I asked I was told sure, but nothing was done. After about 25 minutes and different people asking they finally did it. The food came out and it was bland. My husband ordered some enchiladas and while the meat was okay, the tortillas were stale.  He ended up not eating the meal. The manager was of no help and was condescending when we brought up the issue. Never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"This is very large building with lots of tables.  They have some of the best chips and salsa around. Their entrees are rather standard sit down Mexican food entrees.  Last time I came here the food I got didn't digest rather well but that can also be typical of Mexican food.  The service has always been adequate.  Overall a pretty standard Mexican restaurant in America."}
{"text":"Funny how things change. Food still great, server ruined our lunch, the only meal I was going to get to have today. 40 minutes of a constant flow of chips and salsa without water, and never saw our server. The place was packed on this Saturday.  Then after asking four people who our server was, they came up with some guy who rushed us through ordering our meals, refused to order the appetizer we wanted and I was so frustrated I couldn't even order my food. My husband just ordered me a random taco...not what I wanted...I was so angry that i didn't want to eat. Ruined my day/lunch."}
{"text":"OK but not fantastic food-at least in my opinion.  It is basic, quick, non americanized faire.  I would like to see the salsas perked up a bit but doubt that will happen as they havent been changed in years and years."}
{"text":"met our friends there for an early lunch-huge portions and very tasty.  Waiter was very helpful and service was very nice.  This would be a great place to take family as the kids would love the music and atmosphere.  we enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"Good was very good, unfortunately the meat to tortilla ratio was 85% tortilla 15% meat in the chimichanga... sucks knowing I paid 14.95 for a 80 cent tortilla..."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my visit at all. I asked the waiter for chicken with vegetables and they brought me the chicken with vegetables which had zucchini which I'm allergic to. I was so hungry but couldn't eat it so I asked to talk to the manager to let him know to be more specific on the menu. As far as I know the customer is always right; he didn't really even care about my comment. Very poor customer service from the manager. I only gave it one star because there wasn't a zero which is what they deserve. They should have offered either to cut my bill or give me some kind of incentive to come back. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear, I come to this Popo's regularly because the food is good and the service WAS great! Notice I said \"WAS\", today we walked in, no one greeted, we get sat down, 10 minutes to just get our drink order, we just ordered coke nothing fancy. Finally our server came took our order, 15 minutes to bring out the Menudo, we all know it's reheated, but it wasn't even hot not even warm, so why did it take 15 min?? Was it busy? NOT one bit... at the time of ordering our Menudo I asked for chopped up white onions (my preference and I always pay more for it) , I asked for crushed peppers, do u think I got either , I did not! I had to ask 3 more times, only to have her bring me i teaspoon of onion and said they had no crushed peppers , really?? A Mexican restaurant with no crushed peppers... she's a joke! Remember I regularly come here for the Menudo, I know they have what I ask for, it's the same every week. At this point I just ask to get my food to go, took her 15 minutes to bring my to go bowls (the food didn't even fit in it) and she proceeded to say they had no to go cups for the soda , again seriously!    My suggestion: is this the new norm, I won't be coming back here and telling everyone I know to avoid this place due to poor quality of service. If you claim to be an authentic mexican restaurant make sure u have the right ingredients or at least have people working for you that want to work. I paid for what 2 drinks we didn't even drink because she chose to give us the worst possible service ever. So if u want Authentic Mexican food their are many other better options with exceptional customer service. Popo's has gone to the trash!! Horrible , disappointed, what a waste!"}
{"text":"In the past I'd say the other location is better. But overall I think both work just fine. The other location seems to have specials more often. But here you don't have to deal with that back parking lot like on Indian School.  If you are looking for great salsa, fair specials, a decent margarita, and pretty good food Popo's is always a good choice. The food is a bit heavier than some places but definitely better than xyzabertos."}
{"text":"Not a place to eat if you are gluten intolerant. There is only one thing on the menu you can have if you are gluten intolerant. I had told them i was and they told me no sauces but they never bothered to tell me that the chips and the enchilidas are made from a corn and flour mix. It wasn't till i got sick from the food and asked specifically that i was told. It does not make me very happy when i think i am eating gluten free and i'm not. The food is good if you are not gluten intolerant. I think they think it is a joke or something."}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience tonight and I am not sure that I will return to this one again. I was so excited to go to dinner with our friends tonight because it has been a while since we have been to popos and we love this place normally. We sat down everything was fine we ordered our drinks all was good. We got an appetizer still all good until we ordered dinner. We all did the all you can eat tacos I ordered chicken my friends son ordered beef and her husband ordered chicken as well. They wrote all of our orders down and even went over them again with us to verify what we ordered. Our orders come out they gave me shredded beef my friends husband beef and their son shredded beef. I asked them to fix it and he said OK so sorry I will. Now normally most places will say that they can take at least 1 off the bill for the mix up or give you a free dessert or something to fix the issue. Well not this place and tonight the food was gross I got sick feeling right after we left and had to rush home. I'm not one to ever give bad reviews normally but I am very disappointed in how we were treated after their mess up. Unless something is done to fix this we will start going to the other popos!!"}
{"text":"Have to say I was very skeptical about \"Popo's fiesta del sol\" but being that I'm a mexican food adventurer I had to try it.  1st was seated pretty much right away which generally is a bad sign on a Sunday night (good restaurants are way to busy on Sunday nights) 2nd Chips and salsa right away with a drink order taken within 3-4 minutes of being seated.  3rd chips and salsa were good although I'm a spicy kind of guy the salsa was ok enough for the kids to eat and for me to enjoy.  Now, when food arrived in a decent amount of time the presentation was good and the plate was full. I got \"El Pollo especial\"  and it was OUTSTANDING!  My daughters got children menu items and they were not so pleased with the ground beef taco (ground beef tacos should be left to taco bell and ajo al's) that's why they get 4 stars instead of 5. All in all the service was good the waitress allowed me to sample the menudo which was PERFECT and I will be back to try it.  I would recommend this restaurant not for authentic/tex mex/southwest style/sonorran style/ just for good food!  See you soon Popo's"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Nice environment!  Friendly servers!  One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the past although my last experience really sucked and I haven't been back. The margaritas were once strong yet sweet at the same time, especially with the sugar on the rim! My husband an I would make this a date night and my best friend and I would go on our ladies days for margaritas, an open faced quesadilla with green chili's and the chips n salsa. They have fast service most of the time and generally the bill is worth it. The atmosphere is great i love the bar and the fire outside we have Marc's sat inside a couple of times with big parties"}
{"text":"So I am rating this a three based on the fact that I have severe food allergies and it was neglected. I asked for sour cream and the jalapeño cream cheese on my chimi. It came back with guacamole (I am severely allergic to avocado and other foods as well) on it so I said I cannot have that I am allergic and repeated what I ordered, the server said he would be back with a new one. Came back not even two minutes later with the chimi covered in sour cream with a chunk of it missing and guac under the chimi and on the plate still. At this point I pulled out the epi pen and asked for a manager. The server then severely apologized and made me a new chimi but the manager never came over to discuss the situation. Disappointed in that and disappointed in the fact that I had to even ask for a manager to get my food made appropriately because of my severe food allergies. They refunded us for the chimi for the inconvenience but it was still just a hassle that my food allergies were overlooked and kind of written off, not taken seriously. Hope that changes. And writing this review for others to be aware along with the establishment of the neglect."}
{"text":"obviously a LOT of people here arent used to authentic food! this is just like going over to my friends house & her mom laying out a fantastic authentic meal...........from the fresh chips & salsa to the tamales and on down the line, great seasoning. if you want it HOT tell them they will do it. most americans gripe & complain( as proved by all you nay sayers in this post) about  \"ooooo it's too hot\" you all need to get a friend who's family knows how to cook REAL mexican food and just join them for dinner one night! then you will see PoPos is as close as it gets to having dinner with your favorite mexican food cook!!! Always love them always will! I know at first when they opened there were some glitches but we went back & all was ironed out! Every place you go to eat has off times, get over it! If you're not happy talk to the manager, I can for sure say if you do you will not walk out unhappy! a mexican meal isnt taco bell folks......or those fillibertos or humbertos or all that drive thru crap you all are probably used to! if you dont like it go back & order something different, something new......... perhaps you've NEVER had it prepared properly so you don't know PoPos does it right! ;)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is unorganized and my waitress barely spoke english. The drink quality has declined since we first started coming in 2016. The happy hour margaritas are so sweet with mix that I had to return it and pay an ungodly price for a premium one. Also, if you order a mixed drink all you get is the mixer with no alcohol. We had to order a shot of Jameson and a sprite separate just so it didnt taste like an expensive glass of sprite. Our bill was over 100$ for a fajuta for 2 and 2 rounds of drinks. Will not be back. Sad because we use to like to come here."}
{"text":"This has been a family favorite for many years...Manny is our favorite waiter!  But, I have to share my last experience there this past Friday.  It was a 30 minute wait so we didn't request Manny...biggest mistake ever!!!! We had a new waiter who was OK.  I ordered a chicken taco salad and the first bite was wonderful. The second bite not so great.  I felt something sharp stick into my gum and thought it was a bone.  After a couple of minutes of working it out of my gum and tooth, turned out it was a metal \"romaine\" twist tie.  We called our waiter over and told him what happened.  \"Not my fault\" was his response.  The Mgr was finally summoned and had me fill out a form.  He was less than sympathetic and comped my ($9.50) meal....nothing more.  I received s follow up phone call with s promise of a gift certificate if I would \"just give them a second chance\". It never came. I still think the food is great and Manny is a great guy but their customer service when they make a mistake is definitely lacking."}
{"text":"HUGE portions. AMAZING salsas (especially the green...). FISHBOWL-SIZED margaritas. Menu contains all of the Mexican essentials- but nothing innovative or unique. We had a great service experience and definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"i love the food ..spinach dip , fish tacos and amazing peach and bananna margaritas ....only complaint is service can be poor ....there is a older gentleman who works lunch that does ok but i suggest sitting in the bar area usually the best of the service."}
{"text":"Went to Popo's today on 8/4/11. I wanted to go somewhere close and get some somewhat \"soft food\". My Grandmother just had her teeth fixed and could not chew that well. I could have easily gone across the street to Macayos and had reliable service and food (well sorta). Instead, I decided to go to Popo's on 59th and Bell. Have had them a few times, NO PROBLEMS. Guess I never had take out from them before. I ordered  a fish burro and my Mother had a taco and tostada a la cart. Then I asked for a to go order of a green chili burro. I did not know that on togo orders you must order chips and salsa separate (FRICKIN CHEAP). Anyway, I had a good meal. The food was decent and the service up until this point was adequate. Or server who's name is Junior had a follow that day. I understand the stress, but make a good impression for the one that you are training so they will know the right way to do things. Anyway, asked for boxes and he brought us some. Then our TO GO order came out. No chips and salsa provided. I guess that's a way to generate more revenue for the company. Still, no problem since I had some on my table. I took the chips and salsa and walked to the kitchen. The Manager, Vicky Baird,  was standing right at the doorway. I asked her to please box up the chips and salsa. She then stated it was against health code and rudely walked away. I put the chips and salsa down and left. I was now very mad. I went to the table and told my companion \"NO TIP\". I told him we would NEVER be back. Junior took it upon himself to tell me that he, \"encourages us to not come back.\" Wonder how his boss would like that???? NEVER again. I will continue to spread this message for at least the next two years. 3500+ local facebook friends I am sure will agree."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food is pretty good. Servers do great until it's time for the check. Seems like they disappear and you are left waiting to pay. Been there a handful of times and it is always the same. I like the chicken tacos and the cheese crisps with green chile. Not a huge fan of the beans, which is the most frustrating part of goin here as I love tostadas and bean/cheese burros. Oh well, just don't get that anymore there."}
{"text":"The cream cheese jalapeño sauce is wonderfully creamy and mild. It can be ordered as a side. Portions are generous. As a light eater, I prefer to order ala carte. The fish tacos are refreshing and not too heavy. The rellanos have generous meringue batter which is fluffy and tastes like a meringue... Not the oil it was fried in. Happy hour deals are fantastic. The restaurant usually has a wait time but the bar has open seating and service is quick. Uno mas!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the other location on Indian School for years as my sister used to work there. I was driving home one day from the Arrowhead Mall and noticed the same name and got super excited. I took my fiancee and two kids here and they loved it as much as I did and the food taste the same as the other location and the restaurant is so beautiful. My favorite part was when your waiting they have a fire going outside to keep you warm in the cold months! The staff is super awesome and very friendly."}
{"text":"I ate at Popo's several years ago at their Indianschool location. Company setting and I got some type of burrito with rice and beans. The food was good but I did not thing any better than the rest of the places I had been to;. When they opened a place on Bell I did not go eat there because I was satisfied with where I was eating when I wanted Mexican food.  We were headed out to eat and my wife asked about Popo's. We were at 59 ave, time to give them a try.  First I will say I have already planned a trip back. The food and service was that good. Not often a place impresses me as much as they did. Why not a 5? Need a second visit to give a five.  I liked the layout of the restaurant. It is large but does not feel large. We were seated as soon as we got there by a very friendly hostess. We ordered dour drinks, (water with lemon). and viewed the menu.  Over the years my appreciation for Mexican food has matured. I have several selections I like. This makes it easy for me to judge the food. At least the foods I like.  I ordered the carnitas chimi with sour cream and sour cream with jalapeño. My wife ordered the chicken tortilla soup.  We got our chips and salsa. I liked their chips as they were warm and crisp. A little thinner than some restaurants, just the way I like them. The salsa was mild but great tasting. I like a little more heat so I asked if they had a hotter version and I was brought a smaller bowel with a hotter salsa. After enjoying the chips and salsa our meal arrived.  My wife's soup was packed with chicken and tasted great. Most places the chicken is there but much less. I cut into the chimi and took my first bite of carnitas. This bite was without any tortilla or sour cream so I could get the full taste. To date theirs were the best I have ever had. Their sour cream with jalapeño  was good along with the carnitas.  Yes I will be back next time to have some of their carne asada. This trip will be soon. Popo's is destined to by my ATF Mexican food restaurant. Try their green chili burro the best I have had. Theirs is spicier than most, just the way I like. Now I have to go back and sample the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Ehhh not the best. I don't like having to pick through my chimichanga because I have to watch out for bones and cartilage... and the queso literally tasted like craft cheese. The salsa wasnt too bad though. All in all, I most likely won't be coming back here."}
