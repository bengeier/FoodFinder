{"text":"Completely and purposefully ignored by entire staff! I have travelled extensively and I even live in a hometown that lives on \"island time\" even though we call it something else back home. So I know when people are just slower paced and when people are just being jerks. We entered the restaurant, found a table, and were handed menus. After a few moments the waiter asked if we were ready to order (I said, \"Yes\"). He then walked away from our table and ignored us for the rest of the time we waited. We caught his eye several times and beckoned him to come to our table (ignored). We saw the chef come out of the kitchen to converse with the staff and we beckoned him (ignored). We caught the eye of the bartender and another waitress (ignored, ignored).  I will never know if the food was good, so I cannot comment on that, but the service was the worst I have ever had (even when we were expertly ignored by a French waiter in Paris). In this case the entire staff watched us and ignored us.  We did hear about the idea of \"belongers\" - those who belong here and not the wealthy foreigners that own all the houses and villas. Perhaps these belongers were taking out their frustration on us. I am an excellent tipper, so they lost out on that. My mission now is to warn everyone that if you value your sanity and want to give your business to people who care about their jobs and the things they produce, AVOID THIS PLACE!  There are plenty of places to eat on this island where the staff appreciates your business. Go to other restaurants like Turks Kebab or Da Conch Shack!"}
{"text":"3 course meal is an excellent value, conch soup was large and excellent flavor. Nice air conditioned dining room and free wifi."}
{"text":"Just got back from Lunch at Fresh Catch. The food overall was pretty good. The nachos as an appetizer were a waste of money, stick to the entrees. I had the \"crispy fish\" which was breaded and pan fried grouper with rice and peas as the side with coleslaw, it was delicious and cooked perfectly. My wife got the burger which I wasn't very impressed with but she says was good. Stick with the seafood at this place and if you want a burger go to ALs next door."}
{"text":"My wife and friends were referred to Fresh Catch by a local we met here on Provincial.   We walked from our resort at Grace Bay, which was a short half mile away.    We started with Conch soup and salads, and they were so fresh and tasty!  We decided to split meals tonight so we could watch our figures.  ( which I have been watching grow larger for years).  We had the surf and turf, steak and lobster, and our friends had the lobster.   Huge servings and excellent food.   The service was outstanding.  Excellent prices too.."}
{"text":"Had the Jamaican jerk rib plate and the jerk chicken. Both were great. Also they had happy hour drink specials. Definitely with a stop to try this little place out."}
{"text":"Just got back from an unexpected brunch at Fresh Catch. We had been at the Potcake Rescue and needed a little something before heading back to our resort. Husband and I each had an omelette with toast and it was delightful. The staff chatted with us a bit about the Thursday fish fry, and were nice enough to call us a cab (which was actually much cheaper than the cab we had taken to get to Salt Mills!). Wish we could have spent some more time in that area, but the beautiful waters of the ocean were calling our name. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"This place is trash. Old, overcooked food. Peas and rice were dried out and crunchy with burnt peas throughout. The plaintains where so dry the inside was bread like. The jerk chicken was at least a day old and reheated. Maybe Saturday nights arent there peak times, and freshly prepared entrees just arent worth it for them. However, when you are charging me $30 a plate, You better believe dried out, old food will be sent back and discussed. Do not recommend. We are not locales, we were here on vacation."}
{"text":"Quick and simple dining! You get your food fast and it tastes great. I tried the cracked conch, jerk chicken and the whole fried snapper. The seafood is fresh at every restaurant, so that's not a problem here. The jerk seasoning on the chicken was perfect, not too spicy or overpowering. The whole fried snapper was crunchy flaky goodness. The cracked conch, there's no going wrong with that ever."}
{"text":"This place looks foreboding being in the shopping mall. However,the conch chowder is really the best on the island after 5 years of coming to the Turks. Don't miss this dish or you'll miss one delectable experience. Foodies beware cuz you'll be back for more. Guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Decent little restaurant located in the Salt Mills shopping area of island.  Fresh Catch serves a good selection of island offerings among the many other less desirable restaurants located in this shopping area. The seafood here is fresh and cooked well.   We ordered the cracked conch which was well seasoned and fried chunks of fresh conch. Crispy, salty, tender, and delicious. For my main course I ordered the whole fried snapper. Really great fish. Sweet and crispy, the snapper was my favorite thing here. Simple but delicious. My SO got the chicken flat bread.... don't order the chicken flat bread. It was a sheet of pre-made flat bread with chunks of frozen chicken and likely Kraft's shredded cheddar baked until warm... not a big fan.   But other than that, this is good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. A little pricey, but that's no different than everyplace else on Provo Island. I don't recall the specific names of dishes but all of the meats were excellent (we basically tried all of them... lobster, conch, snapper, jerk chicken, etc.). The only minor negative I can think of is that the more American-style side dishes like mashed potatoes and mac & cheese weren't the best, but that's not unusual in the Caribbean so it's not a big deal. The rum punch here was one of the better ones we had in TCI too."}
{"text":"From beginning to end, everything was wonderful. We got the special which was $35 for an appetizer, entree and dessert. Drinks were 2 for 1 during happy hour - even better. The conch chowder was incredibly tasty - I would definitely have it again. I got the coconut curry snapper for my entree with the roasted veggies and potatoes. It was SO delicious and I normally don't like coconut curries. Finally, I got the chocolate crepe with vanilla ice cream - which was a perfect, refreshing end of the meal. The service was fantastic - very friendly, kind, and attentive. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Fresh Catch is located in Salt Mills which is one of the shopping area of TKI.  We ordered the cracked conch for starters which Is always good wherever you go in TKI. The seafood here is all fresh and food came out at a pretty decent time. I had the whole fried snapper which was fairly good. But it reminded me of fish you fry at home yourself so it wasn't outstanding.  The fried plantains were done well and was perfectly sweetened. but besides all that, its nothing that really stands out."}
{"text":"Wow!! What an awesome local experience.  Who comes to the island to eat ribs, except me based on the recommendation of Vinston (incredible server).  My wife had the Grouper, which as incredible too.  The Baked Mac n Cheese wade excellent!!  Overall warm and inviting island experience!!"}
{"text":"Location: Salt Mills Plaza across street from Regent Village, popular shopping and restaurant center. Setting: neat, simple, but small like a cafe. Service: regular, more or less the same as other similar style restaurant. Parking: parking lot shared with other restaurants and stores in the plaza Food: We went to the restaurant twice, once for a lunch and another for Wednesday dinner buffet. For the lunch, we had salad and whole red snapper, both are good but very small quantities. 4 stars! For the buffet dinner, $40/pp (good price for dinner in Provo), but the food choice is limited. Basically four main courses: lobster, grouper, chicken, and pork, in addition to salad and fruits, and a couple of side dishes. Dessert is rum cake. One free drink: rum punch or fruit punch. The lobster is definitely over-cooked, and so dry that you have to use force to take meat out of the shell. If you really want to eat a little tender lobster, choose the smaller sizes. Chicken and pork are tasty but they are jerky style. Grouper is the best among all. If you have strong teeth, and enjoy chewable meats, this buffet is perfect for you . Overall, it is 2 stars. By average of two experiences, 3 stars is my ranking, and I will not visit it again during this trip."}
{"text":"Im a tourist but we wanted to try some local fare this place did not disappoint the conch was excellent and the grouper burger was also very good it's a very nice place clean unpretentious good local help and nice folks and the food was great for the price"}
{"text":"Love love love this spot!! Top quality food, friendly service and reasonable prices!! Try the conch fritters - lovely spicy taste and crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside. Mmm. Lots of fresh fish choices and daily lunch specials. Island flavours and a laid back vibe. Pair your grilled or blackened fish with a local Turks Head Lager for a refreshing lunch. They also have a full bar and fantastic island drinks menu! Look for the little boat bow out front and the tiki thatch awning - that's the spot!!"}
