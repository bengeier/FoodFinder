{"text":"My wife and I went to the restaurant on a Sunday, we were happy to find out that they had a three course table d'hote for $33 per person on Sundays only.  Had we ordered the three course meal separately it would've been over $50 per person  Overall the service was very good as was the food and ambiance.  If I had to make some kind of minor criticism it would be the waitresses aren't assigned tables, they all help each other, so one waitress will come and explain the menu and then the second waitress will come a minute later and explain the menu again...   Also, we found our steaks salty and my wife's steak was a little burnt.  But overall it was a very nice dining experience and will go back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  We live 5 minutes away and pass by it every day but had never tried.  Well I can't believe it took me so long.  I had the vegetarian mushroom risotto, delicious.  Very extensive wine selection as well as a great selections of beers.  Very intimate place, not very big but very nice.  Like the open kitchen aspect.  Will definitely be returning!"}
