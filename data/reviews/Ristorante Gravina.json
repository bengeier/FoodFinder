{"text":"We have been there a few times since Gravina's opened and the food has always been great. The first time the waiter asked us if we were the same couple that dashed and dined a week earlier?? thanks and welcome to Gravina's!   The food most recently was excellent, we had the osso buco with gnocchi and pizza, the Caesar salad dressing was made from scratch. The portions were huge and therefore good bang for the buck!  This is not the type of place where you get walk ins off the street, like in many areas of  TO, so considering most of the patrons are local and from the neighborhood, nobody from anywhere else is coming all the way up here from TO; it would be a nice touch if the staff and the \"rock star\" chef as Robert C. mentions in his review would come around to the tables instead of hangout at another table, so get up and make the customers feel like they are welcomed, and are a part of your place, that family feeling, that so they would want to come back.....  ..like I said the food is really good but its those small things that keeps your business around for a long time, in a big city you may get away with treating customers like numbers, in a small neighborhood, your local patrons keep the lights on."}
{"text":"Just came from dinner with my family and best friend and was not impressed by this Restaurant. I live right across the street from this place and have been meaning to try this place since it opened. Glad to say it was my first and last time.  To start off we got bread in a basket and accompanied with that was butter? I looked around to see the other tables who have been there and have just sat down and they were given olive oil and balsamic vinegar? Why did I get the butter?  Second, the service was slow. When the salad came, it came as a pile of arugula with a few slices of pear and Parmesan. The pizzas seemed a little cold, like they were sitting for a while? The waiter never came back to ask us how we were doing? Our water glasses were empty for a long while and when we did ask for more water, the waiter handed us his water jug? So there we were, pouring our own water? Really?  Perhaps, the service I received was because I wasn't Italian? That's too bad we had a bad experience, because if it was good, we'd be there all the time. But, that wasn't case."}
{"text":"After several deliciously satisfying dinners at Gravina we have officially become 'regulars' at this authentic Italian ristorante.  The Gravina Pizza is sweet and savoury with buttery prosciutto, creamy mascarpone, pear slices and walnuts. My favourite is the Pappardelloni ai Porcini which is long wide strands of pappardelle in a very rich Brandy rose sauce with wild mushrooms. YUM!!! We've had the Caesar salad, arancini rice balls, antipasto deli and cheese platter, and a few of the other pizzas - all delicious. We always see the Chef/owner behind the open kitchen counter, humble and very talented he takes pride in his menu. His perfectionism and use of high quality ingredients lend to delectable dishes that speak for themselves.  Haven't tried the desserts yet..... More pics to come!"}
{"text":"If you live in Vaughan and frequent restaurants as much as most of us do, you will not be impressed.  Let's call a spade a spade...this is an Italian restaurant in a local plaza for a local neighbourhood.  Do you think Toronto Life's critic is going to come up here and give it a 3.5?  Neoooooooo.  You want a simple meal.  The place is good.....Really good.  I went one evening and the \"head chef\" was eating at a table alone acting like a rock star with some patrons.  Stay in the kitchen and impress me with your skills not your eating ability.  Service was mediocre at best.  The wine selection was not thorough as they are probably tight on cash.  Listen \"mr chef\"  in your business you need to prove your exceptional before being rated...Triple A.... get back in the kitchen and show he patrons in Maple you are worthy of their cash.   Sorry but I can't this stuff anymore with all the competition.  If you want, focus on Italian baptisms, communions, and confirmations and be mediocre this is a great place.  Everyone is afraid to ....Call a spade a spade.  Off to next meal."}
{"text":"A delightful and dependable neighborhood gem. Wonderful Italian dishes and a wood burning pizza oven as well. I personally love spicy pizza so my go-to is the \"Papà Joe\".   I'm not from Italy but I'm familiar with some of the regional specialties. Anyhow it turns out that the owner is Calabrian and if you ask nicely he will add 'Nduja (en-DOO-ya) to your pizza! 'Nduja is a spicy chopped salami mixture from Calabria that is just phenomenal. If you like spicy, savory foods then you might want to give it a try.   I highly recommend this restaurant! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service, absolutely fresh tasty, healthy food ! I would recommend million times !  I live in the same neighborhood and I'm happy Gravina is only steps from home :)) Since we went first time, we go there regularly ."}
{"text":"Lovely decor and friendly staff. Went for pizza with a few friends. I had the little arancini (riceballs) and they were the kind you find at the Italian grocery store frozen, but I'm not complaining- I knew what I was getting. The papa joe pizza was decent but just seemed \"OK\". Had to add some extra spice to what seemed like a pizza with too much going on on it. The restaurant looks the part and is a nice spot for couples or small groups. The price I will say was very decent and I was shocked when we split the bill.   The location make it a nice spot for locals, but I would seldom leave the city for average pizza. Will go back when my friend down the street from Gravina's invites me.   Overall my rating is based on the pizza, everything else was great.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"My family and I had the pleasure of enjoying a dinner here. We enjoyed the lovely interior decor, the food quality and quantity was more then average. The minor dislike we had was their cheese and basil pizza which nearly had no cheese on it and disappointed our children with its appearance. And not a sprinkle of basil, After mentioning this to our waitress, the kitchen was kind enough to send us another order to which everyone was pleased! (But again no basil what so ever)  They were able to cater to my gluten free needs and the location could not be better for us. We also ordered a bottle of their house red, which I personally was not a huge fan off, but that's personal preference.  Over all good experience and will be happy to visit again soon."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I ever went to. We got calamari for appetizer, main course we got steak and N96 pizza. The food was amazing. Our server Roberto was extremely friendly and went out of his way to ensure that we had a memorable experience. chef Enzo Gravina really takes pride in making his dishes.  Definately recommend this place, and will be going back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great!! We would definitely come back and try the rest of the menu!! P.S.  drinks were a bit expensive though."}
{"text":"Been to this ristorante a couple of times and my fiance and I love it. The service was great and they made us feel comfortable. The head chef came to our table to talk to us personally and that was a beautiful classy touch.    The food was absolutely tasty and filling. I would recommend this great place to my friends.   My fiance and I liked it so much that I proposed to her there, on Sept 5, 2013.  Its our special place now."}
{"text":"We walked in to an almost empty restaurant and were welcomed and seated. My first impression is the interior is a classic dark wood and beige paint with the lights dimmed, it just screamed upscale.   Our server was very friendly and took our drink order and told us the specials, which were very appealing. I had one of the specials which was agnellti which was a half moon ravioli stuffed with lobster, and cheese (I believe), in a red wine sauce, along with some red wine & créme brûlée for desert.  It was a nice spot for a date more so than a young family dinner, but it still worked for us. The server brought bread an butter along with our selection of wine. We asked for more bread with our meal because the sauce on the pasta was amazing you just couldn't leave any behind. The pasta itself was good, but could have used a bit more lobster, there was just enough that you got a hint of lobster ever once in a while. The créme brûlée was awesome nicely topped with grapes.   Overall it was a nice night out for the family, but would be better for a romantic night out. The meal was excellent the only knock I have is that for the price, I wish the portions were a little bigger."}
{"text":"Delicious food abounds here.  From the moment you're greeted, the focaccia bread brought to the table is made fresh drizzled with olive oil. I had the BBQ calamari risotto and it was full of flavour.  The calamari was perfectly cooked.   The owner takes pride in his dishes and it's obvious. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Incredible!!! Best hideaway find!! Authentic Italian food with a chef that should be on the cover of a GQ magazine!  Fire burning Pizza oven...can't go wrong!  Check out my photos"}
