{"text":"Ate here today after work!  The exclamation point was unnecessary because I eat here a lot after work on Fridays.  Also eat here a lot on Saturday mornings.  That explains my weight gain.  The green sauce.  Get the green sauce/salsa.  Everything is good that I've ever had but the green sauce/salsa takes it to the next level!  Eff that red B.S!  Go green!  Usually get a taco and burrito.  Good prices, great green sauce/salsa!  Is it salsa or is it sauce?  You be the judge!"}
{"text":"Ok so I read the other reviews about the carne asada and the california burrito.  I recently got back from San Diego (I know how you SD people are all about your mexican food) and had enjoyed my first \"California Burrito\"! the one I got there had french fries in it.  So I just rolled over to Polibertos.  Theirs has potatoes they did however sub the potatoes for fries and it was a good burrito. The burrito was 4.50!  So even though they don't make it with french fries and they are close to the house and I can get one for under 5 bucks. 4 stars and I'll be back."}
{"text":"1st time here, ordered the chorizo burrito to which I added potato, cheese and bacon...came out to almost $7 but it was huge and delicious!  Only ate half before I got full and saving the rest for later. Will return soon."}
{"text":"The mini chimis are good and the jalapeño cream cheese is a perfect match.  Pick up a few through the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday and went through the drive thru here, area not too great but the lady with the ombre hair who took my order was very polite. I order 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and she even asked if  I wanted to add cheese for no extra cost. Got home and ate and the food was absolutely amazing. My Taco Tuesday was completely satisfied will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Fast, affordable, generous portions and most recently good service. This is a great place to get some \"bang for your buck\" food. Very authentic Mexican food and friendly people. :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

I got the super nachos because I'd really been craving some Mexican food. 

It was good, I ate the whole thing and it was filling but for $11 including tax, it felt a little over priced and just kind of thrown together."}
{"text":"I could barely bite through the stale fish in my fish tacos. And the beans and rice did not save the day. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I really love this place because of the mini chimi's. They satisfy a late night craving and are available at a drive thru which isn't typical. I am super picky about meat. The chicken and beef at Poliberto's is delicious! Service is always friendly. My order has always been correct. Try it out! :)"}
{"text":"So went to this Poliberto's this morning for the first time. It was my first visit here and last, not nearly as good as the Poliberto's on 43rd Ave & Glendale. Shows what the difference a good cook and management makes. To bad because I go past this one on Bell Rd all the time. Girl at the counter was nice but they seem like I was putting them out and I was the only one there."}
{"text":"Wife and I enjoy dine-in once a week here. We both enjoy any of there combos. Plate full of rice, beans, entre, flour tortilla,  and drink for a moderate price. Everything is good.  Its a \"go to place\" for the both of us wanting mexican food.
Job well done."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, great service. I love the red salsa is consider buying a point or quart at a time"}
{"text":"excellent lunch specials, reasonably priced. The have a punch card for free meals so make sure you ask. The chimis are very good."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a bad review cause the people here were nice but the food was horrible. My burrito carnitas the meat was very tough and dry and hard to chew with chunks of fat that I had to constantly spit out. I had to really douse the burrito with hot sauce to make it more chewy and edible and I'm not exaggerating either."}
{"text":"This is a taco place that I have been driving by for a long time and decided to check it out. Prices are inexpensive and comparable with other taco places. The inside is very basic. Not much in the way of decor or any theme. There is plenty of seating inside. Their menu is pretty good. Lots of items to choose from. One thing I didn't like is the cheap plates they used. My warm rolled tacos was melting threw the plate!

One thing I liked about this place is how fast the service was. We ordered our food and it came out quick! Love that with these types of restaurants.

There is a good amount of parking in this area. Won't have any troubles there.

I liked the rolled tacos and my girlfriend liked her bean tostada. The food turned out great. They have lots of different salsas to choose from as well.

Overall it's a decent taco place for the price."}
{"text":"Yes I did vote this with a five star! It is the best fast food Mexican joint on the West side of Phoenix. When I want fast food Mexican carne asada burritos I come here! It's not the closest Mexican shop to my house, but dang it, when I moved out to phoenix, you know I tried to hit every Mexican shop I could to try and find the best flavored carne asada meat. And this was the best I could find. 

I come here at least once or twice a month. I always get one of two people that are working the same drive through window. The price's are down right awesome for the quality of food you get. The red hot sauce reminds me of home, it's not firey hot but gives the food a wonderful taste. If your a So-Cal native and miss your Mexican food try here, it's not exactly the same but it will fill that void we all have. \"Cheers Polibertos!!\""}
{"text":"I cannot give this place a good rating. I had just walked out of 2 other taco shops, one didn't have Carne Asada, the other one smelled in the parking lot. 
So by the time I got to this place I had just decided I'm not going anywhere else I may be being to picky, I'll eat here, so I walk in  and i'm standing at the order counter and I get no response from anyone in the front or the back for about seven minutes when the lady comes up to the register she tells me 9.85 for 2 tacos, she takes my $20 and shuts that drawer forgets to give me my money back, just walks to the drive thru window and tells me to wait on my change because she had to take someone else's order at the drive-through. Ok then. That's strange, so I asked for a small soda they had no sodas this day, their soda machine was down and broken so I figured I'd get tea. She gave me a cup, but I find out there was no ice, so she fills my cup in the back, I sit my son down, when she tells me my tacos are ready (which don't take long) I go grab them, but when I sit back down with my son tells me he doesn't want to eat because he wants to play with the bugs. Yes BUGS, all over the booths, floor and around the window frames. I take pics and then I threw my whole tray away. What a waste of 9.85 I'm in the parking lot writing this review because I didn't want to forget.
 I wish I could load video, but pics will have to do.
Won't be back here EVER."}
{"text":"Everytime we have gotten food here we have absolutely loved it. The carne asada fries are to die for and don't even get me started on their green salsa! IT IS AMAZING!  I have received great service every time we've gone as well. If you haven't eaten here you definitely should!"}
{"text":"This place is great!

I was looking for a quick place to grab lunch close to work, but wanted to try something I had never tried before. I grabbed my phone and popped open the Yelp app, and started looking. I saw this place and decided to give it a try.

I was not disappointed. I ordered the California burrito and added Guac. The price was around $6 with a drink. I received my meal quickly and was pleased to see that the tortilla was hot and fresh. It looked and tasted like it had been made on the premises. The ingredients were tasty and hot!

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Being accustomed to near-flawless Mexican food from San Diego, I have to admit I was a little hesitant to try what Phoenix had to offer. On the menu at Poli's, I was taken aback by the California Burrito, which normally is a ubiquitous staple for every local in SD. Could it be? Judging by the menu, the ingredients were the same. I must try it. 

The burrito itself was long and must've weighed over a pound. The inner-ratio was spot on and the overall portions generous. The carne asada showed no signs of gaminess and the texture amongst the fries, meat, and cheese was of ethereal nature. Best of all, it costs about a dollar less than any California Burrito I've had in California.  An epiphanic sensation, I have now bent over and assumed my new standard for what is the California Burrito... in Arizona."}
{"text":"Horchata was sour and they were out of soda. Empty restaurant had crumbs on the floor. Napkins are kept hidden in the back and bathroom is locked. I found this out the sip of my rotten drink. 106 out and I don't think the ac is any lower 85 (being generous).  Couldn't even finish my burrito before giving up. Over all a  never again."}
{"text":"Was starving because of being stuck at work so I quickly yelped \"taco's\" and found this place right down the street. I knew it was there but it's always empty and I am not fond of eating at places that are empty.
However, it wasn't bad...it wasn't wonderful either. I had the carne asada tacos and the meat was surprisingly steak like instead of thin like carne usually is. 
The tacos were STUFFED full of meat, a lot of onions and all that.

Overall, it was ok. Perfect for a quick meal like I needed that day."}
{"text":"Ok I miss Burrito Bandido. They have the recipes from BB. It's *almost* the same. I go here when I have a desperate craving. However, no diet soda, only tea, weird. Meh. Looks like a struggling location. Since it is a Bertos, they are locked into their menu style. My fave is the Baby Bandidos, I mean the mini chimis. It'll do. Party like its 1999!"}
{"text":"This is just alright. It's your average Mexican fast food, nothing special. But that drive thru is a bonus"}
{"text":"Back again, this time for a California Burrito.  Tasty, warm and I got 4 containers of that wonderful Salsa Verde.
Thank you"}
{"text":"Please don't second guess this one !! Don't do it !! I drive down bell all the time and for some stupid reason I get this carne asada itch. It always happens when I pass this place . Friends four times ( I know I'm an idiot ) I stop in and order the same burrito. They are very consistent on every visit which this is my last. NOTHING IS FRESH ! The beef is left over from days previous , I add French frys to the burrito and the frys are also from days previously never done to order , iv eaten fresher beef jerky ........I'm pissed yea'll .......as I write this I'm praying for my body to reject the half I did eat"}
{"text":"Horrible chicken burrito one bite and I threw it away......it tasted old and bland....eat at your own risk"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you. Great food, huge portions. The fish tacos were very tasty. Their carne asada is hard to beat."}
{"text":"My quest for the perfect breakfast burrito near my hood led me to Poliberto's this morning. At $3.25/breafastirito, their prices are good.

My potato/egg/cheese burrito was tasty & so was their hot sauce. The green is hotter than the red.

I added guacamole to my rito when I ordered, but when I got home and started gouging myself & chowing down, I was a bit disappointed to find that the bit of guac was concentrated almost entirely near the bottom of the burrito. Other than the guac skimping, I thoroughly enjoyed the burrito & will most likely be back. The quest continues!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. 

My dad and I loved going to Burrito Bandito in Glendale when I was young. They served \"baby banditos\" or mini cheese chimis. They had the best yellow sauce too. They've been closed for awhile, but I found a yelp review saying this location served their own version. We were so excited! 

However, after ordering we were made aware they were out of an ingredient to make the sauce for the mini chimis. She offered sour cream OR guacamole. I chose both. She proceeded to give me 1 minuscule container of each! 

To make it worse, I ordered mini cheese chimis. However when we started eating they had cheese and beef?? I'm not sure if they accidentally gave us the beef chimis, or if the cheese for some reason comes with meat anyway.  

On top of all that, they closed the window and walked away, failing to give me the soda we ordered. I went to Garcia's to pick up a pint of their jalapeño cream cheese to eat with the chimis. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Tortas are monstrous but not as tasty as I hoped, the onion and tomatoes in my sandwich were tough. I wish the horchata was self serve, its delicious!."}
{"text":"Found a new favorite. The Carne Asada Nachos. Loaded with meat, cheese, sour cream and chips. I assume they come with Guac too but I forgo that part. Be sure to get pico with it. 

The kids said the bean burritos were not as good as before. BUT said the tacos were yummy. David may be on to something."}
{"text":"I didn't feel it was fair to give this place only one star without actually going inside as atmosphere/cleanliness is one of the categories I like to rate on. I had a positive drive through experience.  The service was prompt and friendly.  

I was surprised when I tried to order a diet soda and they told me they don't have diet anymore.  

I ordered the Carne asada burrito.  The size was somewhat small compared to many other places.  The tortilla was dried out and split on me while I was eating the burrito.  It looked and tasted like it had been frozen at one time.  The Carne asada was a little salty.  I had to constantly spit out pieces of gristle and fat as I was eating.  It was the worst Carne asada I've ever had.  There was very little guacamole and the pico was non-existent.  

For a burritothat size that cost over $7 I would expect a much better quality meat.  I was very dissapointed and will not return."}
{"text":"They have good food, what I don't like is the tip jar hanging out the drive thru window.   I mean they're not doing anything more than a Mcdonalds employee they're not serving me at a table and refilling my soda so I'm confused why the tip jar."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing.

Me and my father used to frequent this location after discovering that their food was fairly good compared to our local ramiros, but boy has it ever gone down hill!

First things first, my order was completely wrong. I ordered one red chilli burrito, two shredded beef tacos, 5 rolled chicken tacos and 8 cheese mini chimis.

1. The red chilli burrito:
--First I'd like to mention that we did in fact NOT receive the red chilli burrito, but instead we were given the chicken burrito with green chilli sauce. It had a spiciness to it, but eventually we stopped half way and decided it wasn't worth it after looking at the rest of the meal.

2. The shredded beef tacos.
--The beef didn't taste bad, but the tacos weren't even crispy! not to mention the box was FULL of grease at the bottom. YUCK!

3. The rolled chicken tacos.
--Obviously they had been double fried. Most likely a wrong item from a previous order or was cooked by accident and then pulled out again when the item was ordered. Full of grease, overcooked, tasteless meat... not to mention the guacamole that came with it was already slightly turning brown.

4. Mini chimis
--I ordered cheese and got a mixture of half cheese and half some sort of mystery meat that I couldn't determine what it was. I ended up cutting these up and feeding them to our dog, to which I discovered that these were also most likely double-fried and also seemed to be getting old as the meat was appearing to change color.

All in all, we are EXTREMELY disappointed! The food used to be so much better... so what happened?!!?! Food is clearly going bad and food is being double-fried to give off the impression that it was fresh!

We will NOT be returning here. I'm sad I spent 17 good dollars here on shitty food.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and dropped by to grab a bite to eat.  It looks like many of the Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, so I was expecting it to be pretty good.  Boy was I disappointed!  Here's what I ordered:

Carne Asada Taco, $3.25
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=T9aXK2Wj3MhupooxqD_k4Q#T9aXK2Wj3MhupooxqD_k4Q

Carnitas Taco, $2.65
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=GamyRxhVKMb4tbQR-ss9jw#GamyRxhVKMb4tbQR-ss9jw

Beans, Rice, Cheese Burrito, $2.99 + $.065 (Rice)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/polibertos-phoenix?select=ZOK8OWJR0DTI8bC0-kfSYw#ZOK8OWJR0DTI8bC0-kfSYw

The portion size is very large, so you get your money's worth as far as quantity, but the quality was terrible.

I tried the Carnitas Taco first....took one bite and immediately didn't like it.  Why?  The Carnitas was \"rubbery\" and lacked flavor...it was bland.  It was so gross, I only took 2 bites hoping the 2nd would be better (it wasn't), so I didn't finish it.

Next was the Carne Asada Taco....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  The Steak had a lot of fat and was \"chewy\".  It also didn't taste good to me and I didn't finish that either.

Last was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  I was hoping it would salvage my meal, but sadly it didn't.  It was very salty and the Beans tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while.  It didn't taste fresh.  The saltiness was very hard to overcome and I also didn't finish that portion.

I threw way 1/2 of my meal....that's why I gave this place 2 Stars.  It was the worst I've had since moving to the Phoenix area.

Return Factor - 5%"}
{"text":"Tacos had a good taste seasoned well. The price was right beans were very good. If your in the area stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first and LAST time ever coming to this location. No one at their place and no one in line at the drive thru window,  and we still got the crappiest service ever.  Maria Madrid has no customer service skills,  didn't get the order right,  and had the nerve to get upset when we corrected her.  Basically closed the window on me mid-sentence.  So, we got our money back and went down the street to Filibertos. So so much better!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Portion size was great.. a little to much for me but most people would find that as a huge plus. 

I got the carne asada burrito!! YUMM YUMM. i tried all the salsas too. they were very good. 
the service was friendly and the food was good what else could you ask for! 

final.. Price was nice, food was great! service with a smile! I will be back for seconds :)"}
{"text":"I just went through the drive through where no one answered the speaker or would come to the window. Normally I would just leave, but I'm really in the mood for a breakfast burrito so I parked to come inside and the doors are locked! There are no signs saying they have closed and the 'Open' neon lights are on."}
{"text":"This place is not only the worst, as they always run out of food. They have their employees working over 100hrs without paying them and they only report up to 40 hrs to EDD so they wont pay overtime. The food is extremely over priced and the cashiers have no customer service skills!!!! Think twice before stoping in to eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I had the chicken burrito. It was packed with delicious moist perfectly seasoned pollo!! The salsa was good too. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"1)  The bean and cheese burrito only has an undetectable amount of cheese.  If you order \"extra cheese\", then the amount of cheese does not change.

2) The shrimp burrito is EXTRA spicy, which I suspect is to cover up the taste of old shrimp.

3) The machaca burrito and horchata are good.

4) The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Okay, this should be 3.5 stars - but I rounded down because of the price uppings on the menu...which I understand - but the duct tape was a bit tacky. They could have at least gone with some masking tape. :)

Food was good. I even branched out from my normal 'Bertos ordering of the carnitas plate (\"It just happens to be my favorite, and I order it ... in every dive I go to in this country\"...name that actor that I'm paraphrasing).

I didn't branch out too much - went carnitas taco and 3rolled tacos with guac. Guac was good, a bit less chunky thatn I prefer, but not bad. Coulda been spiced up a bit...I suspect its more of an avocado puree than a true guac. 

Carnitas had good shells (2 soft/warm corn, like it should). Nice crust on the meat. Really seared it well. 

Can't remember what GF had...shredded beef tacos I'd bet. That's her 'Berto's go-to. 

All in all, not bad. If anyone can explain that wooden structure hanging below the drop ceiling for no apparent reason, I'd like to hear what your theory on it is. 

We'd stop in again, but there's a few other 'Berto's just as close (or closer) that we'd probably hit up first."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos and their beans are amazingly creamy. Customer service is always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito EXCELLENT. First visit at lunch today many more to follow. Great food and the guy at the drive through was very pleasant. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been doing a tour of Valley taco shops of late, searching for the perfect chicken taco. Poliberto's served one of the most impressive I've seen. Huge! Overflowing with lettuce and tomatoes. Only one problem. Hardly any chicken! What the heck? Definitely confusing.

The restaurant itself is clean and bright. The layout, which features long tables in addition to booths, is great for large groups. The salsa bar is well maintained. The menu is diverse. The counter staff is very friendly. Good specials. A drive-thru. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, they do not offer any diet sodas. I asked the young worker behind the counter if they had Diet Coke, just to be sure, and she actually grimaced at the question. Must be a common request. No problem. It's good for us all to cut down on diet soda in favor of tea and water in any case. I guess Polibertos is just looking out for us. 

I haven't always had the best of luck with restaurants ending in \"bertos\" over the years, but Polibertos seems a bit above the rest. I will definitely give them another try when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The carne asada fries here were freaking B.O.M.B.!!! I've been eating carne asada fries since 2002 and was fortunately enough to start on my journey of deliciousness in San Diego, CA ... so I fancy myself as sort of an expert in carne asada fries. After I moved away from SD, I once visited SD for five nights and had carne asada fries at a different taco shop each night ... yeah I am that obsessed. 

I first time i tried the fries was on a Saturday night to-go, at home with some beers. The carne asada was good quality and flavorful. The fries were nice and crispy. The salsa verde (my favorite) had a little bit of sour and a little bit of kick. They also had a salsa roja and a darker red salsa...both pretty good too - not watery like at other places. The guac isn't what you'd think of as guacamole but is little creamier... probably because it would be too expensive to use real guac but still good. Overall, these were solid fries that could have competed with San Diego's finest. And at $7.25 they are cheaper too!

The second time I got the fries was on Sunday morning. I was so addicted I needed to have more for breakfast. This time the fries weren't as crisp but the meat and everything else was still good. I also ordered some menudo... everybody that was at the restaurant that morning seemed to be eating it. I asked one guy and he said it was good and he'd been coming to Poliberto for years for the menduo. The last time I had menudo in high school, so I decided to get an order to go. It is a lot of soup and a lot of tripe with some warm tortillas on the side... not quite my thing, but it was good. I am not going to rate them on the menudo b/c I don't profess to know what a good menudo should taste like... but if you aren't use to it you might want to stick to the normal burritos, tacos and of course CARNE ASADA FRIES."}
{"text":"This is officially my new go to mexican joint. 3 mini tacos (loaded with your choice of meat, onions, cilantro and guac) , rice and beans, and a medium drink for $8.30 (rounded) - great deals and great food! And lots of options."}
{"text":"Poli is a little different than some of the other ~bertos places, with a bit of variety in the menu and a bunch of quality in the food.
The place is clean and the booths are quite cushy and comfortable.
It was good, but fuhDANGah i can't be loose enough to give 'em more than a 4.0

The Carnitas taco was great.  (that's pork for the gringos and recent transplants) It came in full size, not tiny, soft corn tortillas, with roasted pork chunks covered in a drizzle of \"guac-like sauce / saucy guac\" and some pico de gallo.  The pork was standout - tasty and tender and not dry at all.

The Pollo (chicken, Guero!) taco was good, as well, but not the best I've had.  Shredded chicken was moist, sure, but this stuff is always precooked and waiting in a watery broth to be tong'd out into a waiting shell, so not too hard to be decent.  Poli's was average to good in the meat, generous with lettuce and cheese, but the hard corn shell was not the right consistency and crumbled into my hand as i ate.

There was a Carne Asade Nacho (grilled meat and chips, Pan Blanco!) plate that was about a foot in diameter and about a third as high.  It looked impressive, but the meaty bit I sampled had a wierd taste -- good at first, but then almost 'fishy' later.  Who knows. 8^ |

NQI Napkin Quality Index : poor, not the worst i've encountered, but only a 2 star napkin experience, as best.

I will be making more return visits, but this does not earn the title of the best hole in the wall mexican joint from me.  (A title a Somethingberto's near you is wishing hard that they had!)"}
{"text":"The food's been improving lately but the Polibertos at 43rd and Glendale tastes better and is open 24/7."}
{"text":"Their mini chimis are almost identical to Baby Banditos(RIP burrito bandito). I'm pretty sure they use the same recipe for the cream chees, it's bomb 
I got the chicken mini chimis,  my only complaint is they use dark meat.  Which is gross"}
{"text":"Boooooo! I boo you, Polibertos!! Let me ask you, does it take you all day to go through those pinto beans, pull out the little stones, any bad beans, soak them overnight to begin your refried bean making process?? Hhhhhhheeeelllllll no it doesn't!! What you most likely do is take your happy asses to Smart & Final and pick up a big ass can of Rosarito Beans!! You probably got Ortega taco shells up in this joint too, huh?!?!?! Your salsa is WWWWEAK and your carne asada is a big NOPE!!

I'm gonna call this place MexiCANNED Food.

Thanks for wasting my time, beeches!"}
