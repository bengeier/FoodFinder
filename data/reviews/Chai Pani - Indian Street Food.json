{"text":"Is street food supposed to be this good? The tandoori prawns in coconut sauce changed my life. If you are headed east out of downtown, checking out Yelp, get the hell off the train and get yourself a chai and a curry."}
{"text":"I had butter Chicken with rice. Unfortunately, they don't serve naan bread anymore... I was like, what?! They gave me Roni wrap instead... Also, it makes me sick twice when I had Butter Chicken, I don't know what happened to the first day of the grand opening, they served the delicious meals... I hope they get improved by then. 
*disappointed* *concerned*"}
{"text":"This is a fast food version of the previous Mango Shiva which many of us really enjoyed until it's demise last year.
Food is pretty tasty and seems similar but not exactly the same as Mango Shiva. Butter chicken, beef curry and shrimp curry were all done well.  Menu choices reduced to manageable selection.  
However wish they had choice of real naan instead of just reheated pita bread.  
Food is ordered at the counter and delivered to your table.  Seems like more and more of these casual restaurants are going to this format of order and pay first.  I'm guessing that they may have trouble seating everyone during prime times so be prepared to take out if no seats available.
Overall nice concept and decently priced."}
{"text":"Quick, flavourful lunch- I enjoyed chicken tandoori in a Kati wrap while my lunch mate enjoyed her beef Malaysian curry bowl (option brown or white rice).  While I don't love chicken tandoori, I wanted a \"baseline\" of taste from a popular dish. This version was good, but I actually prefer a lot more heat.  Servings were large and filling.  The menu offered more intriguing vegetarian options that I will try next time.  Cute place, friendly and prompt service.  Free 2 hour parking surrounds this place, making it even more appealing as an option just outside downtown."}
{"text":"Decent Indian Snack corner. Chat is a type of Indian snack. We ordered chat, Samosa and chai (tea). It was decent, nothing exceptional. Still glad that there's this place to satisfy craving of chat :)

Will try again."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! I ordered the tamarind coconut prawns and they were delicious. The prawns were large and very good quality. The only reason this isn't a 5 Star review is that I paid extra for cauliflower \"rice\", which is actually a mix of basmati and cauliflower, and I had a really hard time finding any actual cauliflower in the rice. I felt a bit ripped off as I paid a premium for something nearly undetectable. Lesson learned - I will return but will not be ordering the cauli rice!"}
