{"text":"Total gem overlooking Place Jacques Cartier. Wine and small plates in a chic setting high above the tourist throng. We went during our first visit to Montreal and the views, location, food, and service were exactly what we were looking for. Loved the salmon poke and the guacamole."}
{"text":"Un terasse à couper le souffle dans le vieux port ! Sur le toit de l'hôtel William grey , ce spot est parfait pour prendre un verre et apprécier la vue sur le vieux ! En plus, avec la nouvelle grande roue les photos prisent sur la terasse sont parfaites pour un post instagram réussis haha   Ils vendent aussi de la bouffe, mais je ne l'ai pas testé :)   Bref, je vais y retourner c'est certain!"}
{"text":"Updated Review 2.0 with food. I went to perché on a Saturday evening- greeted by the hostess at the entrance - I told her I wanted a table for 2. She didn't even bother following up with me in regards to the wait time for our table.  We made our way upstairs and was greeted by a second hostess - nobody bothered to stop and greet us. Seated at the bar - we had to flag down a bartender just to make an order_minus 1 *. Shortly, we did eventually get our own table. Seems like customer service is subpar on busy evenings compared to during weekday happy hour - the staff is more attentive. Touché  I ordered food this time around to share : on 5 Stars : salmon tartar**** (onions, avocados being a strong element if the dish) with 4 biscuits; pulled pork tacos * (the meat was so underseasoned!!! Bland and no flavours- served as three pieces). Food =Minus 1 *  For cocktails: we tried the carprinha pina and the Margaux L. Both were strong  drinks but lacked a punch for the 12-16$ price range.  Overall 3 stars - great design of terasse but needs improvement in other departments."}
{"text":"Only great thing about perche is the view. Probably the best view of the Old Port. Decor is really good too. However my compliments end there. The staff really needs to be trained. Waited 30min just to give my drink order. Another issue; food choice is limited. The poke bowl was good but not the best I've had. Also no dessert on their menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful rooftop terrasse on top of hotel in Old Montreal. It took about an hour to get a drink order in even though it wasn't busy. I asked to replace Bombay with Ungava gin in my drink and it wasn't done. Friend asked for extra lime and it never arrived. Overall the drinks were mediocre. Nothing special. Decent food selection on menu, I was gonna order something but waiter never around. Service is dry but not rude. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a low key, classy and trendy rooftop bar to enjoy an afternoon cocktail, you have come to the right place.  I went to Auberge Port on my last trip to Montreal and thought it was all the rage.  Then we found this place (b/c Auberge was closed due to weather). This spot is covered, has a Miami-esqe vibe with all the white and green décor. Service is great and price is just right.  Not too crowded was the best part and the clientele was 30's - 50's so nothing too young and clubby. We appreciated it!  Great, random find (it is nestled off the main stretch in Old Port) in an alley."}
{"text":"Vraiment très belle terrasse dans le Vieux-Port! La vue est incroyable et les drinks sont bons! Evidemment, ils sont chers (entre 12 et 17$ le drink), mais on est dans le Vieux-Port, on s'y attendait! Je n'ai pas goûté à la nourriture, mais il semblait y avoir un menu pas pire si tu as une fringale!   Je vous le suggère, c'est vraiment beau et ça fait très \"classy\"!"}
{"text":"I went there recently  Beautiful view to the place jacques cartier of the old port Beautiful Terrace i loved the vibe , the crow and the service ( even though there was a mixup on our order )  I very much recommend this terrace cocktails are very good and they also serve food ( which i did not have on my visit )  But for the view itself and the decor ...5 stars !"}
