{"text":"Went on April 14 2017 the food was very good and the service was great. One thing I would suggest is to change or increase their beer selections. No named brand as Molson , etc"}
{"text":"Really quite mediocre Thai food. My husband & I have been here for dinner twice and neither one of us really enjoyed our appetizers or entrées either time. It was all \"just okay\"... Gave it 2 tries (2008 and 2015) & ordered differently both times too, and just not impressed either time.  The location is great if you can secure a seat out back on the terrasse...."}
{"text":"Best thai food restaurant on the island of Montreal. One thing I miss since moving to Montreal from the west island are my regular visits to Chalet Thai. Their signature peanut sauce is to die for!  Best things on the menu: shrimp in peanut sauce, cold spring rolls, papaya salad, tofu vegetables (in either garlic sauce or red curry) and of course the sticky rice! The ingredients are always fresh and the sauces are incredibly flavourful. I've tried just about everything on the menu so I can say with certainty that no matter what you decide to order, you'll be happy. All the dishes can be best described as both playfully delicate and satisfying. However, you might be disappointed by the pad thai if you're hoping for something traditional. The pad thai at Chalet Thai deviates from the norm.  The atmosphere is also wonderful. They play beautiful thai music on their speaker system and the decor is tasteful.  If it's warm enough, I suggest sitting outside. Their terasse is right on the boardwalk giving you a clear view of the boats cruising on the St. Lawrence."}
{"text":"Excellent Resto Thaï, partant de la Rive Nord de Montréal nous y allons au mois trois fois par années. Ça vaux vraiment la peine de faire 45 minutes de voitures pour déguster les plats servis. Les entrées sont servis avec très bon goût et les plats principaux sont irréprochables! Pour l'endroit avec vue sur l'eau je donne un 4 Pour les plats, je donne un 5 Pour l'accueil et le service, je donne un 5 En bref, emplacement, qualité prix, service, et goût je dois de donner un vrais 5 étoiles pour l'ensemble.  Je le recommande très profondément. Richard G"}
{"text":"Définitivement les meilleurs plats thaï ! Je suis en amour avec cette petite place, avec son personnel chaleureux, leur menu qui est bon de A à Z a un prix abordable, en plus de leur terrasse avec vue sur le bord de l'eau. À essayer absolument !"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the salmon and curry dish on my first visit to this restaurant.  I loved it so much that I am looking forward to my visit in two days.  The restaurant is along the famous Ste-Anne boardwalk.  You have the choice of sitting inside or our on the terrace.  We sat outside on this visit.  The service is good and the prices typical of a restaurant of this caliber.  Ah, but the food!  I wasn't expecting to fall in love with my meal.  I love salmon, and I love curry.  I just never had them together in the same dish.  I asked for spicy, and I learned later that the waitress had asked for extra-spicy since the dish is served spicy.  That was okay, I had tears coming down my cheeks, but I love spices, so it was fine.  :)  I would definitely recommend that you check out this restaurant at least once if you are in the area."}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants in Saint-Anne's, the service was friendly and the food was really delicious.. We order the red curry, general tao(very impressed) and some pas Thai.. We really enjoyed the pad Thai it was one of the best we've had in a while.. Drinks are very well made as well but a little on the expensive side yet totally worth it because of the nice view we had in the summertime. Would recommend to ask and sit in the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad. Portions are small but quality good with excellent taste. I ordered the curry seafood. And enjoyed every once."}
{"text":"Decent Thai, especially given the lack of such restos on the west island. Nice view of the water, which is standard for this part of town."}
