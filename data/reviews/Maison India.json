{"text":"One of the best Indian places in the city. Super friendly staff and under new management. It's actually better than it was before and it was amazing back then too. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Montreal, never disappointed in the food and always excellent and friendly service!"}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet. There was a nice variety of food and it was flavourful and good. Staff was friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like you're Indian food drenched in corn syrup then this place is for you. Everything on the menu is either very sweet or too salty. I understand toning down the spice for North- American taste buds, but at least leave a bit of the wonderful flavours and aromas of India in your dishes!. This place is also way over-priced."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and I really enjoy getting take-out from them, though it's also very pleasant to eat in. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is just excellent. Very good Indian cuisine at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went there on an week night, service was excellent (french and english), and the food absolutely stunning. Get the combo menu, you get to taste lots of things and portions are generous so you can share and even take some home. Butter chicken is to die for. We tried another Indian restaurant nearby after this one, but nothing beats Maison India, it's by far the best Indian food I've had. They also have lunch buffet on weekdays."}
{"text":"A great neighbourhood Indian place with good service and reliable food, all at reasonable prices. You probably won't find it in any resto guide but it boasts a devoted clientele. Tandoori chicken and aloo ghobi are great. Their take on chana masala is more tomatoey than u might be used to but quite good. Spices are fairly reasonable but they can accommodate u if u want to blast out your sinuses. Naan is fluffy but firm enough to mop up with. A solid standby when u want uncomplicated Indian food."}
{"text":"I was super skeptical of this place. Prices are about 1/3 more than the typical \"diner-style\" Indian restaurants where I usually go. The manager (I think?) was a bit snooty and I did not get a welcoming vibe from him. But other servers were super hospitable and respectful, and the manager seemed to warm up/loosen up as the night went on.   Basic dinner entrees (such as butter chicken or sag paneer) are ~$13 and do not come with rice or naan (costs extra), and \"fancier\" dinner entrees (like lamb tandoori) are ~$25 (but come with rice). BUT -- this was hands-down the best Indian food I have ever had.   This is the place to go (more so than stars of India) if you're trying to impress a date with good Indian food in a romantic atmosphere. Not a place I would go at dinner time with colleagues unless we were a large group (dim lighting and candles make it a bit too \"date-ish\").   Because of the price differential, if you just need to scratch a samosa or naan bread itch, a quick and no-frills Indian restaurant would be just fine. But if you're looking to indulge, impress, or just treat yourself with unforgettable Indian food, this is a place you shouldn't miss.  Have yet to try the lunch buffet ($15 M-F), but given how the dinner here was clearly of superior quality to most other Indian restos we frequent -- the buffet here might be the best steal in town."}
{"text":"I went to Maison India for dinner, with the Yelp rating as a basis for the decision. As someone who has grown up in London, going to Brick Lane every once in a while for my curry fix - I have finally found British-style Indian curry in Montreal. There are a couple of places in Toronto that come close (Biryani House, and Banjara), but this really hit the spot if you an ex-pat with expectation of proper northern India / Bengali / UK style curries.  I ordered the vindaloo expecting a watered down experience, but found myself panting. Hot meant hot! Service was friendly - they even offered up some yoghurt to quench the fire. The dhansak was hot and tasty. Nan was decent - almost the size of a medium pizza. Will definitely return, but will order the Madras. I'm conservative when dishing out the 5-star ratings - and this gets the 5 for being the best British curry house in Canada... so far - if you think you know a better one, message me!"}
{"text":"Excellent service et poulet au beurre. Demandez le cari de tilapia."}
{"text":"Great location, and fantastic food! If you feel like you want to order in, no problem. You can pick it up at the restaurant.   I went there when my family from the States was visiting and my aunt said that she liked it a lot! The food is fast and properly made. The waiters are nice and always helpful, and if I say so myself, the after mint chocolate is delicious!    The portions are huge so you are never starving by the end of the night, and there is a bar that has a full bar if you feel that urge and desire to have a drink in between or before your meal!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most satisfying meals we've had in a long time. If you haven't been here in a while, the management has changed, along with the decor and the service. But I will get to that later. We started with mains - Dahl soup, perfect for the sudden change in weather and so tasty, with a good spinkle of coriander (if you're not into it ask them to skip it.) It was a good start. Next came the onion Baji. They weren't your usual runof-the-mill round balls but rather flat disks, accompanied by a selection of three sauces (hot, tamirind and mint.) They were sublime. The papadum was nice and crispy, with plenty of jeera throughout. The appetizers alone would be worth writing home about. The three mains orderded were Madras chicken, Butter Chicken (which we called Candy chicken for our 3.5 year old) and the Fish Curry. Everything was outstanding. The Nan bread was great, fluffy in parts and crunchy in others. At the end of the meal, the kind and helpful staff, who are eager to please, offered my son a desert, which they garnished beautifully with his name spelled out in chocolate sauce.   Since we were last there the traditional decor now includes heart-shaped lighting along the walls and we remarked that were served by an all - female staff. Different from the norm... which is just how I would describe this reinvented little gem on Sherbrooke St. They're also a BYOB establishment now with a SAQ 4 blocks West.  We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Evenings in the summer are the best here with a small outdoor terrace. The food is not inspired but is consistent and good. Love the Dal Makhani. The Samosas are delish. Service is fast and friendly. Good veg/vegan options.Wine prices are fair. And they deserve support for their generosity to those less fortunate. this December 23rd they will feed 500 people in need of a warm meal."}
{"text":"Restaurant super chic serveur aimable et surtout nourriture extraordinaire et les portions sont généreuses nous sommes repartis avec un restant et presque tous les gens qui mangeaient ce soir sont reparti eux aussi avec un sac"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, the Nan bread was hard, the butter chicken sauce was good but very liquid and all the meat were over cooked (hard). Everything was still tasty, but not up to expectations, especially for the price."}
{"text":"The calling card of this restaurant is the food quality.   If you have discerning taste for foods made with high quality cuts of meat and spices, then this is a restaurant for you.   The chefs put a high amount of effort into their offerings.  I've had the chicken jalfrazi, chicken tikka masala, vegetable aloo gobi, lamb biryani and spinach saag aloo.    All were excellent choices that I look forward to having again in the future.  The flavours of the spices and the dishes were well balanced and delicious.  The extra dollar or two that you may pay for the dishes here are more than made up for in quality."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service was horrible. Although the staff is courteous, I'm unsure if this was a particular evening where they were under-staffed, but it took the server 25-30 minutes before coming to our table and taking a first order (drinks or other), and the food took 1-hour before it landed on our table. The restaurant wasn't even particularly busy that evening. Most customers kept going the cash/kitchen and asking for service or asking what was taking so long, which is unacceptable for a restaurant business. Great food, but will not be returning as the service takes far too long to deliver."}
{"text":"This would be passable Indian food for a penguin. It's a tad more flavourful than frozen water. This place is unfortunately quite subpar. I had a vegetarian thali (prix-fixe tasting platter) which included dal (lentils) & sag paneer (spinach with homemade Indian cheese)  & mixed vegetables served with plain nan (flatbread) with rice. Nothing was good at all. You know how black is the absence of colour ... this food is the absence of flavour. The dal was the most flavourful dish out of the whole lot. They put a single clove of garlic in a sixty litre vat with a spitting of some cumin and that's it that's all. The spinach and cheese was bland as bland can be. It wouldn't have surprised me if they'd probably had put some cold British mushy peas on a plate with some curry powder and call it Indian cuisine. Really really really bland. The mixed vegetables were also bland and were probably sprinkled with some yellow (hopefully turmeric and not FD&C Yellow number 5) colour.   I think this is one of those typical shitty Montréal Indian restos where they dumb down the flavour to cater to a less experienced and less sophisticated and less worldly palate.  \" Vive le Québec ennuyeux \" This is Indian food for penguins. The most pungent flavours at this place are salt and ketchup.   For good northern Indian food go to Pushap on Paré and for good southern Indian food go to Thanjai on VanHorne."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the better buffets in Montreal, but those days are over. Very average buffet for the price (14$). Only 4-5 hot entrees and no pakora, salad, or other apps.  Was not well stocked when I visited with some dishes nearly empty. Dessert was just some sad fruit in plastic cups. Taj downtown is a much better deal at only 4$ more.  Save your money."}
{"text":"We live in NDG and always order our Indian food from this place.    I've eaten there a few times for the buffet (totally worth the cost).    Fresh, fabulous, great service.     As for delivery - they have a huge menu with something for everybody and it gets to you fast. I've been to their competition across the street (Ganges) which is also good but this place seems a little more relaxed and the food is always terrific. You should go!"}
{"text":"This one took me by surprise.   Sherbrooke Street has an interesting street life, with little restaurants on every block. Maison India (India House) is one of many that have sidewalk tables with a white picket fence around it and blooming flowers.  It doesn't have many reviews, but most seem very positive.  I join the list of those enchanted by the cuisine and friendly service. Perhaps, it was partially the opportunity to order Indian food in French that started off this experience so well.   The draft Biere Indien was a blond with a definite English attitude. We both enjoyed it throughout the meal.    Our appetizer was Bhaji aux Oignons (Onion Fritters) with choice of three dipping sauces.  The Tamarind was best.  The Bhaji tasted freshly made; the cooking oil not leaving extraneous tastes of where it had been before.    We also shared Poulet au Beurre style Indien (Butter Chicken) which arrived in a flaming sunset colored semi-sweet and nuanced mild curry sauce.  This was one of the best Butter Chicken dishes I have tried anywhere. Tender chicken, great spice mix, creamy sauce.  It all came together well. And, of course, the Nan a L'ail (Garlic Naan) to soak it up and savor.  This Naan came out uncut on a large plate.  We had to get physical with it and rip it apart for each piece we wanted.  It was hot, loaded with minced garlic, and not overly oily.  The baker is a big asset.   The Bangan Bhaji (Spicy Eggplant) was also quite good and a nice complement to the Chicken.   To our surprise the House provided us with a free dessert, Mango Glace (Mango Ice Cream), which was cold, creamy and a perfect counterpoint to the curry, garlic and coriander.   This was a first rate meal. I would definitely return here next time in Montreal. Next time I want to try a Mango Lassi, as everything else was so good that my favorite Indian drink should be phenomenal."}
{"text":"Our favourite Indian restaurant! Great vegetarian special, and we just had the veggie masala which was delish! Sag paneer, aloo ghabi, raita, samosas, naan all wonderful! Had issues with the online ordering (timed out and had to redo my order) and the delivery guy is a jerk. We stopped ordering for a while after the guy demanded a bigger tip, complaining that we lived far, which was bull. We tipped fairly. With tonight's delivery, the guy was trying to vie for a bigger tip again. Service at the resto is always good. Thought the owners should know that the delivery guy could cost them business."}
{"text":"Service was great till we neared the end of our meal.  Took 40 min to get our bill and get out.  Plus they don't take Amex.  Food was mediocre but the price was reasonable, get what you pay for I suppose!  Next time I would order separate dishes rather than their packages.  The brown sauce rocks!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian Food and wonderful staff.  Second time here and they recognized me! Impressive."}
{"text":"The restaurant I was aiming for wasn't open, so decided to try out the lunch buffet here and was pleasantly surprised!  There were soups, salads, vegetarian dishes as well as several meat dishes to choose from. All for a very affordable price.  The quality of the food was good as was the taste.  One star off as the naan was a tad dry and the dessert lacked a bit of attention."}
{"text":"I  went to Maison India. I had a chicken curry  It had a nice spicy taste. The service was very good. I think anything on the menu would be good."}
{"text":"Went there for their Sunday Brunch Buffet and I was not disappointed.   The price was $15.95 for all you can eat.    Great selection of 3 chicken dishes (Butter, Boha, Tandoori), lamb dish, vegetarian dishes, veggie spring roll, two types of rice, Daal soup, salad, etc..   The spices were flavorful and they tasted fresh.   The staff was very pleasant and they told me that some of these dishes were from the Bengal region, which I have not been familiar with...most of the Indian food in the US comes from Southern Indian cuisines.   Nice change.  I would go back !"}
{"text":"This place was alright. A-OK. It had great things, but also pretty bad things, hence putting it in the middle.  Firstly, service was generally pretty good, though that was a bit tainted by some other factors. We got there about 30min before last order, though they said we can stay as long as we want. Very welcoming, but as soon as the clock hit last order, all the staff came out and brought dishes and were speaking very loudly in Indian and bustling around us, while we were still on our appetizers. Whenever we asked for anything, they were really nice, but it was mega uncomfortable after that. Pretty unprofessional.  Also, the menu had lots of great options, and for good prices. We got the mixed starter with 2 of everything. It was really good, and we each got a curry/rice/bread. Both were excellent. What wasn't excellent, is that we also wanted wine. Now on the wine menu, the cheapest wine bottle available is $30. And it's the same bottle that costs $9 at the SAQ. The next is $40, and it's $12 at the SAQ. Now I understand prices need to be up, but marking wine bottles more than double, in fact more than triple, is absolutely ridiculous. Especially in a place that has really cheap priced food, pictures in the menu, and a buffet centered through the place. Next door, L'etoile Des Indes offers much more intimate dining, same food etc, but $20+ wines.  So we had a mixture of 4 star and 2 star happenings during our dinner. In my eye, Maison India should be visited if you want to go in the afternoon for the buffet and not really dining or wine. If you want wine and dining, go L'Etoile Des Indes.  Both places are good, just offer different things."}
{"text":"Even if it's a little bit pricey, the food at Maison India is incredibly good. The best deal you can have is the lunch buffet - really worth it!! I'm in love with their salad, a dish you don't find often in Indian restaurant menus. They have a huge variety of dishes : any Indian meal you can think of, it's on the menu. If there is one thing that I could tell the staff for the betterment of the place, it would be to stop staring at customers when they eat... It's pretty embarrassing! Good restaurant though!! :)"}
{"text":"This is some darn good, fresh food. My hubby & I have ordered delivery from Masion India several times recently and every time we have extremely enjoyed the food. The Peshawari Nan bread is my favorite. Excellent butter chicken. We also love the Veggie Pilau rice. We plan to go in person to try the buffet. Luckily, we live a short bus ride away. Return worthy for delivery, for sure! I'll be sure to post an updated review to let you know my rating and comments for my in-house experience."}
{"text":"Really surprised! Everything was good from the bajis to the naam bread! Like many Indian restaurants, the decor is really tacky.....but who cares!!! We took the table d'hôte for one wich include 1 vegeterian plate + 1 meat plate + samosas + soup and desert and had enough food for two plus a small doggy bag!!! Will defenitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place with my mom a few nights ago. Two entrees, one appetizer, rice and naan came to over $60, which seemed quite high for a meal without drinks. The food was alright, but not spectacular, especially given the price paid; $20 for a shrimp entree, really? The lamb zhalfrezi was passable but the portion was on the small side, not nearly filling the takeout dish, or leaving any leftovers for the next day as is typical of Indian takeout in my experience. I'll definitely be exploring other options in the area before ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Don't let the kitschy decor fool you. The food here is really good! The service was slow to start but when we had the waiter's attention, service was very good as well. We each got the \"table d'hôte\" so we could taste as much as we could and didn't regret it. Everything was good, well spiced up. We asked for spicy hot and the waiter suggested \"madras\" level. We're going for \"vindaloo\" level at the least next time! In the table d'hôte you had the choice of soup, appetizer, main (meat), main (vegetable), naan or rice, choice of dessert and tea or coffee. All that for 35$. My evening there made me a very happy person! Great food, good service and not too expensive! 100$ taxes and tips included for two tables d'hôte with a pint of taj mahal beer (the only thing i didn't like :/ ). We even have enough food for another dinner for two!!! Ain't that cool?!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food, nothing surprising exept the nice lamp, good service, price ok, nice decoration, many tables but the little dessert is expensive...."}
