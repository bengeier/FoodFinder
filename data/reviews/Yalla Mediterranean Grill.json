{"text":"I don't I now where to begin. The pita is amazing. Obviously made right there. The hummus is fresh and seasoned to perfection. The gyro meat... I've never had gyro meat as delicious and juicy as they had.

I got the gyro shwarma and it was incredible. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro and it was chopped up instead of sliced and grilled so long it tasted like a well done burrito. I guess I should have ordered the shawarma. It was terrible."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe anyone gave this place less than 4 stars, they must have been having a bad day! I love Mediterranean food, and have tried every place I could find over the past few years here in the valley. Some have been good and some have been ok, but this place really stands out because the food is exceptional!

If you like schwarma, you are in for a real treat. The chicken is hot and moist, and seasoned perfectly. Don't forget the garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food- baklava and pita that is made in-house.  My 11y/o son loved the gyro.  My kabobs were delicious. Our server,Miranda, was friendly and attentive.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and all we have to say is WOW! The food was excellent and tasted home made. 
Audi, our server was amazing she was very friendly and informative. I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Stephanos used to be my go-to place for Greek and Mediterranean, but I think from now on I'll go here! The best and yummiest thing about this place: COMPLIMENTARY pita bread with za'atar and olive oil. Unlike other Greek places, the hot and fresh pita bread is made with love in the kitchen. I could solely eat this, and be 100% satisfied. 

But moving forth, I ordered the gyro shawarma (the beef and lamb mix) plate, and tasted the falafel. I realize that I can't eat too much red meat, or it'll upset my stomach, and the plate comes with a ton of meat. Thank goodness for the hummus and rice, because they both balance out the richness of the meat. Lastly, the falafel was delish. None of the spices were too overwhelming, and although fried, it felt light on the stomach. Next time I come here, I'm definitely going to order the falafel instead of meat. :)"}
{"text":"My recent visit to Yalla has me seriously questioning their negative Yelp reviews. My group was warmly welcomed the moment we stepped into the restaurant, and the excellent service just continued from there. Our server, Audi, was very attentive and helpful. As far I could tell, everybody else who walked in to place orders received the same fast, friendly service from her.

We ordered a gyro, falafel, beef shawarma plate, and fatoush salad. There wasn't an item that we were disappointed with! Despite that, the best thing I ate here was definitely their complimentary pita bread, which is made in house and served with za'atar and olive oil as dipping sauce! We finished the basket in about thirty seconds, and Audi offered us another one. After using the Groupon we purchased, our entire meal only set us back about $20, and we still had leftovers.

Also, Yalla is only about half a mile away from Stephano's, but I'm so glad we decided to come here instead. The quality of the food at Yalla's is so much better than the store bought stuff that Stephano's serves."}
{"text":"Love the food it's great authentic  Lebanese cuisine!found out its related to the sister restaurant Khourys Mediterranean, my mother had the chicken shawarma sandwich and I had the chicken kabob plate and it was great!!
It was cooked perfect and the chicken was juicy not dry like other restaurants I've been to.
Every time we're in the area, This place is my lunch place. Can't wait!!
Big Like."}
{"text":"This place serves the absolute best, over the top hummus I've ever enjoyed!! I've consumed hummus from all over the globe while serving in the military, and must say, you feel \"in country\" while dining in this establishment!! From the chicken to the beef, Yalla is a winner in everything they prepare. If you go away hungry, its your own fault. The meals are plentiful, with every sauce and condiment imaginable. Enjoy!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good not used to mint in my tzadziki fries were under cooked I wouldn't order this next time."}
{"text":"i love middle eastern and mediterranean cuisine.  i have been searching for an authentic place since moving here from Canada a few years ago...i was very excited to try the food i love at \"yalla\".   i found the restaurant to be very clean and comfortable with great service.  i was greeted and served right away with home made warm pitas and zatar to start our food journey ...we then ordered a variety of different items off the menu, everything was fresh, flavoured and spiced perfectly !!  we ended our meal with complementary baklava, yum !  we had a wonderful experience here at \"yalla\" and will definitely recommend your restaurant to our family and friends.
thank you and see you very soon !"}
{"text":"NOOOOOOOOO :( I just showed up here to find out it's CLOSED! So so sad. One of my favorite places in Henderson. The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Greek food and when better than a rainy Sunday evening to get my Greek on! After a through search to find somewhere new and we decide on Yalla. Yelp said they were open and after a twenty minute drive through the rain, they are closed at 6 pm on a Sunday evening. Lame! If you aren't open that is fine, but fix it on yelp and feel free to turn off the two open signs that are still on! To be honest, I won't be back to actually try this place..."}
{"text":"This place was great! We stumbled upon it while going to the Vietnamese place next door and came back the following day to eat there. In short: the service was great, the food was great, and we went back again a couple days later.

Both my wife and I had the kabob plates, and she also had a Greek salad. Everything was very fresh from the pita bread right out of the oven to the kabobs made to order. We'll definitely return next time we're in Henderson."}
{"text":"Awesome food.... Especially the shawarma sandwiches. It's healthy and fast. Great service. Definitely coming back to eat here again. It's a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for  some good Mediterranean food so my boyfriend and I ended up here. I would like to start off by complimenting the staff, from the second we walked in everyone had a smile on their face and was very attentive. My water glass was never empty and everything tasted very fresh. We started off with the jalapeño hummus and pita bread. The pitas were warm and fresh and the jalapeño hummus had just the right amount of spicy. My boyfriend jokingly mentioned he was a spicy guy and they brought a small side of extra chopped jalapeño. We had the chicken and beef shawarma (made with \"top sirloin\") it came with rice and was delicious. The real highlights were the beef kabob made with filet mignon and the Kafka kabob made with angus beef which was very authentic. Not to mention all the great sauces such as the tzatziki and garlic sauce (goes great with the kabobs) I also recommend the yalla fries and the gyros which are a definite must have! Those who are unfamiliar with this this style of food or just looking for a good mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas Yalla should be your first choice. This is a great family run restaurant, that shows with the quality of food and customer service. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I cannot give enough praise to Yalla!! I went there with a Groupon and it is now my new favorite place to eat. Between the homemade pitas coming right out of the oven and expertly, freshly cooked and healthy entrees, I had trouble deciding which was best. I tried the Chicken Shawarma Wrap, and Falafels and stuffed grape leaves and Baba Ghanoush   was exceptional ! Then Homemade Baklava to top it all off. Not to mention our lovely waitress, Audi, who so graciously brought us her fresh, homemade mango drink to sample! The warm, loving atmosphere added to our enjoyment, as well as the Ethnic music playing!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"If you love Mediterranean food you must try this place. Totally awesome. They have a wonderful home made green hot sauce too! Everything on the menu is fresh and delicious! The pita bread is not too thick so you don't get bloaty. They also offer a low carb option with lettuce wraps instead of pita bread."}
{"text":"Food tastes very good kinda pricey. As with any place that makes fresh food You have to wait for the food to be served.. Good selection of Middle-Eastern food. Not as good as Glendale CA but a good choice for the Vegas area."}
{"text":"So I have drove by this place many times so when I saw a groupon for them I decided to give them a try. The place is a little small, and one guy told us to find a table while another lady told us to wait for tables to be cleaned off. After the guy told us a second time to find a table we found one it was poorly cleaned off, we ordered our drinks and food, the waiter brought out fresh pita bread and an herb olive oil. I ordered the filet Mignon kabobs, they were delicious I was not crazy about the rice or the hummas but the kabobs made up for it. The waiter was not attentative at all we never got refills on our drinks and he never checked back with us until time to bring the bill to us. The crazy part is they were not busy so I am not sure as to why we were not attended to. My husband ordered the gyro and a shrimp kabob he also enjoyed his meal he said he was not crazy about the rice either. I think the biggest dissappointment was just the service not sure if I will come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mediterranean food. Our waitress, beautiful Audi was incredible. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"After realizing I had not supported my neighborhood restaurants in a while and being hungry for mediterranean food, I popped in to Yalla's.  It was after lunch and the restaurant was very quiet.

I was looking up at the menu on the wall, when a very nice young man pointed out the menu was also on the counter.  No neck strain necessary.  Plus, I can see better.  So, I ordered the vegetable skewer plate for $8.50.  Initially I thought it was a little pricey until I got home and opened it.

The food is stored in a styrofoam container with a large area in front and two smaller areas the back.  The large front area was filled generously with very tasty rice.  I loved the seasoning, it was delicate and smelled beautiful.  Two large vegetable skewers were placed on top, filled from end to end with a variety of grilled veggies like tomato, red pepper, mushroom, red onion.  The were cooked perfectly with just a hint of a bite.

There was definitely enough for two to share.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out Yalla was opening near my house- we were in need of a good Med Cuisine place there, and also, it is owned by Khoury's- my FAVORITE place to eat.  
We ordered a few things, the roasted chicken sandwich, Fatoush salad with Chicken, and the beef kabobs. 
The rice was out of this world! It has a little crispy thin noodles and a light oil.  The hummus was great and the Fatoush was so tasty.  My husband had no complaints about the sandwich..but we did have a couple downsides.  
The order was billed incorrectly.  And the cashier was very apologetic, but ended up billing me more, so that he didn't have to call his manager to fix it.  I felt that he should have just billed me the price he told me over the phone and comped his mistake.  Also, their Pita bread was not as good as i had hoped, tasted kind of old.  
I'll be back though.

UPDATE: 
I did come back, only to wait in line behind another customer for 10 minutes (at a counter btw) without so much as a \"hello\", or \"sorry\" from the cashier. The wait was so long becuase this woman could not get her order together and we were ignored so we just left. AWFUL SERVICE. Cashier should have acknowledged us, or offered to start our order while the customer ran out to her car, but no. Nothing. AWFUL! 
We went to Osaka across the street."}
{"text":"Great location for a fast food style Mediterranean food. I love their Yalla Fries (drenched in feta cheese sauce), Baba ganoush, humus, and kabobs. The best deal is their 2 kabob combo, which comes with pickled radish, peppers, humus, pita bread, choice of 2 kabobs, and the most delicious rice. Rice at this location is one of the best tasting and most fragrant rice I've ever had. 

I highly recommend this location if you want to grab Mediterranean food on the go."}
{"text":"I had the Vegetarian plate: falafel, stuffed grape leaves, hummus, and some tahini dipping sauce and some peppers and lettuce. All the food was excellent, and the falafel and stuffed grape leaves were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here tonight and It was a very pleasant experience. We purchased the group on for $11 and our meal was $21.30.  Food was delicious and service was very friendly. Our server checked on us in a timely manner and refilled our water and drinks. Very nice little restaurant and close to my house. Definitely will be returning here"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I walk to Yalla once or twice a week for lunch and between the walk and the excellent healthy food on the menu, it's a win win situation.  I walked in the other day and it smelled like a bakery.  No wonder their pita bread is amazing! This place is something special."}
{"text":"I am a Vegetarian. I have been one for over 15 years, so i generally know the cost of the foods i eat. With that being said, this place is nothing but a scam! I paid $9.50 for a dish of 5 fallafel balls, a few slices of old chewy un-seasoned tomatoes, a few slices of old cucumbers, some brown lettuce(used as garnish) and some straight out of the jar pepperoncini( 2 of them)......i also got a cup of the lentil soup...which was $3.99 and may as well have been served in one of those cups that you keep by your bathroom sink! it was so small! My boyfriend got a shawarma sandwich, which was only $5.99!......the sandwich was pretty big loaded with meat,, and veggies,  and filled him up nicely, but how is it that my meal which consisted of nothing but veggies was more than the meat??? Considering the cost of one tomato is less then .50? and all i got was a few slices of old chewy tomato?I am a small business owner so i understand mark-up but come on!!  I am middle eastern by descent so i have to say that the soup and falaffel were very good...but despite that i will not be coming back here due to the absurd prices....i even noticed that to add fries to a sandwich was an additional $2.99! That seems insane to me! They also have a \"veggie skewer dish\" for over $9 which consists of 2 skewers that have one piece of broccoli, a few pieces of tomato, some onion slices and some red bell pepper slices...served over rice, thats it!!"}
{"text":"Being half Lebanese I grew up on this food and tend to be very picky.  Service was great and the girl working knew what she was talking about. My friend and I got our food to go and didn't not have to wait too long at all. 
We ordered grape leaves, kibee balls, gyro, and a chicken schwarma. Grape leaves were ok too salty and rice was under cooked. Kibee balls were ok as well very greasy and tasted very fried. I had the gyro and it was extremely salty I couldn't even finish it. My friend had the chicken and she said the same thing...too salty. The garlic dipping sauce was really fantastic though, my favorite part of the meal!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I didn't expect this place to wow my taste buds....but it did and it's my fifth or sixth time in one month! The owner actually comes out to greet you and ask how everything is doing....he even made fresh mango juice for the patrons in the restaurant! this place is a definete must go to for Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Honestly the best Mediterranean food in Henderson!! If you are looking for delicious, fresh and tasty food for a great price, this place is the best! I highly recommend their chicken dinner, you cannot beat it! Also The staff is friendly and tentative. 

Their pita bread is hot and fresh and comes with a special seasoning that is so amazing! 

Sometimes they run out of whole chickens so I call ahead to make sure they have one, but if they don't we still go there and enjoy the steak kabobs. 

Support local, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  I kind of grew up on Lebanese food.  First of all, the guy at the counter was great.  Nice and friendly.  Seemed eager to help.  Let's get to the food.  The hummus was pretty good.  Hummus is hard to make too poorly.  This one has a LOT of lemon in it.  I could have used some cumin or more cumin.  Perhaps a little cayenne and black pepper too, but like I said it was fine.  The beef shawarma was pretty damn good.  I'll go back for that alone.  The pita was soft, the tahini sauce was just the right amount of pungent.  The meat was slightly stringy, but that's the cow, not the restaurant.  It was done properly.  Their tabouli was good.  Not great, but good and fresh.  Again, LOTS of lemon.  Not as much as the hummus, but a lot.  The pickled parsnips were disgusting.  Some folks may like them, but didn't suit me at all.  Same with the garlic spread.  Two ingredients: garlic and olive oil.  AND it's a paste.  If you like garlic, you'll LOVE that stuff!  My wife's chicken kabobs were a little disappointing.  Overcooked, too crispy.  The rice was ok.  A lot was just ok.  I'll go there again for the beef and would try the gyro stuff, but I wouldn't take guests from out of town.  Too many other places that are way better.  But this one is a few blocks from the house, so I'll go back now and then.  If they stay open."}
{"text":"My family loves Mediterranean food and have high standards when it comes to it. Freshness and robust flavor are important to us. I dined here earlier this evening for dinner with my husband and son, and had a great experience. Unfortunately, we were running on a tight schedule, and since everything is made fresh, our choices for something quick were limited. My son and I got the chicken shawarma wrap and hubby got the gyro. Sure, these are the basic dishes you'll find at a Mediterranean restaurant, but it takes a good cook to make the flavors just right. The chicken was flavorful and tender and so was the lamb in the gyro. We're looking forward to our next dine in experience when we have more time to spare and wait for their other freshly made dishes that take a little longer to prepare!"}
{"text":"The first time me and my co worker came here to eat I was impressed! Pita is fresh and taste great! Meals are good for 2 and the prices are very reasonable. The second time I was here,I took my husband and he is picky. Food was great but our server/receptionist,her name is Iris wasn't very attentive, we didn't have utensils, our water didn't get refilled, complimentary bread arrived after we got our food,but she is nice and very sweet!"}
{"text":"Worst kabob I've ever had!! I don't mean to be rude or disrespectful, but I seriously feel like the flavor of the chicken tasted like vomit. The rice was hard. The service was terrible. At least they were quicker than the place that used to be here. Just overall disappointing. I'm writing this review from my experience I had a year ago, and it was that bad that I still remember. Sorry, but honestly won't be returning."}
{"text":"I am so sad Yalla's is no longer with us. Please re-open next door to me so I never have to cry again.

The first Mediterranean restaurant I've tried that bakes their own pita bread (in house)!!! That was a nice surprise. I was getting tired of store bought pita bread that I could go purchase myself. Delicious warm, fresh pita bread is heaven. I had the falafel wrap consisting of fluffy yet crispy abundant falafels, a nice assortment of veggies, in a perfect pita bread pocket. Can't beat it for $4.99. Also had a beef shawarma plate which was enough to feed two hungry people. I would recommend the Fatoush salad as well. I'm not sure what the dressing was but 10/10. 

Audi, like the car!, had the utmost spectacular customer service. She was knowledgable with our questions and made our party feel very welcome during our entire stay. I will definitely be back, with a bigger crowd next time, so I can help them taste a little bit of goodness on a plate. In the mean time, dreaming of Yalla's falafels."}
{"text":"Very clean inside... fast service. I tried the Yalla Salad w/ chicken shawarma. Very tasty the dressing was light and citrusy and the chicken was moist and not dry & over cooked. Try it for sure. The hummus was also very tasty. The pita bread was very fresh and not \"fresh out of the bag\"!"}
{"text":"I would like to say without argument, Yalla's food is great, place is clean and the staff is friendly. My problem is, they have no ambiance, no style, no originality, no vibe and no enthusiasm. They went from Full service to barely self service. Yalla's can be amazing if they focus the marketing to the right people. They seem a little desperate and fear is obvious when you walk in the door and I am sure it sucks for them when the place is always dead. I hope they stick around because the food is amazing. They need to work on the brand and stay consistent. Market to the right groups, people, get involved in the fitness world and market fresh grilled food to those who workout. Fly above the rest! Good luck Yalla! I will keep coming back but it would feel great to walk in your door and feel/smell something other the despair and fear. I want to smell more chickens in your rotisserie and the smell of grilled meats. Go back the full service and show us you really mean business."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband and his friend. I had their vegetarian plate. It was good. Love the fresh bread. The dolmas was differant from what I'm used to but it was delicious. Service was awesome. Will stop by again if I'm craving Mediterranean food and around the area."}
{"text":"The food here is always fantastic thanks to their cook Jacob. I normally do not post yelp reviews; however, seeing that I come in here often with my sister, I felt it would be appropriate. The gyro wrap is my favorite! Paris, the front of house attendant/cashier/runner/waitress always is smiling and makes us feel welcome. She provides an excellent dining experience! The pita is also amazing because it's hand-rolled and fresh every day! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Delicious Food!! All home made. They make the pita bread fresh and serve it warm.  They had some  of the best baba ganoush I have ever had! It had a wonderful smoky flavor that I couldn't get enough of.  The beef kabob was good meat was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Great food, not Greek, but Lebanese. The menu isn't too big but everything is made fresh to order. Staff very helpful and out-going."}
{"text":"My first time here today for lunch. My first impression was it was clean and not cluttered inside, the guy working the counter was very nice. I ordered the kafta kabob ( ground beef ) which comes with rice and hummus $10.50, the portion seemed small to me for the price. The flavor of the kabob was good it was just small and a little over cooked so it dried out the meat, the rice was tasty. The hummus that comes with it was my least favorite part, it had a unusual taste which I wasn't a fan of. Overall it was fine just nothing jumps out to make you need to come back."}
{"text":"I stopped by at 12:30pm to order Hummus, pita & lentil soup to go. The restaurant is very clean. I thought the service was great! They were not very busy, I didn't have to wait more than ten minutes and they apologized for the wait! I didn't mind at all.

The food: best hummus ever. It was very creamy and fresh. Pita bread was just ok, i thought it seemed a little chewy and day old. Lentil soup was amazing!!!! I'm in love with that soup."}
{"text":"I went to Yalla because of a Groupon I bought. The interior is very nicely decorated...very clean...a very nice feel to it.  As soon as we sat down a fresh order of homemade pita bread was brought to the table with zatar. It was absolutely delicious! I had to consciously stop myself from filling up on bread. We ordered the mini mezza which is a combination of a variety of Mediterranean salads; hummus, tabouli,  babaganoush, falafel etc...so yummy! So fresh! We had the chicken kabob wrap...the flavors were soo good! Our server, Audi, was amazing...so accommodating and sweet. We ended our meal with baklava...my step dad said it was the best he's ever had. I can't say enough about this wonderful restaurant!  Go!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here just happened to notice it as I was driving. I got the chicken Scharma and a side of falafel.  The guy who took my order was very polite, the food was made pretty quick and my order was correct.  Not too busy but a slow but steady amount of people coming in. I did see the owner who was not as polite as his staff, he didnt even smile or say anything to a single customer. The food was pretty good, ive had better but ive also had alot worse. Good portion sizes so either they re vamped the sizes after the previous posts or the other place gives ridiculous portions. I would come back again based on my experiance."}
{"text":"Been here over 10 times now, and each time it's been great. I'm a creature of habit, always order the same thing, chicken kabob and rice!!!! With 2 pita breads. I've been to other places just like this, and enjoy them all, but this place is the best. Food is great, they will replace one item with another if you don't like it, the pita bread is made fresh to order, always great, the chicken kabob have nice pieces of red pepper one/or onion between each piece of meat, plus a very tasty mushroom at the end of each kabob. The rice, wow, I love rice, but there rice is the best I've ever had at any place like this. Get extra instead of hummus if you don't like hummus, if you do like hummus, than ask for extra rice, you won't be sorry. I don't care for hummus myself, but a few of my friends do, and they tell me it's the best they've tasted from places like this.

All in all, I have nothing negative to say about anything here. Service is great, food is great, they try and succeed to accommodate certain requests, and there prices are low. What more can you ask for. Check it out, you shouldn't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"We love the family chicken meal that comes with rice, salad, bread and hummus. Great price and great taste. Service is always great and takeout is quick. Also, their rice pudding is best I've ever had. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place could easily become my new favorite, My husband & I used a Groupon so it was ridiculously inexpensive but I have no problem returning & paying full price. The place was very clean with great service. The owner & his daughter were friendly & attentive without being bothersome. We enjoyed the fresh pita bread & olive oil before our fantastic kabobs arrived. My husband had 2 steak kabobs & I ordered 2 chicken (wanted leftovers for lunch the next day). The portions were generous and came with really good rice, hummus & veggies on the kabobs. Really filling and pretty healthy too! Can't wait to take my 11 year old there- great food, comfortable surroundings & really good value. These new owners are great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Maybe even an addiction. Have you had the Greek salad? That salad dressing is to die for. It has definitely changed over the months and in a great way! Seating is so much more comfortable and service at the table is quite nice. 
The pita bread is made in-house, as well as everything else!
If you want delicious food, this is the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were just driving by so we decided to stop in to grab a bite togo. We were greeted by the waitress/hostess Audi who was informative and helped us decide what to eat (Thank you the gyros were awesome) she also brought us pitas while we waited. Overall it was great and we will totally go back."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this restaurant. Very delighted and highly recommend stoping in for the chicken kabob plate. The seasoning they use adds to the yummy taste of the meat. Rice and hummus was good came with pita bread. The decor was nice and comfy."}
{"text":"I just finished a delicious falafel plate ($8.50) and a side of veggie grape leaves ($2.00) and had a great experience. The Falafel was fresh, crispy, and flavorful. I loved the tahini sauce, it wa a wonderful flavor. The plate comes with hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, and pickled turnips (!!!). The veggie grape leaves were also very good and are handmade in the restaurant. This was a great meal for a hungry vegan. 

The best part is that the pita is fresh and delicious. As soon as I sat down, the server, Audi, popped one in the oven and it was served hot with za'atar and olive oil. As I was sitting and eating, they were baking fresh pita and I could watch them pull the puffed up fresh pita from the oven. 

The service was quick and Audi was extremely nice and helpful. I was the only person there at 1:30 on a Tuesday so I am not sure if it is the same when it is packed. I will be back again to try the falafel wrap, it sounds awesome and is only $4.99. 

I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was really happy when this place opened because it was another close Mediterranean restaurant to try. However, I went in and ordered a beef sharwma plate and a chicken sharwma plate and asked for the rice to be substituted for a salad. He said that's not a problem, it will only be $1 more. I end up getting my receipt and it's actually $5 more. I received my food and when I got home I realized there is no pita bread and the portions are small for a plate. For a new restaurant with 4 customers in the restaurant this place should easily be able to make the orders correctly. I will keeping going to Stefanos down the street from now on."}
{"text":"Very delicious and flavorful food!! I ordered the chicken shawarma plate; the chicken had great flavoring and it wasn't dry. Our waiter was very attentive and our food came out fairly quick! This place is a hidden gem in the Henderson/Anthem area!"}
{"text":"Sherri, the owner at Yalla's is extremely pleasant and a pleasure to talk to. The dishes are absolutely phenomenal and their Greek salad is one of the best I've ever had in Vegas . Even their lunch specials are extremely reasonable and a bank for the buck! Stop by if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed ;)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been here a couple times and I was so excited to see it on groupon!! The food is so delicious. The portions are so amazing and the service is pretty good too. I would definitely come back again!! I got the Greek salad and the chicken kabob and my husband got the steak kabob. Comes with rice, pickles, peppercinis, pita bread and hummus!"}
{"text":"The pita bread is the best thing going for this place. Made in house, and served with olive oil and herbs, this was the best part of our meal. 

Terri R and I came for dinner, after looking at the pictures, I had already decided I needed the Yalla Fries. They looked amazing. Well, they look better than they taste. I liked the fries themselves, but they add a pile of feta on top, feta doesn't have much flavor to begin with, so it kinda ruined the fries. 

We both ordered the gyro pita. While I liked the texture of the meat, it lacked flavor. I ended up drowning it in sumac and dipping it in the gyro sauce. 

This place is owned by the same people as Khoury's, and I wasn't a fan of their food either. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to update and drop a star from my last review. Yalla has switched from being a counter-service joint to being a typical sit-down restaurant. There's no more ordering from the counter, no more self-service drinks, etc.

This would be fine, especially as they've upgraded their dining room with comfy seats and bigger tables. But the problem is that on all of my recent visits, there has only been one waitress working - and she handles everything:  Hosting, taking orders, food running, bussing, payments, etc. That's just not enough when there are more than even 2-3 tables of people. My typical visit now involves walking into a dining room full of unoccupied tables littered with dirty dishes, waiting a long time to order, never getting timely refills, and waiting a long time to get the check. What can you expect? It's not her fault, one person can't handle all those duties when it's busy.

To boot, the food has become inconsistent. Some days, it's as good as it's ever been, while other days it's just off. For example, my kofta last trip was painfully dry and tough, and my friend's rotisserie chicken was burnt to a crisp.

Honestly, I'm a bit hesitant to try Yalla again. If the food continues to be as poor and inconsistent as on my last visit, I will probably have to dock another star."}
{"text":"I have to say I did review the reviews of this place as I was waiting so I was biased but they did do a good job.

I had lunch with my family here because I wanted falafel. I have to say that the falafel wasn't that good. It tasted too fine as if made from a powder. If that is not the case then I was a bit disappointed that they might have over ground the mix. It was good but not anything I'd return for. 

I did how ever like their fresh pita bread. It was perfect with my falafel platter which came with some pickled veggies.

They serve hummus on the side which was a little runny for my taste.

The fresh pita and hummus were a good combo but both were slightly bland. I wouldn't always necessarily say it was a bad thing but to have something not so salty but some flavor was missing.

My niece had a kids meal which wasn't anything special. My aunt had a chicken wrap that was good.

Overall I would return to try some other stuff. Service was good. The young gentlemen was polite and also brought out a pita bread refill. Prices were also good."}
{"text":"I been coming here for a year now and I must tell you since the owner charged over 6-8 months ago the food gets more perfect every time. The ambiance is very nice and the servers are very friendly. We love hummus and chicken kabob plate. So delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Been looking for an authentic spot in Vegas for Mediterranean food and I defiantly found it. Trying to find a place that cooks like your mom does is hard this place hit the spot!!! Worth checking out.!!"}
{"text":"Can you say fresh, fresh, fresh?  At first, service and the arrival of the food was very slow and there were several tables that hadn't been cleared when we walked in.  But we got a variety of different dishes, their chicken gyro plus salad, the dolmades, and their yalla fries.  My dolmades had rice that was a bit hard, but other than that, everything was really good.  I wish their rice pudding was warm, that would have made it excellent.  My husband enjoyed the new take on the spices on his chicken.  We can't wait to go back to try their chicken rotisserie dinner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in for dinner tonight and we were not greeted by anyone. There was only one party in the whole restaurant besides us. We were finally told that we could sit anywhere so we found the least dirty of the tables closest to the exit. Upon looking around we noticed chairs pulled out. trash on floors.  And even crickets walking around in search for food.  A young guy came out carrying the other party's drinks holding them up to his stomach and shirt which was dirty with flour and food. While waking to their table he kicks a plastic condiment container across the floor at us. After giving them their drinks he comes to take our order. We quickly notice that he looked high on something looking away and unable to concentrate on our order.  After taking our order he walks right outside and never returned. Which we later found him passed out in a car in the parking lot. Another girl came to take our order and we told her that we already ordered.  She looked surprised so we went ahead and repeated our order to her.  We also noticed that she was also looking away slowly and blinking slowly as if she was drunk or dazed as well.  She also had a nasty nose ring in her nostril that was a gross distraction. While waiting for our Order I could see the girl making pita bread with gloves on that she touched many other things with. Little later she brings out our order but brought out a dish that we nor the party next to us ordered.  My wife and I were wanting to leave a while back but felt pressured to stay since we already purchased a groupon. we decided to wait it out But then the party next to us started to complain about the bread being stale and old and we just had enough and got up and walked out.  The party next to us said they didn't blame us.  Never again would we go there.  This is my first yelp because I felt strongly about warning others who are considering trying to eat here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just love this place.. Her falafel was delicious. I had the beef and chicken kabobs.. Everything was superb.. Thank you Audi for being such a wonderful server. We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place, its got delicious food and excellent service. Its a family owned business there daughter was our server she is awesome, I ordered for chicken and it was delicious well cooked and excellent flavor. Pita bread is hot and delicious .. couldn't ask for more"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Mediterranean places lately mainly in California where I live I tried Yalla for the first time because I had a Groupon and I must say I was impressed. It is really authentic tasting!

I ordered the shrimp kabobs and my gf had the filet mignon wrap. Both were great! The rice was great too! I guess my only complaint would be we ordered jalapeño hummus and it didn't really taste like jalapeño nor was it spicy but the pita bread and hummus were really good!

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, but realize that it comes in various \"dialects.\"  I also realize that evaluation of food is subjective.  Having said this, I have to report that I love Yalla's take on Mediterranean and will definitely return.  

My husband and I were there for dinner.  The very fresh and plentiful amount of food, the lovely presentation, and the great service will bring us back.  Miranda, our food server, was very friendly and attentive.  We started with the appetizer sampler and it was a meal in itself.  Everything was very fresh and tasty.  I had the Greek salad...very fresh...even the feta cheese tasted the best that I have ever had...fresh, favorable, and creamy.

I strongly recommend that you give it a try and support our neighborhood restaurants.

Note:  we found out that Yalla is under new ownership as of the last several months."}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit and I pretty much get the same stuff that I've tried and tested. This is closest place from my office that I can get kabobs from. This used to be a different kabob place. Name change? Change of owner/management? 

I always get my food to-go. The two times I've ordered falafel - I got charged but no falafel. So, 2/2 is 100% falafel fail rate.

The kabob combos are good. I've had the chicken, veggie and filet kabobs. The combos come with rice or salad, hummus and pita. They have this citrusy garlic sauce that's super amazing. It makes my breath smell so bad but I don't care. Mmmmm...garlic breath.

The ventilation isn't all that great. I wait for my food and I leave with my hair smelling like grilled meat.

Why you no give me no falafel?"}
{"text":"Good fattoush and Greek salads. Fresh fries and yummy hummus. Did not like the chicken swarma sandwich- dressing didn't have any taste. Service was good but there really wasn't anyone in there. There is a groupon online if you want to check it out."}
{"text":"Great food with great prices. Everything is made at the restaurant. The baba ghanoush is the best with fresh made pitas. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and a nice clean restaurant.  They keep you full on hot fresh pita bread and the tiramisu is a MUST! Homemade and super yummy! My boyfriend and I both ordered the Yalla salad and chicken kabobs and everything tasted great!  Audi was our server and she was great.  Always kept the pita bread full."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food, they make their own pita bread fresh daily too, loved their Almond Vinegrete salad with schwarma chicken - very filling!  Will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Audi made us delicious baklava to go with our yummy gyro and Greek wrap.  WANDA Ockey"}
{"text":"THEY'RE CLOSED... Oh no.. I even wrote a review in my queue.  Anybody have any idea where they have gone to?

This place is really lacking marketing, because their food is awesome and they're usually not busy during dinner hours.

Where can you go, where they make fresh pita bread and za'atar as the dipping sauce as part of their free appetizer.  

The slow cooked rotisserie chicken is crazy tender and the flavors are spot on.  Their gyro is probably one of the best mixed flavors I've ever had, even compared to my favorite spots in OC and LA.  

I'm no connoisseur, but I can taste the difference from Lebanese, Armenian, and Greek flavors.  They are similar, but yet different in their own ways."}
