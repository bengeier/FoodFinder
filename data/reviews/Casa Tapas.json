{"text":"Try the lamb filet mignon! The deserts are simply awesome too! It's as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Very good tapas and great selection of wine. A bit pricy but worth the money!"}
{"text":"There is nothing that would make me go back to this restaurant. Our experience was horrendous, we were treated very rudely by the owner himself who took our reservations for 10, yet chastised us as if we were small school girls when we arrived that he never takes reservations over 8 . He wouldn't even let us finish our sentences, interrupting us at every turn!  My issue is not with the party limit but with arrogant and reproachful tone. As a business owner myself, I would never think of speaking to a customer this way.  With so many lovely restaurants in Montreal, why support a business which treats its own clients as dirt!?"}
{"text":"We came to this place for a birthday, the service was incompetent . My guests were disappointed in the food as so was I . Everything was bland. Tapas is small portions and not cheap. Save yourself the trouble and go to pintxo."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place on a random weeknight while exploring the plateau and had the absolutely most awesome server. He chatted with us about how this place was the first tapas place in Montreal etc etc and so we were very excited to try the food!  We had the scallops with figs (not so amazing), the mushrooms (good), the asparagus with cheese (very good), the lamb (amazing), the chocolate churros (good), and something else I can't quite remember..  Although the atmosphere is nice and the food is ok, nothing beats Pintxo when it comes to tapas.  So, give this place a try, but after go to Pintxo and you'll definitely see, taste, and feel the difference!"}
{"text":"C'est le restaurant qui se rapproche le plus du goût des tapas connus en Espagne. Un peu cher mais délicieux"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and the best Spanish wine list in Montreal. Sit at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere, you'll probably leave with some new friends."}
{"text":"Good vibe, great tapas. Dimmed lights, always busy busy. Better make a reservation. A little bit on the pricy side of things, but worth it.  Good for a romantic evening. Great carte des vins.  Yes, yes and yes to the Vieras con higos..."}
{"text":"Awesome décor and excellent food. I always love restaurants that serve bread (and oil to dip it in) while you're ordering your drink and deciding on food. This place even had olives. Somewhat pricey, but the food is pretty high end. Servings are small in your typical upscale restaurant style, but you will not go hungry. Also, our server made an excellent suggestion for a substitute when there was one menu item that we had ordered that wasn't available. I wasn't disappointed. I wish that it had been a bring-your-own-wine set-up, since that might convince me to spend the extra money on the food and go back more than once.   The only real downside to the place was that the noise level was quite high, likely due to the acoustics of the room.   Very, very friendly waiters and management. I actually forgot my bolero on my chair when I left, and went back two days later to fetch it - the owner was helpful and quickly retrieved it for me, with a smile and a great vibe."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place but maybe that's because I had heard people rant about it over and over again... but I was truly disappointed. The waiter was extremely nice and helpful while choosing our wine from the wine list. He gave us his opinion on food as well. The food was tasty but nothing that was out of this world (like Pinxto). For the price it cost, I wouldn't go back. I'm glad I tried it but I wasn't ... honestly, I was \"blah\" about everything. That's the best I can put it. It was \"whatever\""}
{"text":"In a word, \"delicious\".  Amazingly delicious (but that's two words).  We had walked by Casa Tapas many times, but my son suggested we try it out as it had some vegan options.  The five of us tried seven tapas plates as well as a plate of vegetarian paella.  Four of those eight plates were outstanding - I'll go as far as to say the best tapas plates I have ever had.  These included: - a shrimp dish - crispy shrimp in an incredible garlic dressing;* - asparagus - with Manchebo cheese; - braised veal cheeks in a tomato/red pepper foam;* - the vegetarian paella, which had perfectly done veggies and either some incredibly tasty secret seasoning or more saffron than I've ever used in making paella at home.  The fact that we had to wait 30 minutes for this dish is proof that it isn't something simply microwaved in the kitchen.  * Casa Tapas provides a nice basket of bread at the beginning and refills it as often as you empty it.  I've tagged these two dishes as ones where we used the bread to sop up every last spoonful of the sauces.  Service was excellent.  Warm olives are served as you sit down.  They have a good wine list of Spanish wines.  I admit to not knowing much about Spanish wines, so we asked for a recommended dry white.  We were served a Jané Ventura Blanc Seleccio which our waiter said was in the style of a sauvignon blanc.  It was better than that.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find it on either the LCBO or SAQ websites.  To finish it off, one of the best espressos I've had in Canada.  I'll be going back."}
