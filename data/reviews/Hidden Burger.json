{"text":"Very cool idea and the customer service is even better. The burgers are amazing and fresh. The fries are even better and they serve them with a delicious jalapeno sauce. A must try in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good for fast take out and 10$ in financial district. I would go back for a meal. Everything tastes very fresh and is made on the spot. A good take out lunch if you are in the area and feel like a burger and fries."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch special, $10 taxes in for a cheeseburger, fries and a drink. This place is tucked deep inside The Bottom Line, right next to the Hockey Hall of Fame. It's a quiet little spot, with no line-ups. The walls are decorated with Archies wallpaper which adds a bit of charm and character.   The burger itself was delicious. The fries were a little over salted. The jalape単o aioli is .50 extra, but fantastic and not too spicy.   This is definitely on my list of top 5 burger places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch. $10 combo taxes in.  It was like a less greasy, less salty five guys. Flat top grilled, a good crust on the meat, welldone throughout but not dry.  The toppings added a freshness that was welcome, and I wasnt falling asleep at my desk from eating too heavy.  Fries were crispy, salty. Not my very favorite, maybe not even up to the burger's standard but still tasty. But the jalapeno aioli more than rescued them."}
{"text":"A little hard to find, had to call and ask but they said come to The Bottom Line and they'll show me where it is (basically just the back of the restaurant). Really small old-school burger joint - none of the fancy stuff you see in Toronto's modern burger bar. Got just a cheeseburger for $7.50 tax included. Was slightly small but packed a punch - vegetables were all cold, crispy and fresh, patty was cooked nicely with a bit of pink inside. Very tasty. Only regret is I didn't get the combo.  9.5/10."}
{"text":"You ever get the feeling that burgers, like the people in toronto these days, are trying way too hard to be cool? Whatever happened to keeping it simple? Keeping it real? And keeping it delicious? I'll tell you what happened: It moved into a tucked away corner on front street called Hidden Burger. This place is legit, and the guy running it is super kind and genuine. The toppings are burger toppings, the bun is a burger bun and the paddy is a burger paddy. And it all combines to give you a beautifully simple and satisfying burger experience.   Plus, that wallpaper is frickin awesome."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger hit the spot! I'd make it a double next time and the spicy jalape単o dipping sauce gave it a nice twist! It's tough to find so make sure you go through the bottom line restaurant you don't want to miss this hidden Gem."}
{"text":"**VERY IMPORTANT TIP** This spot is located inside of The Bottom Line restaurant.  Walk inside. stay on the left side & walk to the back. We visited here from Vegas & they were about to close around 5:55pm (closes @ 6pm) & he was very nice to cook us dinner since we spent 15-20 minutes trying to find it. Great burger, fries were fresh, & when we asked for ranch he went out of the way to get us a side from the bar. Customer service was on point & the food was just as good. Thank you for this great experience! Peace & Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Got there right before closing time, we were able to get our order in. Tasty, juicy burgers. Great service, owner even went to next door restaurant for ranch for my daughter.  A little tricky finding the place, just go thru the inside of Bottom Line. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I stumbled in here out of DESPERATE hunger and rushing to the airport! I had my mind set on a burger and I was beyond satisfied.  This is PERFECT spot to grab a quick bite and sit down and hit Union Station whether your leaving or coming into the city.   I ordered the specialty burger which had bacon, bbq sauce and an onion ring on a cheeseburger. It came with a side of fries and drink. I upgraded to sweet potato fries-- which I would recommend ordering with the special jalapeno sauce.   I left a happier person & ready to conquer the airport."}
{"text":"This is definitely not an easy place to find. Enter the Bottom Line bar on Front Street, go to the left (opposite side to the bar area) and walk right to the end. You'll see a small \"Hidden Burger\" sign on the entrance.  Now for the serious part - the food. I ordered the $10 lunch combo which came with a cheeseburger, fries and a drink. The burger itself was very fresh and obviously made with quality ingredients. The beef patty was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The condiments were tasty too - a crunchy pickle, red onion and a slice of (real) cheese.  What I wasn't so crazy about was the fries - they were limp and soggy, and while I could tell they were fresh cut from real potatoes, the consistency just wasn't right. Either they weren't cooked for long enough or the oil wasn't hot enough, I'm not sure.  I would definitely go back for the burgers but not the fries. A solid three stars, only losing out because of the disappointing fries."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, but I was disappointed. The burger proportions are a bit weird. It's one of those vertical burgers, that are small but tall, and hard to fit in your mouth. Once you take a bite, the toppings slide out from the bottom. The beef patty was oily and not flavourful. The fries were soggy and really oily.  I was sad to not like the food, because the cashier and cook were super friendly and nice. Maybe it was just an off day, who knows. I might give it another go and update my review."}
{"text":"The burger itself has is a juicy thick patty that doesn't leave grease all over your hands, the sliced vegetables are fresh and thick and the bun while small is sufficient.  The fries are probably what sets this place apart, generous serving with a great taste and the cracked pepper is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Best burger in the city, and at a fair price too considering what Burger's Priest will run you these days. I have also had many others in the city, plus outside too (Shake Shack, In-N-Out, etc.) This ain't my first rodeo.   I had the secret burger today, which happened to be a double 'big mac' style burger. It was perfection, all veggies were fresh and very crisp! Burger patties were perfectly seasoned, and cooked with a good crust on top which you only get with flat top cooking.  Fries were excellent, not soggy at all! I repeat, not soggy at all. They were crisp, well seasoned and delicious. Jalape単o aioli on the side was a nice touch. Anything mayo based with a little heat will always do for me.   I would eat here everyday if I could..."}
{"text":"Hidden Burger is a neat little burger place tucked away in the back of a restaurant named Bottom Line on Front St. I had their cheeseburger and fries and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The burger was delicious and the perfect size for lunch. The fries were also really good and tasted even better with a side of jalapeno aioli generously offered by the chef! For $10, you really can't go wrong and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the burgers here. I had a veggie burger and it was one of the better burgers that I have had. The outside was crispy and it held together well. Even better is the fry dip that came with the sweet potato fries. Our server treated us to a little ice cream for our honeymoon."}
{"text":"Impressive burger how impressive is the amount of time it took me to find it.   This please is a real hidden gem: tucked behind another restaurant/bar, it offers a very limited menu which I have appreciated because it means that here they focus on quality and freshness.   The menu only has: Secret Burger (Ask the chef about the special burger of the week) Cheeseburger Double Cheeseburger  Veggie burger  I came here for lunch with a colleague and we have ordered the lunch special: cheeseburger, fries with complimentary jalape単o mayo dipping sauce and a drink.   The burger I have to say that wasn't very big but I am definitely choosing not to be picky (in this one particular case only) because the burger was a real delicacy. Tasty, fresh and paired with a real slice of cheddar cheese, no kraft slice but real cheese! The sandwich overall was well dressed up with condiments that didn't overpowered the amazing taste the meat had.   The fries were very tasty even if they were a lil too much soft to my taste but they tasted of real potatoes.   I will definitely come back here to indulge my urges of real burger.   I just have one suggestion for you: make sure you read well the directions or you will be lost for real.   Highly satisfied."}
{"text":"Hidden indeed, as you have to enter through the sports bar \"The Bottom Line\", then walk to the back left hallway and then a space opens up on your right (the hostess for the Bottom Line can help). I'm curious if this is how the restaurant was originally designed or if they decided to do it after the fact with extra space. Cool idea in any case. There is a little bit of seating, which is nice.  Typically just open on weekdays, but at the time of writing they are open 11-3 on Saturdays when the Blue Jays are playing in town.  I may sound like a broken record with this in my reviews, but value plays a huge importance for me. The cheeseburger, fries and pop combo is exactly $10, which puts in right on par with fast food. Everything was cooked fresh for my friend and I, and I went with the special burger of the day, which was $2 more and had fresh pico de gallo, taco seasoning on the meat, jack cheese, and few other related ingredients. The taste was wonderful for the burger, and I loved the fresh cut fries - no issues with sogginess or limpness as others have described.   I suppose the only thing that brings things back down to earth a little is that the burger is a relatively modest size. More than fair for the price, and you'll be full with the large amount of fries given - but just be aware that it's at a comparable size to Burger Priest and not the Works.  Well worth the find and the money spent, you'll be playing \"hide the burger\" with your mouth quite quickly once you get a hold of one."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I rolled into Toronto for a conference and needed to grab a bite to eat between meetings. When I saw the veggie burger on the menu, I knew I had to go.  Coming from a vegetarian-friendly city (Seattle), I've had my fair share of black bean burgers. This. One. Was. Awesome. And it paired perfectly with the fries! I highly recommend... and may just go again in the short time I'm here.  A tip to make walking through The Bottom Line less awkward: enter the main entrance on 22 Front Street (it's to the left of the restaurant) and walk through the hallway to the handicap accessible entrance. This will put you in behind the greeter and give you a quick left-turn (toward the bathroom) to the Hidden Burger."}
{"text":"The Secret Burger has a different secret ingredient in its burger each week.  On the week that we tried it, there was a fried onion ring inside the burger!   The Secret Burger also had some crispy bacon in it in addition to the beef patty.  It was really tasty and the bacon just added to the texture and flavour to the burger.  The patty of Veggie Burger was made with black beans, rice, and almonds.  Chef Mo asked me if I wanted cheese on the veggie burger and I accepted.  Both burgers were made fresh to order.  For $10 (already including tax) for the burger, fries, and drink, this was an incredible lunch deal.  To be honest though, the burger itself was a tad on the smaller size (think Shake Shack size) but with fries and a drink, you will be satisfied enough.  For those who want a bigger size, you can always double your order by adding just $5.  I think that is a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"Great little burger joint. Was visiting downtown Toronto and wanted a burger place I could walk to. Asking the front end staff at the Bottom Line pub where the \"burger place in the back\" was is a little strange but what the hay. She said follow me and there it was.  Had the basic cheese burger and it did not disappoint. No ketchup or mustard needed. Will be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"As its namesake suggests, it is well hidden and quite a gem. Hidden in the back corridor of The Bottom Line bar, this little burger shack packs a memorable punch. It is well worth the time to sniff out if you are around the area. You will have to enter through the Bottom Line Bar and walk to back left, staff are friendly and will lead the way if asked.   The burger and star of the show, itself, is quite small - most people would be able to gobble it up in 3-4 bites. This is the least messy burger I've ever eaten, and probably the only time I've eaten a burger as is given to me; I didn't have the need to add any condiments or sauces. The burger patty was thick, juicy and full of umami meaty flavor. Cooked to perfection, letting the true flavor of the meat shine. The ratio of condiments and sauces worked in unison and nothing was over-powering nor soggy. I LOVE the fact that I did not add anything extra-the concept is quite foreign to me as you can guess from the many many times I've mentioned that fact. I almost wish there was a little more to eat, although, moderation is probably a good idea with the glorious greasy meal. The bun is slightly sweet, and lent its flavor well to balance out the savoury and umami side. I absolutely, unequivocally have nothing but praises. The fries and onion ring was a nice side. Both very nicely flavored and crispy. Though, the onion ring was slightly a bit over salted. I appreciate the fries being salted and peppered.  The staff were super friendly. The place is quite busy, so do place your order ahead before getting there. I did not heed this advice and ended up waiting about 30min for my order, because the customer before me ordered 10+ meals - worked out fine as I was quite entertain/distracted by the little snippet of Archie comics that plastered the wall. They do provide delivery service and would be quite nice for a corporate lunch as well.   Overall, great place to eat and nice area to explore. LOVED the food and energy of the place. It is relatively affordable for the area. The burger itself may be small but the meal is substantial enough. I will definitely return, hopefully next time, I will learn to order ahead and not get lost exploring in high heels."}
{"text":"Every Wednesday, my buddies and I at work will go for lunch. I try to take the crew somewhere new every week.  This place as the name describes it's quite \"hidden\" you have to walk all the way through the Bottom Line bar and turn right, it almost felt like trying to use a venue's washroom to find this.  There were only 5-6 bar stools. We left at 11:35am and it got really busy around noon!   The patty was juicy and they have a $10 meal deal including a burger and one pop and fries. I  really enjoyed the bun. I think they deserve a 4.5 stars! Hidden gem in downtown for burgers.  Bonus: love their Archie wall paper!"}
{"text":"I had a friend mention to me about Hidden Burger's lunch deal.  Cheese burger with fries and a drink for $10.00  So I made the trek there.  It is at the back of The Bottom Line with a very minimalist order/wait area.  I had the daily special for an additional $2.00 cost and a garlic aioli dip for my fries.  The dip was excellent and the fries were lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.   The burger was decent however, I would next time ask for a little less pink in my patty.  But for what it was it was a better burger than the local fare.   I think if I were to order the $10.00 cheese burger I might skip to tomato slices as the bun isn't designed for too many condiments."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time today.  As others have said, this place is legit.  Burger, fries and a drink for ten bucks.  Ten bucks even as it includes tax.  They have a secret burger of the week and this week it was a taco burger so I got that.  Oh man was it good.  The burgers aren't huge but they are just right.  There are a lot of fries and the jalapeno aioli is worth the fifty cents for your fries.  An awesome hidden gem."}
{"text":"Enter the restaurant called the bottom line, walk straight down the path in the restaurant and go into the left hallway. Turn right and..... welcome to Hidden Burger.  I was in the area with some coworkers today and remembered hearing about this spot so we walked around looking for it and after a few minutes of being lost we found it. We all got the special of the week which was a double big mac burger with a side of aioli sauce. All their burgers come with fries and a drink. The double big mac was 16.50 and I would say it was worth it for me but it's a bit on the pricey side for sure. The fries were fantastic and I loved the aioli sauce. The burger itself was fantastic and I loved how juicy the patties were.  In terms of seating area there isn't much room so be prepared to take the burger with u to eat outside. I'll definitely be back here because they have a 10 dollar burger combo as well and I think it's a really good value for what you get."}
{"text":"This place reminds me a little bit like In n Out Burger (mind you, I only been to in n out twice).  The fries were good and less greasy.  The burger was cooked right.  I even like this place more than 5 Guys.    I would not have known this place if my colleague had not taken me here.  Worth a try.    They do have a limited menu burger menu."}
{"text":"This place is really hidden.  Despite having read the reviews and knowing that it was inside The Bottom Line Restaurant, I still had challenges finding the place.  I should have read Horacio V's review more clearly.  Eventually the staff at the Bottom Line showed me the way.  Amazing!  I was so happy when I found it, there were some gentleman there who looked at me and were like \"we felt the same way\".  I had the special which was blue cheese and something which was really good.  I also upgraded my fries to onion rings.  I will try the fries next time round.  I guess the burgers are a little small but I was still really full.  You can totally tell it is made from real meat.  It's pretty good.  Part of the fun is finding the place.  I will totally go back."}
{"text":"Great cheeseburgers, great fries, unique spot.  Your life will not be dramatically reinvigorated by these burgers, but you'll get a good burger and fries fix while not breaking the bank. The fries are in the upper percentile.  A cheeseburger, fries and canned pop is $10. Not bad for downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I got the swiss cheese, mushroom, burger with fries.  The cheese was cooked well and wasn't messy eating it.  The mushroom wasn't overpowered by the other ingredients in the burger.  The beef patty was a bit dryer than I would like but it did have lots a flavour and the smoke from the grill in it.  The fries were average.  A great place for lunch if you can find it."}
{"text":"Tried this place today as part of my daily MEALPAL meal and the burger was just ok.  It was an \"ok\" burger. Not mind blowing or memorable, but not bad either. Fries were \"ok\" as well, wish it was crispier. Only complaint was that the burger was SMALL!   Not bad for the price I paid via mealpal, but I wouldn't pay regular price for this.  Will be back, if I'm doing it via mealpal"}
{"text":"Second time going, everything was on point consistent flavors. Veggie burger with cheese tasted great. Fries were great not soggy or oily. Adding the jalapeno dip on the side was well worth it . Would recommend adding that and some fries to your burger.   5/5 for me. Would go again."}
{"text":"Hidden it is! I don't mean the place, I meant the meat. The meat is so tiny compared to the bun and everything else that was put in to compensate for the lack of meat. It's a gimmick, nothing more. Burger is not bad but it's also not sensational. Harvey's would be more satisfying, imho."}
{"text":"Concept is the same as Burger Joint in New York, but it is definitely no where near as good.   Its locate inside the Bottom Line and you can just walk straight to the back. I was expecting a long line around 12ish but I was literally the only person. The burger itself isn't bad, but very tiny (think the size of a cheeseburger from mcdonalds) and greasy, even though a burger should be a bit greasy.   The fries were the worst part. All the fries were super soggy. Its disappointing because they were seasoned well, but just not crispy at all. I would not recommend nor come back."}
{"text":"This is not very hidden and is just the to-go part of the sports bar. Burger was super uneventful and the fries were meh. I think if you're super craving a burger and don't want to pay tip this may be your place. It was not that special to me."}
{"text":"Little burger shack with big potential (I say that like it's a new joint but apparently it's been open for a while).  You'll have to walk into The Bottom Line sports bar to access this spot (a little awkward when you tell the greeter you're not there to fill up on pub food and watch whatever obnoxious hockey game is playing on the large screens). Put aside your awkwardness and walk boldly to the back of the room and you'll discover a wall plastered with Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica. You've arrived.  I decided to try the Secret Burger of the day - two patties and a \"Big Mac\" style - pickles, cheese, lettuce and a special sauce that rivals the Golden Arches. Yes, it's that good.  Price was steep (I wanted just the burger and the friendly cashier thought I wanted a combo so guess what I paid for?) $14 plus tax was a little too much for me. Burger was small and the fries left a little to be desired but it sure was delicious.  But I understanding paying more for more meat (heh). My friend ordered a regular combo and it was $10 - includes fries and a drink. Nice.  Get it to go - they have a very small counter with chairs and it's not ideal for sitting and enjoying your burg with the noise and tiny seating area."}
{"text":"I must say, I had higher hopes for Hidden Burger. There wasn't anything really wrong with the burger, but I wasn't that impressed. I think much of the appeal of Hidden Burger is based on the hidden gimmick. I ordered a double cheeseburger combo, and it was definitely one of the messiest burgers I've ever eaten. I was expecting a more classic flat-top burger, but I got the impression that the patties weren't hand-made, and were unpleasantly dense. The fries really hit the spot, very crispy. Not sure I'd come back for another go, but worth a try."}
{"text":"Love Hidden Burger. It's located in the back of the bottom line (you actually need to go through the bar to the very back) and it has a very cool archie comic aesthetic. Everything is cooked fresh in front of you while you wait.  I'm a vegetarian so I get the veggie burger with cheese when I go. Love the mixture and how it's cooked. It's a bit mushy which I love. It's not trying to be a beef burger like other burger joints that use simulated beef tasting soy that ends up tasting dry and bland. This real vegetable and bean patty is the best kind of veggie burger in my books. It's flavourful and not trying to be something it's not!  Burgers are smaller than standard pub fare and I find it the perfect amount for a lunch and I'm a 6'2\" guy. I'm always the exact right amount of full after a combo. Toppings are well selected for that classic taste, fries are crispy, and jalapeno aioli is a great 50 cent addition to your order! (would love a chipotle aioli option too though)  I've taken two of my omnivore coworkers there already on different occasions and they had really good things to say about the beef burgers as well."}
{"text":"Although somewhat of a search to get to, it's always fun to see the decor. As well, the veggie burger is one of the best I've had. Their lunch deal includes a drink and fries for around $10."}
{"text":"Located inside The Bottom Line Pub.  Was eventually greeted by a guy at the cash (I guess he was too busy on his phone to be bothered). Simple menu. Their debit/credit machine does not support tap to pay. Cheeseburger combo had very salty fries, more salt in the dip, white bread. The burger was small and maybe slightly better than McDonalds (including yellow processed cheese). For $10 it was OK, but not sure if I will be returning - lots of choice for food in this area."}
{"text":"I was invited by Hidden Burger's chef, Morgan, to review this burger joint near Union station. Tucked away in the steakhouse, The Bottom Line, Hidden Burger is not the easiest restaurant to find. Walls adorned with photos of Archie and friends, this is the place to go if you want a good ol' fashion burger. With only a limited number of items on the menu, Hidden Burger strives to do well by serving with only the freshest Canadian ingredients. They are hoping to add shakes and ice cream to the menu soon.  One of their popular feature is the SecretBurger. Every week, there is a new \"secret burger\" that you can order. To find out what the Secretburger is for the week, you can go onto their social media. I was able to try a combination of their Veggie Burger and SecretBurger in one. Their veggie patty was definitely delicious and I liked having it topped with that week's SecretBurger ingredients, which were: jalapenos, avocado, aioli, and cheddar. Not to mention the chef made a jalapeno aioli sauce to top it all off! The patty did fall apart quickly because it was a veggie patty instead of beef. I liked how the burger was crispy with the right amount of spicy though.  Hidden Burger also has a $10 combo deal (fries and drink included) for their Veggie or Cheeseburger. Due to the limited seating space, it wouldn't be a place for you to bring your friends to catch up at. I would recommend Hidden Burger if you work or live in the area and is craving a traditional burger for lunch or after work."}
{"text":"Great burger and cool atmosphere. I've been there a few times and they never disappoint in quality. Only negative thing is that the burger is a bit small compared to other places in similar price range. Fries portion is huge!"}
{"text":"This place is literally hidden behind the bottom line restaurant/bar.  It opens earlier than the bottom line but if the bottom line isn't open you have to go around the side entrance through the building on the left.  Walk all the way to the back left and you'll see the tiny burger kitchen.  WAIT: Came at 11:30 on a Monday and we were the first ones there (and probably the first customers).  It took a bit of time to get our food (5-10 minutes) probably because the grill and everything was getting warmed up.  ATMOSPHERE: It's Archie themed! They even have a jughead special with like 10 burgers.  There is a small counter space and 2 tables so not much space, I assume most people get their food to go and eat at work.  FOOD: Very simple menu, cheeseburger, burger and the special burger.  They didn't have a special burger that week so we got the lunch special.  M-F you get a cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $10!    CHEESEBURGER - this is a no frills burger place, a little similar to something like the habit or in n out.  The burger comes with a soft bun (not toasted), burger patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion and a bit of ketchup/mustard.  The burger was pretty good and had good flavor but definitely nothing extraordinary.    FRIES - super crispy, they have the skin still on them but I still liked them (usually I don't). They give you a good amount with the lunch deal.  Overall, definitely nothing super fantastic but a good solid burger if you're in the neighborhood or want something better than your typical fast food chain.  I'm sure their special burgers are better."}
{"text":"Hidden away in the back of the Bottom Line Bar, this is well worth the stop! Burger didn't disappoint and the chef special \"Secretburger\" hit the spot! Highly recommend!"}
