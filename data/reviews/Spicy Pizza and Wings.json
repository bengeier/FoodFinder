{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Me and my family normally order from them on weekends (we live down the street, and walk over).

In error, we placed an order at the other location. The horribly run franchises refused to make the order at the correct location (after we admitted our mistake and apologizing for the inconvenience), and they would not take an order from us. 

After YEARS of being customers to them, they refuse to take our order after a simple one time mistake. 

I urge everyone reading this to find another pizza place that actually cares about the way they treat people."}
{"text":"My rating here is based simply on the pizza and based on my rating I clearly think it is good stuff.

Like a lot of larger well-established pizza chains Spicy Pizza Wings beats any of them on price. I usually purchase their $6.99 Large w/ one topping, which I find to be the best bang for my buck.

In terms of pizza quality, I don't think you're getting the authentic Italian pizza experience (then again at which chain are you getting such an experience?). The pizza is hot and the sauce is good. The cheese is great and stringy and tastes great. The dough is pretty average.

Do recommend if you're in the area and feeling like pizza."}
{"text":"This place is just a few minutes down the road for me. So I'm always here out of convenience. They always have a walk-in special for 10.99, which you get a large pizza with 4 toppings and a dip. When they say large pizza, they really mean LARGE pizza. Their pizzas are good, better than pizza pizza by far, and the price is cheaper too. I'm not too fond of their wings, they are way too small, and flavours are limiting. Everytime the boys come over, we always get pizza here. If you're ever in the area, you should definitely pick up the 10.99 large pizza walk-in special, it's usually only a 10-12 minute wait, cause they're always made fresh. That pizza can definitely feed a family of four."}
{"text":"The walk-in special is the best deal there for $11.29 you get a large 4 topping pizza and dip. My family has been eating there for years, and have never been disappointed. 

The wings are also decently priced but the pizza is our go to. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Rather than choosing your typical large pizza chains, I decided on try something 'local'. Spicy Pizza and Wings is located in Markham right at Markham road and Denison.
After looking at the reviews, it's worth a try and opportunity to see if it can perform.  It certainly did.
Our group simply wanted pizza without the soft drinks...$14.99 for an extra large 3 topping was definitely a deal.  After delivery I couldn't wait to dive in and when I did, I wasn't disappointed. 

Pizza 1: pineapple, chicken and red peppers: fresh ingredients, lots of toppings, moist, not burnt, perfect amount of cheese and they went easy on the tomato sauce...I was amazed.

Pizza 2: ham, pepperoni and mushrooms: more heartier, nonetheless was delicious.

I guess from now on here I'll be ordering delivery from this place! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Pizza in Markham hasn't been that great, but this place is pretty good. For the price you can't beat it. The wings are on the small side so I'll give this 4/5 only."}
