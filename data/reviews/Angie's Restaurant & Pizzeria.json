{"text":"This was hands down the best pizza I have had all year, and I eat a lot of pizza, along with being a bit of a foodie judgement wise. The sauce had a hint of sweetness to it, and could tell it was freshly made, and the crust was perfect. The owner was super friendly. From the outside, and maybe first glance at inside maybe you would think it wouldn't be good, but go outside of your box. Will definitely be my go to for nearby."}
{"text":"Love the new look, menu and slightly upscale makeover.   Great food reasonably priced.  Locally owned, not a chain, nice young man trying to make a go of it.  Stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a  family owned restaurant and they could not be any sweeter. The food is fantastic too. Will definitely be back here soon. Beats all the chain pizza joints."}
