{"text":"Horrible service. 2 other tables in restaurant . Waited over 30 minutes for food and drinks. Drinks were not brought out with food or before food. Had to wait another 10 minutes for drinks. Staff only starred at us while we ate and had to wait another 10 minutes after done eating for the server to come over and give us the check. Food was ok small portions. Never going back!"}
{"text":"This place is completely fantastic. My favorite order is the carne Asana gringos taco and a blood orange margarita. Their churros are the best way to end the meal, too, if you're feeling like a cheat meal is in order!"}
{"text":"Second stop on mini food tour of the Container Park.  We shared a combo plate of three tacos with chips and rice and beans.  For the tacos, we picked the al pastor, asada, and carnitas.  All three were good, but too drippy/runny to be great.  (Warning: Be prepared to make a big mess!)  The highlight was the horchata which was the cinnamon-iest I've ever tasted, and I mean that in a good way.  However, a word of advice.  As those of you may have tried the silly cinnamon challenge will know, cinnamon does not dissolve in water.  That means that all the tiny particles of ground cinnamon sink to the bottom pretty quickly.  Just be aware of that, and give it a good stir pretty often with your straw to avoid a sip of cinnamon sludge."}
{"text":"Their tacos are great!  I had the fish, al pastor and the gringos tacos.  They were all excellent.  I will have to try the others on the menu next time.  The service was excellent and the decor inviting.  It is a little bit on the pricey side, but it makes up for the quality of the food.  I will be back when I am craving for a good Mexican food when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This little tucked away gem is a hit! Dont blink because you'll miss it! Great tacos, great margaritas, reasonably priced, cool decor and great service! It's now become my go to spot for Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Homemade tortillas. Cool ambience. I recommend dining in. Everything tastes so much better fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic Mexican food in Container Park. It's a little high priced for fast food type Mexican (12 bucks a plate) but very delicious."}
{"text":"Three different people behind the bar (one In which was the bartender) and none of Them knew what tres generaciones was or that it was even a damn tequila! Also didn't know what Bohemia was... (It's a beer) never asked if the food was good or if we needed anything, never given napkins, never Asked for refills, and Never offered our bill...... Food was alright. I absolutely do not recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"Its hard to say as I'm very picky about my Mexican food. I'm from California and I'm used to a more authentic flavor, to me it seemed a little watered down to appeal for the majority in the area. But I've only been there once, but my coworkers swear by this place. But the staff were super welcoming, nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We were drawn here because of the name. The carne asana street tacos were excellent, as were the carnitas.   We'll definitely be back to try the carne asana fries."}
{"text":"The ambience looked great although I took my food to go. The service was good and the food was ready quickly. I got a lengua burrito which was just ok. The items on the menu are slightly over priced. Not too many items under the  $10 range, that includes the burritos."}
{"text":"I'm all about good food, decor, and service and this place has all 3 of those things. Came in and sat at the super cute bar. Would have definitely sat outside if it weren't so chilly. The bartender was really funny and interactive right off the bat which is something I always look for in bartenders. Might be just be a personal preference. I ordered the vegetarian torta and a taco. My mom ordered the tortilla soup and the chicken flautas.  I think what stands out most about this place is that everything is so fresh. You can taste the difference in quality compared to a lot of other places in town. They're open late which is convenient for those nights when you need good late night Mexican food or a good drink without the guilt that usually comes along with it.  Lastly I'd just like to throw out there that there churros might be better than Disneylands. And that's a bold claim. We'll definitely be back to try their breakfast soon."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious. Good portions which I think match the price. But super tasty asada and chicken. Definitely be going back as the container park is a must visit place. This is a great spot to grab a bite when visiting downtown! Salsa tastes great too!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating that I am Mexican, born and raised in San Diego, so I feel that I \"know\" what delicious taco shop food should taste like. My husband and I visited Pinche's tacos to see what the hype was all about. We weren't expecting authentic Mexican cuisine,  just good taco shop food.  We waited in line to order for 20mins, waited for our food to be brought to us for another 20 mins! I had the tortilla soup and corn, both were good enough to order again next time.  The mole burrito was missing mole flavor, but I do give credit that they are large burritos that they are selling. All of the food had a very Indian food like taste to it. Rather weird IMO. We did go on a Saturday night,  but that shouldn't be the issue,  I think they need more staff,  1 to possibly wipe down the tables inside, our table was filthy.  Because there are only a few dining options in Downtown LV, I would go again if friends wanted to check out it. But I think I rather eat at Cardenas Market for more of an authentic flavor."}
{"text":"Ask about specials of the day. Small bar with the best service!! Big tvs you can watch from any angle. Management and service team is outstanding!!! Can't wait to come back. I had the chicken taquitos and corn on the cobb, draft beer, churros. Yummy."}
{"text":"Not only a very hilariously clever name, the food was good and the Blood Margueritas were awesome."}
{"text":"Tasty authentic tacos! The lengua, fish and shrimp tacos were savory and filling. It is real Mexican food made by real Mexicans."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Definitely attracts young people. Pink and blue walls with skeletons in sombreros everywhere. The Gringo and chicken tacos are a must have. The guacamole was delicious and I have never liked any guacamole I've tried. The Pico De Gallo wasn't anything special, but the salsa that was on my chicken tacos was pretty good. The chicken tacos did not have cheese on them, but I didn't think they needed cheese. The Blood Orange Margarita was a bit strong, but still good. Overall, a fun atmosphere, prices are a little high, but I would recommend going during happy hour to save some money."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at Pinches Tacos on several occasions... always delicious! The fish tacos are by far my favorite. Pair those with a glass bottle of Mexican Coke and I am one happy girl. My only gripe is that I feel the price is a bit steep for street-style tacos, but clearly it hasn't stopped me for enjoying them!"}
{"text":"Tried pinches tacos yesterday with a friend. I had the cali burrito and it was pinche good! The Staff was really nice and really liked the vibe of the place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly hungry but I'm a sucker for authentic Mexican and this place is pretty legit. I had a lengua taco and a pollo mole taco and washed it all down with some horchata. I also got to try the \"not nachos\" with chicken and some jamaica. Everything was delicious. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Their chicken mole taco was absolutely amazing.  Spicy but sweet. Also had their al pastor.  Good but still nothing compared to Tacos El Gordo's al pastor.   Staff was extremely helpful and had great suggestions."}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland.  I came here with the hopes of it being great. The location is cool... But I (and girlfriend) ordered two burritos... They came with salsa (not much flavor) and chips... The burritos themselves were poor, and the service ( person at counter seemed annoyed) the pork was dry, and no offering of hot sauce, etc...   Only thing that was decent was margarita. But that itself seemed like the pre mix you could by at any store ( and cost eight bucks)  Let down."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant before they got their liquor license. The food is Fantastic, and the family that own it are fantastic. Real Mexican food by real Mexicans is not just the slogan but a way of life. They also have \" gringo food\" to die for. I get to this restaurant as much as possible. If you like good food, friendly service, and a full bar with happy hours included, Pinches Tacos is where you should go."}
{"text":"This place is killer. This is their second location, first being in The Container Park Downtown. Their Mexican corn & horchata are to die for. The owner talked to my boyfriend & I & explained everything. They're family owned & operated. Score! Support small businesses Food is authentic Mexican food & all homemade. We'll be regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"I leave fat and happy every time I go!!! Fave spot in town for tacos. Delicious! Plus the owner and staff are great people, very personable and remember you when you go back! I've dragged many friends here and I will continue to do so!!!"}
{"text":"I had an unexpected day off today and headed to pinches tacos too see what the buz was about. I was not disappointed When i walked in was instantly greeted and decided to sit at the bar asked the bartender to tell me about the food and she made a great suggestion to go with the three taco plate so I can try a few items at once  I choose to drink a michelada and was the best I have had in town amazing so simple and refreshing. Two men that were there were so helpful and friendly and the two women bartenders made me feel at home. As the gentleman put it I was def devirginized and will be going back again soon"}
{"text":"The place has a great atmosphere, and staff is friendly and fast. Ordered our food, got a free chorizo dip and chips to try, it was great blend of chorizo, cheese and beans. I ordered the asada burrito, Cooked to perfection, and very tender. The chips are homemade tortilla chips, the ones made from tortillas."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  This is a fun place to go while out and about in Container Park. While there aren't many tables to sit at inside there are plenty offered outside. The carne asada fries were unreal....staying fantastically crispy all the way to the end.  The sopes were also amazing and fantastically crispy."}
{"text":"Best mexican place in town it feels like you are in mexico the service is always perfect and the tortillas are hand made fresh apon order it dont get anymore mexican than this spot and happy hour is the best in town! Checkout the bar first its tge best spot to enjoy their patio is huge and even have games to play these people make you feel like family i love it you will never grow tired of coming here"}
{"text":"A friend recommend this place and I'm glad he did! We've been here about 5-6 times now and have had a great experience each time! The food, service, and atmosphere is great. The decor is bright and cheerful just like the owner and staff! Excellent Mexican food, good prices, good times, and good people. What more could you ask for???"}
{"text":"We tried several things from the menu, including beans and rice....a proper.....and al pastor tacos also some breakfast I wouldsay that the food is above average Mexican but not worth the price ,very good but I was not wowed"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! One of the best MEXICAN restaurants ever! We had their tacos, burritos, the corn on the cob and horchata. The taste is to die for! Everything is perfectly seasoned and the service was great. I was happy to hear that they have locations in L.A. Since we were our in Vegas visiting for the weekend."}
{"text":"Fish tacos and blood orange margaritas! So good! Great outdoor seating. Perfect for catching up with friends at the Container Park. We ate there at night."}
{"text":"Affordable, great food, and the staff was very helpful,and courteous.  I had the al pastor tacos, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best chicken nachos I have ever had! if I could have them everyday I would....highly recommend trying this place out. Customer service is truly the best i've seen."}
{"text":"Great place really good food and a large menu. Awesome environment and friendly staff. Get the taco al pastor!!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here and I love it! The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. The wait staff is friendly and helpful! The food and drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"First thing is first customer service was outstanding the bartender Varnessa was attentive. I ordered the corn on the cob and it was amazing! It tasted just like the ones you get off of the k mart kart w/ the horn. I had the adobada tacos and were also amazing."}
{"text":"The food is alright, not the best nor the worst.  A bit overpriced for what you get.  If I am paying nearly $10 for a burrito then it better have enough meat. You can get better Mexican food that is more loaded at a better price at other Mexican taquerias around town."}
{"text":"It's about time Las Vegas has an excellent Mexican restaurant in the Southwest part of town. It may be a bit challenging to find however, well worth your time. Absolutely some of the best pico de gallo I have eaten. Food is always very fresh and good; the best chips in Las Vegas! Although still waiting for their liquor license, they possess the best soda machine I have ever seen; it even has ginger ale - WOW!  Jimi says check it out....you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Pinches Restaurant is what comes to mind when someone mentions container park. Besides the crazy slides they have that's waiting for a lawsuit cause all the kids that comes out says \"ow I hit my head but it was fun\"  Anyways its a bit pricey but AL PASTOR with the hottest sauce they have, CORN ON THE COB and horchata to wash it down. Bomb! ~Fin~"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Delicious and fresh! The tequila is great too! I ordered 4 tacos and as I was eating them I realized this tastes so good and I'm writing a review. Environment is awesome and makes me feel like I'm in Mexico for an hour."}
{"text":"Just sat down to some carne asada fries and an Al Pastor taco. Both of which were beyond my expectations. We live in Hawaii and can never find good Mexican food so whenever we travel to the mainland, the search is on for good Mexican food.  Grew up in so cal and I know what authentic Mexican food is.  This is absolutely the spot. Service was great and the Diablo hot sauce is legit if you like it hot. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Great shrimp tacos. The carne asada fries are delicious. I really liked the ambiance. The service was good - the owner greeted us and also came and talked to us. You should stop by and try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great. A bit pricey but worth it. The employees are a pleasure. Try the micheladas they're amazing. Wish they sold some mix for home !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic quality food.  The decor is meh -- don't go there for the ambiance --  but the quality of the food is incredible. Probably some of the best Mexican food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, great music, and friendly staff... What else could you ask for? Love this place! $2 tacos during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Super good food! Friendly service! Feels like home atmosphere great music playing and the carne asada fries where to die for!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, love this place..   I gone twice, and have not been disappointed!  First time I had:  -Pinches Combo which consist of  3 street tacos with our choice of meats (I choose Carne Asada).  Served with Rice, Pinto beans, and some chips -Cheese Enchiladas -Mexican Corn    The second time:  -Tostadas -Mexican Corn -Side of Rice  The tostadas are so fresh, and the crunch of the corn tortilla was legit!  So yummy, and they were not stingy with the carne asada.. The corn, well it is just mouthwatering, and I crave it all day!!!  Perfect flavors.  Sometimes Mexican corn can be too much, but they get it right every time...  Overall, my experience there has always been awesome!  Prices could be a little cheaper, but you can't put a price on authenticity..  The workers make it feel like your walking into their home kitchen.    I love that it's in container park as it's an amazing place to be.  Last night, I felt like I was somewhere else, almost like a mini Pike Place in Seattle or Pier 39 in San Francisco (without the water of course) .  Its a perfect combination of Urban meets Art Gallery..."}
{"text":"I heard good things about Pinche tacos. So why not give it a try. I ordered the chicken burrito. The burrito was stuffed with rice and beans. They also included a dab of chicken and guacamole. The salsa for the chips was so plain. I could have made it better at home blindfolded. We paid cash and didn't even get a receipt. If you your looking for a over priced Albertos this is it."}
{"text":"For a grab and go food place, excellent, really delicious  food and margaritas, would definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Container Park and I came specifically to try out some of the food I had heard about. Pinches Tacos did not disappoint.  The line was pretty long, but considering the length of it, they kept it moving really fast. The staff is all very friendly and they have a really good variety on the menu. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to be brought out to us, and they'll even bring it upstairs, which is nice.   I ordered the chicken tacos which come with onions, cilantro, and salsa. They were really, really good. It tasted very fresh and flavorful. The rice and beans were also good. My friend ordered fish tacos and those also looked really good.  My only major gripe is that the drinks are pretty expensive, bottled or fountain. The fountain drinks only come in one size and it's pretty small. It's somewhere around the size of a solo cup, maybe slightly bigger.  Otherwise it's a great place. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"My guy was on the fence about the Container park, said it seemed too hipster--UNTIL I took him there.  This place was first on my I must feed him this.... and I've converted him into a believer.  Their sopes AMAZING-I had a chicken burrito, and he ordered a carne asada one, they cut it in half for you too which is awesome and meant of course, that we could swap half and each have one, its rather affordable too since it was my turn to pay for dinner, I'm glad I didn't spend a ton.  Definitely recommend this place, they serve you your food outside you don't have to do anything! This is just sucha  cool place I'm glad its there."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with customers service. ! Food is good but the workers are very rude. I ordered a flan that took forever and they ended up not having it , they gave me a churro insted ...=/"}
{"text":"New taco joint! The Estiffy is aptly named and it's a meal. Two not so mini Chimis filled with nicely browned ground beef, perfectly deep fried with some stiffy producing creamy pink sauce and a nice topping of cotija cheese. Yum! Shrimp taco at $2.95 had a lot of nicely cooked shrimp with a cabbage salad and nicely sliced salsa. Busy little place."}
{"text":"Friend and I got the 3 taco combo plate, they offer so much but I stuck with pollo, pescado, and al pastor. Saw the corn in a pic on here and got that too and boy was I glad I did. Believe it was about $16 with drink (taco combo comes with rice beans and chips) The tacos were very good like the ones back home. Least favorite was the fish but it was still good. The corn however I absolutely loved. I don't know what it was, the type of cream, butter or chile, whatever they used was amazing! I want more!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago. I had high expectations but it was just a regular taco shop. In fact I think I like Roberto's better. Maybe it was what I had. I had the al pastor burrito, I wish I could say more but it just wasn't exceptional or enough for me to remember in detail how to describe it. It was smaller than what was expected for the $10+ I paid for the burrito and a drink, it came with a couple and by that I mean maybe 5 or 7 chips on the side. The habanero salsa had a good kick and flavor, that may have been the best part and that they had fresh brewed ice tea. Maybe I should just expect to pay that much since it is in the \"new\" area of downtown? Maybe I am just spoiled and expect authentic mexican food at a reasonable price... either way it just did nothing for me."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here on my way home from work and the food was amazing ! We are vegetarians and we ordered the potato and cheese flautas the vegetarian torta and two bean and cheese sopes. Soooo good the service was quick and the lady was friendly. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Really good carne asada tacos!! Super friendly staff and great service. I would definitely eat here again for a quick affordable meal."}
{"text":"For $11 carne asada, the meat portions were small. It was mainly beans or rice. The salsa could of been better. Overall the tastes was bland. The atmosphere reminded me of a taqueria in TJ but if you're looking for legit tacos, I recommend going to Tacos Y Gordos or Tacos Y Tacos.  Bottom line, for the price, Theres better alternatives. The horchata though was pretty good and refreshing."}
{"text":"Amazing food, even better service and love the decor! You have to try the blood orange sangria! Super strong and delish. My fave taco was the gringo. Ana is the best server! High energy, took all her recommendations which were all great! Will be back very soon :-)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with their tacos, beers, horchata, and elotes! I'm on a pescetarian diet right now and was thrilled that they also had fish tacos. Love the seating upstairs and that they'll actually bring you your food too. Must stop by this place if you're strolling through downtown container park!"}
{"text":"Only good was the corn :) I ordered a carne asana burrito and I hardly found the meat and that was for almost $10.00 bad bad"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada fries and they were amazing!!! I asked for no pico de gallo or guac and they had no problem doing that.  I didnt know they added cilantro to top it off, and I am not a big fan of that, but it didnt matter, it was still great.  I definitely will go back for more fries.   The guy taking our order was extremely funny as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try it out. So we went to the Grammercy location today. Didn't like the food at all, the beef tasted old. I bit into my burrito and the hard end of an avocado was in my burrito, you know the little wooden looking thing? We only received one little thin napkin with just a fork inside. The wait staff, although they seemed friendly, weren't thorough. Quality is definitely more important to me than the atmosphere. Sorry guys, but I think I'll be heading to Don tortacos next time :("}
{"text":"I had the carne asada and carnitas tacos. Tortola was fresh and crispy. Very flavorful and habanero sauce was awesome. Watermelon margarita was refreshing."}
{"text":"I had to try this place, especially with the reviews and cool pictures of their decor. Was very happy to see they were open on Sun. Tried there al pastor tacos and chicken flautas! Yummy. It looks like they make there own tortillas, not sure, but it was nice light and fresh. I will definitely be back to experience again!"}
{"text":"Marginal Mexican food. Had the 2 tacos with rice and beans. Rice was under cooked and beans cold. Beef and chicken was okay flavored. Only got 6 chips which were good but for $12.50 this meal should have been the bomb. Not the place to go if you're hungry. Lastly, their name wasn't posted on the outside of the building but rather inside so it was hard to find."}
{"text":"A must try... Great food, drinks and people... Let's support and keep them here... Well worth keeping in our area..."}
{"text":"Wow... What an unpleasant visit. This was our 5th time going to this family restaurant and our last. We get there at 7:50 pm on a school night with a party of 4. Trying to catch late dinner with the kids. We waited until 8:05 and had to leave without getting any service. There were a few tables there and the one that had the attention was the one with one of the owners of this place, drinking with friends. I'm sorry but YOUR customers come first. There were 3 servers and about 5 tables. No urgency to try and get our drink order, let alone get our food order. 1 girl walked by us no joke about 10-15 times and didn't even look over at us. The other girl, went back and forth from the kitchen and the other server kept going to the table where one of the owners was sitting. We love the food and but the service was terrible, if you call it service because we didn't get any food or drinks. The frustrating part was that we had our kids and were starving after a long day of activities and school. We will not be going back to this place and will definitely not refer our friends and family about pinches tacos anymore."}
{"text":"The authenticity of this pinche tacos place is amazing! Feels like you're eating food  from your grandma recipes.  My girlfriend had the carne asada torta and I had the carne asada burrito. The torta was extremely delicious and the burrito didn't fall far behind. I have to admit their diablo sauce and the green sauce are magical!"}
{"text":"Muy Bueno!  Pinches Tacos is my favorite Mexican place to eat, like they said \"Real Mexican food by Real Mexicans\".  When we came here I got steak tacos, and I can honestly say that they are the best tacos I have ever eaten. Even though I live 35 minutes away from Container Park,, I do not mind making the trip when i'm craving some authentic Mexican food. When you walk in you can feel very overwhelmed by the line of people and the chalkboard menu, fear not my friends, they have a smaller printed menu that is easier to navigate.  The only thing that I can complain about here is that Container Park closes to the 21 and under crowed at 9:00pm, which is a total bummer, its not Pinches fault, but it sucks when you're craving some steak tacos and you cant get them. Keep it up Pinches!"}
{"text":"Just ok tacos. Happy hour $2 tacos misleading cause doesnt include asada, pastor, lengua you know all the good ones. $3.50 for bottle coke ? Not a fan."}
{"text":"First time here. I really liked the food! Tried the 3 taco plate, with rice and beans. Ordered pescado, asada, and carnitas. Wasn't wowed by the carnitas, but the fish and steak were very good. The steak was a bit on the spicy side, but in my case that's a good thing. I'd try a burrito next time. They looked really good. I'd also get one of their margaritas. Have to say that's about the only thing missing from my meal, but I'll save that for another time when I'm not out with my kids."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment if you are looking for real Mexican food look up tacos el Gordo you will not regret it best Taco shop"}
{"text":"1st time to the Container Park, which is so cool, and my husband and I stopped into Pinches Tacos for some \"Real Mexican food, made by real Mexicans\" as they state on the outside of their shop.  Customer service was ok, the cashier seemed a bit rushed and frustrated.  For 2 beers, 2 chicken taquitos (plain) and 4 carne asada street tacos it was $40.  I literally had to stop at Robertos on my way home because I was starving.  The food itself was ok, nothing to write home about. Sure wasn't worth the price. I'll definitely return to the container park but I'll make sure to stop and eat somewhere else first!"}
{"text":"When you walk in to Container Park you get hit with the smell of the BBQ place but this place is a hidden Las Vegas gem. The margaritas and tacos are incredible! I am not one for spicy food but this hit the spot. Service and atmosphere are excellent! I had a burrito with guacamole onions and salsa. Amazing. My sister had the tortilla soup which was a bit like curry and delicious. My peach margarita paired great with my meal. Can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food. Outside is small but it was to nice to eat outside and the bar is right there with big windows. Will be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"So far my first couple visits have been great. Ordered Carne Asada fries and the combination platter another day. Finished every bite! Perfect sized meals and yummy Horchata..just wish the drink cup was bigger. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was great and look forward to coming back.  Loved the potato and cheese flautas.  Service was a bit slow but we weren't in a rush.  Busy Taco Tuesday night."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican places I have ever gone to. Service was good, food came out fast, and the food was AMAZING. I love this place and could eat their food everyday and never get tired of it!"}
{"text":"If you are staying downtown walk to the container park and have breakfast at Pinches Tacos.  The chilaquiles was amazing. All handmade tortillas."}
{"text":"Friends have told me Pinches Tacos was very good. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and elote corn. The enchilada sauce had no flavor! It was very watery and tasted like tomatoes thrown in a blender with no seasoning and that was it. They would be better off using canned enchilada sauce. The rice that came with the enchiladas was disgusting! You could tell it was old rice bc it was crunchy and completely inedible. I couldn't finish the enchiladas and the rice I couldn't even eat it past the first bite. The corn was they only part of my meal that was decent. The food was not only terrible but over priced too. You are better off going to Dontortaco. Don't waste your money at Pinches Tacos."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the owner and family are all super friendly and nice. They always seem to be having fun at work and not treating it like a chore. Sure you can probably get cheaper Mexican food somewhere else, but the vibe, location, and happy hour and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Got the taco combo plate with beef, chicken and fish tacos.  Food was hot fresh and flavorful.  However, it could use a little more spice for my taste.  Looking forward to coming back for happy hour.  Worth trying."}
{"text":"Please pay close attention, don't be fooled into believing you will be served good quality, authentic Mexican food, just because the order taker, repeats your order to the cooks in spanish!!  This restaurant makes americanized Mexican food for tourists, that do not know the difference.  First lets start with the quality of he meats they use, poor grade! Then lets discuss their red chili sauce tastes like it comes straight from a can. The fish tacos, are below average, they lack spice and flavor, The white sauce was bland, and they don't put salsa on their fish tacos, if they did add Pico De Gallo, it was bland.  Overall, bland tacos.  The chicken enchiladas are more cheese enchiladas, it had so much cheese, I had to remove the excessive amounts, just to make it palatable.  What you are getting here is bland, americanized food, called Mexican food.  An irrefutable truth, the food is BLAND.  False ratings by people that don't know what Mexican food should taste like!!!!   FYI, there is no BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN VEGAS, and for those of you that are easily impressed with the name, PINCHES tacos, wake up and smell the kibble!  The only thing that was Pinche about this restaurant, was me for going in this place."}
{"text":"Authentico y deliciso!   the asada tacos and potato & manchego cheese flautas.... And they were amazing! Busy place and kind of hard to find a place to eat when busy, but so worth the drive and wait. We plan to be back again real soon."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time after wanting to go here for awhile! We decided to take our daughter and grandson who cautioned us that it would be pretty pricey. We didn't listen because we wanted to have lunch with them but honestly, how much can Mexican food cost? Well we found out. First of all the ambiance is fun and it has a lot of great features about the Mexican culture. The taco truck in the front of the place was a cool addition. The Lotteria cards as table cards was a cool idea. The car seats as booth seating was pretty nice as well and the stringed lighting makes you feel like you're in a backyard in LA. We ordered 3 horchatas. They are great and I recommend them! However, you literally get a child size plastic to go cup of this drink. Thumbs down for presentation and portion on that. Then the home made guava flan came out. To me it was bland. You can't taste guava in there at all. So why even put it out there? Thumbs down. The flautas came out. Presentation was awesome! Portion was perfect and it was really really good! Two Thumbs up. Then the main course. So Asada tacos were pretty good. I do have to say the tortillas are decent but a little on the thick side and I like them thinner. We tried the chicken mole and it's good too but I don't recommend it as a taco. Just a dish with beans and rice because the sauce is too think to be in a taco. A very disappointing dish was the Al Pastor!! We got it in a burrito and taco style. They both fell flat and short from taste and quality. Just to let you know... A PERFECT Al Pastor should have piña chopped and marinated with the meat and the meat should be tender because of the acidity of the pineapple. Neither of these things happened and I found myself having the worse Al Pastor I've ever had in my life. Which is very upsetting because that happens to be my favorite meat. Beans and rice were fresh. All of the tortilla chips were overcooked and burnt! Even my nieto wouldn't eat them and he LOVES chips! So on to the service. We are greeted by a female server who was very helpful and friendly. I recommend keeping her because she's funny and pays attention to everything that's going on in that restaurant. I didn't get her name but she's crazy. In a good way. So I'm sure you'll figure it out. The other server who happens we to be pregnant, she was the opposite. She needs to go home and not work in an eatery with people. She didn't look like she wanted to be there, was quiet and looked tired, which again, if she's pregnant maybe she shouldn't work in that type of job. Especially as a safety issue because what if she falls!? She could hurt herself and baby.. She actually made the experience a little bad because she wasn't as friendly and upbeat as the place itself. I feel bad because I know it must be tiring to have to work but with the enormous amount of money being shelled out by patrons for your overpriced food, you really need to consider who is serving it! Our bill came and it was $82. Yes, $82. For 3 kid size horchatas, 2 bland flans, 2 flautas, 1 burrito, a taco combo plate, a kids quesadilla (which by the way we asked to gave a to go box so we could take it with us and the server never brought it put so we said forget it and left it behind) 7 asada tacos. It literally was $16 for 5 tacos! Lol.. Well we tried it and we now know that we are sticking to our Lindo Michoacan in Henderson or Taco Y Taco in Henderson.. Hell, I might just move to Henderson if it means getting a decent Mexican dish in this city... Sorry Piches Tacos. You guys are Pinche expensive and it Pinche wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Here now and been here a a lot of other times and still hands the best fucking (excuse the language) place in  Las Vegas to get tacos and Mexican food  the owner Javier is the shiz super friendly  this will forever be my go to spot for tacos in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Hubby & I had burritos from Pinches.  I had the carne asada burrito which was yummy & hubby had the shrimp burrito which was not all that great.  The carne asada had lots of flavor & the meat quality was good.  The shrimp was fried and the burrito was mostly filled w/ cabbage.  I had to knock off one star for inadequate serving sizes (way too small) & another star taken off for stale tortilla chips.  The chips tasted a day late & a dollar short.  Customer service was good.    Just a side note:  Its awful stuffy inside Pinches, the AC would be nice while ordering your food, and probably much appreciated by the employees who are sweating bullets over the hot grill."}
{"text":"Being from Mexico and raised in the United States, this is by far, the most amazing Mexican food out there.  If you really want to try authentic Mexican food without going to Mexico, eat at Pinches Tacos.  Trust me, it's like a demo version of Mexico served in America."}
{"text":"This was an amazing find while on a walk in downtown (old) vegas. Located in the small recycled shipping container park, the ambiance and food are both spectacular!  My wife got the carne asada fries while I got the three taco combo (carne asada and carnitas). These were some of the best tacos I have eaten. Ever.  We highly recommend this place, as they are fighting the good fight against \"fakes-ican\" food as Pinches puts it.  Go there for a cheaper and off the beaten path meal."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before hitting Fremont Street. Containerpark is a relative quite part of the Fremont area and you can actually sit outside for dinner (that's a rarity for Las Vegas). The food is good and the overall athmosphere of containerpark is great.  A great spot to have something to eat when you're on Fremont street."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's pretty good. The tacos are delicious. I especially like the mole taco. The taquitos are also good. The enchilada sauce kind of tastes like ketchup, so I will probably not order those again.  The restaurant itself has great ambience and a bar. I do think they either need to lower their prices or create a full service restaurant. The food quality is good, but it is set up as an order at the counter fast food type place. It's fast food with full service restaurant prices and ambience. I think if this place added a couple of servers and some good chips and salsa, it would win five stars."}
{"text":"Finally a REAL Mexican spot with REAL Mexican food !!! And on my side of town. Definitely will be a regular customer !"}
{"text":"You said you served breakfast (desayuno, for y'all) until 2 pm.  You said you had \"Chilaquiles\" -- which I LOVE!  But when I ordered them--at 12:15--you looked at the loooong line behind me and decided that would take too long, and be a problem for you.  So I helped out.  I left.  And you have joined my list of restaurants \"dead to me\"."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here. Container Park food options are pretty limited and I assumed with a name like this, and all the controversy surrounding the name which I think hyped up the anticipation at least for me, it's got to be good. I was wrong.   We ordered two steak tacos and a steak salad. The steak on all three items was super dry and completely lacked seasoning. The tacos didn't come with lettuce or cheese. Really nothing other than dry meat wrapped in a tortilla. Fail.   The salad was even more disappointing. There wasn't much lettuce, mostly cabbage and the portion was so tiny!! Can't believe I paid over $12 for this teeny, tiny  The dressing lacked any flavor. I was really disappointed with the food here.   It's a bummer but I will not be returning and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I had the burrito al pastor and my girlfriend had the chicken burrito. I'm the type of foodie who likes loud flavors and enjoys a flavor combination to just wow my palate. This was not one of those experiences. It was mediocre at best. Pork was not particularly flavorful - didn't really taste like an al pastor to me. Chicken burrito was equal subpar - not much to comment about. Best part of the meal was the dos equis on tap for 5 bucks.   I liked the container park- just look for somewhere else to grub."}
{"text":"Came here expecting it to be great from the reviews and the picture of the Corn on the cob. Ended up paying $16 for 3 tacos, corn, and a Mexican soda. After spending that much money I expected it to turn out great but meat ended up tasting sweet and funny compared to the meat on the tacos. Friend had the carne Asada fries and picked out all the meat from it. Corn on the cob didn't even look or tasted well at all what a shame"}
{"text":"Apparently not new to Vegas but our first time.  We had the Huevos Rancheros, pastor sopas, and taco trio.  In the midst of discussing how fresh everything tasted without the overpowering spice/heat, someone from the restaurant came to our table and explained what flavor profile they were shooting for .. Which confirmed what we were talking about.  Definitely will be coming back often.  Great location and atmosphere!  So very close to our home as well."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food. Beans are a bit dry. Rice is good. Tacos just didn't stand out. Nothing great about the food. Just average. Beer is cold. Very unique location."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the food was DELICIOUS! The prices are a bit high but they cook the tastiest Mexican food, next to my mother. I would recommend a friend to eat at the restaurant. Plus, the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Showed up during happy hour. Several of the very authentic and lip smacking tacos were only $2 each. Clean restaurant, fantastic service & a great location."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a little something to eat before church. I didn't want a huge meal, just a little snack. The cashier who took my order was super helpful at suggesting options and they even made me something not on the menu to suit my desire. The chorizo taco topped with onions and cilantro was the best taco I've ever had, and being Latina, I've eaten my fair share of tacos! They really should put this on the menu,  it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Finally a good late night spot by my house- AND THEY HAVE A BAR!   I had the chance to try out Pinches at the soft opening today. Upon walking in, the place was packed and I was still welcomed graciously by the employees, which I later found out was one of the owners. I've opened a lot of restaurants and I know how rough openings are, but wow- they made it look easy. If it's this great already, I see a bright future for Pinches!  I tried the El Pastor taco & the pollo taco- both delicious. My first time having pastor and I was very impressed. My family has owned an authentic Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas since the 1960's, so I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, and I finally found one that I like. Quality ingredients, not just loaded with sour cream and cheese. The tortillas were handmade, and that makes ALL the difference.   There's outside patio seating available and a full bar area that's half inside and half out. The seating is very relaxed and spacious.  After speaking with the owner, Jorge Anaya aka \"Pinche\" I learned a little more about the restaurant. They have multiple locations in California and one in downtown Las Vegas. He was awesome and treated me like I was at home, very smart guy that you can tell cares about the very last detail of his food.    I can't wait to go back and try more on the menu!  In the words of Jorge, \"We don't take life seriously, we just take our tacos seriously.\""}
{"text":"Service was barely existent. Food was bland. Waited 8 minutes to get menu and 20 minutes for the food. Restaurant was barely busy. Will not come back again. Rather go to robertos."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their tacos, juices (watermelon is my fave) and elote are awesome. Service is always great too!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Delicious Mexican corn on the cob and the best churros!!  In the Las Vegas Container Park."}
{"text":"Sorry Pinches... Nice location and vibe, awful service and food not so tasty, in fact we felt sick soon after our meal... unfortunately was as not impressive as the place itself. God Speed!"}
{"text":"We eat here every time we are at the Container Park. Food is reasonably priced and they have options for everyone- although I wouldn't recommend for the kids (especially if their idea of a taco comes from Taco Bell). Their corn tortillas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food! Tortillas made at time of order and meat just as fresh. The carne asada was soft and not overcooked & hard like many other places. Staff friendly as well, plenty of seating outside to enjoy the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place has amazing tacos! Honestly one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to pinches on a Wednesday night it was a great atmosphere. I found my eyes darting all around looking at all the unique decor around. We were also greeted with both of the brothers who own the restaurant and you could truly tell that restaurant was their baby and they took such great pride in it. We had the 3 tacos combo plate the corn and the not nachos all for around 25 bucks which is crazy affordable compared to other Mexican restaurants I have been to. Everything we are was amazing with so much flavor! This is why I have rated them 5 stars service friendly and family oriented, atmosphere colorful and creative and food savory and tasty. Worth trying for sure!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but now I refuse to go back. Since they opened, the food has progressively gotten less good and the quality of the operation has gone down.   The last time I was there, the staff was very rude and argumentative with me about my food order and drink wishes. I ordered my usual meal which comes with salsa and guacamole. They forget the guacamole, which is my favorite part, and I didn't realize until I was already home. My boyfriend also asked for their hottest salsa which they left out as well.   Another issue we ran into is that we ordered a fountain drink and all the sodas in the machine were flat. We mentioned that to the lady who took our order and she said she had to ask the manager what to do, who is also the cook. He came out from behind the counter and took a cup to try the soda. He then proceeded to argue with my boyfriend that the soda wasn't flat until we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the food was pretty average. I don't understand places that don't give you chips and salsa on the house... so I ordered chips and salsa. $3.00 for that but nothing special. I ordered a  vegetarian burrito and it was pretty small but pretty good flavor. Also came with the same exact chips and salsa I had ordered prior. I wish everything came with rice and beans... overall not bad but nothing very special. Don't know if I would go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Everything we got was amazing! We tried the pork, beef and fish tacos! All the meat was seasoned so perfectly and the tortillas were made fresh. The blood orange margaritas were delicious and strong! I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often."}
{"text":"At least this place lives up to it's name...in the derogative sense. Pinches Tacos was a huge disappointment. The carne asada had a funny taste to it. I'm guessing it was over seasoned. And what is up with the extra .50 cent charge for carne asada? This is the first place. Shrimp, I  get it. Fish, of course. But for carne asada that isn't asada? No...it's not grilled, pinche tacos were disgusting. And by the way, this is a real mexican writing this review."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here since it had really good reviews but for some one who is Mexican it really disappointed me in so many levels   1. The place was just so small , only 2 tables at the corner and almost no space between each other  , literally each others back    2. We order a quesadilla ! Blend ! I know it's a quesadilla but there's places that you can always taste a good quesadilla , this was not the place.  We also had carne asada fries , the fries were kinda good maybe 3 starts out of 5 for the fries -you can totally taste \"fake  \" the one that comes in a bag  My mother in law order tacos de papa (flautas with potato and cheese)  again , blend ! Then order a side of chips and salsa ( not for free) almost $6 dollars for old chips and salsa that ain't even salsa - more like pico de gallo( onion, cilantro, tomatoe in lemon  and juice ) and last but not least street Mexican  on the cob (mayo,butter, and chile en polvo( chile powder) this was the best thing I had from all the food we had . All that almost $50.00     Glad didn't try the tacos because the person I from of us seem like they didn't like their tacos either , as far as I am concerned I don't think I will come back here at pinches tacos - I think food truck food tastes way  better than this place"}
{"text":"I'm at a happy 3 1/2.  I expected to be blown away, instead it turned out to be just some solid tacos. We tried the Al Pastor (Slow broiled marinated pork), Asada (Grilled Angus beef), Carnitas (Citrus scented pork), Adobada (Grilled chili marinated pork), and Pollo (chicken).  The tortillas were smaller than your typical taco shells, you can tell they are homemade. The Carnitas were our favorite, the other meats were just so-so. The Adobada only came with 3 chunks of pork. Tacos all come with cilantro and onions unless otherwise specified.  The taco plates sounded like a good deal with three tacos of your choice (seafoods are extra), rice and beans, with a side of chips. The chips turned out to be a few tortilla chips on top of the beans, the rice and beans each filled their own tiny sectional of the divided paper plate.   We also ordered the chips with salsa and guac. The salsa was made with fresh tomatoes, onions, and cilantro, but had an odd sweet taste. The guacamole was delicious, and had that chunky avocado texture that I typically crave in a good guac.  It was $21.51 with tip, so decent eats for the price. The staff was very friendly, and they offered indoor and outdoor seating.  It's not that it was bad, it's just that we've had better tasting tacos at home."}
{"text":"Food was kinda bland. Guacamole salsa were really good. Three stars only because the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Having lunch at a new place is always fun..... Different part of town nice we sat at the bar had some tasty tacos and beer nothing special good flavor and good service will stop by again if I find myself on that side of town."}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of this restaurant! I always take my friends from out of town here and they rant about it for weeks. Margaritas are phenomenal and very strong! Lengua tacos are my go-to. Not over priced which can be hit or miss with the container park. Employees provide excellent customer service. Can definitely say I am always full and happy leaving this place!"}
{"text":"The service was poor we ordered two breakfast burritos with no salsa. They put salsa on both burritos and when we told the waiter Vince he said that isn't salsa it is just tomatoes. That was a lie it looked and tasted exactly like their salsa. The other breakfast we ordered never even arrived at our table when I told them they said well we only put in two burritos. They didn't even offer to make my breakfast or apologize. What happen to making the customer happy and  giving good customer service. Our drinks were empty and they never offered us more. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Always, always, always my first pick for food at Downtown Container Park. I'm not Mexican myself but I sure do love my Mexican food! I've tried a bunch of their tacos and flautas and always order elote (Mexican style corn) and haven't been disappointed. The quality of their ingredients taste incredible fresh and always well prepared.   It's slightly more expensive than what you'd expect at a Mexican restaurant but it is in Container Park after all. Regardless, it's well worth the price and always a good eat when you're in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went here today to try it out since we were at the container park. 2 words! Ridiculously overpriced! The restaurant itself was really dirty, no clean tables inside, the soda machine wasn't working properly, & the tea or coffee machine was leaking water everywhere. My husband and I shared a carne asada burrito which was $11 and some change (wayyyy wayyyy overpriced, seriously!!!) and it was so small!!!!! Got my kids the enchiladas, which come in 3 (so small too!!! more like size of rolled tacos) we were all still starving at the end! the portion sizes are so skimpy and not even worth how much they charge. Our total for a carne asada burrito, the enchilada meal, and 2 soft drinks came out to $30 almost $31!!!!! That's f'n ridiculous!!!!!!!! Definitely not coming back here! You can find REAL Mexican food elsewhere that's cheaper and taste 10x better! Sorry  Save your money! Not worth it! Only gave 2 stars just to be nice?"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and vibe from this little taco joint. Definitely has that street taco feel to go with the street food. The mini chimis are awesome. They would be better with a different meat other than ground beef. The shrimp tacos are street style and authentic. Definitely will be revisiting and exploring the menu!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some great New Mexican food I headed down to the new spot in the up and coming Gramercy development.  Went straight to the bar as that's my usual spot to hang out grab some drinks and enjoy the atmosphere.  To start off Pinches has a great little seating area and some fun decor with an actual taco truck inside the main dining room.  That is about all they have going for them. I sat for about 20min, at  the bar, before being acknowledged. After another 10min I finally had some water in front of me and was able to place a food order while the guest sitting in the booth behind me (that were there long before me) waited to be served. As I write this now at the end of my experience they still don't have water in front of them. Food came to me in a decent timeframe although it wasn't what I ordered. When my order arrived, I have to say, it wasn't bad! Nothing special, but not bad.   The staff argued with each other in front of guests, constantly on their phones, not cleaning the dirty dining room, it was really rather embarrassing.  Where it got at its worst and prompted me to write this review was when I witnessed the bartender eat french fries off the back bar, proceed to washing dirty glasses, then eat more fries, then make and garnish a drink. Did I mention that during that time she never once washed her hands!!!!  The rest doesn't need to be mentioned, that is more than enough for me to know that I will never be coming back here or recommending it to anyone.  I'm going to attempt to track someone down to close out my bill now since the same bartender left the bar unattended for a cig brake."}
{"text":"Sad to say I thought it was just okay.  I had three street tacos carnitas (pork)pescado (fish) and asada (steak) neither had any flavor. I get trying to apese the masses but this tasted like nothing.  Even with their salsa I was surprised at how lack lust they were. I gave this an ok rating because I have faith they will make changes. Also their staff was very friendly. I will give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Ordered a pastor burrito with everything. I ended up getting a bean burrito with a lil bit of meat. Would of been fine had they given me a descent amount of meat tho."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Mexican places I've been to in the southwest (of Las Vegas). We were greeted promptly by a waitress who was just passing by and told us to sit where ever we like. We sat in the bar area at a table, it took a few minutes for us to be notice but the service was really great. We came during happy hour which is from 4-7 pm all tacos are al a carte but only $2 each (there are a few exceptions though).  The food:  We ordered 1 taco al pastor - really good but a little too marinated for my taste.  1 shrimp taco - amazing!  1 fish taco - amazing! 1 pollo a la parilla - so moist and well cooked/marinated 1 taco de lengua - the meat itself lacked some flavor and the green salsa on it was too spicy for me but overall this one gets a 3 on its own. 1 gringo taco - comes in a fried hard shell tortilla, my bf really liked this one.   The ambiance is loud and fun as a bar should be. But if you want to privacy and seclusion they have the opposite side of the bar where the dining area is which I think is good for that."}
{"text":"Overly priced Mexican food. Nothing to actually rave about....  Paying for location it felt like.  Great service and ambience but 4 bucks for a small regular taco isn't worth it... Although the carne asada fries were good. Definitely gotta try it at least once. Just to say you've been to \"Pinches Tacos\""}
{"text":"Tastes like Mexico.  Not California, not Texas. Mexico.  Delicious...with many options for both meat and veggie eaters.  We are enjoying vegetarian flautas right now;)"}
{"text":"The decor is really cute in here, love the seats in the bar area as well. The food however, is pretty bland, and kind of pricey to boot. We had the carne asada burrito, which was so full of refried beans I had forgotten it was supposed to be steak, the few pieces of steak that were in there tasted so overwhelmingly of onion i was glad that there wasn't more. Don't get me wrong, I love onions, and cook and eat them all the time, however the meat tasted like it was marinated in grated white onion and nothing else, though the meat was tender. The salsa that was served on the side was completely flavorless, though it did look to be freshly made. We also had a 3 taco combo which came with rice and beans (both bland) the chicken mole taco was good, but not great. The citrus carnitas were totally flavorless, and the adobada pork was surprisingly also tasteless as well. The tortillas however appeared to be freshly made, and were really good. We also had chicken flautas, which were probably the best thing we ate, although once again, the chicken lacked flavor. We also tried a veggie taco. The vegetables weren't caramelized, and... Big surprise here.... Lacked any sort of flavor.  I will say that all of the ingredients seemed fresh, and of decent quality. Everything needed salt, and desperately lacked flavor, heat, or taste of any kind. They joke that this is Mexican food for gringos, they aren't kidding.  For the price ( around $50, for counter service, this to me is expensive.) We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend. Never would've known this place was there if someone hadn't told me. Consider it a hidden gem. Plenty of space when you walk in. No host was there when we arrived so not sure if there is one generally there. One of the servers who was helping another table said we could sit wherever we liked. There is vehicle built into the establishment which is an interesting touch. When you first walk in there is opening seating. When you proceed further there is a bar. The decorations in the establishment are all Hispanic based. Bright vivid pastel colors. This place serves up street taco style tacos (fit in the palm of your hand). The combo plate they have gives you 3 tacos, rice & beans. I ordered the asada (grilled angus beef), pescado (Fish with Veracruz cole slaw) & Pollo a la Parrilla (grilled chicken) w/ beans on the side for my date. My date ordered the combo plate w/ chicken & asada double rice. Her plate came out first & 5 minutes later my plate came out. This was odd to me that our food didn't come out at the same time.  The food was delicious. The fish was well put together w/ flavors. The chicken was not dry which can happen from time to time. It's flavoring was on point. The asada was the tastiest of the three in my opinion. However it was a close race for sure between the three. My date also enjoyed her tacos.  This is a place I will return to for more tasty tacos. As mentioned it's def a hidden gem of tasty goodness."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! The vibe is completely LA, and the food is by FAR the best Mexican food on this side of the 15!!! Do yourself a favor and get the sangria! And don't complain because this isn't your typical fruit punch on the rocks sangria. Oh and anytime Don Julio is involved you know it's legit. 5 stars for the potato and cheese taquitos, shrimp tacos, and whatever Pandora station they're playing."}
{"text":"This place had some good chips and salsa and even better Horchata.  It's in a very hipster mall, but it was good."}
{"text":"You can't beat these tacos. I really love the Gringo tacos- they have awesome happy hours too. And now so close to where I live? Heaven!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is amazing!! There were three tacos that the guy at the counter recommended and it was so good. The gringo taco se were great too. It's worth leaving the Main Strip for this. And they serve beer!"}
{"text":"Cute, unique inside w/ the food truck and very colorful.  I like the outdoor indoor bar, skinny margarita, the Gringo or hard shell taco and hot sauce.  The people were friendly and view great.    I had the mole street taco as well which I'd say was ok, my friends looked better, but mine was mostly sauce.  A bit too much sauce.  I'll be back to try more, but hope they have more than just the Gringo to go back for.  I am not into much pork, but hear it's good."}
{"text":"Tacos were excellent. I recommend the al pastor tacos and blood orange margarita.    Best part, apart from food, is the relaxed container park vibe. Younger crowd and plenty of kids mixed in.   We stayed at the golden nugget, it's about a 10 min walk and a nice break from the madness.  Like a trip to Austin Texas.  Prices are reasonable.    Plenty of other places to eat and drink if you have some in your party who only eat American. It's cool to walk around with a beer and sit anywhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! The food is amazing and the owners make me feel right at home. Nothing is better than tacos and tequila! If you're looking for a great vibe with authentic Mexican food, you have found the right spot :)"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good!  We got carne asada tacos, adobada tacos, an al pastor sope and washed it down with a michelada.  Everything was fantastic and we can't wait to come back and try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Florida and stumbled on to this gem at Container Park. Everything is cooked to order fresh including the corn tortillas for our carne asada tacos. We don't have good Mexican food in Florida, wish I can convince Pinches Tacos to move. Worth every penny and then some."}
{"text":"Addicted to The churros!!! The food is authentic! The staff is helpful and gave out free shots on Cinco De Mayo oh and a free sombrero!! Love this place! It's in container park too so it's a great hip atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The gringo tacos are the best ever. It's always great service from great people. I recommend coming everyday."}
{"text":"My pinche  review... When I saw this place (container park) I just had to stop and check it out. It kinda looked like a kids Quest for adults. I walked around checking all those unique stores and places to eat and decided to go into the pinches tacos container and order some food. Not my first time in a container but it is the first ordering tacos inside one. Last time I was in one of those containers there was definitely no tacos or beer for that matter and my \"first\" class travel companions weren't as nice as the people inside this one, but that's another story and what happened in that container stayed in that container, this is Vegas and this review is about pinches tacos....... The menu. I didn't get to read it all, actually I wasn't really going to try it is a huge blackboard with like a thousand items written all over it. the combo plate for 8.95 any three tacos caught my eyes and I ordered the asada tacos but came up to 10.45 because they charge .50 extra per taco for the asada or seafood. ( asada tacos are made with grilled angus beef.) Most of the seating is outside but they did manage to include some seating inside and if you're lucky you may find an empty table inside and enjoy your tacos in full container experience, specially if it's freezing outside.  Tacos were good...very good. I need to go back and try other items, I took a to go menu and been planning my next visit. Tacos de pollo mole and camaron Fritos sounds very appetizing as many other items on the extensive menu. Service was good, you place your order, you're given a number (a Mexican lottery card in this case) and your food is delivered to your table by a smiling employee that makes sure your experience at pinches tacos is an excellent one.  If you like good tasting tacos made with quality fresh ingredients and a clean environment, pinches tacos is the place to go. If cheap quantity and greasy food is your thing,.... well Roberto, this is not for you, but you'll be Gordo in no time.  #greatfood! #greatservice #gordo=fat"}
{"text":"First time here.  Love the atmosphere and decoration.  Great bar and outside patio.  The tacos are so delicious.  Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos! Very flavorful carne asada and the gringo taco is so good! The service was quick and the music they were playing was on point. I ordered the 3 taco combo plate with the gringo and they were delicious. The tortilla was freshly made. I'm craving it already and I just had it 4 hours ago!"}
{"text":"Went here to see what the rave about the asada fries was over... Unfortunately after waiting over 40 minutes and numerous people whom came in after me getting their food , i asked for a refund...i mean seem to me they were having too much fun in the back laughing giggling and not paying attention because also someone else's fries were never received.... not to mention i received a parking ticket for time limit on meter... for my to go fries i never even got to taste"}
{"text":"First time here and I love it.  Food is very fresh and tasty. I had the potato cheese taquitos with super fresh guacamole.  Gringo fries are tasty. Will come again"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here. I could hardly wait, thinking it would be like the PT in culver city & Santa Monica.  First off the service was horrible when we went lastnight. At about 9, Young people who didn't seem to know anything about customer service. They didn't smile, they were not friendly. Not professional, long faces on the young waitress & the man who brought the food & the one handling the money. The waitress went home walked out the door & didn't say bye, nothing! No one ever came back to ask if everything was ok, if we wanted another beer, etc. They never offered us dessert. We waited for someone to come back & ask us if we were ready for our check. We waited awhile for some assistance. It never happened, we had to get up & go look for someone. The bill was wrong. It had to be fixed. That took forever. Last the food was tasteless, cold & tasted as if it was out of a can. We were so disappointed. I hyped the place up to my friends who at the restaurant couldn't stop making jokes to me how bad everything was & what was I talking about when I said it was really good. We all will never go back. The awful service was inexcusable due to the fact it was a slow night. The worst experience in eating out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Was REALLY Delicious. Way better than it looked from the outside. The Name says it all lol"}
{"text":"The tacos were a rip off. I actually visited Marianas grocery store and they were better. Thanks for trying though guys."}
{"text":"Today was the third time visiting this location, and I will not be back again. The first time I had the tacos and they were ok. Second time, the burrito, which was very bland. Today I ordered the carne asada salad and the chicken tortilla soup. The salad was a joke, soggy shredded lettuce with no flavor, same as the chewy carne asada. The tortilla soup was very sweet and dense, tasted like a curry soup. It was terrible! This place is overpriced, overhyped, and some of the guys working there are plain rude. I'd prefer Taco Bell over this place."}
{"text":"Best taco ever the \"Gringo\"! Beautiful location, reminds me of Los Angeles. Bartenders and staff are so friendly and happy especially Alexis."}
{"text":"I eat here just about every time I'm in the Container Park. Often the lines are relatively long, but usually go fairly quick. The prices are decent and the portions for most items are definitely solid. Most importantly, the food is outstanding. Nothing I would recommend avoiding."}
{"text":"ALWAYS Great drinks and awesome bartenders!  They make the best Micheladas. My fave foods are the fried quesadilla,  gringo taco and potato & cheese flautas...a must try!....AnD the corn in a cup is yummO too! Ask for the Diablo salsa if you like that extra kick."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Tacos were great nachos elote!! Gonna be telling everyone bout this spot"}
{"text":"Gotta Get Me Some Gringo Tacos To Finish The Week Out!  Love the colors, the atmosphere and all the great employees!  Be sure to tell Javier Hi and try one of their amazing Blood Orange Margaritas!  Oh ya-happy hour Tues-Sat. From 4-7!"}
{"text":"Tortillas, great! Everything else, terrible!   I went in for Taco Tuesday last night hoping to find a joint to return to every Tuesday since I just moved to town and I will not be back! A server came by to get us our drinks pretty quick and after that he just disappeared and I had to wave him down every time I needed something. He acted disinterested and never checked on us. Beers were $6-$7.   On Tuesday pork and chicken tacos are $2 so I ordered one Al Pastor, one Carnitas and 3 Chicken. As soon as I bit into the carnitas it was gross and I put it down. The Al Pastor was bearable, kind of. Same with the chicken. I ended up eating my Al Pastor taco and one chicken taco and asking for the check. Nobody asked us how our food was which most restaurants do right after your first bite.   Not going back. Terrible service and tacos."}
{"text":"I only do reviews for the best places and Pinches is near perfection for street tacos and anything Mexican cuisine related. Order their al pastor tacos and street corn on the cob! Yum!"}
{"text":"I think that Pinches Taco's just became my favorite Mexican food spot! Their food is delicious and made with premium ingredients and well priced. I would recommend anyone to Pinches Tacos, this is a fun and taco shop that offers great food and I love the name with the story behind it!!! Freakin awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The owner and staff are so friendly. They always make me the best chilaquiles even though it's usually past their breakfast time when I stop by. I feel comfortable to bring my 2 year old here plus he loves their guac and flautas. I heard the bar just opened here so I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Very different than your normal restaurant experience. Decor is fun. Food is delicious.  There are like 18 things I want to try on the menu. The indoor/ outdoor bar is pretty awesome. Staff was friendly and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The girl working in the cashier in that moment seemed like she didn't even want to work. I got 12 tacos for a group of people and the tacos were very small like extremely small lol and expensive. The taste was decent, but I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Fun ambiance and delicious food  and drinks.   The ambiance is fun.  Good music. They have indoor and outdoor seating.   The food was delicious but they seemed a little light on the meat and I ordered an extra side of carne asada.  Quality ingredients with lots of flavor.   Service could have been better but they worked hard. I think we were just there during a rush.   Margarita was delicious.   Fernando one of the owners was there and greeted everyone.   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Obviously many like this place, I find it to fall short of real Mexican food as West-coast folks know it. Unlike SoCal or Baja , the portions are small and the prices are high.  My true test at any 'traditional' Mexican food restaurant is the carne asada tacos. That's what I ordered, and was very much unimpressed. The beef did not smell fresh. Evidently my nose and taste buds were right as my stomach bothered me all day after. It was very gamy tasting, enough to where their verde salsa couldn't cover it up.  I'll save my next trip for Tacos El Gordo. Fresh, inexpensive, and authentic."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has four stars! We got three tacos, a chicken, a steak, and a pork, and they were all a bit bland and dry.... We also had food from the hot dog place, as well as the vegan place... Those two places were better! Overall a disappointment."}
{"text":"Most terrible tacos I've ever tried. Carnitas are overly dry terrible taste, al pastor has absolutely no flavor and meat was so hard it is cut horribly. The quesadilla was good but tacos are terrible. Pinches tacos???? Pinches tacos de la verga!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night. Fun  atmosphere and good decor. The gringo taco was my favorite. The owner (maybe manager?) came by and we asked what the cactus taco was. He insisted we try it and brought us a free one. Totally unique flavor. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Good flavors but the price for tacos is a bit steep. Need to go during happy hour to take advantage of the price drop. The chicken mole taco is amazing."}
{"text":"First time at container park. Really good food. Super flavorful and real Mexican. I had the asada taco plate. Definitely should try the blood orange margarita too! I didn't try the corn on the Cobb but it looked so freaking good, I'm for sure going to try it next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Outstanding service! Blood orange margaritas, perfection! Waitress took our drink order before we even sat down, high five! Love the gringo tacos, asada tacos, beans and rice....It's all good! My fav taco spot in LV hands down."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas!! There's a lot of sub par Mexican food in vegas... this place is killer!! Come hang at container park downtown, catch some great music and get yourself some badass tacos!!   The wait is a little long but it's worth every second"}
{"text":"Love the place !! Very good Street Tacos ... Especially the GRINGO !! The owner is very nice and makes the atmosphere way better ! Very clean !!"}
{"text":"I never get tired of this place. Tortillas are made fresh. Horchata isn't overly sweet. The gringo taco is the best thing there. It's all I get. The inside is very nice and well decorated. Come on Tuesdays for  $2 tacos!! (Not all, but the gringo is 2 bucks and that's the only one that matters)"}
{"text":"I heard this place was really good so Wife and decided to give it a go, the bar was busy but we managed to get a couple seats. We waited for at least 15min before even being acknowledged then another 10min for our micheladas. She said she would be right back to take our food order but never came back we legit waited another 45min before leaving. It seemed the bartenders friends were more important than taking care of regular guests cause the people next to us got there food and refilled drinks, every time I tried to get someone's attention they wouldn't even look our way. I'm sure this place is great and the food is great but they really need to work on service specially at the bar and not making us feel like we don't exist! I hate giving bad reviews but this was not cool specially being in the bar industry!!  Edit- this place has grown on me since the last time I've been here and the manager was super cool! Didn't ask but bought our table a round of shots!"}
{"text":"This place use to be so much better. They are stretching everything and putting much smaller portions now. The corn is old and has black spots, the fries come n a half box now and they still charge the same $8 or $9. I don't know what's going on but I won't be back until it changes."}
{"text":"WOW, the worst place for lunch.  we had a group of 8 people. good thing we didnt have more co-workers come with us. they asked if we are paying separate or together on one check, separate.  we were told to go to the truck window and order our own.  okay.  we were served our food by them calling it out.  got the 3 taco combo $9.00 with rice and beans. steak - eh tongue - eh grilled chicken - eh beans - bland rice - bland chips - okay automated COKE drink dispenser - awesome!  went back to the office, everyone asked, how was it, even the ones that also told us its not good.  WILL NEVER GO BACK.    they need to season their food, at least taste before you send them out to the paying guest.  Decor was great too look at, maybe they spent their monies on all that and their focus, when they should focus on their cooks and preps for their food.  I even had another co-worker that is having a birthday party celebration in container park tomorrow at their other location.  Now he doesn't want to go.  Maybe the liquor is better than their food."}
{"text":"My wife and I can't get enough Pinches!  We've been back several times since our first visit and review, and we're never disappointed by the quality of the food, the level of service, or the deliciousness of the blood orange margaritas!  We are slowly working our way through the menu options (there's seriously something for everyone), and I hope to try every taco, but the Al Pastor is definitely my fave!"}
{"text":"Love love love! This place! The food is great, the restaurant is smokin cool and they have a great HAPPY HOUR.   But the reason you will come back is the people, they make you feel like family. Thanks Max you are our favorite!   The family!"}
{"text":"Tacos was poppin. Drank a solid 1 beer. But loved their carnitas tacos and their lengua. Shoutout all the people working late and dealing with my drunk self."}
{"text":"great little spot @ container park! chicken taco and steak tacos were good! =) had the mexican corn on the cob and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Viva Las Vegas baby!  The Good. Location-location-location.  We are staying at the Golden Nugget and it was only about a 10 minute walk down Fremont Street to the location which is inside a very nice area called the Downtown Container Park.  This location houses cute boutiques, novelty shops and dining.  Let's continue with the Good.  The food.  It is a walk in and order go find a seat kinda place.  We walked in both I and my girlfriend ordered the 3 taco plate with rice and beans.  We each got the two chicken and one carne asada tacos.  Both of our meals were very tasty and as I mentioned came with rice, beans and chips.  The chicken was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The carne asada was delicious with minimal grissle like other places have.  My date is very picky about Spanish rice, but she loved there's.  Me, I am picky about my Frijoles and these were the perfect blend and seasoned well.  The chips were very good, thick, hot and crunchy.  Price.  Wow!  Was only $9.50 per plate.  Great bargain especially for Vegas over priced food.  Would go back again and again.  The Bad.  When I was done I hungered for more......don't want to be a piggy.  The Ugly.  Nothing ugly about this place and location.  The atmosphere was very family friendly with music playing and entertainment all around."}
{"text":"5 stars for their fish tacos and their guacamole. By far the best I've ever had. And I am taco obsessed (I even had its tattooed on me) so I feel I can give you a good honest review.   We had a selection of other tacos. All nice but pretty standard. Pollo was a stand out one and the Carne Asada Fries were pretty bad ass but mainly because of their fresh guac. The best guacamole  hands down.   We got the fish taco on the side just to try and it ended up being the nicest thing we ate. So many flavours. I am in my happy place."}
{"text":"I came here with one of my friends because he said the food here was really good and it really was. They gave us friendly customer service , food kinda took a while but it was worth it. I got a chicken, chorizo, lengua and asada tacos . They were really good specially the lengua one . And the sauces are good as well , ( better then other Mexican restaurants) !"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced flavorless mexican food. Customer service.,. Ehhhh not so good. I know they pay premium for this location but come on.... At least put meat in your beef. They get two stars because I like the chips yet the burrito and tacos we got were so gross!"}
{"text":"I eat here EVERY time I come to Vegas. It is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at and the prices are extremely good for Vegas. I highly recommend the \"lil estiffy\" it is incredible!! I love the vibe of the container park and the staff has always been awesome every time I come in. Hands down the best place to grab good Mexican food in Vegas for cheap."}
{"text":"Well, I must have been eating chocolates prior to my last rating because this time around the carnitas were tasty. My sister would sum up the review with a simple, \"Yummy.\" However, we're not talking men we're discussing food. I am not a good food critic, but these tacos were finger licking good. I also had the blood orange margarita; at first I thought the guy at the counter stiffened me, nah, I can't get off my chair tasty these are. Shsssss don't tell my therapist. F me crazy, I am so glad I came back and gave these guys another try.   Honest, it's not the tequila talking come and give them a try. Down town is not just a great song it's a great place to spend a few hours. Las Vegas rules!"}
{"text":"First time I came here was for an event. I liked the location, the atmosphere was nice & unique. I like how they added the taco truck inside where you order that was a nice touch. The floutas were delicious along with the chilequillas. Cant forget about the blood orange margarita on the rocks! Provided excellent service, i will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Pinches tacos is awesome beginning with the name. Haha! I really like to go at night because the container park becomes 21+ which means that there are no children running around, also there are only 2 indoor tables, so make sure you go on a pretty day since they have plenty of patio seating.  This place has my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas. The favors are pretty authentic, the staff is super friendly, the prices are very reasonable and of course, the food is amazeballs.  If you go for breakfast, try the Chilaquiles. If you go for lunch, anything will do. I've had their enchiladas, flautas, tacos, etc. Everything is always great.  You can't really leave the place without trying their blood orange margaritas, let me warn you though, THEY WILL MESS YOU UP! I am not kidding, those are not weak at all!  Some others of my faves are: Horchata, Elotes, Churros"}
{"text":"The food was great. The tacos are good specially the carnitas and adobado."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! You can see them make the food as you wait. I tried them once & was foolish not to order more. I will do the take out thing so my fiancé can sample this new, excellent Mexican place. We are always going to different Mexican restaurants to see which ones stand out & which ones are regular. This place definitely stands out. It's in a great location as well. Right off of the 215. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Beat place ever they have to die for carne asada crispy fries and the BEST ORANGE BLOOD margarita in las vegas....I will be going back alot"}
{"text":"Ok; I hate to rate food places low but when you pay $18 for four small tacos and two have worse than gross beef, rather its beef that's not edible you've earned your one star and I swear if I could give no stars I would. I saw some good fries another customer ordered maybe that's why they get good reviews but don't buy their meat tacos unless you want the inedible type shown here."}
{"text":"Pinches tacos is located near our office and we usually go there once a week!  We love the food, staff, and owner.  The ambiance is festive and great for having a meal, a drink, or watching a game.  This is a great locals restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well, I guess one star isn't being fair to the food since we didn't actually eat .. This one star rating is for the lack of service.  My mom & I walked in, were greeted promptly by a guy who handed us menus and advised us to sit anywhere we wanted.  Now, I guess to be fair to him, and the girl that was also serving, the NCAA Championship game was on.  So, the end of the game and the three other tables in the restaurant were taking up a lot of their time.  Anyway, we perused the menu for a couple of minutes, decided what we wanted, put the menus down, and waited for someone to come by to take our order.  And waited .. and waited.  We sat there for a good five minutes and nobody ever visited our table to take a drink order, ask if we had any questions .. Nothing.  After the server walked to the bar to deliver food on a couple occasions, said 'hi' to his buddy and deftly avoided our table, we decided to get up and leave.  I'm a sous chef and I am very forgiving when a place is busy; but this was unacceptable.  Bummer, because I've heard good things about the food here."}
{"text":"If you're tired of the \"berto\" franchises this place will make you appreciate good Mexican food. Tasty fresh and great quality food.  I had the shrimp tacos and beef flautas...they were awesome.  Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great!  I only gave them 4 stars for now cause it was my first time. I plan to visit them again and see if they're consistent with food quality and service :) But for now they're food was great"}
{"text":"This place is such a cute spot to get some great tacos! I love how vibes you get when you are in Pinches Tacos. If you are looking for a cool spot definitely stop by! Will be back to get some more street style with some clients after we view some houses!"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot! The interior decor is out of this world, full food truck inside complete with tables and fences as if you're road side at an authentic food truck! I got the combination 3 taco plate, my always fav carnitas was yum and our server suggested the Gringo as a crowd favorite, and she was absolutely right! Very good"}
{"text":"Cute little Mexican food place to eat at. His one is my favorite in container park. They forgot about us and brought us a plate of chips and salsa with guacamole. That little extra step made the difference. The food is delicious and served hot and fresh. Thank you for the awesome meal."}
{"text":"Five stars for super friendly staff, but tacos were just ok, nothing special. Got 3 tacos- pollo, asada, and al pastor, not very memorable. Maybe I should of ordered something different. Inside is cute, and probably a good place for happy hour or grab a drink with friends. I recommend going to Tacos & Beer instead."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Good prices. Restaurant is super cute and they have a bar! - their flautas are delicious. Not 5 stars because it is not my favorite but I really really like it."}
{"text":"You must have the corn on the cobb stick. The carne asada fries are loaded with beans, cheese, onions, cilantro, pico de gallo, and guacamole. Extra points for the guacamole as it was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"For an Asian girl who doesn't eat much Mexican food, someone has to explain to me why I love this place so much.  Is it authentic? Traditional and genuine Mexican cuisine? I have no idea.   All I do know is:  - I'm so distracted by eating here that I haven't take one picture of my food. Whoa. Serious.   - Big menu. I love lots of choices, even vegetarian items. Bonus!  - They make a lot of their items from scratch, including their guacamole and re-fried beans. Yummy!  - Location. I get to eat in peace while I watch my boys play in the tree house. Yes, both kids, my toddler and my boyfriend.  - They bring the food to you. I'm sure we've sat at a very far table to see an eye on my son. But they spotted the order number stick thingamabob every time...and fast!  So Pinches has my vote. Their food is what I look forward to when we decide on visiting the park. The chips and guacamole are usually gone by the time my boys come back from the tree house."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place and I was a little disappointed. I order the not nachos (Asada) (around 10 bucks) and the flavor was on point,however the temp was not. The meat was almost as cold as the gauc. But in all fairness I didn't complain or ask them to fix it because I didn't have time for all that. Other then that the food flavor was on point and I would try it again during the day next time (I came around midnight)"}
{"text":"Located in a cute, quaint shopping area. The decor is nice and chic and the prices are very affordable. Great for late night munchies."}
{"text":"Ordered asada fries and combo asada taco plate. Could have added more asada on fries, tacos were good. A bit overpriced on what I normally would pay. All in all good tasting late lunch"}
{"text":"Food is good and service was meh. 1 star rating is due to the incredibly rude staff at the bar. When management was notified of the unacceptably rude service, they did little more than to make excuses. No apologies or anything. I have a feeling some type of unprofessional relationship exists between management and the bartenders. The female with gauged ears was the worse of them all. Hopefully the owner takes this into consideration and takes appropriate action. She single-handedly lost this restaurant a decent amount of potential business."}
{"text":"Purpose if visit. Late lunch after going out Friday night. Ordered the Los diablos al pastor burrito. Marinated pork with jalapeño peppers, rice, sour cream and guacamole. Burrito was perfect for a hangover. Spicy enough for a nice kick. The homemade chips and salsa was excellent. The homemade hot sauce was also a great addition. Peppery but had a long lasting kick. Ordered a nice horchata drink. Tasted like rice pudding with cinnamon. Very sweet. Perfect inexpensive lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Ordered fish tacos. They brought TONGUE!!! Omg. Did not even replace. Very disgusted and upset. Plus they charged us."}
{"text":"A fantastic little taco shop inside the Container Park. The menu offerings are vast and all made with pride as well ample in size. The staff is friendly and lend to an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was prepared and tasted perfectly.  The Mexican corn on the cob was excellent. The corn was sweet and the toppings were in perfect proportion.  The chips were homemade just right and the salsa was a delicious complement.  Although I loved everything, my favorite part of my meal was the carne asada taco. The meat was great, tender and well-seasoned, but the highlight was the handmade corn tortillas. Whooo-weee! So soft and light. Totally made my taco!  I can't wait to get back to Pinches!"}
{"text":"Came in with my little brother for an early dinner. He and his friends love this place. We set up at the bar and we're going to buy two really nice bartenders immediately. We ordered the Mexican corn (elote) to start and it was delicious.  We ordered six different kinds of tacos. The gringos were the best. Don't ask questions just order them. Al pastor was second best.  They have a really good happy hour Monday through Friday from 4 to 7 I believe.  Not the best tacos I've ever had but hard to beat for only two dollars apiece."}
{"text":"Blood orange margaritas are better than iv e ever had! Delish tacos too. 2nd time visiting. Made a special trip this time"}
{"text":"I didn't really like tacos until I had gone to Tijuana. This place somewhat reminds me of Tijuana so obviously, I kind of liked it haha They have a pick three tacos for $10 thing. It comes with rice and beans. When you ask for more though they dont tell you thats its an extra charge - so keep that in mind! The only thing I get when I come here is the pescado tacos - it is so freaking good and comes with this red sauce on top that goes really well with the fish. Im not sure if they have taco tuesday - weve gone in a few times on a Tuesday and no one has told us of any specials. WHY NO TACO TUESDAY. This is all."}
{"text":"Tacos were okay, tortillas were hand made. Salsa was tasty but not very hot. Rice was not orange and sort of bland. Beans were good and last but not least horchata was gross."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas in my opinion. Their horchata is some of the best I have tasted. They have Mexican corn on the cob that I would drive hours for just to eat. The staff is very friendly and it's in an amazing location. I would highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Chips and guac were delicious. The cheese enchiladas were too sweet for my liking but my husband didn't seem to mind. Steak burrito was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is the Mexican street food I've been searching for in Las Vegas. And I didn't expect to find it in such a touristy area, but there it is. Everything I tried here was great. It reminded me of the Mexican food they have in Tucson, AZ. Which is a huge compliment cause Tucson is almost in Mexico location wise.   I got the vegetable torta and it was AWESOME. It's not what you typical led expect because the bread wasn't fried and was more like a pocket they put all the fixings inside, but it was so so good! The tacos, guac, chips, salsa... You name it, it was great.  The place is small and definitely a hole in the wall, but thats what I look for when I'm trying to spot good street food. Take a chance on this place, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada torta plate and an elote with everything on it. The torta was pretty delicious. Better than most I've had. The corn is basic but still hits the spot.  I give this place 3 stars only because they don't seem too nice when you kindly tell them they accidentally messed up your order. A little \"I'm sorry I'll fix it right away\" could help. I also rate 3 because it's a tad bit overpriced. $3 for one taco? C'mon guys."}
{"text":"Wonderful margaritas for happy hour!! The tacos are all spectacular as well!  Good selection of different tacos."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at this place a few months back and I posted a review which was removed. I am reposting. If you aren't friends with the staff, don't expect to get great service, rather it will be mediocre at best. We thought since we were latinos too we'd at least get more one-on-one time. One of my kids ordered the street tacos. We were told they would be bigger than the ones on the street and weren't. They were the exact same size for 3 times the price! And we went during the non-peak hours. We ordered another plate which I can't remember the name but it was a hot mess. Almost like it was all tossed together on the plate. The presentation was awful. We waited a long time for our meals. They were very pricey too. Which I guess is because of the location. We definitely will not be back. Save your $!"}
{"text":"The steak taco was really good. But, the margaritas were just awful. Would eat there again but skip the crime against nature that is their margaritas."}
{"text":"Salsas are really good,  homemade tortillas and the guacamole with queso and Chile poblano is delicious."}
{"text":"I 100 percent think we got ripped off. We ordered the sopes an enchilada and 2 taquitos and chips and salsa for 2 buck it was 34 dollars. It was packed in there a lonnnggg lonnng line behind us and drunk patrons getting angry at the wait so we didnt want to question the guy behind the register. But I was super dissaponited. The food was good but felt like fast food and not worth the money. Id like to have my 34 dollars back and wish this mediocre experience never happened."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews here my husband and I wanted to try. We were very disappointed. We ordered the combination plate that has 3 tacos, rice and beans. I wish the menu or the waitress told us the tacos come dressed. Meaning they have the cilantro, onion and salsa. I hate onions and I'm not of fan of red salsa for my tacos. After fixing them to my liking I noticed there was little meat. I had lengua,  al pastor, and carnitas and all were hidden by a big helping of cilantro, onion, salsa and/or pico de gallo. One of my tortillas was under cooked and all of them fell apart when you picked them up to eat. The meats were tasty but not enough for a serving. Stars for decor and friendly service but food is overpriced for the portions.  I was rooting for this place but at the end was disappointed."}
{"text":"Liked this place a lot. Atmosphere is great, it's really cleverly decorated. One of the managers came out to talk to us and really made the experience memorable. I liked the tacos but unfortunately they were out of the three I wanted to try, we came at a weird time in between lunch and dinner, they said they would have it ready for dinner time. Still, I enjoyed the chicken, the gringo, and the adobada. If they open a location on the other side of town we might become regulars. If you live in the area, go here instead of that other taco chain, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to hit this spot up since I caught a shot of their breakfast torta on social media- it looked incredible! But I'm rarely on this side of town when the sun's coming up, so the b-fast menu wasn't available when I stopped by.  Opted for a couple of different menu items with different meats- the sopes were  little underwhelming, but the tacos were large and meaty for the price. I appreciated that they had lengua available, despite it not being listed with the other meats on the menu. Maybe it's only around as a trial, as the texture was wonderfully soft and tender but the flavor just wasn't that great. The carnitas were a little better, but again, not great. Food was comfortingly homestyle though.  I dig the location, the art on the walls, and the table cards. I've heard good things about this place but I guess I didn't order well. I'll have to come for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Came here after the pool and it was a perfect fit for a real margarita (after my wack one at the pool), a blood orange spiced margarita at that! And perfect food to fit the hot summer!  I tried Pinches in the container park and didn't know they had a new location until I saw it in the Weekly. They talked highly about it so after the pool it sounded like a good choice.   It was exciting to walk in and see all of the decoration. There was a big stop light that I didn't get to take a picture of because my phone was on 1%.   The taquitos were our appetizer. So good! I can't believe it had potatoes inside. I got the combination plate- cactus, vegetarian and shrimp. While my girlfriend had the fish, chicken and shrimp. I tried everything and it was good! I think the fish was the best!   I saw a corn and we couldn't resist to order one and share. The Mexican-style corn is her favorite thing! She ate most of it. I thought it was too cheesy. She said it was the most authentic. I said well it's made by real Mexicans, what do you expect."}
{"text":"Best place in town, if you want great tacos then look no further! Javy and the whole crew are amazing, you will feel like family even if it's your first time in!"}
{"text":"My wife and I sat at the bar, after we ordered our food and cocktails. We were ignored... couldn't get refills for water,couldn't get any kind of service.  Tacos were good - but, the service at the bar was horrible."}
{"text":"The customer service sucked. We waited 15 minutes for someone to even approach us. I'd understand that there was a wait if it were busy, but the restaurant was empty. Also our food was cold. 10/10 do not recommend this restaurant. I'm livid."}
{"text":"I went to Pinches for lunch and was so thrilled with my choice! The atmosphere is beyond adorable and the food is amazing! We started with some chips and salsa which were extremely fresh and amazing. I went with a margarita because tacos + margarita = match made in heaven. Man this margarita was GOOD! This wasn't your typical fake juice margarita. The lime was so intense and tart which really made the margarita stand out. As for the tacos, I went with the al pastor and the asada. Both were amazing! The al pastor was pretty spicy but so delicious and the asada was great as well. It was much more mild but provided a big punch of flavor! I can not wait to come back and try their other menu options. I'm especially excited to try the huevos rancheros! I will be coming back VERY soon!"}
{"text":"I love street tacos so decided to try this place. Honestly, I've had better. Pepe's Tacos and Robertos are WAY better! $3.50 each for a carne asada taco was a rip off. I had an horchata which was very small for the price (Roberto's taco shop horchata is huge and well worth it). What really concerned us was the rating from the Nevada Health Department. Didn't notice it until we were eating. They had a \"B\" rating and I can tell you from working in food & beverage, that is NOT good. We found out why...we saw a woman wearing regular clothes (manager ??) enter the kitchen and begin to work with the food with no gloves or hairnet. Then after a few minutes her daughter came into the kitchen to \"play\" around right next to the food!! I would think if you already have a poor \"B\" rating, that would teach you to adhere to the health laws. apparently not. I wouldn't try this place until they get their act together and comply with sanitation laws."}
{"text":"Well well well it looks like another Southern California favorite has made it here to Vegas but I'm glad it did because it is bomb!   First of all how cool it the name the style of this place? The cool vibrant edgy and kick back feel is exudes through their decor. The owners must want people to feel excited and comfortable yet get great food at the same time.   With a fake taco truck right in the middle of Resturant and Pinches everything this taco place easily won my heart over quick.   But the tacos really do steal the show. With home made tacos fresh in front of your eyes and mouth watering meats who can go wrong. The special \"Gringo\" taco was actually really really good. A hard shell fried taco with tender flavorful steak inside and a spicy creamy sauce it was sooooo good. The lingua was also amazing and as tender as can be. The tortilla though in picture I thought it was going to be this thick doughy tortilla oh but was I wrong thin and warm with a great corn taste you can tell the difference why it's better then store bought and pre made.   Burrito was good and I was glad they had that option but I will stick to the tacos cause they were amazing. They offer a HH with $2 tacos and $4 beers all night on certain night. Owner Fernando went around talking to everyone created a very friendly and inviting atmosphere. Very cool guy! Can't wait tho come back and in the beautiful new Gramercy it was neat. There is also another location at the Container park which I will have to go check out as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! The gringo taco was very good. They should be getting a liquor license soon as well. Nice spot to grab some food and a drink and watch some Football!"}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican during our Trip to Vegas and the place we found was off The Strip in Fremont at Container Park. This place is super small, therefore, sitting outside is recommended. It was actually really nice outside that we didn't mind sitting outside. I had a nacho platter for two with extra chicken and two Mexican cokes. The price was very reasonable. This place is mom and pop ran. The lady at the til had limited English, however, my Spanish was more clear to her than my English so I just went with that. The service was fast. The nachos were in house made. I loved the Salsa."}
{"text":"First off all, this place is located in the shipping container park, which is awesome. I want to build a place just like this in my city and live there.  Secondly, the prices are pretty low for Las Vegas.  Thirdly, the pinto bean sopes are some of the BEST I've ever had. I love sopes. Love them. The texture of the Pinches sopes was perfect, not soggy and not rock hard like at many places (even in Mexico). I took one bite of my boyfriend's and had to go back in and order a whole one just for myself.  The nopal taco is pretty good too, but five stars for the sopes! When they're so good, why would you even want to order anything else?"}
{"text":"Omg the food here is amazing. I had the gringos tacos (lol) and a bomb Elote!! I haven't had a meal that great in a long time. Its also pretty cool how container palr is tucked away from the strip."}
{"text":"Firstly, let me say that I support the business name and theme.  It's got a great vibe to it for a small shop and it isn't afraid to have a little bit of personality.    It's tucked into Container Park near Downtown East Fremont, and I do mean tucked - it's almost hidden in a back corner.  I didn't see a title outside, which is probably thanks to its personality-filled name.  I can dig it.  The service was spot on, friendly and fast.  Everyone on staff delivered full smiles and plenty of help to this gringo as needed.  I ordered the taco combo - three tacos of any choice and rice and beans.  Asada.  Al pastor.  And lenga.  Both the carne asada and the pastor were great, simple with a nice flavor and satisfying.  The lenga was a bit of a disappointment, but it was late in the evening and they did say they were running low.  So I'll cut it a bit of a break.  Overall though, for a quick taco spot in downtown, I think it accomplishes what its after.  And hey, it's all in the name."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor is awesome!   My enchiladas were tasty I got the chicken and the rice and beans are really flavorful. The chips are really good too.  The queso was just ok and my husband wasn't digging the flavor for the tacos. So that was disappointing. I would come back but he said he wouldn't so we're a bit divided."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today because I love tacos and I have heard good things about this place. This location was hard to find, it is back in be corner of the plaza, you can't see it from the streets... I drove around both plazas for a while until I finally saw the sign!   The place is really cute, they have a food truck on the inside, colorful tables and chairs, a bar area for 21+  I got 2 of the beef tongue, 2 pastor, 1 chicken, 1 shrimp (helped a friend out with this one) and corn on the cob. The pastor and the chicken were very tasty! These two stood out the most, the rest of the tacos were alright. The corn was amazing, huge corn ear for $3... The cheese and chili on top were perfect! Also got the hibiscus tea which was very refreshing.   Service was great, the staff were very friendly, very fun and chill environment. They do have happy hour were certain tacos are $2.   However... If you just want good tacos going to a food truck would be less expensive. The beef tongue was over $3 each... Can get the same flavor for cheaper at a food truck. I do recommend checking this place out for the decor and the pastor and chicken!!"}
{"text":"Great Margaritas. Haven't tasted the food yet. But the folks inside are fairly welcoming. Usually stick to the regular margarita, but the orange one isn't too bad. Pretty cool that they give you a \"to go\" with it that way you can walk around the park and drink it."}
{"text":"PRO: got the nachos with Carne asada for 9 & margarita for 7.  Had them spice it up with habanero. Good flavor, but price is crazy."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pinches was on Cinco de Mayo. It was good, but not great like I was expecting based on their reputation around town and as a result would rate my experience at 3.5-4 stars.  First of all, the location isn't the easiest to find. It is part of an urban living shopping center that doesn't have the best parking flow or signage. After driving around the lot for a couple minutes, we found Pinches Tacos' business sign and parked nearby. Walking up to the restaurant is a little nondescript and the front door isn't distinguished as the main entrance. It doesn't have their name on it, the word entrance, or any signage above it; just a sugar skull decal. So we kept walking and ended up awkwardly entering from the patio.   We were promptly greeted and seated at the bar where the bar staff shared the Cinco specials and quickly served us. I tried their blood orange margarita and Taylor had a beer. The Marg was good, not great, they didn't skimp on the booze but I didn't really feel like it had any blood orange flavor.. or really any special flavors beyond the classic Marg.   Food was also very good, but still fell a bit short of great in my opinion. I tried two of their tacos- al Pastor and Carnitas, and Taylor ordered chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The best part of the meal is their homemade tortillas! It is a rare detail to find and makes all the difference in the world. The rice and beans were pretty bland for my taste, but the enchilada sauce was flavorful and an interesting take on the classic red sauce; not quite as spiced as I'm used to but had a rich and luscious texture to bathe every bite of the enchiladas. Again, my tacos were good, not great. I was surprised I preferred the flavors of the Carnitas more than the al Pastor, but I was also pretty disappointed when there was a huge chunk of fat/connective tissue on my small street taco:( When I mentioned it to the server, she didn't really care and just said \"usually they are pretty good about that stuff\".   The atmosphere is really vibrant and unique. It has a laidback vibe of a taqueria but with full service. The bar opens up to a small patio and features an outdoor bar counter for service. There is also a large area for viewing the kitchen and a fun taco truck installation as a service station.   Overall, I was pleased with the quick service with a relaxed atmosphere and the food and drinks are satisfactory enough to ensure I'll return, but not with any urgency."}
{"text":"Honestly this place really let me down and missed the mark. what a bummer. definately wont return.  this is a Mexican place.. they dont bring chips to the table.   No kids menus. no kids crayons or papers to draw on.  ok, ok, I can live with that  but the food is food-truck mediocre (at best) at restaurant prices... and the service was HORRIBLE.  seriously the worst service I have received from anywhere in a long time.   super disappointed, and as a life long Mexican food fan... I wont be back."}
{"text":"They slay. End of story. I can't imagine there being anything on the menu that isn't delicious. The restaurant has a funky, feel good vibe. The gringo taco is by far my favorite. My husband loves the al pastor. The happy hour specials can not be beat. Great margaritas and it's close to home. Seriously, try that gringo taco! It's so good!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, good service but was disappointed that they would not sell me guacamole even though I had ordered $70 worth of food for my party."}
{"text":"I do not understand how this place has such good ratings. The food was mediocre at best and there was nothing about the service or anything that made it worth a higher review.  I got my usual order, a carnitas burrito. I like carnitas above all things because it is juicy and flavorful. This carnitas was the opposite of that. It was chunks of meat (at least they didn't cheap out and skimp?) that had no flavor. None whatsoever. How is this possible? I don't know. I ate about half, then just ended up taking the meat out as I went to make it somewhat palatable. I finally went inside to look for some hot sauce and there was nothing out...no salsa, no sauce, nothing. So I had to ask the cashier for some and I think she gave me 2 of those small cups. This wouldn't have been a problem except it was the only thing giving the burrito any flavor and I went through the 2 little cups in about 2 bites. At least that was spicy, to drown out the flavorlessness of the rest of the burrito.  My sister also had a weird dish with no flavor. I can't remember what it was and I doubt she could either.  There are other places to eat literally across the courtyard from here. Don't waste your time on this mediocrity."}
{"text":"I was just recently introduced to this place..fabulous! The food is outstanding and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is fun and the employees are very friendly. My new favorite Mexican food by real Mexicans! (It's on their signage lol)"}
{"text":"The food is incredible! I actually met Mr. Anaya and he took the time to talk/visit with us at our table for a few minutes... I look forward to seeig the store in Santa Monica.... Asada tacos have the best flavor."}
{"text":"Maybe it's cause I'm from SoCal but the food here was just ok with a hefty price.  Nothing I ate blew me away and definitely not going to be a second home for me haha"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, you can say it's a pleasing experience when you can tell the effort has been put into the decor and set up of the restaurant. Unfortunately I wish the same amount of effort was put into the quality if their food. I had the carne asada tacos that were $3 EACH! and they only came with 1 skimpy tortilla. The meat was very bland. When I asked for limes the waitress pulled them from behind the bar and they had dried out from sitting out too long.  The customer service was very good and they made you feel right at home. If you were looking for a place to hang out with friends with a good atmosphere this would be a good place to go. Granted I did not have anything else on the menu but my experience with the tacos has steered me from coming back."}
{"text":"The happy hour margaritas and taco platters are enough to keep me coming back. The vibe, the food, the drinks, the prices are all amazing. It's rare to find a place so fun, affordable and tasty here in Vegas. You won't be sorry you stopped by"}
{"text":"Went to pinches last night. The carne asada is sooo good. We had eaten somewhere else already, but my husband wanted to try the tacos here. Has a bite of one of his carne asada tacos and wanted more. So we ordered a carne asada burrito. Great combination of ingredients, and the tortillas taste amazing.  Only disappointment was when I ordered potato and cheese taquitos, they poured salsa all over the top, when I asked for guacamole instead. So they were nice enough to remake them (I also tipped them extra for remaking them), but then all I got was potato taquitos with no cheese, no sour cream, OR guacamole. So I had two potato taquitos with a container of salsa. Really annoying that they got it even more wrong the second time. I was really nice about the mistake too, and thought I'd made myself pretty clear in what I wanted."}
{"text":"Showed up for lunch and it was busy but the waiters worked very fast to get us all seated and get our orders in. Decor was really cool and different.  I had the pastor Tacos and a lemonade which I thought both were amazing!! Def coming again."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed is what I would describe my experience at Pinches. I don't know what all the hype is about with the food. I came in expecting a decent portion size and way better tortillas for the tacos. I ordered the combo plate for the tacos, and a corn on the cob.  Nothing great about the retried beans and rice that come with the plate. The beans seriously tasted like they were reheated 3-4 times and had no creaminess to them. To each their own with the beans consistency but you get what I mean.  For my tacos I chose 1 carne, 1 chicken mole, 1 fish. All three of my tortillas for the tacos were almost underdone tasting. I truly understand an authentic flour tortilla press shell, but just something about it was not cooked all the way thru. I have made better carne at home. Nothing seasoned or amazing about it. I expected more of a grill taste to it versus chewy. Chicken mole was nice flavor, but way to much sauce, not enough chicken. And The slaw for the fish taco was just weird. I don't even know how to explain it. The flavor over killed the fish, let alone I couldn't even find the fish. The corn on the cob was a great street corn. I have no complaints. Whatever corn they use is very juicy and they have all the flavors balanced.   And now that I have looked at Yelp reviews of other tacos, my boyfriend and I were not offered any sauces for tacos... this is probably another factor as to why I didn't care for the tacos. I like spicy. So I would have liked to added something, or even have a lime to squeeze on top.   Definitely don't recommend this place if you are looking for \"authentic tacos.\"  I think a lot of people just like the happy hour and Taco Tuesday specials."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mexican corn... soooo delicious!!! You can tell that this is authentic Mexican cuisine. The staff is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"The Mexican corn is the best! Just like ordering one from the elote man as a kid. Vanessa, the bartender (I'm not sure if I spelt her name right) is an absolute doll! Either way, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Simple with quality. Fresh ingridents, micheladas and real tostadita chips !"}
{"text":"Great tacos & great customer service. Love the atmosphere & ambiance. The gringo tacos are my favorite. Very delicious"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Pinches!  Javi is hands-down the coolest manager I've ever had the pleasure of meeting!  Every time we come in there, he knows our names, takes time to talk to us, and always seems to remember previous conversations!  With as busy as Pinches is, its amazing to actually feel like a valued patron.  The street tacos are so awesome and the drinks are even more delicious.  You would be remiss not to stop in to this place for lunch, brunch, or dinner.  Love these guys!"}
{"text":"To start off with the good, the restaurant's interior is invigorating. They actually have a food cart parked inside of the restaurant that you can order from. They also had a $14 bottomless mimosa deal that almost pulled me in. This place would be a fun vibe for a night out.  Now to the not so good. While we were ordering, we asked a preferential question to our server, to which they responded that they had not been working there long so they didn't know (maybe a menu tasting for your servers wouldn't be such a bad idea). They deferred to the table before who had ordered the Chilaquiles, so we went with that. I would have let this slide, had the following not occurred.   For the price I was paying, I expected a healthy amount of food. However, when our food arrived, my jaw nearly hit the floor. What I had set in front of me was a small (like, REALLY small) pile of mush-looking Chilaquiles on a tri-section plastic plate. The other two sections were used for the tiny piles of Guacamole and Cream that came with the meal. To make matters worse, a friend at the table had the same dish, but nearly 50% larger of a portion (still would not have been enough to satisfy a normal adult). Taking it a step further, taste was underwhelming and the plate had probably been left to cool for 5-10 minutes. These incidents were not isolated to the Chilaquiles either.  If I'm going to pay $10+ for a child's size portion of food, at least serve on something that doesn't make me feel like I'm in a prison cafeteria."}
{"text":"The Skinny:  the fresh corn tortillas were good but the fillings were bland (with the exception of the chicken mole) -  and there is no salsa bar or side of salsa that comes with it. What gives? (2)service is friendly but the kitchen is slow(3) value: for the subpar tacos (with no salsa!) 2.5 star review.   I have to say,  the decor is pretty awesome. Tucked in the Gramercy complex, the restaurant sports a pseudo food truck with brightly colored painted walls. That being said,  the ambience doesn't make up for the food. (FYI - no diaper changing station in the bathroom).  The hubby really wanted to try their fare on taco Tuesday. Just FYI -  their $2 tacos only apply to their vegetarian, chicken and pork options which are regularly priced at $2.95 or less.   We tried 5 tacos - the al pastor, adobada, carnitas, chicken mole and the pollo a la parrilla.   Of the five tacos,  the only one that tasted like much was the chicken mole. For a chicken mole, it would only be okay in my books -  lacking any smokey complexity. As for the rest -  the fillings were  terribly bland and I couldn't really tell which taco was which (they all tasted the same... Bland!). There was literally no heat in the food and the tacos were served bereft of any salsa. (yes... The fillings were topped with some crushed tomatoes which is not salsa. FYI- no salsa bar... What self respecting taco joint has no salsa bar?). The meat depending on the taco was occasionally a bit tough. It was a pity because the corn tortillas were freshly made and pretty tasty.   The front of the house service is good friendly and prompt. However for a taco joint, the kitchen was rather slow at bringing out the orders.  Overall, not an experience that I feel a need to repeat. With some great hole in the wall joints serving amazing tacos in town, I give this one a pass."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, the lengua tacos were so good I came back twice for them on the same night and wept - literally wept - at how good they were.  Also, maybe your grandma made better corn tortillas - I won't challenge their honor - but you cannot buy better, period.  I like to stroll through yelp reviews to screen the negatives and why... all I see so far is \"I was so wasted and they did not treat my belligerent offspring that wanted refried beans like a king.\"  I'm going to pine for those lengua tacos for the rest of my life...THAT is how you braise meat."}
{"text":"So my first visit to Container Park was oh-so-magical.  The fire-breathing praying mantis, the adult slide, the cozy feel.  Sit upstairs for a view - they'll bring the food up there. -:)  Their asada taco and margarita are the two things I keep coming back for.  They let their meat marinate in something oh-so-tasty and it's always so tender & flavorful.  It may be a little pricier than average but not only is it Downtown it's also in Container Park, so that doesn't really matter to me.  I get great food, great drinks and a great view."}
{"text":"We came to this location looking for good tacos and better drinks. We left satisfied. Their michelada were very spicy and flavorful and their margaritas tasted fresh with a lot of liquor. We got amazing non stop service from everyone. Very likely to return to this cool spot!!!"}
{"text":"So good! I drove through Las Vegas and on the way back stopped here AGAIN. The staff of Pinches Tacos are skilled. New favorite."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I had the carne asada. tortillas from scratch! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here one night looking for a late night dinner, and was glad to find that they stay open late. At night, the Container Park transforms into an adult playground: 21+ only, and the bars and restaurants stay open. Adults play in the playground -- the tree house, the slide, some games, and the praying mantis comes alive. We came on a Monday, so it was quiet. They don't actually have many tables inside, and it's not really that comfortable sitting inside, but I do like their outdoor seating! It seemed like they were cleaning even though they were still open for another hour, so that was odd...However, they were very accommodating in taking our order and friendly, despite the fact that the person taking our order had to maneuver around someone else mopping.  Food is solid, but not mind-blowingly good. Fun spot to grab a bit, especially at night when the mantis is alive. We got an order of chips and salsa to start and elote (Mexican street corn). I also got a fish and an al pastor taco. OH, and we also got their blood orange margarita. And that's when things started to get fuzzy...The blood orange margarita is super tasty, but also super strong!?  My friend LOVED their salsa and actually went back to ask for more. And came back with a big bowl. I preferred their al pastor taco to the fish. From what I remember, the al pastor was decent, but not really rave-worthy. Something about the fish taco slaw was off...maybe they put too much cabbage or didn't chop up the cabbage finely enough, or was missing crema? The elote was great! I love elote, so I'm not sure how you'd mess it up in my book. I love that they have it here! And it's served on a stick, so you can eat it right off the cob without getting your hands too messy."}
{"text":"The Gringo tacos are the best. All the tacos are full of flavor. Great service. Best time to go is during happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  We had a great time at the opening and have been back a few times since.  We would recommend it to our friends for sure and will be bringing clients here.  We met the owners who are really cool guys - it's a family-owned place and they definitely have the restaurant owner thing down.  Everything we have tried has been good so far."}
{"text":"Bean and 'cheese' burrito. The ' cheese' used in the burrito was not a melting cheese, lumpy and unappealing, at best. No flavour from the poor beans whatsoever. Service was not an issue, the food however is an entirely different story. Bland. The white cheese stuff from bags is just soooo, gmo- ish."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool and \"hip\" but they need to figure out their service.  They have a walk-up window at a food truck (inside) but we were told to sit down and they would serve us.  The service was very slow and we had to find someone to get drink refills, long after they should have been taken care of. They have a Coke Freestyle machine but it was out of order and we were drinking iced tea anyway. We also waited an inordinate amount of time for our check.  (We were there at 2 pm on a Friday; they were not busy). I ordered the combination plate of 3 tacos, which comes with rice & beans. I asked for no beans but they brought them anyway. The tacos are just okay. Not bad, but not so good I feel the need to go back.  I had carnitas, chicken, and adobada. They were all smothered in salsa and I really couldn't tell the difference between them, flavor wise.   I think this location would be good for happy hour or hanging out after work. It's not great for families or for date night, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Was good overall.  Cool atmosphere.  Food was fresh, served quickly, and flavorful.  Service wasn't great, otherwise would rate a 4."}
{"text":"I had no idea that this was the second location for Pinches Tacos in Vegas. Maybe one day go downtown Container Park. Truth everything about this location screams of all the things I enjoy about legit street tacos. Not only talking about the food but the atmosphere plus really nice when you can sit inside not just find plastic bucket sit on or on the curb. The employees are awesome and five stars all around.  Thankful my brother told me about this place for legit street tacos. Otherwise I would have never have found it. The location it off the beaten path (although notice second visit they were putting name on main sign right off russell) cause from Russell Rd no matter direction coming from hidden and since part of office building or Gramercy throws you for loop even more. Once you come around the building find one of the hidden gems in Vegas.   Both visits all about the tacos. 11 different proteins choose from so there literally is a taco for everyone. So far I have tasted the Pollo Mole, Asada, Lengua, Pescado, and Camaron. Each time got the combination plate (selection of three different ones of your choice) comes with refried beans and rice. The refried beans and rice are awesome. The refried beans the thing stands out of not so much over puree. Still whole beans in it rather then all smooth not fan of that style. The rice was solid. Tacos Lengua had always been my favorite. The Lengua is very very good. Both the Pescado and Camaron they both battered the same. I love it. Add squeeze of fresh lime juice. The most refreshing fish tacos every going get in the desert. Pollo Mole sauce little heavy for me. Mole thing unique taste. I would pass if order it again.  The Asada was solid. The tortilla, toppings, salsa, and everything tasted fresh. I could have eating tacos all day and night if I could. Me there that good only thing want too order.   They even had all the tradition mexican sodas orange flavor to coke all in glass bottles. Also have other bottle drinks plus cool coke fountain machines that choose from eight different flavor cokes. The personality in this place is awesome. You place order looks like food truck or taco truck in this case. Talk about decor. I love love love it. It has the whole dawn of the dead. The skull bones from artwork on the walls, the pictures above the food truck, even the hanging strings of lights, the tables wooden rustic tables, and cool sign point all different directions. The bar area is small but they do have widescreen for games. Talk about awesome HH one that need come back. Tuesday have $2 tacos HH. Must one Tuesday for me. The weather warmer outside not really patio area but places that can sit down enjoy the food and weather.   The service is nothing but five stars. I believe one of the owners. It was my first time he explained everything too me clearly, and made me feel welcome first time. He checked see everything was going couple times and leaving thank me for coming in. Everyone came across really friendly, cool vibe, and made whole experience that much better. Second visit the guy remember my face was like back for more tacos. Hell yay man!!! I just love small business owners that feeling care about each customer experience."}
{"text":"Ordered from Postmates to deliver to my office Downtown for a work lunch.  I've eaten at Pinches before and have never been disappointed. Great street style tacos.  I've had the chicken and asada tacos and they are always full of meat and delicious, simply topped with chopped onion and cilantro. Their tomatillo salsa is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada burritos!!!! And the chips and salsa were delish too... You must try this place out, container park is an awesome and much needed addition to Downtown Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The Gringo Tacos are to die for! Cute atmosphere and our bartender Alexis was great! Will be back and recommending."}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos is one of the best casual local spots in town. The vibe is always great, beautiful outdoor seating, and the food? Delicious! Oh, and they really know thier tequila!"}
{"text":"So good!! O love how this place is decorated too!!! Right down the street from my house too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"well I see I heard on tv about pinches tacos I'm from chicago and I came  to try them real mexican food make for real mexican the slogan said...... not true I visit the location in vegas by the fremont street  I order pinche taco de Camaron & pinche michelada $12 the taco was bland yes home made tortilla coleslaw  then I order the michelada w/oscura beer but the tatto lady said you should try w/clear beer taste better ok  im not impressed about pinches tacos don't waste your time & money there"}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for lunch and she was running late...I felt like I was being rushed to order and the waitress kept reminding me things I requested were Extra...ok whatever I didn't ask you all that- it lightweight offended me...then as my friend arrived she felt the same way- she asked about specials and the waitress was like yea after 3...ummm it's basically empty in here and it's 2:45....I thought the guacamole was yummy but guess thts about all I will be returning here for & to go now for sure"}
{"text":"I hear the chicken tacos are bomb...however my carne asada buritto was trash. Enchiladas trash. The buritto has a little bit of meat. Hello people , where's the beef. Mostly guac and beans. The margaritas taste like juice. Taste like premixed margarita. We had several kinds. Very little liquor. And I dont drink.  The waitress was nice.  Only thing that was a semi good was the chicken tacos.  I wouldn't come back. So many places in vegas to get tacos or burritos. This is a waste of time. Food really just ok.  At least last night.  Three stars for waitress really.  Your money your choice. Good luck"}
{"text":"This review is for the Container Park location.  Yes, the name of the place is--tee hee--naughty but the food is very authentic, well made and delicious.  The menu is a country mile long.  We split an adobada taco (good), a camaron (shrimp) taco (great), and the chorizo/cheese dip (fantastic) which comes with a ton of delicious, fresh chips.  I also had a michelada for no other reason than very few restaurants offer it. It was nice and refreshing on a hot night.  I can't recommend the chorizo dip enough. It's rich, creamy and the ultimate comfort food.  Delicious food is served here."}
{"text":"Very nice decor, but thats about it. I ordered a carne asada burrito,  but i got 90% beans, 5 % steak mixed in with spicy guacamole. I asked the cashier if the burrito was spicy at all and she said no. The owner was in that day i went, i wish i would of told him about the burrito, but i wanted to get outta this place. My wife had the chicken torta, and you guessed it, not enough chicken.  I think they pre cook all their meat, and have it sitting for a while  This place is very expensive , you would be better off going to la bonita market, and i hate to say it, but robertos tack shop. They have a marketing strategy that says cooked by mexicans. Im thinking those mexicans they refer to must of grown up rich or had some type of culinary training (and not in the good way) in America, not mexico, because this food doesn't taste authentic to me. Granted, its better than tex mex which is utterly disgusting.   Stay away from this place. Usually i try a place twice before i give up on it, but once was all this place needed."}
{"text":"You've got to have the tacos here. Amaze balls. Great service. Friendly staff. Food is so fresh and good. Just come by for the $2 taco happy hour. You will love the blood orange margaritas."}
{"text":"Best taco happy hour in Vegas, and who doesn't like tacos? Great atmosphere, great food, good prices!!"}
{"text":"This location is hidden, it is in a business plaza. Came here late Saturday night and surprisingly there wasn't many people here. The set up inside is super cute and very spacious. Lots of seating.   I ordered two Carne Asada tacos that come with their green salsa, cilantro, and onions. Their tortillas are made FRESH. Because when I got mine they were smoking hot!!! I also got the Mexican corn also known as the Elote. Corn on the cob slathered with mayo, cheese, butter and chili powder. Elote is my weakness and it was sooo damn good and the corn was sweet. The asada was well marinated and very tender.   Bae got the Al Pastor burrito. It had beans, avocado, onions wrapped up in a warm tortilla. Also came with a side of chips and salsa. Devoured the food. It was really good. Ending it with horchata ice cream and friend churros. The food was great and I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Do not go here! Go look at my reviews, I rarely give a bad rating. I came here with some friends from work based on the recommendations on here. This was a huge mistake. I ordered a basic chicken burrito with cheese. The first burrito they tried to give me had NO CHEESE on it. The second one had NO CHICKEN on it with one sliver of cheese. Now, for a 10 dollar burrito this is unacceptable. I quickly got my money back and didn't even receive an apology from the people making the food.   Save your money! Go elsewhere. This place is nasty and extremely over priced. You can get more for half the price down the street. Stay away from this place and go get a pizza instead!"}
{"text":"Nice break from the overpriced strip.  Great food, service, and margaritas!  Guacamole and salsa is fresh and plentiful.  Best tongue tacos."}
{"text":"First time eating here, lots of food choices. Street tacos are mostly all under $3.00 each. I had the al pastor, pollo mole, and vegetarian (I like veggies!) All were great. My friends had burritos, enchiladas, and a torta sandwich, all were a great size for the cost. They have Dos Equis on draft, as well as margaritas.  Yes the place is small....it's in the \"container park\".  The concept is to have smaller spaces with cheaper rent to promote local business. For sure it's not GAP, Claire's, or Taco Bell. I love the atmosphere, feels like you're not really in Vegas. My only worry are the metal seats outdoors when it's 100+ degrees out. Other than that, I'll definitely be back to hang out here."}
{"text":"So good I'd say we've become regulars Excellent service, simple, yet tasty menu. Great happy hour and fun, colourful atmosphere. We love it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now- always have a great experience.  The employees are great- engaging and fun to be around.  The food is excellent...and there's quite the tequila selection."}
{"text":"I was eating upstairs with my brother and came and sat down with a margarita. When I asked him where he got it, I immediately went downstairs to Pinches. When I walked in, I was not greeted. I continued to the menu and looked to see pricing. I then walked to the register and stood for five minutes while employees ate food by the grill and did not once ask if they could help, if i needed something, or to take my order. So, shortly after I walked out. I was the only customer in the store. Apparently the food is good here, though. One star for bad customer service skills."}
{"text":"Really, really good.  I was in DTLV for a conference and decided to swing by to see what the Container Park was all about.  I ordered a chicken burrito to have a baseline of comparison from other larger, corporate \"freshmex\" places.  Pinches Tacos wins hands down.  Their attentive, passionate staff was making up fresh margaritas, micheladas, corn on the cob, chilaquiles and more.  Stop reading.  Go!"}
{"text":"Family owned, they have 2 location here in Vegas and more in Cali! The tacos are delicious! The staff was full of energy and ready to please! A must try if you are downtown or in the Southwest!!!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by saying that I hate Mexican food,  authentic or not.    Last night we took my in-laws to the container park because I had heard from friends about how cool all the restaurants and bars are.  We were surprised to find out there are only a handful to choose from, so we picked Pinches, and I of course bit the bullet and decided to give it a try.  Mom ordered the enchiladas with beans and rice. The tortilla was on-point and the chicken was moist and flavorful, but the red sauce is too sweet.  Dad ordered a burrito with lengua. It came with guac, cilantro, salsa, onions, beans, and rice inside.  Everyone really liked it. He also ordered a chicken taco, which was also delicious.  Sean ordered a carnitas torta with onions, guac, Mexican creme, cilantro, and beans inside. It was good- the bread was almost like a flat bread.  I ordered the asada \"not nachos\", which had cheese, guac, beans, green salsa (everyone else's orders came with red), home-made chips, and sour cream (I asked for no onions, so there weren't any).  It was f***ing delicious! I'm craving it even now as I write this review at 9 am and I'm not even hung over!!! The steak was honestly the shining star; it was so flavorful and not overly chewy or hard. Also it was kinda refreshing- everything was fresh and went well together like a flavor explosion in your mouth.  My nachos were definitely the table favorite.  I think we'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was in area and decided to give this place another try.  Bought one carne asada taco and corn on the cob to go.  Very happy that they are using the biodegradable food containers as opposed to the styrofoam.  The taco had sufficient meat and the corn was just delicious. Staff was friendly, but food did take a very long time and I saw other people being served that came after me with big orders.  They really should move to a bigger space. The  drink machine right behind the cash register is very cramped."}
{"text":"With \"Mexican food made by Mexicans\" being their tagline I had high expectations for the food. Walking in you'll see a big menu written out on a large chalkboard. The menu is so big with such small writing that its hard to decipher. I ordered a fish burrito which was far from Mexican. The burrito was filled with mediocre fish and coleslaw. Coleslaw?? Had the place been advertised as a fusion food joint, I would have expected an interesting concoction such as this, but wanting Mexican food, I was sorely disappointed with what I ate. Also, the meal came with a side of very few tortilla chips and enough salsa for two chips (no exaggeration)."}
{"text":"Me and my family went all the way down to eat there, expecting good Mexican food ... very good actually because we know before hand each taco it's almost 4 dollars.. We always look  for yelp reviews looking for the best and we go no matter price or distance, (we live on SW).  They are located inside container park, and that's maybe why when u enter there's space just for 2 tables inside, and about 5 tables out and a few more on a second level.   When we enter nobody greet, just silence, we didn't even know if we were supposed to sit or make the order on the cashier first, there's no sign. We order about 14 tacos for 3 adults and 1 kid, 2 cokes , 2 corn on the cob and chips with salsa for about 65 dollars...   Taste was bad, and my son who was hungry didn't even finish them cause the taste..!, neither the little one,  I decide to take the rest of the tacos on a to go container, on the way home the car start to smell so bad because of the meat I had to stop and put them on the trash. Gross..  Overall super overpriced, bad service and bad food."}
{"text":"My wife had the 3 taco combo with 2 asada tacos and a carnitas taco and she said it was good.  I had a al pastor taco and it was excellent hard to get the seasoning right but they nailed it.  The tacos were made with homemade corn tortillas and that's what sent it over the top. Love the elote it was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Container Park to let the kids run around and stumbled upon this place. We ordered the carne asada combination plate which was solid. We shared the plate but would definitively return to see what else this place has to offer."}
{"text":"The best freaking tacos in Vegas! The staff is also so friendly! Nice atmosphere for lunch outside on Container Park."}
{"text":"Wow... super good food. I would say this is the best place to eat on this side of town."}
{"text":"This type of operation is going to kill the current fast food business model. Tacos are a few dollars, whole entrees under $10 and beers for $2.  Not only that but the product is not bad, tried carnitas, camarones & al pastor tacos. Flavors were simple but fresh and Fast, Seriously these guys were packed for super bowl Sunday and my food took about 5 minutes. Environment was clean, service juvenile but effective and design is a bit garish but fun. Would dine here rather than a drive through joint any time.   Considering price point and goals I give it 4."}
{"text":"I tried the shrimp burrito and potato flautas. SO good! Really this place is delicious. And everything tastes like it's made from fresh ingredients. Plus the location is great.  Horchata is just ok. I've had better."}
{"text":"Love the name!!! Taco plate with 3 tacos (Asada, Al Pastor and Molé) and Horchata. Nacho fries and a Fish Taco. All 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. I got the Vegetarian tacos, they were fresh, flavorful and amazingly refreshing. However, I don't recommend walking all the way to Container Park 5 min before they close at 11pm. We had to sit in the park waiting for our takeout, with all the security guards hovering around us waiting for us to leave. Our food was finally ready at quarter after 11, and security quickly ushered us out onto the empty street. Walking back a few blocks to the more populated area of Fremont street was a bit creepy. Where was everyone? Weird. Next question was, where are we going to eat our takeout? We ended up sitting at a bunch of slot machines in the divey Fremont Street Casino while scarfing down our Pinches Tacos. Not the classiest atmosphere, but so worth it. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place and was a little disappointed. Ordered 2 asada tacos and a chicken mole taco. Did not like the mole taco at all. The asada tacos were dry. Nothing special just average tacos. The corn on the cob was delicious! Don't know if I'll be back. There's better places to get some Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This has been on the list for awhile, and so glad we finally made the trip. Only had the tacos (because you have to when it's in the name), but not disappointed. Between the 2 of us, we had asada, carnitas, mole, pescado, and camaron (beef, pork, chicken, fish and shrimp). Each tastier than the next. The menu is a little short on traditional starters, so we had the chips, salsa, and guac, but that was tasty to warm up the tummy for the yummy that was about to follow. Definitely want to come back to try the other options (I'm going for the burrito or flauta next). Wait staff also was super helpful, very friendly, and very attentive."}
{"text":"The inside is reminiscent of a food truck with Spanish flair and skulls. It a cute place but most importantly I ate here last night for the first time. I kept seeing it on instagram and we ordered to go. We got the chicken street tacos and the Asada fries. Everything was good but those asada fries were Amazing! So much so that I am back again today because my husband felt that we needed to eat it again lol. As I sit here waiting on my order I see the bar is pretty fully stocked with any of your favorite liquors you can ask for and the vibe is pretty chill. It sounds like I will be frequently coming here."}
{"text":"They have the best Tacos. Happy hour is $2 tacos and $4 margaritas. In a great area of town. Awesome bartenders and the owners are interactive as well. Always have a great time with friends here"}
{"text":"I went there on Tuesday and the service was terrible. I waited more than 30 min and nothing. The owner even dropped of menus with no follow up he even did this to the table next to me and they also received no service. While waiting we saw several other customers wait and wait and then leave. The service was so bad, that I don't see myself returning. I went to anther Mexican restaurant up the street and wow the service there was awesome. I wonder how this place stays in business because I observed at least $300 dollars walk out in the 30 min I was there. If I was you I would skip this place and go to a better run restaurant where they appreciate clients and actual want to be in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! It's my new favorite hangout!!! Nothing better than bomb Mexican food on a hot or cold day, washed down with a Modelo Especial, Corona or Pacifico. I'm in heaven!! And Christy is the BEST!!! She always puts a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Such a good vibe! Everyone was so nice and the food was great! The nopales taco was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the only Mexican place I like in this part of town.....perhaps because it's one of the only places actually run by Mexicans.  You know if something as simple as a tortilla chip tastes as good as it does here, then you're in for something special.  Everything is good, seriously, just tell em what you're allergic to."}
{"text":"Cheese dip with chorizo was so good!! I went in 20 minutes before they close and the staff was just so nice and friendly! The food is amazing! They also have elote(corn on the cob) which was juicy and so tender, this place is a MUST for sure! The horchata was PERFECT as well because I feel it wasn't too sweet and definitely freshly made!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! Yes! Legit Mexican food in spring valley?!? We ordered the al pastor , shrimp, carne Asada and fish tacos all were perfection. The tortilla soup is the best I've ever had and the blood orange margarita was sublime. I am a local, and am thrilled to have a new spot!"}
{"text":"I didn't really know what to expect when I first came here but I fell in love after the first visit. I've been back 3 or 4 times, in 1 month. The Gringo Tacos are AMAZING! I always ask for hot sauce, which they make in-house. And they're only $2 each during happy hour. Happy hour is ALL DAY Monday. Then, Tuesday- Sunday, 3-7pm. I've tried each of their $4 margaritas and they're all really good. My favorite is the Blood Orange & White peach. I also had their Michelada which is good but I wish they rimmed the glass with Tajín or something. That would make it so much better. I definitely recommend this place. The food 10/10, price 10/10, and environment 10/10!"}
{"text":"I don't know much about this place but a friend of mine recommended it. So I had to try it. It has that California beachy Taco Shop vibe.. you walk in and there is a fake taco truck set up for you to place your order and it has enkei rims and knock-offs. The Cook Area has graffiti on the outside and the paint is mainly pink. I happen to be there on a Tuesday. Which other than the asada or Seafood tacos were $2 each.. I got the pastor, abodaba, cactus and Gringo tacos with a lime jarrito. Service was good and friendly. The food was good too. I didn't get up and do a cartwheel or even break out into a dance of any sort. but it's a cool place with good food. I can see going there on a Saturday afternoon hanging out having tacos and drinks. I think they're above average and definitely deserve 4 stars. Have to say good job Pinches Tacos. If I am back on this side of town it would be a place I would revisit."}
{"text":"It's ok because the food can pass for what it is.  Not great because the taco had no flavor.  I ate the Lengua Taco which is my o'time favorite! Maybe it was an off night for them.  Had the tiny burrito (al pastor) pretty good, but the price for the burrito $$$ and the taco $$$ yikes.  so expensive. Tortilla soup was not good. Tastes more like enchilada sauce. I will go back since their street corn is great and it's closer to home. Don't mind paying the price but make it a bigger burrito! :)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here and it was as good as the first time! It was incredible.  It is by far the best Mexican I have eaten in Las Vegas.    I had a shrimp burrito with spicy shrimp and coleslaw in the burrito.  It was wrapped together in a homemade tortilla that, I swear but could be wrong, was lightly grilled to seal it up.  On my plate was homemade salsa. When I say homemade I am meaning sometime today maybe even fifteen minutes ago homemade.  The salsa was so fresh I though the tomatoes would get up and dance.  I scooped up that succulent salsa with homemade chips.    I had a bite of a chicken mole burrito.  It was so rich and creamy!  The savory taste wafted up from the fresh tortilla.  I don't really like mole but I was loving this.   This is worth every penny and every second you must wait to stare down at the piping hot masterpiece in front of you.  Get in your car now!  Go now!  Take everyone you know with you.   There is no way you can beat this Mexican food.  Thanks Pinches for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"That elote was off the wall! So flavorful and light. At home OC there are gentlemen who push the carts and sell pretty much the same style of elote, the OG way. Its delicious too but its really rich!. At Pinches Tacos, its wonderful and i cant get enough"}
{"text":"I always come here during my lunch at work or on my own time. The food is always delicious and there is never a problem with my orders. What makes this place even greater is the staff here..they are ALL welcoming and quick. The staff acts like a family and they usually joke around with you. It's never a disappointment here!"}
{"text":"5 star rating from ya boy! This place is bomb.com they be killing it. Beans and rice is major, is it weird that I crave just those two sides together? Hahahaha"}
{"text":"First of all, when we were ordering our food there was a lot of unclarity and confusion. My friend ordered the gringo tacos with shredded chicken which she always gets at the other locations, but she said they couldn't do that. Fine. Then I asked her what the vegan options were and she said I could do a vegetable burrito which states that it comes with vegetables. She asked me if I wanted rice and beans but I guess she apparently thought I meant I just wanted rice and beans.... because when I got my burrito after half an hour it was just rice and beans.. I asked her about the vegetables and she looked dumbfounded and didn't explain anything lol. We were also waiting for a long time and saw other tables, who ordered after us getting their food first. We had 4 orders at the table and they all got brought at different times. We understand that they were busy but it shouldn't be an excuse to lag on customer service. The worst part is that the food wasn't even worth the wait. My bean and rice burrito felt like a 5 year old put it together: soggy and shapeless and cold.  My friend did however like her tacos and said they were warm. The salsa was weird though! I am quite confused by how busy this joint was."}
{"text":"Being faux Mexican, I clearly asked three workers if they had tripas tacos and all three said yes.  I tried to speak with my best accent possible to say tripas and what I got was a fried carnitas taco for $4.  It was okay but never had my tacos deep fried before and disappointed it was not tripas.  I came in because they bragged on their sign \"real Mexican food made by real Mexicans\".  Figured real Mexicans would know what tripas were but these must have been Mexicans from North Las Vegas instead."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and the drinks are OK but the food is subpar. It kind of taste a little bit too much like roadkill.  Tortillas were a little dry. Server was nice at least but they were not very welcoming to begin with. I think I'm gonna look at other options."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Love the atmosphere. Love he service. Love the food.   Taco truck food with a sit down restaurant touch.   We were greeted immediately when we walked in and everyone was very pleasant. We were struck by the atmosphere right away. Giant taco truck in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables and chairs. There is a viewing area where you can watch food being prepared. The music was not annoying. It wasn't to loud and was Some Classic Enrique.   The food itself. Amazing. We had the Mexican Street corn (in a cup) and it was better than I had expected. Very excellent.  We had chips with fresh Guacamole and Pico. Also very good.  The lunch was three carne asada tacos and 1 chicken mile taco. Everyone was excellent. I craved more but had to stop myself. Fat boy tendency in full effect.   Very clean dining room. And overall excellent place. Next time we will try the bar!    Def will be back."}
{"text":"Food and service is really good, everyone is super friendly.. Just bummed there isn't a strawberry margarita flavor."}
{"text":"I'm so sad about this place:( My husband and I (both from LA) love good Mexican. We tried Pinches at the container park and loved it. The food was fresh hot and delicious. This location however cute it is was soo disappointing. My husband is an Executive Chef on the strip and we always test new places with an open mind. To be able to deliver a Togo order proper is a testament to devotion to customers. Pinches failed miserably with the food,the server who helped us was to say the least  condescending and put out to help us. It was 11 am and we were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered 1 carne asada burrito,cheese enchiladas and a bean and cheese burrito...( the bean and cheese burrito was not on the menu) . Enchiladas were cold and the sauce tasted like Ragu. The rice was cold and hard...clearly yesterday's. The bean and cheese had barely any cheese and no sauce at all. It was like eating canned beans. The asada was ok...just kinda meh...And the bill with tip( yes we always tip 20%on Togo)$52.....we were charged $8.50 for a bean burrito. If I ordered a side of beans with a tortilla it would cost less than half. We got no silver no napkins and 2 portion cups of salsa(it was good,but come on 2 small portion cups for $52 of Mexican food).So I'm sad to say we won't be returning.....and we live in Summerlin. We were so excited to have authentic Mexican in our neighborhood. Sticking with Viva Mercado....food is great and most important they want us to return so they don't have to charge $8.50 for some beans!"}
{"text":"We recently moved here from San Diego and have been looking for an authentic replacement for home. The food here is pretty good, and the atmosphere is fun, but where flavor is lacking, they add heat. The carne asada is just beef, it doesn't have that traditional carne asada taste. The beans are not cooked with lard, but still tasty enough. They smother the enchiladas with sour cream and cheese.  The service is great, they check on you often and seem to really care.   The search for authenticity continues."}
{"text":"Ok food, but overpriced for what it is.  Terrible bartending staff that forgets orders (because several of them are often too high to see straight), rings stuff up for you you didn't order, and are fond of making comments about tipping - crap service all around. The happy hour prices should be the normal pricing if it we're priced right (for the tacos that apply, only some do - those that don't are grossly overpriced).  Overall, skip this place."}
{"text":"Great service!! Bomb drinks!! Bomb Tacos!! Nopales and pescado ones where on point! Tortillas Bomb! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Its ok but not the best the only thing I can recommend is the potato taquitos. I was not impressed with their tacos or soggy corn on the cobb........... BUMMER"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 Stars for food and 5 stars for service ! We have had Vernesa for the 2nd time. She is very attentive and friendly !! Gringo tacos are amazing ! Shredded beef with a chipotle mayo , lettuce and tomatoes ! Delicious ! Carne asada nachos are also good ! Chicken is a bit bland and so is the salsa that comes with the chips and salsa/Guac. Overall cute restaurant and good atmosphere !!! 2$ tacos on happy hour !!  Will be coming once a week !"}
{"text":"Nice lil joint located in container park, when you need that mexican food fix it's nice to swing on by. I usually opt for the carne asada fries or Nachos which are loaded with everything but the kitchen sink. The prices are a lil steep but .. well in the area it doesn't break the bank. Service can range from fast paced to slow as a snail. Also when it's crowded also determines the time factor. Upon my last visit it was past 8PM so the waiting time was pretty short."}
{"text":"Woo Hoo I'm first to review. Located in the front of container park, it's has no sign so go to the left corner and there they are. Street tacos with plenty of flavor. I got the 3 taco combo and my kids got quesadillas. Everything was delicious and filling."}
{"text":"This establishment stands up to its name: Pinches tacos. In Mexico,\"pinche\" is an all purpose insult enhancer. The staff here were total \"pinches\" my 3 year old autistic son got the look when he spilled his Jamaica. And when I asked the waitress for a refill--she told me to go inside and pay. Listen, I've spilled drinks at fast food places and they've offered to refill. Accidents happen right!? Their sign mentioned \"owned by real Mexicans\" but when my real Mexican mother asked a woman a question in Spanish( yes this is America I get it) she acted like she didn't understand and responded in broken English. Aside from below average customer experience the food was cold and not acceptable for consumption. Since when are quesadillas served cold? All the plates were cold and the presentation could have been better assembled by the 1 year old in our party. The container park is catered to families and this establishment better think twice of they want to increase revenue. Turning the stick eye on helpless children is less than favorable for their reputation. If you have kids or like good Mexican food this pinche restaurant is not for you! Save your time and money."}
{"text":"This place is more than I expected it to be. Service was great, and the place has a great selection. If you are a first timer I would suggest trying the Pinche Combo Plate which has 3 tacos of your choice, rice, beans with tortilla chips.  If you want to play it safe like I did, chose the Pollo, Al Pastor, and Asada tacos. They were excellent, and their habanero hot sauce was very spicy, but the heat does not linger.    Ambiance is very settle and relaxing. Prices are fair for the amount you get, and I would say that you wont regret spending your time and money at this place.  If you haven't been there, I would suggest trying it out."}
{"text":"Placed my order at 8:00pm on 4/16/2016. After 15 minutes, the waitress said my order was next. Then 23 minutes later another waitress made excuses saying the bar was slammed and that my order was next. It took 27 minutes to get my taco plate out. Yes the bar was slammed but it's Saturday night! You would think they would have extra people working. The food was good but it's just unacceptable to wait 27 minutes for a 3 street tacos."}
{"text":"Well I was so looking forward to going here. The carnitas were plain and lacking salt and there was none on the table. The salsa for the chips was nothing more than chopped tomatoes, onions, jalapenos I think and a lil bit of cilantro. It had no flavor and too many onions and served on a almost flat plate so it was difficult to scoop it up. I forgot to order my tacos without onions and it had so many that I could not even pick them off, they were mixed in. The queso dip was the best part of my visit and the margaritas were pretty good too. The elote did not have enough topping on it and NO LIME!!   I would go again but just for margaritas and appetizers. Not the salsa though."}
{"text":"My family really likes this place. We've been twice and everything we've gotten has been tasty and fresh. The real deal."}
{"text":"I love Pinches Tacos. It's a little pricier than most taco places out here and it's out of my way. But if I'm ever downtown (which is pretty often these days) this is always my go to place. I can't come here without getting an elotes. It's my favorite. The lengua and el pastor are always my choice of tacos. Both flavorful and tender."}
{"text":"This place is great! Me and my co workers come in quite often after each work weak and Normally being that I'm from California I'm used to eating real authentic Mexican food and in Vegas it's so hard to find good Mexican food but this place is as good as it gets! My favorite are the taquitos and the corn on the cob (elote style) is amazing. And the music is great also, kept  me dancing and in a good mood the whole time, I love the upbeat atmosphere and the modern art on the walls just give sit a good feel as well, definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Located inside container park, it''s a divey little Mexican taqueria.  Decent price considering location.  I got the al pastor burrito.  Came with a side of chips and salsa.  Chips were ok and salsa was decent.  Burrito was good. It tasted fresh.  The meat lacked a little flavor.  I asked for some hot salsa and it was a nice habanero based salsa with good flavor.  All in all, a a decent place to eat if you're at container park"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, about a year ago I had a great time, the bartenders were friendly. The food was good also, since I transitioned to a vegan diet. There isn't any vegan options. I asked a lady bartender about 3 questions until I realized that she clearly didn't want to be bothered. My sister noticed the feed back I was getting from her also. I was cringing inside and felt completely uncomfortable. So after one drink we had to leave. Hospitality is everything to me and they clearly don't understand that concept."}
{"text":"Love the location downtown at the Container Park, which is close to where I work (I can walk there).  When I heard they were opening down the street from where I live at the Gramercy, I was so excited!  We dined there today and it was as delicious as their downtown location.    Hubs and I each had a few of their chicken tacos and their al pastor tacos.  We also split a Mexican Corn on the Cob.    Service was friendly and our food came out quick.  They weren't very busy, they had maybe 2 other table, but their grand opening is tomorrow.  I hope they get enough business for them to stay there.  They are very popular at their downtown location."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Reasonably priced.  All home made Mexican food!! Will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and tried a few different things. You can never go wrong with tacos. They have a combo platter served with your choice of three tacos with rice and beans and a few tortilla chips for $9.50. Dish is slightly more for asada. You can chose from several meats like AL pastor, pollo, fish, asada, and even veggie. Meat portions inside the tacos are very filling. Surprising from these little corn tortillas.  My favorite flavor from my meat choices was the pollo mole. Had a nice sweet spicy taste that I really enjoyed.   I have also tried the flautas and burritos which were also filling and had good flavor."}
{"text":"Melt in you mouth Carne Asada tacos with hand made flour tortillas! Worth a stop, plus the container park is cool with a playground for the kids."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. And great margaritas! Discovered this awesome spot downtown & it's become one of my favorite Mexican food spots . The staff were nice there as well with quick service for such a crowed space."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Their corn was so good and juicy one of the best I've tried from a restaurant. I had the shrimp tacos and they were bomb!!! Great little spot in container park, def one of my top choices when going downtown"}
{"text":"Really awesome staff. A little overpriced outside of happy hour, but everything else is great about this place."}
{"text":"Authentic and great service.  Special treat was mineral water with lime juice and salt. Best pick me up after a long day!"}
{"text":"Their pinches tacos disappointed. I ate the pinches combo plate with 3 tacos, al pastor, pollo, and carnitas. Very ordinary, meats lack flavor, and salsas were bland. There are much better Mexican taco joints out there in the world. I would not go out of my way to eat here. On the upisde, their beans and tortilla chips were good."}
{"text":"The drinks are nothing special. But what really is disappointing is the food. I tried the pinches tostada and it was just gross. The carne Assad was good but all else not. Tried their lengua and pork tacos. The lengua was passable but the carnitas taco flavorless. Cactus was served cold and not well. Just a total miss in my opinion. I've had great cheap Mexican food. This isn't close."}
{"text":"This taco place needs to be open later! When I want a taco fix, they're not open late unfortunately. Therefore, I had to give them 5 stars. The bartender & server were very friendly. We ordered the elote, quesadilla, carne Asada, lengua, & adobada. The meat was cooked well. Not to mention some of the best micheladas I've ever tried. Pinches has daily specials, taco Tuesday's & happy hours. To top it off, the interior is awesome, music is Fun, outdoor seating is nice, & just an overall clean restaurant. I hope to return with the same great first experience we had."}
{"text":"Wow,  que terible  Real awful food, by real Mexicans Carne asada taco - strange flavor to the meat.  Was wondering if I was going to get sick. Also Ordered a carnitas, and an al pastor taco.  The meat was  bland, could not tell them apart.  One had a spicy red salsa on top that looked like a disinterested tomato.  All the juice had landed on the plate.  This made all the tacos soggy. Had a horchata which was fine.  Hard to screw that up.  Maybe It Came From A Package"}
{"text":"Beyond phenomenal. Fantastic staff, food was excellent and drinks were top notch. I can not rave enough about this place. Even the owner was down to earth and legitimately friendly. We drive an hour and a half just to come here. When we go to Fremont Street for fun, we go to the one in container park every time. Try it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best taco place in Las Vegas. Happy hour is where it's at, drafts are usually $4 and the pollo tacos are $2. Well lit, uniquely decorated, with a polite and fun staff. Homemade everything. Stop reading, just come."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place.  I love a good taco place, but this food was just bad.  Having grown up in East LA, the fun name and decor excited me.  Right off the bat, the \"waitresses\" began complaining about other employees loudly directly behind me.  They were all wearing random really casual clothes that just made the place look even more out of place for the nice location. Flat soda (he said he had to get it from the bar), stale chips (Really?  How do you mess up chips?) and a burrito that was just mush.  It was supposed to be steak, but I could only find tiny bits of meat!  To top it off, the avocado inside was way off!  I know what over ripe avocado tastes like.  This place seems like it is on the verge of going under.  Trust me, I'm a Mexican-American who has eaten some of the best Mexican fare in this amazing town- AVOID THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"My GF and i decided to give this place a shot and they did not disappoint! I got # tacos( Asada Alpastor and Adobada) all 3 were delicious! i also got some guacamole on the side it tasted very fresh! and no meal is complete with out a drink, i recommend their Horchata it is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Service is really bad, the server didn't know the menu. I ask a few questions about the corn, tacos and scramble eggs sides and he didn't know the answers. we had 1 michelada, chilaquiles and tacos and scramble eggs and 2 corns.  No salt shakers, no Tabasco sauce, no limes.   Not going back, the bill was $50 too expensive for a bad experience."}
{"text":"The tacos were great. Unfortunately my order came out wrong. It was during the lunch rush so I didn't want to bother them to fix it. Still, the food was enjoyable and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Friday night and our experience wasn't quite good.  The restaurant smelled like cleaning supplies. It's expected to clean the restaurant when it is slow, but the smell was strong enough to the point where it was bothersome while eating. Maybe don't go all out of the cleaning chemicals when there are two more hours of business left.  A friend and I ordered the carne asada fries while another friend ordered the 3 taco combination plate. Our carne asada fries came out pretty quick and looked appetizing, but didn't meet our expectations. For the price of $11 or $12, the portions are smaller than most of the Mexican restaurants that serve carne asada/ any other meat with fries. With there being a smaller portion size, we were hoping that the meat would be better than the casual Mexican food restaurant. At best, the meat may have been very slightly better.  My friend that got the 3 taco combination plate was displeased. He complained about how the beans were watery and that the tacos were just alright. The amount of money he spent on his meal he said could have gotten him a lot more at other places that had better quality as well.  Although I wasn't a fan of their food, I did like their counter which is a full scale taco truck and their decorations."}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos is a fun place to go for decent tacos and darn good margaritas.  They have happy hour Monday - Friday 4-7 pm, and all day on Sunday.  These are good times to go for $2 tacos (my favorite is the Asada) and $4 margaritas (my favorite is the blood orange).  While there are other things on the menu; I usually keep it simple when I visit: tacos and margaritas.  The vibe is eclectic as there is a food truck inside the restaurant, but the overall feeling is chill.  It's a great place to wonder into after a day at work or before a night of fun."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great ambiance, awesome staff, and amazing tacos this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Yumm! The shrimp burrito is the bomb. Very flavorful and fresh.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Almost forgot the corn, don't miss it!"}
{"text":"It's located in a nice area and the design is very unique. I came during the day, but it seemed a bit empty. I would have to say this place is a bit too pricey for a small taco plate. Overall the taste in their food was good, but not amazing compared to some other places in my opinion. It's a cute decent place!"}
{"text":"Happy to see another CA chain come over to NV! Atmosphere is fantastic, waiters are the nicest! Food was a little on the bland side but i do t mind coming back because of the folks that work it!"}
{"text":"I ate here on Cinco de Mayo. I got myself the Asada quesadilla, for 12$. Now, I'm from Texas and know authentic Mexican food. I have never had a quesadilla with only meat and cheese. No pico de gallo, no grilled onions, nothin but meat and cheese. Tasted good considering, but for the price, very disappointed. Vegas, lol."}
{"text":"The Mexican Corn was to die for. The service and ambience was priceless. Thank you , thank you."}
{"text":"It's an ok place ! I wouldn't eat here again .once in a life time kind of place . The portions for the pinche combo was small little rice little beans . And when the woman delivered the she took the plasticware from her apron . Hope she wash her hands after she used the restroom .And her apron looks like it hasn't been washed since they open the restaurant . Definitely not a place to eat if you have weak immune system . Definitely  You'll have a stomach hurt . So for a 8.95 combo plate not a good deal thumbs down ."}
{"text":"Food is good. It's not the best tacos in town but it's good. Like how they got a big table. Usually go here with a big group. The service is really good very attentive fast on the order and the best thing is they give you individual checks. I don't know why that is such a big deal at most restaurants. Here they just did it without us even asking which is really great. Good food and awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, but this is another one of those places where I don't agree with the majority.   Located in the new Grammercy plaza on Russell and the 215, it is not visible from the street. You have to drive to the back of the building. Once inside, the decor is cute and has a Day of the Dead theme meets LA street art. There is a food truck looking counter to order to go, but if you want to eat in, you can just seat yourself.   SERVICE: Our waitress (didn't get her name) wasn't super friendly, but she was the only one waiting on ALL of the tables. She looked overwhelmed and I felt her pain as a former food server. I saw that other tables were still waiting for their drinks while we had already received ours. And the two women that came in and ordered to go were waiting over 15 minutes. My BF finally got our server to smile a bit when he paid for the tab and mentioned how busy she was.   FOOD:  I don't want to be mean or anything, but I didn't really care for the food. The rice was sooooo bland. Our tacos had liquid dripping from them, which made the tortilla soggy, which in turn made the taco fall apart. There was hardly any meat in the tacos. You could taste more onion and cilantro than anything else. The horchata and Mexican corn were the highlight of the meal.   I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews. Even if I was in the area, this wouldn't be on my places to eat list. I guess I still have to drive to the north side of town to get decent tacos."}
{"text":"The service was great and the atmosphere was wonderful as well. Unfortunately, I didn't really like the taste of anything at all. I tried mole chicken, adobada, al pastor, elote and a traditional margarita. Not a fan of anything."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place, we go to the one in Container Park monthly and this location at the Gramercy every few months.  The food is fantastic!, the drinks are strong and the servers are really cool. We had not been to Pinches in about 4 months, Sal the waiter sat us and remembered what we drank from last time we came in. The food is delicious and comes quickly. They have elotes, Mexican corn. The ongoing specials really hit the spot, Gringo Tacos and El Darkness burrito is a prefect combination of spicy and flavor, making you reach for your Mexican Coke!. If you like mexican food that is affordable, you owe it to yourself to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The fish tacos combo plate and Margaritas are too die for.  Check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Pinches Tacos! This is our first time at this location and it does NOT disappoint! The decor, servers (family), and the food are on point! We look forward to enjoying our \"Taco Tuesdays\" at Pinches in the Gramercy, this summer!"}
{"text":"Probably a little on the low end on the scoring here but it's the first taco spot I had after going to Cabo and I didn't find it that great since I was craving that authentic Mexican. I had the pinches combo with a carne Asada, al pastor, and a carnitas taco. Carne Asada was hands down the best, carnitas were a little dry and al pastor was lacking flavor. It came with beans, chips and rice and the chips were the best part of this meal and one of the best chips I've had in a while. Followed it up with elotes and while I'm not a huge fan of corn, I would give it a thumbs up for corn lovers to chow down on coz it's pretty decked out with some lemon juice, mayo and chilli powder! I washed it all down with a horchata and that was really good too so overall decent spot and price is ok for being at the container park."}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly pleased with the wait or the food.  I felt it was bland and lacked quantity. We waited at least 30 mins in the line before being able to order food and the another 10 for our food. We may try it again if the wait isn't so long.  Bummer that they use chicken stock in rice."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a quick trip and wanted tacos for lunch. Chose this place based on reviews. The chorizo dip was amazing! Get a large. You can put any extra on your tacos. I tried the 3 taco plate and got  al pastor, carne asada and carnitas. They were delish. The reason for the 4 star is the food was brought out cold, not even warm. I'm sure it would have been even better if it was hot. The location in the container park has a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Good food. Customer Service is a hit or miss. The ladies are not so friendly. I told her that it is our frist time to eat there and we are a bit excited... she just stared at me like I'm a weirdo. Hmm, maybe I am. Who knows. I went to the other lady and asked where I can get a fork, knife and napkin... she pointed \"over there\". I didnt see where she was pointing at because we were across the room so I asked her if she was pointing to the drink station area. She said \"nevermind\" walked away... I followed her towards the drink station, she stopped and turns around and handed me our utensils. Wish it was a friendlier place, the food was good but definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here but once the server came it all went down hill he was so rude and insanitary even holding the cup by the top where you drink, when we asked him to bring us a new cup he scoffed and and a new server came out. The service was bad. The food was bad. And a taco is 4$. Not worth it  I kept thinking he was going to spit in our drinks."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly!! They remembered me! Which makes me feel welcomed and appreciated! drinks a really good, also the tacos are very good! I had the chicken, steak (fav)"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos here are amazing! A little small for the price, but I guess it's quality over quantity! The inside is very nicely decorated and clean with a feel good vibe. I've always got the tacos to go, but we stopped by here months ago to try the Mexican corn & Spanish rice & that was alright. I come back for the tacos. Only thing I didn't like is that they charge like $3 for a bottle of Jarittos when I can get those at the grocery store for 85 cents!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a shame to have such a culture rich city and yet there are not that great of Hispanic places that really hit the spot. My bf and I came in here to get Elote. And it was less than appetizing. The corn came out as this dingy yellow color. Slathered with all the fixings. It'll fool your eyes to make it think it's Elote. But the flavor is less than what you expect. Just a crunch of old corn and cheese with dripping mayo. No spice for our hungry mouths. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"Cool spot! Its a taco truck inside a restaurant. The woman behind the counter was cool as hell and helped us decide what to order. Food was good but the atmosphere makes this place. I just wish it had more people in it. The only downfall was a woman outside smoking. Her fumes filled the restaurant so much even the employees were mentioning it."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the decor and music being played at this restaurant. Was greeted by all the staff with a smile and was instantly made to feel right at home. Our bartender was fabulous and made the best Micheladas I've had in a long time. The food looked amazing as well. Great selection of tacos, Street corn and of course churros.   Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and drinks. Salud"}
{"text":"Super delicious tacos here I had the chicken tacos I highly recommend them they were spicy but not overly spicy we had a large group of people and it was very nice the owner came out and gave us complementary queso for the table the queso was amazing amazing amazing I highly recommend it!!!! Plus The name is to funny if you know what it means.... M"}
{"text":"BOMB! I won't waste anybody's time with a lengthy review but just know that if you're in the mood for REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican, this is the place to go! I recommend adding Mexican cheese and diablo sauce to any order. Friendly staff, affordable prices, and amazing quality."}
{"text":"My experience with the staff was phenomenal, everyone there is very friendly and attitude free. The food is great. Only go in there for their tacos. Home made tortillas... That definitely drew me in to visit. For dine in guests... They have table cards (Lotteria) instead of \"numbers\" its so authentic, I love it."}
{"text":"There's nothing like the Gringo taco and the street corn. Everything I've tried on the menu is amazing. The Gringo taco will having you coming back for seconds and thirds. I never thought I would find street corn at russell and 215. LA has found its way to vegas and it was worth the trip. I will be back again and again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for tacos. Tacos are bomb and fairly priced. You get a good 5 inch street taco which is bigger than most street sized tacos. This place can get really busy so I recommend coming before 9pm."}
{"text":"The service was great and the guacamole was so fresh. The highlight for me was the pollo taco and the beans. Get the beans. They were delish. A small restaurant with fresh food."}
{"text":"It's loud and the service is terrible. Our waitress walked by my mom and I 10-12 times, she never once asked us how we were doing our if we wanted refills. Tried flagging her down to see if the rest of our food was coming (we each ordered a corn on the cob) she rolled her eyes and kept walking. Never got the rest of our dinner or the check??? We sat around for 30 minutes waiting for it. Tried flagging different waiters down, but none could be bothered. It was too loud in the place to think or wait around much longer, so I went up to the waitress stand and asked to pay. The asada tacos were great, my mom enjoyed her shrimp tacos, however the beans were bland and unappealing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the authentic taste this place is great for tacos. I love their carne asad tacos. They are pricey for Mexican food but if you are downtown for lunch this is one of the better options when it comes to Mexican food downtown. The staff is really nice but the place itself is really small so you will most likely have to sit outside. If it's cold it kind of sucks and if it's hot it really sucks too."}
{"text":"This pinches tacos location is the best location! Convenient right off the 215! Great parking ! The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant is welcoming! Vince always takes care of me he is a great server. Carne asada tacos are the way to go, but carne asada with anything else will also treat you right. Drink wise, you can't go wrong with a XX or even a blood orange margarita. BEST TACOS IN TOWN !"}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty great, super cool and chill atmosphere and great service. Very good kinda white washed Mexican restaurant with authentic Mexican tacos. The meat is delicious, I got the Asada taco plate. The meat was fire and the tortillas are freshly handmade and they were amazing. Needed some lemon, they didn't have a salsa bar or anything so you have to ask. But it's pretty cool place.   Service was exceptional but not gonna lie this place is pretty pricey. $2.50 for tacos I believe they have $2 taco specials during happy hour but it's not for all tacos, only a couple meats like chicken and such. Asada isn't included in the special nor lengua... It was $4.25 for a lengua taco. 1 TACO!! Lol THATS FREAKING CRAZY!!!   I got the Asada plate and it was like 10$ or so not bad and my boo got an Asada torta and a lengua taco. He thought the torta was a lil mushy, just not what he's used to I guess.   We spent like $45 for us 2 for dinner here. Not what we were expecting on getting tacos but it's cool. We're not cheap .. but we are from LA and there's great taco places every where and all of them are like $1 .. lol so when I think of tacos that's what I think of paying. But it's  hard to find good taco places in Vegas that's why you find spots like these that are hella overpriced. They should at least have like taco Tuesday and during their happy hour make all tacos available for the $2 special. Bring in more business instead of pushing it away with the ridiculous prices. It's tacos   This place is good, but if you want some good tacos for a lot better price go to Tacos El Gordo. It may be a little more hood and not white washed and fancy and boujee but they have good tacos and for a good price. So does La Bonita Supermarkets."}
{"text":"I went there one day with some friends and it was great. I tried 3 of their street tacos and loved everyone. I loved the environment. The server was busy but she still came and checked on us. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I got the carne asada tacos, some elotes corn, and chips and salsa. The steak was super tender and delicious, very good tacos. The corn was phenomenal. Really good Mexican food. As they have painted on their container, \"Real Mexican food made by real Mexicans\". Try the corn. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like the food.. disappointed. The bartender/waitress was really nice and personable. My husband and I both thought everything needed salt except the salsa. Which was really good, btw. We got the carnitas burrito and the pork looked juicy as hell. It was not marinated long enough so had zero flavor  the al pastor tacos were ok..  nothing to come back for. I'm giving 3 stars for the atmosphere and pico de gallo."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito and may I highly recommend chilaquiles!! The atmosphere is fun with a little bit of quirk at the bar. Check this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I live down the street and wanted to try some food out of my norm, and I was not disappointed! The tacos are great, the staff is very friendly and full of great suggestions and the location is so damn cute!"}
{"text":"I must say this place is not what I expected! The atmosphere was awesome! It's a place where you go to hang out with friends and have some great tacos and drinks,beer,shots,and a great time! So if your ever looking for a fun restaurant go there."}
{"text":"I LOVE PINCHES TACOS!!!! No Really....LOVE!  First off, in the Container Park in Old Down Town. Such a super cool place to go. We love bringing visitors to the park. Take them for the obligatory walk down Freemont St, then stroll over to Pinches for your reward! Delicious, amazing tacos!  I always get the taco plate. 3 tacos of your choice, rice and beans. And although I am definitely a gringo, but one my favorite is the lengua tacos (if you don't know, maybe you should not ask.) But the fish tacos are amazing, as are the rest. I have never been disappointed here!  Last time I was there, had a bite of the Torta (a mexican sandwich) - It was awesome too!   If you are a local or even visitor and in the Old Downtown/Freemont area. Do yourself a favor and go check out Pinches in the Container Park. You will not be disappointed! YUM!"}
{"text":"\"I can't complain about this place\". The food is good and the prices aren't bad either\". I always get the chicken taco plate with beans & Spanish rice, \"I Never go wrong with that one!\" I recommend this place next time you visit the Container Park!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the menu is corny as hell. It's like Carlos Mencia was the brainchild behind it.  Pinches Tacos was my second food choice at the Container Park after Cheffini's POS system crapped out. Pinches Tacos is located right next door to the aforementioned hot dog place, and they offer an array of basic mexican foods like tacos, burritos, and other standard Mexican food menu items. I went with the Adobada Tacos and an order of Flautas to share wth the table. The Adobada was pretty good, great seasoning with a light crunch, plus the addition of pineapple added that sweet factor that's common with marinated pork. The Flautas were ok, but I mostly tasted the fried tortillas and the guac that covered them. The table liked them, but I would have preferred more filling.   The wait to order food and the wait to get it was brutal, it was at least a ten-minute wait to order and another ten plus to get it delivered, not sure if that's the norm, but it wasn't the best.   As for the menu using the words \"Fakeixcan,\" \"Pinche Gringo Menu,\" and the \"Estiffy\" taco is super corny, but I'm sure the soccer moms who rage here love it."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place, what a major disappointment. The cashier was so rude, so right there not off to a great start.  My food was so nasty!  How on earth do you screw up cheese enchiladas? My husband said that his tacos were very good though, so maybe that is the way to go....and the cashier did offer an apology later for being so rude with using \" sorry, we were swamped\" as an excuse.  A big PASS on this one."}
{"text":"I cannot with this place!! We ate here literally when they opened at 10am and at 5pm when we were supposed to have dinner we were still full!! Threw off my whole heffer schedule.  But seriously it was so delicious! We were promptly greeted and they helped us with the menu.  If you look on the board it can look super overwhelming but they were patient and super friendly especially to my mom who is always hesitant to try different things.  I got the Al Pastor and Elote, mom got the Huevos Ranche tacos.  The quality for everything was great and it is made to order so be patient.  Just a wonderful experience and it was so close to our hotel (10mins walking from Fremont).  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more than 3 stars sooooooooooooooooooo bad! Its a part of the new downtown. They have a cool name. And when I asked for some \"real hot sauce\" they responded with \"We're Mexicans, of course we have something spicy enough for you!\" It all sounds great right? Big menu, little bit of everything from authentic to Gringo. But overall, I was majorly let down when it came to the food.  Pricing, decent. Service, stellar. Food, bland, average and needs work. I dined here with my boyfriend, and his kids who are 16 and 17. We got a variety of things from chicken tacos, al pastor tacos, carne asada torta, cheese enchiladas, and some chips and salsa.  First off, chips and salsa were good and so was the side of super hot sauce. The taste lingered for hours, and I would buy it alone if I could. (wait can I?)  Anyway, the chicken tacos were eh. The al pastor tacos can't compare to any of the tacos on the Q's taco challenge ventures. The carne meat was good, but the torta was a bit spongy. My enchiladas looked like they were about to take the cake, but again, eh. BLAND with no flavor. Stuffed full of cheese, with the potential to be bomb, and just ended up being a disappointment.  I felt bad because everyone there was so kind and on their game. But I literally wanted to hit a drive thru on the way home.  Maybe I eat too much Mexican food straight from LA, or maybe I am picky. Probably a bit of both, but either way- takes more than average tacos to impress me."}
{"text":"Great little gem just at the east end of The Fremont District area. Delicious fresh salsas and my favorite, al pastor tacos! Staff is super friendly and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Wow! after moving from Texas I was stressed to find some good Mexican food and then I found Pinches!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Pinches Tacos but their Las Vegas location was in Downtown. As a local, I try to avoid going to the strip or the old strip for that matter because of traffic. So imagine my excitement when I learned that they opened a new location in Spring Valley!   My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night (Wednesday). We were immediately greeted by who we later on learned as \"Javier\", one of the Anaya brothers - creator of the awesome Gringos Tacos. He gave us a couple of suggestions from their menu so we decided to get the combo to be able to try almost most of it: Gringos, AlPastor, Asada, Shrimp and Fish Tacos. Everything tasted wonderful! It was so delicious we told everyone we know that they must try this place.   However their grand opening might not be until mid-November (or so we're told), so if you do decide to swing by, just remember to BYOB. Overall, this place has impressive food and it's always a plus when you are treated like family. This will definitely keep us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place has the most awesome food !!! They have taco Tuesdays they have the best margaritas the atmosphere is awesome the service  is excellent!!!! Watch out because when you go there your going to be addicted LOL"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone else is raving about. Elote was good, but the tacos were less than decent. They were bland and not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I turned to this little street to go to the restaurant off of Russell, you immediately think you just entered into an apartment complex with several buildings on both sides. Ahhh, there it was after making 2 trips trying to find this place.  We were all seated and while waiting for the food to come, we had a plate full of chips, spicy pico de gallo, and fresh guacamole to go with our blood  orange margaritas. A must try!  Taco Tuesday, tacos@$2/piece. We ordered the gringo, mole, Al Pastor, grilled chicken tacos, asada. It was delicious!!! Each taco   had distinctive flavors. I love them all but ... If mole is not one of your favorite Mexican dish, then this may not be your best choice of taco either. The mole sauce was a bit on the thicker side and had deeper, richer texture. I  might skip the mole tacos next time. The menu is pretty extensive. We went  for taco Tuesday so we had tacos only. I can't really say which one is my favorite since we did not order all the tacos on the menu. If I had to pick among what we had that night, my favorite was the Al pastor tacos ( marinated, slow cooked pork with such amazing  flavor and  the gringo tacos (hard shell , marinated chix light filling with fresh tomatoes and sauce.) It seems like the happy hour is popular.  Overall: loving the tacos, reasonably priced, extensive menu selections, ambience( casual), happy hour! Can't wait to bring friends and enjoy the FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I came with the expectations to find real Mexican tacos just like the business mission statement says, but left we no desire to come back. The tacos al pastor did not even have the classic piña, instead it had tons of red salsa. Tacos did not come with the traditional lime. No salsas on the tables.  Beans were flavorless. The only thing that was yummy was the red rice!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and it was great! The carne meat is out of this world. It's thick and not the typical carne you get at most places. So tender and juicy. The chicken taco was really good too. We ordered sopes and they are much larger then we expected. Probably the best sopes I have had. We will definite be back!"}
{"text":"Oof. Much like Natalie Imbruglia in '97, I'm torn. This taqueria is a solid 3.5 for me, but considering it was a beautiful day outside and there was a live bass player doing his thing, I'll round up.    Why a 3.5? Price. Size. Taste (1/2 star off).   Picked up the three taco combo ($9 w/ sides of rice, beans and chips), but it's nowhere close to enough food if you eat like a normal human. I'm not asking for Hash House style meals here, but these 'cos are tiny. Mentioning this so you get an extra side or some of that corn, bc you WILL be heading back on line for a few more tacos if you're hungry and only get the special. I suggest going down burrito road if you're looking to fill up. Any who, so yea, I spent $31 on five tacos, 2 beers and an order of chips and guac. Bleh.   Of the 5 tacos eaten, my favorites were the adobada and al pastor. Each were paired with the perfect amount of toppings and the meat was moist and flavorful. A fun 4 bites for each of those tacos. Least fave? The asada. A bit boring for me here.   Looking for the best tacos in Vegas? They're not here. Looking for a good taco downtown? It's here and you might enjoy some live music while you dine.  Side note: a friend mentioned that the pollo mole was the best mole he's ever had.  Sider note: he's from Philly, so he probably hasn't had much mole sauce Sidest note: whomever calls the container park a 'hipster' area is a dolt... it's a total yuppie zone."}
{"text":"I love going during happy hour! The Gringo taco is my favorite. I also love the blood orange margarita. Their margaritas are strong! Their horchata is pretty amazing, too."}
{"text":"These guys are great for happy hour, quick bite with the family, or drinks with friends. Very cute and clean restaurant. The food quality is good but not great - it's more like quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"I would have left a higher star if management had handled the situation different. We had a large group and more people showed up than what we said. More didn't have a seat but we weren't upset by that we understood.  What offened us was that they were angry and told us not to come back because 3 people never got their food due to their systems being down and we all paid sperately. I could understand if we had a waitress but at this resturant customer orders like taco bell... You walk up to a counter pay then walk away. No menus on the table.  The tacos was ok. Lengua could use some seasoning and the tortillas do fall apart.  The atmosphere was nice and management was nice in the beginning. But when it all ended they told 25 people not to come back because they didn't like that we paid separately. I understand their systems were down and that's why 3 people never got their food but instead of being mad at 25 paying customers who would have come back change they should have changed their tune.....  After several in our group posted a review on FB Piches started insulting us. Not a professional management style."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! The potato & manchego flautas were crispy and flavorful, topped with a perfectly spicy salsa and guacamole. Hubby had two sopes, they were delicious. My daughter enjoyed the beans, (I had to do \"quality control\" and they were great!) and we all ate the corn in a cup, which I HIGHLY recommend. The ambiance is so fun, too! We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I visited Pinches Tacos during a February weekend afternoon.   Atmosphere: Different yet cool The entire menu is written in chalk, which looked pretty cool, if I do say so myself. The music added to the Mexican atmosphere, if that's what they were aiming for. The inside of the restaurant is very cramped, so it's good that there is outdoor seating.  Service: Not bad! The menu is huge, size-wise and variety-wise. The servers were nice to me as I ordered my food. They handed me a stand with a picture of a calavera, which I thought was pretty neat. Having this meant I knew that they would come give me my food and wouldn't have to pick it up in the cramped indoors.  Food: Authentic and enjoyable Upon getting my food, it was hot, hot, hot! The foil wrapping my burrito conducted the heat from the beans really well, and upon biting into the burrito I got, the food was steaming! The beans actually tasted like authentic, made with lard and proper seasoning. My burrito was hot and delicious, although waiting for it to cool would not have hurt. The chips and pico de gallo were fresh and tasted adequate.  Overall: Indeed Real Mexican food made by Real Mexicans Worth a visit for some good Mexican food. The food is tasty, the service is timely, and the location is awesome."}
{"text":"Good place to come to eat with good food, but the only problem is you pay $9 a plate and only get 3 pieces of meat. But there corn in the cob was the best"}
{"text":"Tacos were good but like someone else said, \"Mexican food made by real Mexican's\", I expected their tacos to be even better than what they were. They got the food out super fast which was a + considering we were on a time crunch. They are really expensive for tacos though. Almost $30 for 2 people to order 3 tacos and 2 drinks? No tiny taco should be 3$. Maybe visit the LA taco trucks for ideas?"}
{"text":"This is a great  spot located inside the Downtown Container Park.  It's located near the entarance and can not be missed .  As soon as you enter, you are greeted by a huge menu, with a variety of options.   The interior was clean,but felt a little congested at the counter. There are a few tables inside the shop. However,  the seating outside  was more spacious and allowed me to take in the atmosphere of the Container Park. They give you a table placard to take with you when you order and dine outside. It makes it easy for them to bring you your order.  The food was delicious and and prepared quickly . I had the Carne Asade Fries.  The portion was huge and the fries we're perfect.  My friends tried tacos which we're packed and looked delicious. The margaritas pack a punch.  They definitely  sneak up on you! The price on the food for the portion sizes was fair.  I feel like the margritas price was fair considering  they do not skimp on the liquor .  I will definitely continue to visit,  when visiting the Park."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I went on their soft opening. Right away I notice the really cool art work on the walls and their cute lunch truck inside. The atmosphere was really fun and the owner Javier was super nice and sweet! They were giving out free beer and sangria on top of some free appetizers. Place was pack and everyone seem to be enjoying themselves very much and having such a great time. Towards the end of the night I got to try their food. Had their Mexican corn on the cob with mayo and cheese, yum. Then I tried their 3 taco plate combo, 1 chicken mole, 1 veggie and an alpastor taco. Loved them all very good flavor. Over all cannot wait to come back again and try more of the food they have to offer."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with the food at Pinches Tacos. My husband and I split the veggie nachos and street corn. The corn was good but I've had better. The nachos were also good but they just kind of lacked creativity. I felt like they were pretty basic and I could of made the same thing at home. Nothing really blew me away with this place.  I would maybe stop by again and give their tacos a try."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. The crowd is pretty young which is nice. The happy hour was pretty good. The food however is just ok.... i would come back, but only at happy hour."}
{"text":"FINALLY! I was able to stop procrastinating and try Pinches Tacos! I've obviously been missing out because my most recent visit was amazing! I came here this past weekend anticipating happy hour however the nail salon across the way took longer than expected. No biggie! Hungry as I was I still wanted some tacos! After drooling over all the pictures on Yelp my cousin and I finally arrived. The open kitchen conept is pretty dope because you can actually look inside and see them prepare your food. Everything made FRESH from SCRATCH! Thank you taco God's! The bar has this cool indoor outdoor set up and that's what seemed most appropriate for this occasion thanks to the beautiful weather. When you choose to sit in the patio your bartender is also your server. I wish I could remember her name but the amount of margaritas I had kind of umm clogged my memory ha! BUT what I will say is that she was awesome and made some strong recommendations for us being that we were newbies. Happy hour was over but we still rolled with the tacos and margaritas! Oh let me tell you though, these weren't your typical wimpy pre-mix tasting cheap tasting margaritas by far. The pour wasn't stingy at ALL and they tasted great! The street tacos were a good size and I was blown away with the bursting flavors. All in all this place rocks! I WILL be back to make it for happy hour!"}
{"text":"My girl and I stopped in for dinner this evening.  Our waitress was great. Polite, friendly and quick.  The food was good. Loved the green salsa on the tacos.  We were a little upset that they didn't serve a blended margarita, but the ones they did serve were pretty good.  The major negative was how noisy the place was. Part of the reason is they were holding some sort of an event there. The other reason was because there were a couple of kids running around screeching at the top of their lungs.   I'd visit here again. Hopefully next time it's a little quieter and perhaps they'll invest in a blender so they can blend their margaritas."}
{"text":"Gringo tacos are the bomb! Holy smokes, melt in your mouth flavors and seasoning. The outer shell of the taco is a perfect mix of crunch and flavor.    The filling had an amazing sensational taste of salsa, meat, seasoning, and onions. Totally worth coming down for!!"}
{"text":"First time here. SO GOOD. The michelada was perfect. I usually can't find one where the taste is just right. Here it is. We also got the asada fries which were yummy. A little pricey but maybe that's just because of the location. Fries were $10.50 and the michelada was $8. For our first time here they did great. We'll definitely be back!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place was A M A Z I N G! Starting when you walk in you have a feeling that you are going to have a great dinner. We were greeted by the staff and they explained all the tasty stuff on their menu. I had the gringo tacos and some of their yummy Mexican style corn. We shared chips and chorizo queso dip and that was so tasty. Staff was constantly asking how everything was tasting and if we needed anything else. We will definitely be returning, might have to try their happy hour next time. The restaurant decor is great also! Nothing that I don't like so far!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple weeks ago. Food was delicious. The atmosphere was fun! Loved the songs that were playing - talk about some throwbacks! Service was good too!"}
{"text":"Third time visiting and I'm glad to say this place still has tasty food. The home made beans, fresh salsa and chips, should be reason enough for anyone to try this place out. For the people complaining about a too strong margarita . For the people complaining about the wait time during peak hours  . Whenever I see a line ... that's probably where the food is good !"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find. They do not have a sign that says \"Pinche Tacos\" which is understandable. They have a very large menu that accommodates everyone. I got lengua tacos when I came. It was a little gamey also the beef was a little over cooked and salty. Also a little on the expensive side for tacos (over $2 for lengua tacos)."}
{"text":"I was actually really disappointed in this place. It has good reviews on yelp but the food there is all right. Coming from Los Angeles I have a very high expectation for Mexican food. I got the lengua tacos, something I always get when I go to a taqueria. However these lengua tacos really weren't that good. The tongue was very gamy and it kind of made my stomach hurt a little bit. Not the worst I've had but definitely not the best. Also it was a little expensive I'm used to paying about a dollar to $1.50 for a taco and they charge me double that at this location."}
{"text":"I have to admit the food is quite tasty.. it is also quite pricey. I got the carne asada fries, and a drink and I was out the door for $16. The fries were not that big. On a side note, Jefe's Tacos has the best asada fries and you get about 4 times the amount you do from Pinches for $10.    I think Pinches makes their own chips and they are delicious, the chorizzo queso was quite good, a little too creamy but still worth it. We ended up getting the taco combo plate, with asada, roasted chicken, and abado and my buddy loved his plate, another one got the asada burrito, said the burito was smaller than he expected but said it was really good. Finally our other friend got the flautas(sp) and she said they were very good. The carne asada has a very strong citrus flavor.   The also sport one of the soda machine that you can pick tons of brand name sodas then add flavored syrup.   I'd come here again for sure. Like many other reviewers have commented, the location is a bit hard to find and you may have to walk around to get to it. I really want to come here during happy hour and check out the prices and drinks."}
{"text":"Love their Tacos with Hand made tortillas that was a kill. Down side for me it was the Dos Equis on the Pricey side, but then again it was pricey at the other places...."}
{"text":"This is a low key casual place to come eat & drink.  I read the reviews about lack of & bad service, which we didn't experience.  The host, bartender & waitress were all kind, helpful & attentive toward us. It was immediately recognized that we were from out of town & were let in on how to drink & eat more for less. We ordered tacos de carnitas. They were prepared deliciously. Handmade corn tortilla. The gringo taco, although deep fried was juicy and full of flavor. We will definitely come back and we'll bring our friends and family too. Great spot to enjoy Mexican food away from the strip!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome! Container Park is great. Tacos were good. My comer spot is better but I'd still comeback."}
{"text":"I have been to Pinches a few times.  I have to admit that I am a huge fan.    THE GOOD:  Carne Asada is off the hook!!  I love that you get good quality beef here.  Cut into chunks so you can taste the meat.  This isn't the poor quality cheap stuff you get at other places.  This is the Real Deal Holyfield.    I've made my own creation here.  I order the potato & cheese flautas and get 2 orders of carnitas without the tortilla.  i smother the flautas with the carnitas then dig in.  It is so so so so good.  I'm trying to convince Javier to make this a menu item and call it the Uncle Willy.  hahaha.  If you like Enchiladas, you'll love Pinche's Enchiladas.  Their red sauce is amazeballs!!!  After trying the cheese as well as the shrimp, i prefer the cheese.  It is just a better marriage.  I can't explain what makes the sauce so good, but it is definitely the best Enchilada sauce I've ever had.    Gringo Tacos are... in a word... fan-funky-tastic.  Shredded beef and mozerella in a fried taco shell should not work, but it does.  I'm not sure why it tastes so good, because my brain is telling me this shouldn't work, but it does.  This taco is so good.  Happy Hour at Pinche's is kind of like going to a party at your buddies place.  You know the place well, you go with some friends, but you don't necessarily know everyone there when you walk in.  But by the time you leave, you're friends with everyone.  Exactly how I feel about Pinche's at Happy Hour.  Always making new friends and having a great time.    The outdoor patio is great for this time of year.  Perfect place to sit and puff a cigar along with your favorite drink.  There is a descent amount of foot traffic, so you can also people watch.    If you're a fan of Mexican street corn, aka elote, you'll love the offering here at Pinche's.  They do it a little differently than other places.  You get the cotija and chili powder, but you also get some crema  THE BAD:  Only thing negative I can say is the burritos can do with less beans and more meat.  I find that the meat to beans ratio is a bit off here.  But if you like refried beans, you'll love the refried beans at Pinche's."}
{"text":"This is a very bright and colorful restaurant that looks great for a party. I visited on a Sunday early evening and ordered take out. I was the only customer in the place. I ordered al pastor tacos, a fish taco and a pollo mole. All were excellent. I hope more people come to this place to keep it alive. I could seriously see having a birthday party here."}
{"text":"So good I came back! Some of the best mole in town. It's inside the Container Park, so it's fun too. They have fresh brewed tea, the traditional Mexican fruit beverages (horchata, etc), beer & wine, and soda fountain. Everything is made fresh and it's simply delicious. They do deliver and you can call in ahead. When it's not too hot, there is seating out on the patio over looking the park. Must try at least once."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating at this place for quite some time, due to the 4 stars and Living way across town. This review is not to put down the restaurant, but for management to recognize their shortcomings.  First of, parking was really bad, there was no parking when we got there, the layout of the buildings and parking was just off.  So, having to walk quite a distance, expectation level went up quite a bit.  When we got in the restaurant, ambiance was pretty cool..... Til we ordered.... the cashier, which I'm guessing is the manager or the owner, who was busy on his phone,  had a little girl behind the register, finish the transaction. There was a cook in the kitchen with an earpiece dangling on his ear while preparing food.  Keep in mind this was our first time here, so we didn't know what to do.. after we ordered and paid, I didn't know what to do, so I had to interrupt him on his phone and ask if I was to find our own seat or to wait by the register, and had to ask how they were going to be able to know which order was which.  Food quality was terrible, for the price we paid, I expected to have average food, sad to say it was below average. There was no meat in the burrito, rice had crunchy bits, which had been sitting out for quite some time.   All in all I will not be coming back to this restaurant and I hope that owners or management can see this and fix their issues."}
{"text":"Pinches tacos has been on my to do list for a while.. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly staff member that helped us to a table of our choice. What a fun place that uses a food truck as an ordering window. Our server took our order so that we did not have to place it ourselves at the window. Food is delivered to the table identified by the number received at time of ordering.  Our lunch order consisted of the Taco Combination Plate and a Pinches Bean Burrito with cheese. The combination plate includes any 3 tacos plus, refried beans and tortilla chips. I chose the Adobada (chili marinated pork), Camaron (shrimp) and Pescado (fish). The seafood tacos come with Veracruz  coleslaw on top. The tacos can be ordered with deep fried seafood instead of grilled. I ordered grilled and both were delicious. The chili marinated  pork was tender and had great flavor. The coleslaw provides a nice crunch. The rice is pretty standard. I liked the beans because they are thick, no gravy, perfect for the chips.   I would order these again but I have my eyes on the the Burritos for next time. Also looking forward to the outdoor patio. Take time to check out the wall art especially the tiles in the bathroom."}
{"text":"4.5****× I'm drawn to palm trees.  Yeah they've got one towering like a guard at their door.  Loving the interior - so fun.  Some tables had bucket seats that are for cars.  The energy too of the workers and diners.  There's a food truck in here!  Whatta display - it's cool :D.    Comarz and I swung around to eat here cuz ... 1. I had never been.  2. She went to the one in Downtown and wanted to see this one.  3. We were hungry.  Good enough; let's go eat!  We sat at the bar.  There's a wall which opens up to views of an exterior patio, business buildings, and more palm trees yay!  People can sit outside of the bar - limited seating.  But how fun is that set up?!  Don't ask me about the name of the place though :P.  I just learned it.  Do your own questioning elsewhere.  They're serious about making you feel at home.  Especially with the food okay.  You know home cooking is meant to taste a lot better cuz it's made with love right.  Slurp-u-lous flavor tacos found here.  Family recipes!  Come try!  Also, met Javi and Asia.  Tossed a couple tequila shots like we do in Uncle's backyard.  Thanks for the home feel guys!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a co-worker and she had me when she said tacos. I like to try tacos from different spot and this spot have really good tacos. Not only they serve tacos, they offer others choice like burritos, sopes, tortas, enchiladas, taquitos and breakfast during the weekend before 2 p.m.   Wasn't too hungry so I ordered two tacos: 1 Adobada (California chili marinated pork) & 1 asada (grilled grass-fed beef). The tacos were tasty, the asada tacos was one of the best asada tacos I had in a long time and the pork were in chunks which I really enjoy. The prices are higher than the average taco spot but they  use high quality meat and fresh vegetables. Next time I will definitely try something than tacos because everything on the menu sounds delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was pretty good! I'm a big al pastor fan and I got the tacos and a blood orange margarita, ahhhmazing!! This place is pretty small for how busy they are, I hope they expand because they deserve it! Great fun atmosphere and staff is fun and they seem to like what they're doing. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"What an original place !  When you enter you see on the right side a food truck that they cut in half to put the menu, the place you order to go food, register and drinks section. Then you face the kitchen where you can see the cooks preparing your food.  On the left side you have a bar that offers inside and outside seatings. And outside the terrace is just humongous !  Now the food. I ordered the simple veggie burrito that is made with beans, Mexican rice, guacamole, onions and cilantro. I added cheese.  I can understand when people say it's missing a little flavor but me I like it this way. For me it's always easier to add any kind of salsa or hot sauce than having no choice and have to eat a burning plate that turns your mouth on fire and prevent you to be aware of what you're eating.   Knowing that it's just across the street from my house I'll be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Came to try it out not that clean, we ordered the three taco combo and a torta. From the combo plate the rice was under cooked, meat was flavorless, the one good thing I enjoy was the pick de Gallo they make. Their customer service was very nice."}
{"text":"Got a carne asada burrito 2 carne asada tacos and a carne asada torta with my family. Cost about $32.00 and all together it was awful.. the $12 dollar torta I got had just as much carne asada as my wife's one carne asada taco which only cost $4 pretty much only had a few pieces of carne and the rest was all bread.. they wrapped my sons burrito in tin foil and than cut is so he had little small pieces of tinfoil inside his burrito.. taste was awful, Presentation was awful And portion sizes didnt make sense. Never coming back again"}
{"text":"Don't understand the good reviews. The tacos are below average...much better elsewhere.  Is the decor here abstract, yes, do I care if the food isn't good, no.   Maybe this place would be fun for happy hour only with no food, seemed like a fun atmosphere. For me, I'd rather go somewhere with better food.  We ordered multiple items, apps and almost every type of taco they had (wanted to try everything so we could figure out our favorites). We figured this place would be a new spot we frequent due to the good reviews, however, we were wrong. The fish tacos were nasty (spit them out). Nothing else was impressive at all and it appeared like the waitress knew we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"Great food with lots of traditional flavors!.  It located in container park so there is lots for kids to do."}
{"text":"I have had thousands and thousands of tacos in Las Vegas. . . the carne asada taco here is hands down the best I've had in the Las Vegas valley and surrounding areas! The steak was seasoned and grilled to perfection. I found myself talking about them the next day and every time I think of Container Park.  I also LOVE the \"Mexican Corn\". The corn was HUGE and served with cream, cheese, lime and chili. I've only had corn like this served out of a shopping cart on the streets of Las Vegas and Los Angeles. I remember hoping the corn guy would come around so I could have some. This was ten times better than the shopping cart corn (and that was pretty good too). In fact people walking by kept asking where I got the corn.  My boyfriend had the lengua torta and loved it. He gets lengua all of the time for tacos and said this was really good.  PROS: Carne asada taco              Mexican Corn              Lengua torta              Sitting outside enjoying the park while eating"}
{"text":"I came here for a light snack and was really pleasantly surprised by how good it was! I had the Tiny Estiffy, two mini seasoned ground beef chimichangas, topped with a really tasty orange sauce and cheese. I also had a few bites of their Carnitas Burrito and that was a great choice as well. Even their tortilla chips were good! I'll definitely pay them another visit to try more items from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Wow! Where to start.... we ordered six tacos, all different. The meat on every taco was overcooked/dry. The tacos lacked complexity in the flavor department. Bottom line, if you want to good tacos, go to Tacos El Gordo"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pinches Tacos inside the Downtown Container Park because it smelled good. As we waited in line we noticed the cooks behind the counter were NOT wearing gloves. My husband (a chef) was very skeptical about this and wondered what other health codes they were breaking. We found out a minute later as one of the cooks scratched his ass and then pounded out a tortilla with his bare hand. Adios Pinches!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place received such high ratings. Food was very bland. Service was not attentive. Going to stick with taco el gordo."}
{"text":"Great happy hour get the gringo taco and the corn on the cob love this place,  the blood orange margaritas are aeesome as well as the bartenders its a great place for locals on this side of town"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and great food and good prices. My husband and I wanted to try something new and this was a great place. The only down fall it was really loud but the game was on so. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Good food for a fair price (even better because my office is always paying for this stuff), but it lacks the spices I expect in authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Myself and my coworkers have been here a couple of times for our lunch break. It is a little out of the way for us but totally worth it.   My latest trip I ordered the three taco combo plate. I got (1) Gringo Taco, which was on special, (1) Carne Asada Taco and (1) Al Pastor Taco. The Gringo taco was really really good and my favorite of the three. It was shredded beef with chipotle sauce and a crunchy shell. The other two were very delicious as well and were on a soft, handmade corn tortilla. I love that they are handmade and traditional, but they really fall apart on you while eating them. I ordered my combo plate with all beans, no rice. Their beans are good but I think they would benefit from just a little more flavor and salt.   We ended our meal by sharing the guava flan. We were very excited about this. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was bitter and tasted burned. It may have been an off day for the flan and just a bad batch but it was very disappointing.   For lunch, for the three taco combo, it was about $13. (you have to pay extra for the carne asada) This is pretty high on my lunch budget and there are a lot of places you can go where you are served for less than that much per person. That is my main issue. But, you can definitely see where your extra dollars are being spent. Fresh ingredients that are handmade.  We will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!  I probably would have added 1 more star if the taco had no Cilantro which I personally hate.  I had the carne asada tacos and so did my GF.   Loved that they clearly make the tortillas from scratch.  They also have good rice to go with the meals.   They offered Elote and my girl loved it.  Also had Mexican Coke which is not always easy to find.  Would come back and just ask for no Cilantro lol."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos, fresh ingredients, lean meat and flavorful salsa.  Great place to bring children"}
{"text":"Yes yes!! This location is freaking amazing! Tucked away in the new Grammeracy on Russel and the 215, it was absolutely beautiful from the outside. Came here for my boss's going away party and really enjoyed all Pinches had to offer! The decor is so fun, bright pink and blue walls, Day of the Dead skeletons everywhere, and a huge bar. What more could you ask for! I enjoyed a few of the Spicy Margaritas, they were great! I really loved how they came in Mason Jars too. I've eaten at the Downtown Container Park location and the food never disappoints. We tried the shredded chicken and carne asada tacos, so good! I have a feeling this will be our new hangout."}
{"text":"Yes yes! I've eaten here numourous times and it's always a great meal! I absolutely love the ceviche and the shrimp burrito. Not to mention the bloody Mary's! To die. Every time I'm at the Container Park I stop in to my favorite Mexican spot."}
{"text":"Tacos were small and expensive. I had the lengua & carne asada all for $8+, both were mediocre.  Each taco had 1 small tortilla that broke down as you lifted to gobble your 2 bite size taco.  If I did a sit-in for this place I can see why they can charge up the price for a small taco but you walk-in, order your food and go find a seat. Nothing more as far as customer service.  I guess someone has to pay for the location of this place, their customers.  If the price was right & taste was on point, I'd return but I'm not a believer in overpriced tacos where I have to order myself & no other customer service."}
{"text":"Walking in, I was won over by the funky Dia de los Muerto decor melded with street art feel. Bright, airy and you can watch the ladies and gentlemen rolling fresh tacos in the window! There are several dining areas: their outdoor seating looked charming, dining room has 3 small tables & 2 large tables so it can accommodate large or small groups, there is a bar area & another eat-in area past the indoor taco truck. I thought it was a little confusing at first, do we order at the table, do we order at the truck? Eventually a server stopped by & got us going with Margaritas. I had the Blood Orange, it was good if not overly sweet for me.   On to the food, the beans and rice were both dry. Rice had a sweet garlic flavor that was subtle and good. Basically, skip the sides & make up for it with lots of tacos.  Tacos:  Al Pastor: 5/5 - tastes like summer, crisp carmelized pork, tomato sauce, plenty of cilantro & spice- a spicy tomato & onion purée was so yummy. The mix of soft corn tortilla with flavorful caramelized meat, crunch from raw onion with lots of cilantro, this was a standout!  Carnitas - 4/5 they were a-ok but def go with pico de gallo, the flavors go together so well!  Gringo Tacos- 3/5 in a crispy taco shell, complete with cheese and crisp fresh lettuce.  Carnitas, dry. Nice bite of cilantro. First we tried without the sauce and they were a 5/5 for me, then I ordered with the sauce and it just overwhelmingly SWEET, couldn't eat it. so with the sauce 1/5 from me. Would def order again, without sauce.  Camerones - 5/5 tender shrimp, crispy cabbage, just right in sweet and salty, lots of smokey paprika first, spicy little after note. Delish!  Notes for improvements would be, the table we were lucky to get (they were slammed for Taco Tuesday at 5:45pm, note to self!) was awkwardly located too near the line forming at the truck, because the line kept backing up and forming around our table. Kids coloring menus would also be a great offering! It was a cluster on Tuesday at 5:45, but we got a table- people lining up around our table not the best.  Management stopped and chatted with us for a few minutes, that was great! We'll be back again to try some more; glad to have this spot in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very delicious tacos. The horchata was delicious as well, and I got a free shot of Casadores! It's small and packed, took a bit to get the food, but worth the handmade tortillas! Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars because it was edible. Carnitas were whole pieces of pork with no flavor. Pastor tacos were the only semi-saving grace for this place. The menu talks about gringo this, gringo that, and I told them I would be compairing them to taco truck in East LA. Needless to say this place is not even close to, \"Real Mexican food made by real Mexicans\" as their entry sign boasts. Not worth the time of day."}
{"text":"Love the fresh tortillas and Mexican corn."}
{"text":"Awesome time with the staff , they are the best . And the food is out of this world.  Love you guys"}
{"text":"My taco Tuesday spot. The tacos are so yummy!! I like the margaritas as well. On Tuesday everything is discounted. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! The brothers Javi, Fernando & George who run this place are awesome and friendly, which keeps me coming back for more!! I love the chicken burritos, quesadillas, GRINGO tacos and of course the Horchata drinks! Btw, I learned from them that Pinches is NOT a bad word!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is decent. Fun decor. Food is average. Don't believe we will return any time soon."}
{"text":"It feels like family going to this location!! Best mitchalads and tacos for the price. My favorite is the greengo tacos!!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor, ambience, the music and customer service from wait staff. The food, however, ay dios mio. I had the combo plate with 2 carnitas tacos, 1 asada, beans and rice. The carnitas were bland and blocky. I'm used to my carnitas being kinda shreddy, but that's just me. The asada was decent, nothing to write home about. If you want really good tacos (in Vegas), go to Taco y Taco. If you want GREAT tacos, go to TJ (MX)."}
{"text":"I usually stop by with my daughter at least one time when I'm in Vegas visiting my family on a monthly basis. The food is normally to my liking as it stands to reason my returned visits! Today, I had a craving for some enchiladas and taquitos!!  Taquitos were delicious as usual, however the enchiladas plate were definitely NOT to my liking  The sauce has this sweet taste and after a few bites, I still didn't like it.  So, basically I had eaten one out of the 3 enchiladas and was so disappointed that I didn't even eat my rice and beans. You'd think our server would noticed and ask if everything was ok, but NO it didn't even phased her.  On top of that I had to ask for a refill to my glass.   Customer service sucked today!    Will never order enchiladas here in the future"}
{"text":"Great food.  Prices are a little high but the food is very good.  Service is average to good"}
{"text":"Great staff, super friendly. Great tacos. A little pricey for a family of 6 and the beef burrito is a lot on the slim side for 11$."}
{"text":"Best tasing tacos EVER! And I'm a meat snob. I hate chewy fat meat. And the flavor was Delish!"}
{"text":"Tacquitos weren't my favorite but the tacos and flauntas were really good. My service was great and very friendly staff. Will definitely be coming back for Mexican food made by real Mexicans."}
{"text":"First time visit. We had like 3 waiters help us so it was confusing on who we ordered from.  I ordered 3 tacos on a Sunday for $2 each. ( that's the Sunday special I guess)  I ordered: Pollo mole, Al Pastor and Carnitas. Pollo mole was my favorite, so flavorful and delicious. Al Pastor was quite good but I've had better al Pastor tacos elsewhere.  Carnitas was boring and a little dry. If this place had maybe a salsa bar or something it would be worth coming back more often.  I would say try this place during happy hour. I'll most likely be back sometime."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is a welcome edition to the neighborhood! The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is very friendly.as far as decor, I love the \"taco truck\" within the brick and mortar of the restaurant. Pinches Tacos is my new favorite place for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"I went and visited this new location to try the tacos! I was very impressed with the decorations because they are so cute and unique. I was a little disappointed when I walked in to two guys boxing right there and throwing punches. I ordered the taco plate and i have to say it was okay for me. I thought it was a little cold when I get them and a bit dry with the meat. I did love the rice which I usually don't ever eat. I would go back to give it a second chance and try the corn that I forgot to order."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and the food isn't great at all.. my carne asada tasted like every other thing on the menu except carne asada.. I'll never waste my time or money at pinches tacos"}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent. Everyone very friendly and always smiling! The food is amazingly good! I tried the lengua taco combination, the meat was soft and tender! I also tried their corn on the cob, so damn good! A must try place if your on the southwest of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Legit the best experience I have had in awhile as far as tacos go. Still the street taco vibe but super clean and nice location. Walked in and was greeted and told The specials and favorite tacos right off the bat by there friendly staff. I ordered afew tacos because on taco Tuesday they have 2 dollar tacos. Food came out fresh and fast, for sure going to be bring family and friends back!"}
{"text":"First going to this restaurant.  I was so excited to try. I placed order to go from server. He recommended tacos adobada.. waited for order for 42 minutes. Before I asked for order. I was informed they didn't have product. I asked for refund was given nothing but attitude from cashier. Very rude . Will not be returning.  Thanks for horrible experience.  I'll be spreading bad words about this establishment.  I work in restaurant industry..and customer service is Key!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile and now that they opened a location off the strip I was so happy to try it out. The place is very well lit and the decor is bright and fun. However, our server seemed displeased and barely even spoke to us. I ordered the 3 taco combination plate and I was very disappointed. The meat was great quality but no flavor. The beans and rice that came with the meal also tasted watered down with no flavor at all. 2 beers and 2 taco combination plates for 39 dollars was not worth it. Food was not good enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place has descent reviews. Tried carne asada and fish tacos, with rice and beans. The asada tacos were extremely greasy without a flavor to remember. The fish lacked flavor also with the beans tasting like Rosarito can vrand. Rice was just not there in the spice or flavor either. Jamaica was the only thing that had a good taste and it was a fountain type drink.   The signs entering this place say \"real Mexican food\", these need to come down.  Sorry Tacos El Gordo blow the tortillas out their doors."}
{"text":"Came in on taco Tuesday. $2 per taco, not bad! I was pretty underwhelmed. The fryer was down so a lot of stuff we couldn't even order. Salsa that comes on the tacos is bland, and we weren't offered the other options we had to ask for them. Ordered two micheladas, it tasted like there was more mix then actual beer. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Tortillas are good hand made, pastor is okey if you are hungry the rest are delicious."}
{"text":"I can't stop going here!  I LOVE this place! Burritos, tacos. elote (corn on the cob Mexican style), quesadillas you just cannot go wrong with this place! Plus, they're ALWAYS super nice!  I don't care what you order, it's gonna be good!"}
{"text":"We love this taco place. It's a sit down restaurant with some pretty cool wall art work. You can see their kitchen from the front. Pretty great atmosphere. They usually take a little while to cook everything so expect to wait a little bit for your order. Tuesdays they do $2 tacos, so if you want to try some good tacos that's the day to do it."}
{"text":"Had carnitas, shrimp, and asada tacos. Little to no flavor. Rice and beans were bland also. The best part of the meal was the Fuze raspberry tea. Would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos is the bomb! The atmosphere is chill and decor is freaking awesome. They have great happy hour specials, and regular prices aren't too bad either.   Their carnitas tacos are my fave. They make their tortillas fresh. Also order their elotes, omg so good!   If you're looking for some adult beverages,  I would have to say this place has the best micheladas in Vegas. Can't really go wrong with any of their drinks!   The whole staff is awesome and super attentive. They will happily help if you have any questions about the menu.   Great place to hang if you're in the area. I haven't tried the other location yet, but I'm sure it's just as great."}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas. Awesome guacamole. Angus beef in their asada. Great staff and fast service. The blood orange margaritas are on spot."}
{"text":"That pollo mole tho! Get the taco combo for sure! Perfect little street style food to go with your beer!"}
{"text":"We ordered carne asada fries and chicken flatuas. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING !!! by far the best mexican food I've had in Las Vegas. Much better than robertos and tacos y tacos. The carne asada was tender and delicious stacked with crispy fries cheese, pico and guacamole. The chicken flatuas were for my children who devoured them. They came with crema gucamole and pico I only got one bite but the filling was delicious. We spent almost $25 for two menu items, one fountain drink and a bottle of water, a little pricey but definitely worth it. My only complaint is the restaurant is kinda small so navigating my stroller was difficult and it was too cold to eat outside more heat lamps pls !!"}
{"text":"The food, off the hook, the staff was fun and friendly made us feel like family."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Great food and you must try the tortilla soup! Went with a large group of people and everyone raved about their food. I will most definitely be back. So happy to find some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Go for the blood orange margaritas! That's reason enough.  The rest of the food that I have has was good. It is a quality taqueria. Not fine dining, but really tasty and fresh, and the service is very good.    I feel like the chalkboard menu is a little hard to read, so it takes a minute, but that's a minor issue."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The decor is awesome and reminded me of Playa Del Carmen. The food was really good. My favorite was the lengua taco. Churro was bomb!"}
{"text":"We tried the Pinche plate with guacamole and a side of corn... All I can say is wow the food was absolutely amazing, I mean amazing! I just moved to Las Vegas from San Diego and in San Diego we have some of the BEST mexican food ever as a result of being so close to the border and this place feels a lot like home. It feels good to get some non fakexican food in my new home!"}
{"text":"Tacos and michelada!   The line is long but the food came out fast. Their homemade tortillas is definitely a plus. I had the veggie taco plate and my pic ordered the pollo mole burrito, both tasty and flavorful. Other good items, the beer, horchata, refried beans and salsa."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos. Friendly owner with a super attractive wife. Great choices in different meats and fresh tortillas. Loved the whole experience!"}
{"text":"Pinches is wonderful in the Container Park. I eat here every year when I visit Las Vegas. I love the tortas. This time I had a torta with al pastor and my wife had elotes (corn on the cob). She loved the elotes. The service was very friendly and their food kicks ass. I wish I could try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointed. There's no other word for it. Came here because I saw all the great reviews on Yelp and the 4.5 star rating and figured it had to be something awesome. Well, it fell short, very short of awesome.   I will say that the staff is very friendly. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a waiter and he was very informative and nice. Plus the decor is very cool. I was already excited about the food thinking with such friendly staff and cool decor that it couldn't be anything but great.   The taco al pastor was nothing special. The meat was dry and the corn tortilla was soggy. Next up was my side of Mexican rice and tortilla soup. The rice was okay again nothing special and the tortilla soup was probably the worst I've ever had. I know good real Mexican food and this wasn't it. The soup had a consistency of canned tomato soup and instead of putting fresh avocado slices in it they put a glob of guacamole in it with some cream. It was very weird and tasted like Cholula hot sauce. Oh and there wasn't a single tortilla strip in the entire soup. How is it tortilla soup with no tortillas?? I had a couple spoonfuls and decided I just couldn't eat anymore of it. I went home with a tummy ache and I never ever get tummy aches from food.  My husband wasn't impressed with his food either. The only good thing I can think of regarding the food was the crispy tortilla shell of the gringos tacos. That was good but I didn't like their salsa on the taco itself.   Plus they didn't bring any silverware or napkins until we asked for them after all our food got to the table. The runner brought the soup out to me without a spoon. They didn't refill our waters during our dining time there and it was also hard to flag them down to get the check.   I really don't understand how this place has such a high rating. It's mind boggling."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I most favorite spot! The atmosphere is nails, the food is stellar and the atmosphere is rad! We love it and we looooove the staff! We recommend this hidden gem to all of our friends! Have to try the blood orange Ritta's and the gringo taco!"}
{"text":"Beautiful day at Container Park.  Pinches Tacos were very tasty.  Had the shrimp combo plate along with elote.  About the only downside is how they deliver your food.  They give you a stand with a number but they kept having issues finding people at tables.  None the less, the food was worth it and as the line of people backs up during a nice day I'm sure they will do well."}
{"text":"Gringo tacos from the taco truck - if you have been here but haven't had those, you are sooooo missing out. I had visited this restaurant about 1.5 yrs ago when I first moved to this side of town, but I didn't think it was really anything to write home about at the time. Apparently, I had not ordered the right foods. A friend of mine took me to the taco truck at Downtown Container Park and ordered beef and chicken gringo tacos and once I tried them, I was totally hooked. I am so happy I live so close to this location in the Gramercy because can get them anytime I want now. Every person I've introduced them to (whenever I had visitors, I take them there when we're not feeling like going anywhere far) has loved them.  I like to come here and get gringo tacos, street corn, and either micheladas or beers and maybe - if we're feeling a little adventurous - some tequila shots. It's the perfect environment and food for a hangover or for a casual dinner with friends or a date."}
{"text":"I actually feel bad for people that think the tacos at Pinches Tacos are the best. Decent at best, nothing tasted special or excellent, it's average across the board."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!   The food is great! I am a huge mole fan and their mole is fabulous!   Service was exceptional. I can't recommend this place highly enough. If you find yourself in Vegas, go to Pinches!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, staff is really nice, and great view of the praying mantis with the antennaes that catch on fire. Went twice on our trip. Definitely a repeat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We stumbled upon it in Container Park and my fiancé, who is Mexican, loved their slogan, real mexican food made by real mexicans. They have a huge menu and the majority of my family got burritos, either al pastor or pollo and my sister got the vegetarian tacos. The burritos are BOMB! I will be going back to container park just for the burrito. I've eaten a ton of burritos over the years as they are my favorite but this is by far the best burrito I have ever had! Definitely worth it....you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"good food. mmmmm. not enough time to write. got to eat with the fam. tacos pastor  and carne are resllt good. yunmy!Enjoy guys."}
{"text":"Clean, fun ambiance, waiters are out going, love there location. I know of them from there location at Container Park and have been waiting for them to open this location. So far at this location, I love there tortas de carnitas! Mexican corn was yummy (its not hard to F*up corn mayo and cheese) Didn't really like there Carne asada sope the meat just tasted odd, there beans and rice NO flavor."}
{"text":"My friend knows the owner, so I was excited to try this place. I ordered the Combination Plate & got 3 tacos: Asada, Al Pastor, and Lengua (all 3 were recommended by the owner). The plate included rice, beans, & tortilla chips. $9.50 + additional $1.50 for Asada = $11 for my meal (+ tax).  I wish I enjoyed my meal more than I did, but 2 out of 3 tacos were too dry for me & were a bit bland. Maybe next time I'll ask for flour tortillas instead & add sour cream or guacamole. Hopefully that'll make a difference. The rice & beans were good, but nothing extraordinary about them.  I enjoyed the Lengua taco the most though. The meat was juicy & cooked perfectly. I'd definitely order that again if I go back.  The decor of the place is funky & artsy. The restaurant is hidden, though, so it can get confusing on which door is the entrance (happened to us).  Nonetheless, it's supposedly a hot & new restaurant. So, I'm willing to give it another shot sometime."}
{"text":"So, I'm sure other people have had and do have good food here. But that wasn't the case for me today. I have nothing against Pinche's other than their terrible food. It was some of the worst tacos I've ever had and being a former chef on the strip, making good tacos doesn't take much more than fresh product, solid cooking techniques and balance with acid(lime in this case) and salt. I'll just lay out the facts and let you decide for yourselves:  - Guacamole was salt less and lime less along with being too spicy.  - The salsa that came with the chips, that I presume was their \"house salsa\" tasted like it had black pepper in it and was also salt less.  - The Elote was also just ok. The mayo was squirted on rather than brushed on so there were globs of mayo on the plate which is unappetizing. Again, a little lime would go a long way.  - The adobada taco was absolutely terrible. This is where cooking technique comes in. The pork was so tough and the fat not rendered which made it unable to even chew. Along with the whole taco being dry as their was nothing on it but the meat, onions and cilantro.  - The pastor taco was the only highlight. And I say that barely. The flavor was good and the meat was tender. It was still dry though as most places add a crema and pineapple to it to add creaminess, sweet, and sour contrast. Again, only meat, onions and cilantro.  - The fish taco was horrendous. The fish was obviously not fried to order as it was soggy with no crust. The cole slaw on it was blah. Nothing great.  - The gringo taco was ordered my wife and she liked it. I didn't try it but it isn't hard to make the \"traditional\" American hard shell taco.   In the end, I will not being going back. When it comes to cooking, mistakes are made sometimes but for Pinche's, everything was a mistake as the lone bright spot was the gringo taco. If that's the only thing that is good that comes from your kitchen, then things need to change. It was their sign outside that made me laugh when leaving, \"Real Mexican Food by Real Mexicans.\"  Obviously not the case with Pinche's."}
{"text":"5 stars for food. 1 star for price (The pricing is RIDICULOUS). 1 star for seating (one or two tables inside, and hardly any umbrellas in the crazy vegas sun outside, seriously?) 3 stars for service... they just seemed annoyed with people who had never eaten there before and weren't sure with how they take orders."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the prices are stupid high. For a tiny plate of chips and salsa, it's like 5 bucks. No refills. Wtf.  We came in once and asked how much each salsa would be for our to-go order (we wanted to try them all!) and they told us it'd be $1 each!! For those tiny little plastic cups. We laughed but they weren't joking.  There are definitely better places around town that are cheaper."}
{"text":"WARNING: Super Addicting. Highly recommended is the CHICKEN MOLE BURRITO!! Delicioso. Normally I steer clear of any chain serving mole; but I took a chance, and it does NOT disappoint. The most tender carne asada, and moist carnitas.  All the chips/tortillas/sopes are made fresh by hand, which you just can't beat. When you think about the quality of the food, the price is right on point. The fact that they serve elote is unique and has to be one of the best \"snacks\" in Container Park!! Yum. Yum. Yum.  The service is excellent, and it is very likely they will remember you upon return. Real Mexican food from real Mexicans, right here in beautified (in process) Downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have known a homeless man for 4 years. He is an expert on the Fremont Street area. As an excuse to buy him a taco for the holidays, I ask him to give me a tour of container park. Very cool by the way.  We ordered 3 steak, street tacos and two soft drinks. We each took a bite of the tacos an sort of looked at each other funny. I ask him what he thought and we both wrinkled our noses. They had a funny taste like the meat might have been prepared for a long while before we ate it. The meat was also slightly tough to chew. For the $16.00+- that we paid, we did finish. However, when a hungry homeless guy has to force  down the food. You do the math.  He ask me to give him cash to play KENO next year!"}
{"text":"Authentic! Carne Asada taquitos were my favorite. Excellent chips and salsa ... always a hallmark of true Mexican food. Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Seems like a fun place ... kinda hidden (speakeasy \"I know this place\" feel).  Let me tell you I wish I didn't .... I get the \"street taco truck\" vibe but man .... no flavor, expensive and the waitress jacked my order up (then tried to tell me it was my fault)..... too many good Mexican places out there to make a mistake on this joint."}
{"text":"I love it. Great food and the 10 minute loading zone outside works well for to-go orders if there's no line. $3 for a 16oz horchata is a straight up ripoff compared to Pepe's. The burritos are good and no upcharge for wet style."}
{"text":"So I thought I'd take a nice walk from working hard at my salon. I get here didn't wait long witch is great being that I was super hungry. I get my tacos and this what 10$$ and I tipped 3$! I'm really upset OVERPRICED I'm sure because of the location! I won't be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Decor is awesome. Vibe was awesome. Tacos were awesome. I'm a taco expert so believe me. I know what I'm talking about. I'm coming back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Came here from a recommendation on Reddit and.....1.5 hr wait time...for tacos at a stall (not a sit-down restaurant but more of like a permanent food truck with outdoor seating)?? I have never heard of such a wait time for tacos! As someone who's visited many taco places in Illinois/Chicago area and Atlanta, I know for a fact that the best taco places have quick service (its basically like...street food in Mexico y'know) and great quality food! after 1.5 hours of waiting, the pollo tacos we got were cold, and I HATE cold beans (they only gave us about half a scoop). Asking for water took another 15 minutes because the line was so long and the poor cashier was being bombarded.   Almost took the food back to have it reheated but didn't want to wait any longer T_T. Arrived at 8:00pm for what we thought was going to be a quick dinner before the main event (El Cortez and Fremont Street Experience), but it was almost 10PM before we even left the plaza...wait time was longer than Gordon Ramsey Restaurants on the strip, and their portion sizes were so tiny that I wasn't even full off of a full taco dinner ($10+). Darn it, Reddit. Disappoint."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!! Taco shells were on point. The fillings... we had asada, pollo, el pastor, pollo mole, lengua, rice and beans... and chips with salsa and guacamole... just so GOOD!!! Nice job PT!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Great flavor, friendly service, great prices. Not much inside seating but there is plenty outside patio seating. Located inside Container Park."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch while I was doing some work at a small event in the Fremont area of Las Vegas. I grabbed a three taco plate with lengua (tongue) and chicken tacos. Everything tastes fresh, the tortillas were made to order, and the sides were delicious. Happy with the meal overall :)"}
{"text":"Don't even want to give details in my Pinches review because I want this place to stay exactly how it is and don't ever want to atmosphere to change!  A family run Mexican hang out that is so inviting that I can almost guarantee you'll be friends with the owner before the time you leave.   They offer quick lunch service for those working in or close to the Gramercy, and by night, turns in to a hip bar to meet up with friends, play some life size games in the courtyard, share a cigar outside and keep on with the amazing spicy jalapeño margaritas!  Love you Pinches :*"}
{"text":"We waited 2 hours for our tacos. One hour just to order and another hour to actually get our tacos. We went on the day of the dead, but still service should not be this slow for TACOS. The tacos were delicious though. The carne was soft and lengua was on point."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed a blood orange margarita and chips and salsa on the patio here on a nice night in November.  I can't speak for the tacos, but the chips are crisp and thick, and the salsa is deliciously chunky.  The guy at the counter let me try a taste of the margarita before I ordered it, which was nice."}
{"text":"Food: alright...... had Torta de Asada, Asada Fries and al pastor taco (didn't like taco, felt dry for my taste) but rest was good  Dining area: we dined outside, since the weather was pleasant.   Service: Good/Nice cashier and server."}
{"text":"Love the staff.  Authentic Mexican food made by real Mexicans. Vanessa rocks. Apple is a sweet tart.  FN Bobby has mad skills behind the bar and makes a mean michelada.  Love this local hideaway."}
{"text":"Elotes man, elotes.   The corn is cooked well. The toppings are generously applied. When I bit into and got the cheese all over my face, I was in heaven."}
{"text":"Came to Pinches they have a great vibe and style, a good selection on the menu too.  Ordered the 3 taco meal and Carne Asada fries. Fries were great the avocado some of the best I've tasted. Not a huge fan of beans but they were good. Meat was good and 1 portion could easily feed 4 people.   the pork was my least favourite not much flavour, the beef was ok leaving the chicken to rule. Or did it? Ordered the dash taco on the side and it was absolutely amazing best fish taco I've had. Flavours were insane and the crunch from the cabbage just makes it."}
{"text":"Cool little taco shop at the Grammercy (Russel/215)  My date and I had dinner at Pinches Tacos and had a great time. Tacos were 2$ for happy hour. They were bursting with flavor and we loved them. They're smaller street style tacos so order a few if you want to leave with a full stomach. Their margaritas were good too. Service was great. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Slightly offended by the person representing this place. I came shortly after opening ( this review has been a long time coming)  a guy came brought us our food and began to give us the low down on the place since it had just opened. I think he was a rep, hell maybe even  a manager at the LA location. my husband who is full blown Mexican struck up a conversation with him and he told us how this place differs from others in the area. One reason being the \"Not Nacho's\" I asked why they are called that and he said \"well, what do people think of when they think of nacho's?\" A little dumb founded I paused for a while and he said \" chips with processed cheese on top\" I realize this place is also a chain in LA with plenty of Mexicans so what makes him think that's what people think Nacho's are? I know I don't think that and I'm white. So what \"people\" is he referring to? Get a life bro, your tacos suck compared to REAL tacos at Tacos El Gordo!!!!"}
{"text":"I can easily rate the service and food 5-stars. We stopped by the Container Park today and decided to have lunch on property. Mexican food sounded great to everyone in our group. The staff was friendly and informative. The food was delicious and filling. I enjoyed the carnitas burrito and fresh salsa. Come on a nice day and enjoy the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great food. Decent price. The Carne Amada taco plate was good. The tortillas were home made. And the beans were very good. Had chips that they make here. Wonderful find here in Fremont area of Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here during lunch and was expecting your typical Mexican food. I have to say that it exceeded my expectations. The portions were huge, I got the enchiladas and they could have fed two people easily. The meat was also very savory and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone trying to get a bite in container park. The water melon juice was also extreme delicious."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour from 5-7m which is $2 tacos  (chicken, pork and \"gringo\") and $4 drinks, the margaritas are good they have a traditional, blood orange and peach. The consensus was chicken taco and traditional margarita for the win. Also the guac, salsa and chip trio is amazeballs."}
{"text":"Was my fave food in Vegas( visiting from San Diego) I got elote and potato taquitos."}
{"text":"Mmmmm great Mexican food. Good portions and a friendly staff. We had the nachos and quesidillas. All great! Definitely coming back here! Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had a friend come into town so we decided to try this place out! It's easy to find and looks great from the outside. When you walk in, the set up is very fun and the place offers a very chilled vibe. The kitchen area looks like a food truck and the seating area kind of like a patio with a garden gate. There's also a big version of 3 in a row, if that floats your boat.  I was a little confused when we walked in because there were 3 girls leaning up against the food truck, chatting and drinking, I thought they were guests who'd just made themselves very comfortable, but no, they were staff! It would have been nice to have been greeted a little more professionally but thankfully one had enough time in between sips to tell us to 'sit wherever'. Drinks came quickly enough from the bar and for food, we went for the flautas to share and we each had the taco combination which came with 3 tacos, beans, rice and chips. The flautas tasted good, but they were served cold which was a shame. We all had different tacos and all commented that they were OK, very average. Meat a little overdone, not seasoned properly and the kitchen was a little stingy with the amount of shrimp. The taco combos were also served on a plastic plate with separated sections, kind of like what you'd be given if you were a child, or in prison. A normal plate would have been great.  The staff were friendly enough but I was a little shocked by how 'differently' they do things here. For example, a guy who I thought was a guest passed our table and asked if we were all okay before returning to his table of girlfriends, turns out he worked there. And the lady who served us our bill came over, purse in arm, before returning to chilling with a guy at the bar. Idk if she had clocked out and was doing our main server a favour or what. Very strange and not what I personally appreciate, but if you like casual dining and extremely casual service, then this might be for you! As for me, I think we'll try something else next time we crave some tacos!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this place was great! The gringo tacos where bomb and the happy hour had good tequila for a cheap price! Also the bartender had told me that it was happy hour all day on Sunday! I thought this is great, well not so much....  I go back there on a Sunday,and I expected the same treatment and pricing as I got the last time I was there. Well no apparently on Sundays it is happy hour after 3pm only so my friend went there before us and was not happy about that.... so we come back after 3 and sit at the bar. I ask about happy hour, I'm told two different things by two people but it was okay bc they where just like $1 difference in there description of happy hour, but they both said shots where on special. So we drink then we get our bill.... we where getting charged $12 for a shot of casamingos blanco! I said excuse me but the last time I was in here for happy hour it was $4 a shot, the guy said oh that's only if our manager/owner was here.... ummm what!!?? I said well I would have have ordered them if I knew the prices tripled when the manager/owner is not here :/ needless to say I will not be referring my friends here or coming back. The food is good and so are the drinks but not for the price. I work on the strip in a Mexican place and we are not even that expensive! Esp if it is \"happy hour\""}
{"text":"Great food. Quick service. Friendly staff. They have a cool vibe for their inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"Eh. It was ok for what it was but for the price, I wouldn't say it's necessarily worth traveling out of your way for. I got the shrimp burrito which was pretty good but I didn't feel like it was worth it."}
{"text":"I guess this place is OK when you're in a pinch (get it).  We were looking for a quick bite to eat on the way to the Smith Center, who knew Le Thai was closed on Sundays, anywho, we ended up at the Container Park.   We both settled on the Pinches Combo which is 3 street tacos with your choice of meat, I went with Carne Asada, Shrimp and Fish. I couldn't tell the difference between the shrimp and the fish there was so much breading on them. They also charge you .50 cents each taco for \"upgrading\" to seafood. Elote was pretty good, not the best I've had,  little heavy on the mayo. Horchata was good.  For $35 for two people to have street tacos and a fountain drinks, it was a tad overpriced, in my opinion. Nothing was that good for me to come back again."}
{"text":"I would give them a good review because their food really is good.... When they get it right. I have come here multiple times with my boyfriend and they have gotten the order incorrect at least twice.  I am a vegetarian and have only had restaurants give me meat in my food probably 4 times in the past 6 years. As I took a bite into my potato manchego cheese tacos I distinctly tasted chicken. I waited 20 minutes to get the incorrect item that simply needs to be fried. Like I said before, I would go back if they could pay attention to the order."}
{"text":"Love the food & the vibes I get when I go into Pinches tacos! The food is good but when it's busy, the customer service is a bit slow. I took my parents here & they loved it. Totally going to go back!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Taco place in Vegas! The ambiance is pretty cool and the service is great! I usually order corn in a cup, the taco combo which comes with 3 tacos of your choice, rice and beans. I've tried chicken, al pastor, carne asada, and shrimp tacos! Delicious! Love coming here for dinner with friends and catching up. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here!!! I've heard about this place from a couple of my friends. They said they've eaten here in California and now they have 2 locations in Las Vegas. Since I was at Container Park & was super hungry, I decided to give this place a try.   I'm very picky with my Mexican food since I come from a town were Mexican food is every authentic.  I ordered the beef flatuas and mmm mmm mmm it was AMAZING!!!! Very moist & tasty. Sorry to say but a lot of Mexican restaurant make their flatuas dry and yucky but NOT here!!!!       The staff was very friendly and the food runner was very impressive. He must have carried at least 6-8 plates of food on one arm. I totally recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!  We had the watermelon and the blood orange margaritas which hit the spot. Tacos were fantastic and the Mexican corn was off the chain.  Great atmosphere and fantastic people running this place.  We plan on coming every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for some to go food on cinco de Mayo not knowing it was cinco. Place was lively and seemed to have a good energy about it. Looks like a fun place to throw some back. I ordered the carne asada burrito which was $10. Came with guacamole inside and the quality was very good and I was impressed. I look forward to going back in the future"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots. Food is always great, staff is friendly and recognize me now  :) Location is nice and I love the vibe. Everyone is also in a good mood and you feel like family when you are there. I have taken multiple friends there and everyone is also a fan."}
{"text":"The best nachos and chicken ever. We are locals and drive 20 minutes just to get their food. 3X in one week!"}
{"text":"These guys are for real! I haven't had a bad thing on their menu, yet I'm surprised at how good everything is every time I eat here!!! This is real Mexican Fare. In my opinion and this could be a stretch for most but PINCHE TACOS takes the number one spot for South of the border food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"**4 stars for service and 3 stars for the food** Tried Pinches out in the first few weeks they opened. Liked the food and the set up and style is pretty cool. Ordered the nachos, and a couple of  taco plates. It was good but definitely didn't wow me. Tacos were good, but I enjoyed the refried beans more. They didn't serve alcohol at that time so they let my husband bring in a 6 pack so that was kinda cool. Service however was great. The boss was very attentive and friendly. Prices are cheap. If you like small mom and pop restaurant's this place is worth a try!  The location is kind of hidden so you can miss it."}
{"text":"this place was very yummy!  we ordered a variety of tacos i liked them all. im not a seafood lover but loved their shrimp tacos. i love the menu simple and unique. the margaritas are good too a little strong but good. i recommend this place to sober up after a night of drinks. pinches tacos que pinches tacos tan Buenos."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Very good food. The nachos are large enough portion for two. Just ask for jalapeño if you like yours spicy! Got the asada fries but with chicken instead. A whole different option for French fries lovers. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Pinche amazing! Incredibly nice people, wicked good food, and super creative concept. You won't be sorry you came!"}
{"text":"We were craving tacos and wanted the legit Mexican joint and came upon this.   Def legit and tasty. I order the tacos which was okay and also order their horchata which was refreshing and the flautas that was delicious. Giving it 4 stars cause that hit the spot. Def worth it and it was affordable compare to all the other restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"GET THE GRINGO TACO!!! not on the regular menu but it's delish. I crave their blood orange margaritas...I like mine spicy!!! The shrimp taco is my next favorite and then the al pastor. Not crazy about their carne asada. Hidden gem. I love this place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place in the SW. Located in The Gramarcy(Russell, just west of the 215). Place is fun, relaxed, food really good and great prices. And, staff is friendly and everyone's working hard. You really should give it a shot."}
{"text":"The wait was a kinda long for just 2 orders of taquitos but it was well worth it. Had the flauta carne asada & potato/cheese w/side of rice. The portions are a good size, about 6 pieces per plate piled with guacamole, fresh salsa, Mexican cream & cheese. I could barely finish an order. The rice was really tasty too. I noticed a lot ppl ordering the taco plates and they looked delish, everyone's plates were licked clean. Good authentic Mexican food, definitely a step up from Roberto's lol"}
{"text":"I really liked the decor of this place and wanted to like the food.  However, the red sauce on my chicken enchiladas was sickening sweet and the beans and rice devoid of taste.  Hard to find the entrance too-- no signage at the door. It looked more like an emergency exit.  Oh well, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the second location for Pinches in Las Vegas and is completely different from the one in the downtown Container Park.  It's at the Gramercy just off the 215 at Russell Road.  When you enter, you place your order at a \"food truck\" window.  You're given your drink there unless you're getting soda from one of the many flavors Coke machines.  You're given a table marker and you have a seat while they make your order and then bring it to your table.  There was no one there at 5 PM on this Saturday night and I was able to take in the decor and get some photos of the interior.  It was designed nicely with whimsical wall paintings, faux garbage cans that have paper flowers in the top, and a kitchen in glass with wooden closures like a Mexican food place.  One of the owners took my order and he chatted with me about the decor and explained the Dia de los Muertos style art done of member of the Anaya family.  My meal came--a combo plate with chicken mole taco, adobada taco, and carnitas taco.  I also ordered a Mexican corn.  I asked if they'd hold off on bringing the corn until I could enjoy my tacos.  When I was done with the tacos, I was asked if I was ready for my corn and it was brought to me warm.  This was so much better than getting everything at once and having the corn cool off while eating the rest.  I also got a horchata.  The tacos were good with the chicken mole being my favorite.  I thought the other two were OK. The rice was standard and the chips and refried beans were OK, too.  The corn would have been better if it had more chili powder but I'm sure they use what the average customer would like rather than what I prefer.  Service was great and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional!  If I were rating the place solely on atmosphere, it would be 5 stars all the way.  The interior design was well planned and it's a very inviting place.  I need to come back and try some other tacos and ask for more chili on my corn.  It's easy getting here from where I live.  For those uncertain, exit the 215 at Russell Road and head west.  Halfway from the 215 to Fort Apache, there's a left turn into the Gramercy complex.  Drive a semi-circular path around the back of the building along Russell.  Just keep going past the coffee house.  Shortly after an open space, there's another building and Pinches is in the corner of that building.  You can see the 215 and the signs from the parking area.  On leaving keep going around the semi-circle and you'll be back to Russell very quickly."}
{"text":"When we walked in around 3:45pm on Wednesday it was pretty empty. So we figured we'd be eating pretty quick. Nope! We waited for our drinks then waited even more just to get our order taken. Add in the time it took to get our food. Also, my husband kept calling out to the waitress that was right at the next table chatting it up with the family. I guess you have to know someone there to get attended to. Finally, we get our food. My flautas were soggy. My husband's carne asada fries looked like everything were just thrown onto the plate. It was a mess. According to the waitress that described the tacos, she stated they were bigger than your normal street tacos. NOPE! Exact same size. My daughter did say they tasted really good, so there's that. However, paying over $3 for a street taco??? I guess it's all about location. Needless to say, $60 for a quesadilla, flautas (3 cut in halves), 2 street carne asada tacos, and carne asada fries, 2 drinks and a beer...that's too pricey for me for mexican food. And I am mexican! We definitely will not be back. Especially since we didn't feel welcomed AT ALL!"}
{"text":"My fav go to please for tacos and a fun vibe. Great margaritas, too- especially the Blood Orange. Javier is always welcoming! Love the carnitas, carne asada and huge tostadas! Keep up the good work! Love supporting local chefs and owners."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food did not have any wow factor..to be honest I could have saved money and had Roberto's for a better time..tacos el Gordo is a far better taco spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about pinches tacos I decided to meet up with my friend to check out the hype! We arrived during happy hour and I was greeted with tequila shots and tons of micheladas! We ordered adobaba, Asad, and pollo tacos which were amazing. The bar had excellent service and the food was incredible! I will definitely be back to this establishment!"}
{"text":"This has so far been my favorite food in Vegas!  I travel to Las Vegas all the time and so far, I've never personally been wowed by the food. As a vegetarian, there wasn't much for me at any of the meaty buffets Vegas is known for. So to my delight I found some fantastic Mexican food for really cheap here! The tortillas are all homemade, and all the vegetarian options were DELICIOUS (Which is not always easy to find). The must have item would definitely be the Mexican corn. Also would recommend the chilequiles and huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is ok and the service was great. We went on a Tuesday night and they had a promotion going on, we got a free beer with our meal. The staff was extremely friendly and pleasing to look at. Keep up the great work and we will def be back again to grab a meal!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the freshest and most delicious Mexican places I've had in a very long time. I have definitely found a new spot."}
{"text":"Awful! Awful I had a bowl of enchilada sauce for tortilla soup and a salad under my gross cheese enchiladas! Cold taco! This place is garbage! Run!!!!   Nothing family about this place! Gotta puke!"}
{"text":"To be fair, I like the look of Pinches Tacos, but I only had one thing there to eat - Mexican Corn on the Cob.  Perhaps a more in depth review would give me the chance to add another star.  As one of only a handful of places to eat in the Downtown Container Park, Pinches had a shorter line.  But I wasn't particularly going for entrees here since we had some other food already from another eatery.  I did really want to check Pinches out though.  I ended up getting one of the biggest staples you can find on a Mexican menu besides rice, beans, and tortillas.  Corn on the cob!  The Mexican Corn on the Cob from Pinches Tacos was actually not bad, although I prefer mine grilled.  This one looked like it was just boiled or steamed.  It did have the requisite Mexican cream, cheese, and chili powder on it though.  A very good helping of it.  The corn on the cob was a good size as well, enough for two people to munch off of.  Overall taste was good, the sweet corn blended well with the hit of cream and the salty cheese.  The kick from the chili powder was most welcome.  I would definitely have this again the next time I come back to Pinches Tacos.  The thing that took 1/2 star from this review should be no surprise...the price.  Wow, $3.95 plus tax for one corn on the cob?  Seems really high priced for me.  I mean, you can go down to your local Mexican market around town and get the same corn on the cob (in some cases better) for like $2!  There's this Mexican guy I pass by nearly everyday from work who rolls around his little food cart and sells corn on the cob for $2 and his looks just as good as the one from Pinches Tacos.  I must say, the raise in prices must mean the rent at Downtown Container Park can't be cheap.    Hopefully when I feel like braving the parking and the crowds at this park again I'll be able to stop by Pinches Tacos for another taste."}
{"text":"We've been to the new location twice now.   The tortilla soup is excellent! Blood orange margaritas are strong yet yummy. We tried a variety of tacos. Some hits, some misses. The gringo taco, nopales taco and chicken mole taco were all delightful. The beef taquitos are a win too!! The sopes left much to be desired and the rice and beans are subpar.   The atmosphere is awesome and the patio is great! Happy hour is excellent. I can't imagine a better way to spend Saturday evening then a scrumptious margarita and tacos al fresco.   We will definitely return. Again and again I'm sure. The service is warm and friendly.   The first time we went, there was a kids menu...the second time around the server didn't really know what we were talking about. On our first visit, my son got taquitos with rice and beans and a yummy pineapple Agua Fresca. Also, they do not have highchairs. This is a major bummer. They do have booster seats but they aren't appropriate for younger kids (under 2). The straps don't tighten much.   Go check out pinches for casual delicious food!"}
{"text":"This Mexican eatery is located inside Container Park.   I ordered a fish taco, chips & salsa, & chicken quesadilla. They were all excellent. I love their fresh salsa. I also got side order guacamole but it had a kick to it. If you can't do spicy like me just beware. But I ate them anyway.   Not too many sitting are inside so you'll have to sit outside. But they'll bring your food to you."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. I was really excited to try this place as I have yet to find a great taco joint on this side of town. We ordered the three taco combo plate to go. We did not ask for any modifications to them or anything to be left off. I also asked for an extra side of pico de gallo and some extra salsa. The girl working the front was obviously VERY new but for some reason was left without help, so this may have been why our order was so screwed up. However it's no excuse as new employees should be supervised until trained....  We made the mistake of not opening the box to check the order before leaving. All three came totally naked - no toppings, just plain. No slaw, no onions, no cilantro, nothing but meat (and nothing but peppers, onions and eggplant on the veggie taco). The veggie taco was also missing the shiitake mushrooms. The only other topping provided was some sad red sauce on the side. It was a mass produced fully liquid sauce that was the saddest excuse for salsa I've ever seen. Roberto's wouldn't even serve something like that. As a last straw, I got no pico at all, on the tacos or as a side, despite paying for extra.   This is exactly the \"fakexican\" the wall inside warns you about. Ironic."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not amazing. If this is the only decent taco spot in the area, then this must be the price to pay. $3ish for a taco, pricier than most taco spots but this place is in a nice plaza so maybe that's why. I had the asada tacos which the meat could've been more tender. The tortilla tastes homemade and a bit fluffy which is different from other spots."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was awesome, including the decor. Service was really good. The food was authentic Mexican and tasted exceptional. Will definitely be going back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I recommend trying the agua frescas and the carne asada fríes. I like the vibe but I feel like it's definitely over priced. The meat quality isn't that good, and for the prices they charge it could be way better. It's alright if you're in the area, but there's definitely some yummier taco/Mexican places."}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty good, but nothing too exciting. They all have \"edgy\" names, which if you know some Spanish slang, might make you a little uncomfortable ordering in front of your kids.  Prices are decent, rice, beans and chips are really good.  Like every other place in the container park, there's basically zero seating inside. Great to sit on the patio if the weather is good, not so great in December/January.  I'm boosting to 4 stars because I like the container park (gentrification complete!)."}
{"text":"Amazing! Came to pinche tacos on the 31st of Dec. and was greeted by the amazing waiter. He recommended dishes and had a few laughs with us. Ordered tacos, not nachos and burritos and everything was great! So great that we came back 2 days later. Again, we were welcomed by the awesome staff. The food was amazing. The owner even took some shots with us. Random but he was really nice! Great place. Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"We thought this place would be delicious as we were previously told and based on reviewers; however, that was not the case. This place is not good and their meat taste kind of weird. Also over priced."}
{"text":"Didn't really mean to but my friends ended up being those people...  We were THOSE people that came in 10 minutes before Pinches Tacos closed. Now, typically we would understand if the restaurant employees got cranky because hey, they were cleaning up and getting ready to go home. But to our surprise, we got the COMPLETE opposite of that in terms of service.  We were first timers and had heard so much about this place so we were pleased to find the cashier taking the time to talk to us about some of their popular menu items. We also noticed that there were other diners who were talking to the people in the taco line complimenting everything they just ate which only raised our expectations even more.  In the end, we went with the carne asada and the al pastor tacos. I was able to try both and they were good. The portions of the meat and of the salsa were not bad but the tortilla definitely topped it for me!   I didn't have to worry about it ripping because it had a good hold of everything inside, always a plus in my book!  Overall, the food was not bad. The service and the downtown atmosphere will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but damn good pinche tacos! Located at the new container park in downtown Las Vegas. #LoveIt"}
{"text":"Ordered the taco combo plate and a beer. It looks the like prices went up since the original posting of the menu on here. Still reasonable for the area. The tacos were great and the beer was nice and cold. I sat upstairs and was startled by the pyrotechnic mantis.. Wished the restaurant would play the music it was synced to, as salsa / jazz just didn't match up right to the flame spitting statue across the way. The lengua (tongue) tacos were superb. This place is a wonderful addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Located in Container Park, it's the Mexican food option if you have hang out in the Park...  Service: They have some friendly people working the counter and the grill.  They bring your order out to you if you're sitting outside which you most likely will as the seating inside is limited.  They do get the food out in a timely manner which I appreciate.  Food: The 3 taco plates comes to you served on a 3 section styrofoam plate along with rice, beans and some tortilla chips.  The tacos were made with fresh ingredients but unfortunately tasted very bland and lacked flavor.  The beans and rice quality was something you can purchase at your local grocery store.  I think they can do better.  The blood orange margarita was decent and and served in a plastic cup out of a soft drink machine dispenser.  I thought they got my drink order wrong and I was served an orange soda, but all was well.  Value: The 3 Taco plate was about $10 and the Blood Orange Margarita was $8.  I understand there's a premium for the location but the quality of food is lacking even for the premium location.    I like sitting outside in Container Park on a nice days with the crew and would love nothing more than to enjoy that time with good Mexican food.  I'm going to give them another chance because the staff is great and I'll hit up the nachos or burritos next time.  Update coming sooner versus later as I love Container Park and the Downtown area."}
{"text":"Amazing experience and amazing food. Hands down the best Mexican food in Vegas! Service was equally as good! I highly recommend their Flautas! Their potato Flautas are my favorite!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit and it didn't disappoint. I got the Piches Combo, three tacos, beans, rice and chips all for under $10. I tired three different tacos, pollo, asada and fish.AllI were great, can't decide which I liked best. Looking forward to back and trying something new."}
{"text":"Waiting for friends. This is seriously unbelievable. It's 11:36 Saturday morning. There are maybe 8 other customers total. We are expecting 7-8 people. They have a table for 6 ( 2 - 4tops put together). In the sun. And it's really hot. But they said we don't like to put other tables together. Only other option? Share the huge table with the only other guests in the restaurant. Really. We cant just put two together that aren't in the sun and separate the table we're at. It might take 1 minute? Unbelievable start. Already a bad taste in my mouth and I have only ordered drinks. Also we are about to double your business right now. Literally.  So please show some hospitality and grab us a table not in the sun. Thanks a lot.  Food was ok. Service was kinda non existent   Waited over 30 minutes for the check. Someone had to take the check to he manager to pay while our server stood in the back on his phone. Terrible.  Party of 8.  Over $200 for tacos!! Go to CANTINA DORADO instead! Way way better"}
{"text":"I don't get why this place gets such high marks.   Quick and to the point. The location in the Gramercy is nice, but just the fact that it in a very nice and well put together style courtyard with plenty of outside seating and lighting. The actual dining room looks like a mess with tacky graffiti on the walls, a chain link fence in the middle of the dining room for no reason, and a ridiculous looking fake taco truck that really is just taking up space. The food is also nothing to really drive me back to this place. I tried the roasted vegetable burrito, only to have it be 80% filled with coleslaw. I have also tried the tacos and although they aren't horrible, i have certainly have had better on the side of the road out of a taco stand for half the price. I felt like i wasted my money eating here."}
{"text":"I was so excited finding this here in Vegas! After moving from LA to Seattle, I've been in desperate need of authentic (and super affordable) Mexican food and I found my place...in another state. Chicken mole tacos were delicious, carne asada was well seasoned and the carnitas were so tender and juicy. AND THEY HAVE CARNE ASADA FRIES. This place is also located in a really cool part of downtown Vegas so not only was the food amazing, it's also a really cool atmosphere to sit and enjoy good food. Excited to come back!"}
{"text":"Well after reading all the reviews for this place we wanted to try it. The atmosphere of the place was great. I lived the decor. We were greeted right away and seated. I ordered a blood orange margarita and it was awesome. I order the queso and chorizo dip, it was salty didn't care for it so just had the pico de gallo and chips. We got out taco order and the order was all wrong I ordered a fish taco carnitas and carne and didn't get the right order and my friend got the wrong order also. The waitress was dingy and forgot our water and salsa .. The only good part of this dining experience was the margaritas."}
{"text":"Seriously LOVE! I've eaten takeout a few times and have always been satisfied so I finally decided to done in this past Friday night. We sat by the bar and The atmosphere was so fun, the employees were so friendly and it was all around a good time! Some menu favorites are the ceviche, the pastor torta, and the gringo tacos. The blood orange margarita and the horchata are some drink favorites. Love having such a fun place so close to home, I can definitely see myself becoming a regular!!"}
{"text":"\"Real Mexican Food made by Real Mexicans\"  These people must not know about Roberto's.  Food is meh. The rice was very bland. Refried beans left a lot to be desired. Tacos were definitely not worth the price. The chicken one wasn't even seasoned very well. The chicken Flautas, however, were actually pretty good. And the shrimp for the tacos were good, just not enough.  The place is okay but only certain things are worth the price. Best bet: Stick to Roberto's."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends tonight and couldn't believe how bad the customer service was; I'm surprised they have this server representing their establishment on the front line with this kind of service. I work in customer service and in the tipping industry and when you do not provide me with ANY customer service do not expect anything. This server had no personality and messed up the order. Half of the food came out then after 5 minutes one of the appetizers came out. Then found out the other half of the order wasn't even put in to the kitchen so took awhile for my friends to get their food. We also ordered some drinks which never came out. Had to ask more then twice to get a refill as well. 2 of our friends ordered Horchata and our server told them it would be 5 minutes. They never got the drinks, she didn't even offer to get him something else. She did not once apologize for the inconvenience. I have been here a few times and always tell family and friends about how great this place is. This is the first time I have left disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great start to a night of drunken debauchery in Downtown LV. More info on that... never.  Everything here is pricey, and this is coming from the guy who was upset when Taco y Taco raised their prices at their original location from $2.00 to $2.15. It's $2.60 here at the entry level, unless you decide to try the cactus taco (I didn't). I just went ahead and did the $8.95 combination plate for three tacos (chose al pastor, adobada, and lengua) with rice and beans. I'm not quite sure if the chips were part of the deal or if we actually did get them separately for our entire group.  The food is pretty decent. I really did like the rice and beans, especially the beans. I thought the tacos were each okay, maybe the lengua being the best of the bunch. The al pastor did not come with pineapple, which was disappointing. It was also curious that there was only one tortilla per taco, not two as all the truly good places seem to use. They do offer beer, which is about par for the course downtown.  In a Container Park context, this place is most likely a solid choice. But in the Vegas taco scene, it really isn't worth making the centerpiece of your visit."}
{"text":"we ordered the pastor tacos, a carnitas taco and a margarita.  I didn't notice the Margaritas came from a fountain, right next to the register.  If I would've paid more attention, I probably wouldn't have ordered it but oh well, I gotta have something to drink with my Pinches Tacos right?  The Pastor tacos were ok but I've had better at hole in the wall taco shops around Vegas.  Didn't get to try the Carnitas tacos since we only ordered one and my +1 ate it before I could try.  I like the huge menu they had inside.  I wouldn't mind trying the other items on their menu, they also have a \"Gringo\" menu for those who like Ground Beef in their tacos etc...they will bring out the food to your table which is nicer than having to wait around for your name/# to be called."}
{"text":"It might just be the pinches margarita talking, but this food is awesome. Delicious food at decent prices. And there are many vegetarian options as well. Eat here!"}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience and great food. We were there over the weekend and had 3 tacos, 2 mole with pollo and 1 lengua. They where TERRIBLY salty, I was very disappointed and actually won't be coming back"}
{"text":"This is real Mexican food.. Down to the cinnamon horchata, delicious chicken mole and shrimp tacos. They make their own tortillas and they're delish! I found this place on yelp while visiting from L.A. and I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Great burrito! Generous portions. Made with care. Just a great taco stand at the container park!"}
{"text":"Had some business on the west side near Russell and Fort Apache and I was t really craving tacos that's usually just on Tuesday! I ordered the Pinche Combination Plate which you get to choose the type of tacos you want I picked two shrimp and one Asada, which it came with refried beans and Spanish rice. The food was hot and plenty of it, the issue was that the food was very bland and nothing where you have that moment of wow that's a good taco. That moment never came...."}
{"text":"I came in to Pinches Tacos mainly for a taste of the Mexican style streen corn. But I didn't feel right ordering just corn so I got a taco al pastor too.   Long story short, the prices are high and service takes too long.  Short story long, yes, the food here is kind of pricey. $3+ for a small taco. Almost $3 for an ear of corn. And yes, it took a long time to get just a taco and ear of corn. The staff seem to prepare multiple orders before carrying them out to the customers who, in most cases, eat outside. It was getting gusty outside while I waited so I moved inside.  My food came out very shortly after I moved myself inside the restaurant. The al pastor taco came with a goodly amount of pork, a fair bit of onion and cilantro and a healthy laddle of salsa. It was dripping grease and juice. It was a good representation of one of my favorite types of tacos but it was not my favorite version. The house made tortilla was a nice touch though.   The corn was good as Mexican style street corn tends to be. The crisp kernels of sweet corn took nicely to the crema, cheese and chili. I enjoyed it thoroughly though, again, it was not my favorite version of the dish.   For me, the food is fresh and service is friendly. I appreciate both. But the price you pay and the time you wait is disproportionate to what you receive. Another case of a place to check out if you are in the area but not to make a destination of."}
{"text":"After eating at the Container Park location, I was pleased to discover there was this location, much easier, larger interior and more convenient parking.  We ordered grilled fish tacos and tacos de pollo, both were very good. My daughter goes there once or twice a month, it's  one of her favorite spots."}
{"text":"5 stars for Pinches Tacos. Today was a great day to walk around Fremont Street and visit the fun Container Park. There's a variable bevy of stores and Restaurants and having a hankering for Mexican, Pinches Tacos sweet and subtle name was just the ticket.  I ordered the 3 taco plate (chicken) with rice and beans, delicious. Fresh and tasty. My husband got the chicken burrito with rice and beans, he said it was great. The guac and chips were really good, the guacamole was fresh and the texture was just right. The friends we were with got taqitos and fish tacos, which they commented were very good, as well.  Service was friendly and accommodating, the place was clean and organized. They find you seated outside and bring you the food.  Bill for us was $25 and change. I'll be visiting Pinches Tacos again."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere, great food and unbelievably good service! I went with my entire family of five last night had tons of food, The Carne Asada fries almost every taco on the menu, and some of the fabulous Mexican corn. The service was impeccable they even thought ahead and brought me to go stuff for my hot sauce when I was packing up the leftovers because even with five people we could not eat all of the food."}
{"text":"Went to this location a few weeks ago with my wife. Staff was super friendly and space was nicely decorated. Also very easy to access from the 215. The tacos were street size, ie fit in the palm of the hand, but we're very flavorful. The fish taco and the carne asada were great. They also have a Taco Tuesday where the regular tacos are $2 all day! I will be back on a monthly basis and recommend you give this place a try. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed and I really wanted to like this place.  I had the carnitas tacos and the meat had almost no flavor, same for the tortillas which completely fall apart as soon as I picked up the taco.  The beans and rice were just OK. The service and atmosphere were decent, but so what if the food is bland."}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS!! You can tell it's fresh. My friend and I ended up here on a happy accident and both loved our meals! I got the Huevos Rancheros and she got the Chilaquiles. Equally amazing. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing Pinches tacos for a while now and decided today was the day to give it a try. I went to the Gramercy location which the parking lot is crazy packed! After entering Pinches i was greeted immediately by the gentleman behind the counter who informed me to take a menu and order with him at the counter when ready. The ordering station is shapes like a food truck! Very creative! The tables surrounding me look very colorful and appear to have a rustic antique look. This place has a very homie feeling. I selected the chicken enchilada combo plate with red sauce. The sauce was a bit sweet tasting and very delicious. I even elected for a glass of wine which perfectly complimented my meal. It's so hard to find good Mexican food these days and at a decent price. I must admit I cleaned my plate completely, it was that good! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the food, and the decor! If you've had the food downtown, it's just as good here.   I had the 3 taco combination with chicken, steak and pork. This also comes with beans, rice and some chips. Plus a Mexican Coke. If you're in the mood for a good street style taco, this is the place to go. They are small, so ordering just 1 won't be enough."}
{"text":"We were shopping in the area, and checked on Yelp for a good taco/burrito place. This place sounded great.  Inside, there was a small area to stand. There were about 5 tables, but two of them were in front of the kitchen, and along the wall where people would stand to place their order. One of the tables off to the side was rather large, and could fit about 8 people. Luckily, there were a lot of tables outside, and one with an umbrella opened up while we were waiting.   I ordered the taco al pastor, while my husband got one as well and a taco carnitas. With a drink, the total came to just over $11. The fountain drinks are rather expensive at $2.75.   When the tacos arrived, I think that we were both a bit surprised at their size. They were about 4-inches in diameter. They looked really good though, and came with a lime wedge. We dug in, and the flavor was really good. Nice chunks of seasoned meat, with fresh cilantro, salsa and onions. The tortillas were also very flavorful.  It was fun sitting outside and watching everything that was happening around us.  I don't eat very much, but next time I would need to order 2 tacos, and my husband would get at least 3. Might try a burrito next time."}
{"text":"I'd take a real taco truck or robertos over this place. The service was schizophrenic and the food was basic. The cost high.  The staff is confused. Everything was in the form of a question \"Did you order this or that?\" \"What did you order again?\" \"Whats your name?\" ( why does it matter)Despite these questions the orders came out late and  incorrect.   It took too long for follow up. Waitress didn't even know the tequila menu. Asked what my price range was (tasteless)  The waitress screwed up our bill 4 times.  Mixing other tables with ours.  Also put generic items on the bill (seems deceptive and even fraudulent)  Don't buy into the hype. There are far better places in terms of service, quality and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week and always enjoy myself. Delicious and fresh food. friendly and hilarious staff. Things to try: the corn is bomb, tortilla soup is out of this world and the potato taquitos are life changing. Yummmm"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food? Are you kidding me? The fish tacos had no flavor, they use canned refried beans & the customer service is definitely not what it should be.  Container Park is really cool & deserves a better Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't stay far from this eatery, so on a Friday night it was a must try. I am so glad that I tried this place because the food was delicious!   I liked the open seating and the unique customizations all throughout the restaurant.  I also like the friendly staff and the delicious food."}
{"text":"I thought it was just ok. I expected it to be more like Gordos and I liked the 3 taco combo idea. The meat was a bit dry and tough to eat though so it was a bit of a disappointment. I ordered the carne, pastor and pollo in my combo with rice only. I did like the chicken which was moist but other than that it was just ok. We had ordered to go on a Saturday for lunch and there was no one there. I'm not sure that's a good sign. In fact they brought my food out 5 minutes later and so I left. Only to realize that I only had the burrito that my husband ordered and not my tacos...why they didn't tell me who knows?! So I had to drive back to get my tacos which were on the way to being soggy.   My husband wasn't impressed with his burrito that was 10 bucks either. He complained there wasn't enough meat for the cost. Overall I thought it was decent but it's definitely not my favorite place to get some tacos!"}
{"text":"Went with a group pf friends around 10 pm, we order a bunch of different thing so we could share. Er ordered the bean sope, potato flautas, pastor taco, fish taco & shrimp taco; they were all pretty bland. The margarita was super sweet and not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Los tacos eran extremadamente delicioso y los servidores fueron muy atentos. Una comida sencilla [for this gringo]... pero la noche fabulosa."}
{"text":"I can easily say I've found my new favorite taco joint. I had been eyeing this place up for a while now and I'm so glad I finally stopped in for happy hour. They have a daily happy hour from 3-7pm which includes $2 tacos and $4 drinks. Not all tacos are included on happy hour though so be sure to ask your server before you order. My favorite tacos we had were their gringo tacos which includes shredded beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle sauce in a hard taco shell. They were absolutely fantastic!!! So glad our server recommended them because they weren't on the menu (except for briefly being mentioned as a possible upgrade on the taco plate combo). Also, if you love spicy hot sauce, ask your server for a side of the habanero sauce. It was so tasty! Looking forward to trying this place again in the future. Everything on their menu sounds delicious so I must try it all!"}
{"text":"Great service but the food is very bland. Shared the taco plate (shrimp, lengua, and carnitas) and chicken flautas. Many components of the dishes we had needed more depth. The rice and beans were completely uneventful. The carnitas tasted like absolutely nothing. The taco plate came with some salsa that was fresh tasting but could have had more of a kick to it. The flautas were decent as the chicken was seasoned and it came with a smoky/chipotle sauce to dip it in. They were so busy, I felt bad asking them for hot sauce since they don't have it out for easy access. The location is great but I recommend a hole in the wall taco shop for \"real Mexican food made by real Mexicans\" which they boast on the outside of their establishment."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last minute to pick up food and it was poppin' on Friday night with a young crowd.  The food is okay, I mean it's just the super commercialized style Mexican food. I've had pinches tacos in Cali and wasn't fond of it then so wasn't expecting too much."}
{"text":"I asked for shredded beef tacos and got rolls tacos. The waiter said I should have asked for the gringo tacos since its the same thing as shredded beef tacos.. humm. I also got the corn on crack from the waiters suggestion as well as the watermelon beverage. The corn on crack was drowning in fake butter,  cheese and chile powder. ... No one at my table would touch it because it smelt and looked gross.  The burritos looked good and folks at my table were satisfied which is why I gave 3 stars. I loved the watermelon beverage! This place has a great name, located in a great park, decent service and ok food."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's family owned and operated, everyone is always friendly. Great food! Love the chorizo queso and the blood orange margarita is very popular here. The elote is ! Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Really good chips and freshly made tacos! Great find in container park !"}
{"text":"This is basically only for the elote aka Mexican corn on the cob.  After beer fest we came to container park, to sober up basically, haha. I saw some lady with an elote so I came here, and waited almost 20mins in the line.  The price is 3.95, which to me is a little steep. The corn itself seems steamed, and I'm used to the grilled or boiled. It was prepared with your traditional fixings.. I think... mayo, cheese, and chile. To me the taste was super bland and for the price it was not worth it at all.   It may be because I'm used to the legit eloteros, they slather it with high cholesterol! I mean, butter, mayo, queso, and some tajin. This place fell hella short... the 2 stars is again based off the corn.  Customer service is just ok, the guy gave me crap about the part of Mexico I'm from and I wanted to show him what we do to people who run their lip in my area :)  I may come back to try their other offerings... or I can just go to my kitchen and make it myself, but it will actually be delicious."}
{"text":"Pinche is right my friend, can you say TOURIST TRAP?! Came in here for some tacos and an Eloté, was appalled by their prices for everything. $5.25 for two small taquitos ten dollars for two taco plate.  We went with the Eloté which is Mexican corn. The corn tasted old. It was slathered in some strange sauce, covered in a weird cheese with no additional flavor. I struggled through it and immediately regretted coming here. Never again, & I hope you don't make the same mistake we did."}
{"text":"I just had the potato & cheese flautas. They're so satisfying. And the salsa roja & guacamole add great flavor. This little corner of Container Park es muy bien!"}
{"text":"Pienche Terrible, servers barley speak English, you have to ask for sauces, limes etc 2 or 3 times before they remember or maybe they don't understand what you are asking for. Food is mediocre at best. Everything had a bland taste. the plates, forks etc all mix matched and were dollar store quality.. and at $4 a taco I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Let's face it the availability of true authentic Mexican taco places on the SW side are barren. You're pretty much looking at Taco Bell, Roberto's, and other Americanized places. Sad to say I'd include this one as an in between.  Service: it used to be so inviting coming here with the manager always walking by seeing how the food was but on our last visit he was just behind the register and dedicated to a big group by the bar instead. As for everyone else it's whatever, they just bring you your food and that's that. Previously you sat at your table to order now it's done fat burger style by ordering and they'll bring it to your table.  Food: I like the odd meats like tripe and my all time favorite lengua which they have here. The food is pretty good and I recommend getting the taco plate. Nothing mind blowing about the food but it is good.  Overall: this place has a weird vibe. It tries to be authentic yet seems really Americanized and gimmicky. Not as strong as when they first opened"}
{"text":"Wow! Finally some REAL home made Mexican food!!! Had the chicken mole taco and the grilled chicken tacos too! Both were full of flavor and tasted great! The rice and beans were fresh and tasted great! Pricing was decent for 3 tacos, rice and beans 10.00. Place is a good size and very colorful atmosphere! Staff and service was great as well! I will be visiting this place often! Keep up the great work! The only negative about this place is that the food is too healthy! I was starving an hour later!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken flauta, potato/manchego flauta,  tortilla soup, queso dip, veggie taco, pollo mole taco, adada taco, carnitas taco, alpastor taco... LOVED IT ALL. Super fun decor and great vibe. And I can't believe the reasonable prices for great quality of food. Every single employee was warm and welcoming"}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos: Mexican food made by real Mexicans.   The food is overpriced and fair at best. $15 and change for 3 small tacos,a side of bean and rice, and a beer.   Container Park is scenic and interesting. It is definitely yuppie, but that doesn't mean the food has to be mediocre. Expected more."}
{"text":"Who cares if it's hard to find, who cares if it's slow. It's new! What do you expect. Not one person in when we walked in. Didn't change the food. Started with a full flavored michilada, and a fresh agua de Sandia (watermelon juice). I got the taquitos and made it a meal. He got the chilaqiueles. We shared a corn. We were pleasantly amazed with every bite. We are grown and raised by Mexican families and I will say the one major difference is the portions. They are quite a bit smaller then the tragical Mexican plate which is perfect tho!!!! You can try more things and don't feel bad cause you can't finish it all. Yum yum yum. What a surprise. We will be back."}
{"text":"Coming for my first time to Downtown Container Park, my sister was taking me out for a fun day together, shopping and eating. We walked into Pinches Tacos, and I noticed how many people were out on the patios happily eating and watching their kids play on the playground. As far as I could see, Pinches Tacos was the food of choice amongst the people eating, so we decided to start here.   ATMOSPHERE Walking in, the decor is interesting: pink walls with dancing skeletons. It wasn't creepy, but it was more of a culture-happy vibe. It made me a bit excited to try what was on their menu.   SERVICE The lady behind the counter was helpful, very knowledgable about the menu and very laidback, in a good way. She let my sister and I try the blood orange margarita, and while we were doing so, the owner Javier came in a greeted his workers in a friendly manner. Then he jumped into our conversation out of the blue, which actually took us by surprise, but he was actually pretty fun! We took shots ON THE HOUSE from (and with) Javier. Definitely a great experience xD   FOOD:  SHRIMP TACO WITH COLESLAW, the shrimp is plump and juicy, with good seasoning. The coleslaw however is okay. Nothing to write home about, but I would order this again for the shrimp. At $3.15 it is a bit pricey, but service made it taste better.  MEXICAN CORN ON THE COB, with everything, it was delicious. Lots of cheese,  crema and seasonings. With hot sauce, it was just the way I had it on a beach in Cali. Yes, again this was probably a little pricey to, but it refreshing and with the free shot, it was worth the few bucks!   BLOOD ORANGE MARGARITA, fruity, just the right amount of ice and the margarita mix is strong but delicious  Overall, I had a fun and welcoming experience. It was my favorite part of my first experience of Downtown Container Park!"}
{"text":"Located in the Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas, this very authentic taco shop has the best margaritas in the downtown are, they even serve them in a to go cup (hey this is Las Vegas after all) I didn't have anything to eat but it looked and smelled great so what could possibly go wrong if you give it a try? Nothing, that's what. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I read a lot of the reviewed and was stoked to come here. But I was highly disappointed. The al pastor was super dry. The hand made tortilla did not taste good at all. The only thing that was good was the corn with everything."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long time!!! Everything was amazing !! I can't wait to return ! Try the Corn on the Cob!"}
{"text":"Yum! A group of four of us stopped here while we were doing a downtown food crawl and we all really loved the food.   I love their location inside of Container Park. There are several tables inside next to the kitchen and more seating on a deck outside as well. It's a great spot to enjoy tacos on a nice day.   The street tacos were so good. I was in love at first bite with my carnitas taco. The tortilla was freshly made and definitely not a packaged product. On top of the tender carnitas there was plenty of pico, cilantro, and onion. We also enjoyed taquitos that were served with plenty of delicious guacamole. They won my heart with the street taco, but the rest of the group was won over with the taquitos.   For Container Park I thought their pricing was very reasonable. The tacos are only $2/$3 a piece which I thought was inexpensive."}
{"text":"I like this place! It really is just like the Mexican food that my Hispanic neighbors and friends would make back home in California. It's kind of expensive for what you get. The roasted chicken tacos were really good and the horchata was good too. Only 3 stars because the price is so high for what you get."}
{"text":"I dont know what took us so long to go to Pinches. Four of us went, chips & guacamole, 16 tacos, 10 drinks, and $100 bill during happy hour. Great deal!! The tacos were very good, we had El Pastor, gringo, vegetarian, roasted chicken, can't remember what else. We also had margaritas & beer. Great value, good service, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"If you have more that 15 people in your party they do not want your business and the manager was very adamant about that with me.  On Tuesday, a group of us went to have dinner together, we started at 15 people and would up being 25 plus.  We did not care about having to stand and eat; it was all about being together.  We were at 5 long tables, long counter and 1 separate table.   Instated of turning 3 other tables, the staff decided to seat other people who had to have our group hover other them.  (Hope they enjoyed all of our conversations)    I ordered food at 6:35pm and at 7:15 after watching other people be served and I asked where our food was.  I was told that it would be out shortly... Next I was asked for our orders again and the server said they are working on it.  At 7:35pm we got our food and another server said, you just ordered at 7:15 so that was quick service, then found out that there computer lost order and so what, you got your food is what I was told.  I spoke to manager Francisco who was just not in the customer service mood and told me, that his sit down restaurant ( and this is not a real sit down restaurant as all food orders are placed at a counter and servers bring food out to you) did serve me quickly and defended the 7:15 pm order placement. That blew up in his face when I showed him my credit card charge at 6:35pm.  His response to me was we that cannot be the right time for your order.  Again, he was not customer service friendly and the said I don't want you large party business and was very adamant about that.   I surely will not be going back to this place and will share this experience with all my friends."}
{"text":"Came back twice in a 2 day period.  This is real Mexican food, they know how to make authentic delicious tacos.  Staff was super friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious. I highly recommend it. As a Mexican myself I'm very picky when it comes to authentic Mexican food.  We orders the carne asada fries. Bomb . The staff is very welcoming. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've in the mood to give this place 5 stars based on food, service, and atmosphere.   The people here are super duper friendly. You get the feeling that they know everyone that walks in the door. It's like a Cheers for a lot of people apparently. I'm lucky enough to work so close by! I've already been here twice in the past couple days.   Their vegan options are really good. You can either get Nopal (cactus) or Veggie (sauteed veggies), which have amazing eggplant in it, as the substance in your taco burrito. Rice and beans are delicious as well...and don't get me started on the chips: super crunchy with the perfect amount of salt.   I would suggest coming here and starting out with a combo plate of a couple different types of tacos to get a taste. Don't forget to check out the specials board!  The atmosphere is awesome. The walls are covered with graffiti, Loteria stuff, and Dio de los muertos stuff. We opted for the \"car seat\" chair in the bar area. They are so comfortable; you won't want to leave. I haven't had the pleasure of dining at the bar yet, but that's next on the list. This place would be great for a party or happy hour location."}
{"text":"Came here on Halloween night, it was pretty busy! But the staff was friendly and fast paced so it wasn't much of a wait for our food. I think their menu could use a little touch up because it's kind of faded, but it's still legible! My boyfriend and I got an order of Carne Asada Fries, corn on the cob and two margaritas. The fries were sooo good. The portion size was very generous. For me the fries were a little too crispy but I didn't care too much because everything else on the plate with it was too good!  The corn on the cob was yummy. I've never tried corn with all those toppings but the flavors worked perfectly. I'll be getting it again the next time I come in!  The margaritas were really strong. But I liked it. So no complaints there :). They were fairly filling despite the fact that the cup looks like it isn't holding much!  If you're in downtown container park, I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food was delicious. I got the carne asada fries. Super huge upgrade from Robertos and only about $2 more. I really loved the service."}
{"text":"Nice and clean atmosphere is great. Food is good needed a little more salt. Great customer service! I got the al pastor torta it was good."}
{"text":"This place was A-OK. OK? I ordered carne asada, al pastor and some other taco from their 3 taco combo meal. I didn't mind the atmosphere and I thought ordering from the food truck was kinda tacky. But w/e.   Considering the hype around this place, I expected this to be El Gordo or Taco Y Taco quality, but it was more on the average side. If your business has \"tacos\" in the name, I will weigh my overall review on tacos.   For the price, meh. They also charged me $3 for 12oz of horchata, the hell? I might give this place another try, but with other taco shops in the area, it will probably be later rather than sooner."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early lunch at Pinches Tacos . It was outstanding! The food was delicious, I highly recommend the Not Nachos, and the employees were helpful and extremely friendly. If we are ever in this area again, we will for sure be returning to this fabulous little spot!"}
{"text":"A Friday afternoon lunch by myself away from work landed me at Pinches.  I had heard and read the upheaval regarding the name of this establishment and needed to stop by at least once to see it in person. It is in the Container Park, which was nice enough, but considering I was on a lunch break and I just wanted to eat I was pleased to see there was not much of a line outside PInches (which, by the way - does not have its actual NAME on the restaurant).  The place is cramped, to put it lightly. However, the menu board is bright with neon colors chalked on. Select from tacos (of course), burritos, and even Mexican breakfast items. I will be back for you chilaquiles.  You walk up the line and finally get to the cash register and are unceremoniously cramped against people attempting to get to the ONLY soda fountain in the entire place. The place is just entirely too small. But, I ordered an al pastor burrito, with no cilantro, and a small drink, made my way out of the cluster-F of people and sat at one of the two tables they have to the side inside the restaurant.   Al pastor burrito - comes with meat, beans, salsa, and rice. Meat was not super tasty the way al pastor should be. I was disappointed. Taco y Taco has better al pastor by a long shot. However, burrito was nicely done, ingredients dispersed. You get what you get - and guess what? This place is in a touristy destination, it's a tiny place, and you can't see the meat they're using rotating beautifully, being sliced before your eyes. So - there ya go.   It is not bad, nor is it great. There are plenty of places around town you can get AMAZING food like this (and probably for less). I would suggest one of the many places on Charleston Blvd.  Anyway, I'll probably be back during another of my lunch breaks for the chilaquiles. If those are any good, the review may change."}
{"text":"This place has stepped down a notch from when they originally opened.  Food is okay. Service is not great but not unfriendly.  The blood orange margaritas are good.  Menu is fun and simple.  My first experience the food was great.  Its authentic and the seasonings were well combined. The plate isn't dished heavy enough for my taste.  Meaning a small scoop of rice and your meat on the plate.  No garnishes, side nibblings were fried tortia chips.  It was good though.     My second visit the food was not satisfying. The carne asada was all meat flavored.  It was not seasoned or marinaded enough.  Again, the rice was a scoop.  Not enough cheese or sour cream and quacamole on the plate which I had to order as an add on.  The salsa was watery and basically made like tabasco sauce style.  The side fried tortia chips wete a headcount of 5.  My Kiddos' dishes were put together like a school cafeteria lunch - no heart in it.  Their fries were barely salted with small over cooked broken fries.  Our food was served at our table but we had to ask for ketchup, for more hot sause salsa, and napkins.  I won't be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is in the container park downtown Vegas.  The chicken tostada was amazing - maybe the best one I've ever had.  Delicious!   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay tacos. I had al pastor and the carnitas. Pretty plain and basic. I was hoping for more but after the hot dog I had next door it was amazing. They have another location and it was better there."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!! The elote loco was dreamy!! The chicken quesadillas were packed with ingredients and flavored so much so that my picky kids finished them off in one seating! And the tacos were insanely delicious , my husband is very picky when it comes to tacos since he compares them to tacos from his hometown in California but he was very satisfied. We'll definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about Pinches Tacos is the atmosphere, the customer service, and how it's decorated. The food was boring and flavorless.   My sister ordered a watermelon drink. She asked for two tacos de asada and two de adobada, but she got three tacos. The waiter wasn't good with listening. She said her tacos were boring. The meat was stale and had no flavor to it. By the way, we're Mexican so, we know about flavor and we were just disappointed of how their flavor of food tasted like.  As for me, I ordered horchata, Mexican corn on the cob, and a chicken burrito. The horchata was delicious. The Mexican corn on the cob was okay, it wasn't the best- I couldn't really taste anything. The Mexican sour cream wasn't popping. The chile powder wasn't spicy. The cheese wasn't popping as well. As for my chicken burrito, it was boring and flavorless too; It included red rice, beans, and guacamole. The guacamole was probably the only thing I could taste. I don't understand how this place has high ratings, I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Second (and last) year I had a bunch of people (20-30 people) meet there for my birthday. Last year, it was great. Service was 125% better than I could have imagined or asked for. I was super thankful for what you guys did.   However, this year wasn't quite the same experience. We were asked to sit outside in the court yard (not on their property) because they didn't have the room because it was \"taco Tuesday\". Cool, I'm more than happy to help out because in the past, I have gotten great service and the weather was nice so it wasn't an unreasonable request. However, I went up to the bar three times and every time I was waiting to order food and drinks, I listened to one (of the three) bartenders we were dealing with complaining rudely about \"the big party in the courtyard\" and using profanity in reference about us (\"this is fucking annoying\", \"why can't all these fucking people go away\" are some of the gems I heard).They had no idea why we were there (for my birthday) but they complained openly about us amongst each other right in front of us. Since at least 20 of the 30 people in our party work at the same major strip property in the service industry, we make it a point to be respectful and tip well. I even put all the tables together myself (since it was in the court yard I felt I shouldn't ask anyone to do it for me), because I get that they were busy and I had a large party with me.   Every single person was a huge fan of the food, but almost all of them complained about the bartenders attitude. It was super off-putting for me. Last year, my bill was about $35 and we tipped close to the same amount (for two people, not the entire party) and this year, my bill was $46 for seven tacos and two drinks. My girlfriend only tipped $7 and I think that was probably $3 too much for the bad attitudes we all received. Like I mentioned, we had anywhere from 25-30 people there and the checks were averaging $20-$30 per two people. So roughly, $375 in food and drinks, and we all heard the constant complaints about us like we weren't standing right in front of the s I was pretty embarrassed I was dead set on having people come there a second year in a row due to how the bar tenders treated us. I'll be super clear about this...we did NOT have any dealings with anyone INSIDE. Only three  female bartenders (one had large gauges if the owners care to read this) outside.   Anyway, the as mentioned before the food was great and the gringo tacos were as good as ever. I just won't ever order an alcoholic beverage or go to the bar ever again. Next year, I will find a new taco place to have a get together for my birthday because the bartenders made it clear to us that have no interest in helping anyone unless they want one drink and to leave right away.   Bottom line is, if you are looking to have a group event here, I would steer clear. But if you and one other person are looking for some pretty good food, this wouldn't be a bad option.  I probably won't be back for awhile because I am embarrassed for asking my friends and family to come here, but I love the gringo taco so I know I'll eat there again at some point.   Hope this review helps."}
{"text":"I don't think you can fully appreciate the funky vibe of this place unless you pay a visit, either for happy hour 4-7 p.m. ( and all night Sunday and Monday) or, as we did, for dinner.  It was like being in a Mexican shrine for Day of the Dead, including skeleton-themed fabric headrests on the booths.  So cool!  As a Mexicophile, I truly appreciated the ambience, as well as the latin music - heavy on the Mexican, but with some Shakira and cumbia thrown in.  I couldn't stop dancing, even before the Riesling I had to go with my meal.    Our waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu, but he was helped along by Vernesa, who did.  I ordered the taco platter, choosing the chicken mole, marinated pork, and the fish.  Two of the three were winners:  the chicken mole taco was outstanding and the pork was very good.  The fish wasn't.  I could have ordered it grilled, but took Vernesa's suggestion and went with the default - fried.  There was almost no fish in that taco, and the pitiful amount turned out to be breading rather than fish.  The Veracruz coleslaw that was the taco-mate of the fish was tasteless.  I didn't complain about it until I was asked, and I'm very disappointed that not only wasn't it comped, I was still charged the \"seafood surcharge.\" Only 50 cents, but I think that if a customer says there was no fish in the fish taco, management shouldn't add insult to injury by charging more.  My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas.  It was a picture-perfect, beautiful plate of food, and he enjoyed it.  Our friend had a pork burrito and liked that, too.  We all loved the plate of chips, guac, and fresh pico de gallo we were served at the beginning.  Those chips might be the best I've ever had!  I found the alcohol surprisingly pricey, not across the board, but for some of the offerings.  The bar seems to be a work in progress and opened after the restaurant did.  The bartender brought me a taste of the one Riesling they had, a label I'd never heard of - 14 Hands.  Terrific, and not overpriced.  All of the staff were so friendly that it was a pleasure.  Had it not been for my fish taco experience and, at the end, me being greatly insulted by our waiter in his inept attempt to be friendly (and I'm still upset), this would have been a 5-star review."}
{"text":"I love the fact that Pinches Tacos has Elote ( Mexican Corn ) . It's a corn on the cob smothered with mayo, cheese , and hot spices. It doesn't sound like the healthiest thing in the world but It is a favorite of mine that isn't sold at a lot of Mexican restaurants. Whenever a place carries this dish I automatically add an extra star...(if it is good.) The Elote is wonderful here!.   I ordered the beef flautas as my main entree . These were also delicious! They were a good size and it was filling.   They have a nice patio for dining but we were lucky enough to find seats inside. The reason I say that is because there isn't a lot of  tables inside so I felt lucky to get one. It's a nice place to grab a bite to eat and people watch."}
{"text":"Had a short break for work, so I decided while I'm in the Container Park I'll give this place a shot. Didn't have much time so I called ahead and placed an order for the Al Pastor Burrito. I arrived at Pinches Tacos 30-40 minutes later to find out my order was never made. Very disappointing. My food was ready about 10 minutes later. The burrito was decent sized, and came with a side order of tortilla chips. I think the situation warranted a free beer, but I was too hungry to complain. The burrito was pretty good! Definitely gets the job done while you're visiting the park. Prices are average, and the menu had a big selection. However, if you're looking for the best burritos in town, I highly recommend Cardenas."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm easily pleased when it comes to Mexican food, or if this place is really that good... I'm going to say that it really is that good for the three main reasons that makes any restaurant good:  1) The food - it's not good, it's GREAT. I've only been here twice and both times I had a burrito instead of tacos. I had one of the pork and the asada (beef). It was very more-ish! In my opinion, the perfect size for a burrito so you're not left with a heavy brick in your belly and carb crash shortly after. It comes with a side of chips and salsa with just the right amount of kick.  2) The service was friendly and fast. The first time I was there, it was for a late lunch and the food was out in about 5 minutes. The second time I was there, it was during peak lunch time and there was a line that quickly moved, the food arrived at our table between 5-10 minutes. Both times, the people behind the counters were friendly, approachable and gave good guidance in what to order.  3) The atmosphere was relaxed and it was the perfect outdoor lunch during a warm winter day. There's seating inside and outside, I sat outside on the patio where there were ample tables, chairs and heaters. With the warm (not hot) winter sun kissing my skin and my burritos, I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. I will say that the inside seating was a little sparse, due to the size of the stores in the Container Park, but I believe they made good use of the space that they had.  I'll be eating my way through their menu in the coming months... or maybe weeks... ok, honestly, it'll probably be days :)"}
{"text":"This was a nice place to grab a drink and some food. Careful though that bill racks up quickly.  It seemed a bit pricey to me. Bummer, because it's a great atmosphere and has a bar and tacos, would be a good fun casual place to visit more often  it cost a little less.  The food was pretty good. Our experience had slow service,  I showed up 30 minutes before happy hour ended and had hoped to squeeze in 2 drinks but we just didn't get service in time.  Anyway overall it was good I would still come back from time to time. I wouldn't call it the best mexican food around, but not bad at all."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a million stars, I would. The tacos were amazing! The fish taco was VERY lightly fried and flaky and fresh. The shrimp taco was bursting with flavor! Nothing we tried was bad, and the service was AMAZING. The owner greeted us at the door and stopped by after the meal to see how everything was. This is definitely going to be a staple in our restaurant cycle!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat inside container park.  Here's what you do.  1. Check the music listing. On Friday and Saturdays they have live music at container park starting at 5pm 2. Get a happy hour beer at bin702 sit by the stage 3. Get pinch tacos and eat down front by the stage. The taco plate is 9.5 but it's lame cause you have to pay extra .50 per taco for carne asada...not sure why. I like the potato flautas for 5.5. Comes with guacamole. 4. They will bring your food to you.   Excellent experience we do this at least once a month"}
{"text":"The food isn't all that great. Who serves sopes without queso fresco anyway?!?! However, if you want to pay $4 for corn, it's the perfect place."}
{"text":"This was our first time to container park. Heard so much about this place so had to try it. We don't eat meat, but that wasn't a problem here. We got the fish burrito, which came with chips and salsa. The burrito was pretty good.  My favorite part was the corn!! It was soooo goood!!!! Best corn I've ever had!   The only downside was the long line. My husband stood in line forever and the food took a while to get there. The menu was also a bit hard to read. Overall,  awesome place."}
{"text":"We had already had burger and loaded Fries elsewhere. But visiting the Container Park and noticing Pinches sign for Asada Fries, we couldn't resist!  They start with seriously awesome fries - these things are perfectly crispy and seasoned. Then they're covered in cheese, beans, salsa, guac, sour cream and, of course, carne Asada. They really load them up so every bite is full and flavorful!  We will definitely be back to try more here!"}
{"text":"We are locals and frequent the container park often. Went here today with a big group of friends and decided to try someplace new. My husband ordered the carne asada tacos. Order came out wrong, but my husband was hungry so he didn't say anything. The older man that served our food rudely insisted that's what he ordered.... It wasn't. Anyways, he then goes to scoop up the metal stands with table numbers(a few at the table), knocks them over, and they ALL fall onto my husband plate. Like food all over the table. Big mess. Gross metal signs in the food. Our entire table was kinda surprised that he proceeded to scoop them up off my husbands food, say \"I meant to do that\", and then walk off. Um, ok. Luckily it wasn't my plate cuz I definitely wouldnt have wanted to eat that. Anyways, lost future business from us, plus our friends that saw the incident were majorly turned off. Shocked that this is a family owned business. You think they'd realize how important customer service is. Anyways, there's way better places to eat at the container park. I recommend the Perch( super customer service and great food!) and highly recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"When I show up to a typical Mexican food joint, if I see carnitas in the menu, you've already got my attention.   But Pinches' has an unfair advantage: they serve beer. Another unfair advantage is that Pinches is located inside Container Park(an awesome atmosphere with live music usually playing 90% of the time), but one of the big reasons I give this place a five stars, is their serving system seems to be nearly perfect. This is my third visit, the first time being given a wrong order, but a mere SECONDS later, the correct food was on our table(nothing worse than being hungry and seeing someone else's food) and we were chowing down.  I like my burrito made a certain way and they served it up exactly how I like it with no guff. Great food. Great atmosphere. Beer. How can you go wrong?   With Taco y Taco and Roberto's in town, it's nice to try excellent burritos and fish tacos with great flavor. This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the Gringo tacos.   Great prices. Food is reasonably priced and decent specials for Cinco de Mayo.  Great service. Bartenders were friendly and attentive, even on an especially busy day.   Great place.  Place has a California-bar vibe. Bar opening up to the outside patio is a nice touch.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a bang for your buck THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!!!! Yes everything is homemade, so if you are looking for a homemade LIGHT SNACK then yes go to this place. I feel like everything in this kind of \"uppy\" place is over priced & you don't get much food. You are better off just going off the strip for some real food!!  (The pic I'm showing is the 3 taco meal, cost $10.75 & you could get this same meal for $4 any other place/I waited 45 mins for it also)"}
{"text":"I love Pinches Tacos because it hasn't failed to be amazing! From service to quality of food! It's always a good spot for that quick taco fix, you can order in or take out. It's not a large spot but it can hold it down. I've never been here when it's been really packed, I've always been able to find a table without a wait.   I recommend ordering a taco platter because you get 3 tacos of choice with rice & beans. It's a great choice when you want to try new tacos.   I've have the carne asada fries and it was delicious! I think anything on the menu is delicious! It's just a cute restaurant, it's vibrant always friendly service and quality of food is always great!   The elote is good, it's oily and messy to eat but if you're craving it and you're ok with being a little messy then it's all for you!"}
{"text":"I've been watching this place under construction for the past couple of months just waiting for them to open.  I caught the soft opening yesterday afternoon.  I was able to try the al pastor and el gringo tacos.  The el gringo is a specialty taco created by one of the Anaya brothers, Javier.  The flavor profile on el gingo is like no other.  Simply put, AMAZING!!!  So good in fact I brought my whole family back at 5 when they opened up with the full menu.  We did a nice tour of the menu.  We had the cheese quesadilla, asada quesadilla, asada fries, pollo mole taco, adobada taco, another gringo taco, the potato and manchego cheese flautas (AMAZING), and one of my wife's favorites the street corn on the cob.  To top it all off I came back again this morning to try their chilaquiles for breakfast.  It's about time we have a great authentic Mexican restaurant up here in the southwest part of Las Vegas.  They're located at the Gramercy on Russell between Fort Apache and the 215.  Come check it out and treat your palate!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat Al fresco Mexicana. I ordered a chicken Quesadilla and a Chicken burrito. Server working the register was a very well mannered guy. Even used the word Sir, that says a lot about who's getting your food. Good job!  The burrito was a lot fresher and lighter tasting than most Mexican restaurants. The chicken was lightly marinated, moist and tender. The tortilla was also soft and moist with no dry ends.\"Rare\"  If you're into spicy heat, ask for the hottest salsa they have. It's kind of like an extra hot version of Ranchero salsa.  I've read reviews that complain about portion to price ratio. True the portions are not traditional American Plate crowding portions. But they are pretty close to the portion sizes of other Mexican places in the freemont area. And in my opinion this food is a lot fresher and close to home made taste than the rest.  Will be eating here again in the very near future."}
{"text":"What a waste.....by me....I have wasted my time driving by Penches Taco's on my way home and never stopped in, until tonight.  Wow!  This place is terrific!  The design of the place is the first thing you are blown away by, it's pretty cool.  Second, the service is amazing, everyone was beyond friendly and willing to make sure everything was great.  Third and most importantly, the food was really, really good.  I often wonder why people settle for ordinary, but instead you could go to Penches Tacos and really be impressed."}
{"text":"I have been wandering around for good mexican places,with good ambiance,good food selection and great service! I would mostly get one but not the other two. All of these were an experienced served to me at this newly found place.according to them its just another chain,but i have never been to one,so i was so excited just from coming in. with theyre not so notorious nor lame Day of the Dead decor,they have a fake taco truck in the restaurant,a good seating area for those that has children  (i think)lol and a bar for those whos looking for more interactions and friends relaxation BS. We sat on the bar,the bartenders were pretty cool.it was slow the time we came in so we got the chance to actually be in it. Loved the tacos ,i ordered.havent enjoyed a good taco on this side of town. I had shrimp,fish,el pastor and asada. My fave were the seafoods,surprisingly,since i always get disappointed...the sauce were awesome.my mexican partner indulge himself with extra home made  hot sauce that they have ready in a bottle in case you wanna go more crazy with ur eye sweats.. Loved it loved it.cant wait to comeback on a weekend.beard this place is poppin! Just come in and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I dined here after the color run event and the food was amazing. I had the torta de pescado (fish torta or sandwich) and it is my usual whenever I go. The sandwich itself is pretty stuffed consisting of a fried fillet, their coleslaw, and beans. Each bite has a harmonious combination of hot and cool as well as tender and a slight crunch full of flavor. I personally know the owner and he and his staff are very flexible when it comes to customizing or substituting orders. They make you feel like family not because of the cool día de los muertos and lotería decor everywhere, but because of their warm and friendly interactions.   Rating wise I would give this place a 5 star rating, but the only reason why I'm not is for their spacing in this particular location. It's extremely compact and limited. Everything else is outside and since it's Vegas, you're either being blasted with scorching heatwaves or cold air."}
{"text":"Tbh, I came here because there was a Pokestop nearby, but sadly you won't quite reach it from here; you'd need to go outside and walk toward the street to get it. I was surprised by how hidden this place was from the street. You have to turn into the driveway and drive around to the back of the building where the restaurant is located.  I ordered the combination tacos of beef tongue, asada, and adobada. I enjoyed the beef tongue the best. It was very, very tender. It came with rice, and chips and beans - no complaints here. I also got an order of the Mexican corn. This totally hit the spot! It was coated in the sauce and a nice layer of Parmesan cheese. Delicious! The corn was huge too! I would go back just for the Mexican corn."}
{"text":"This is a laid back Mexican fast food restaurant located at the container park. We ordered the carne Asada and alpastor burrito. They were both very good. However, the alpastor is good for people that enjoy spicy food.  While the carne Asada had less flavor and it was less spice. The burritos come with rice, beans and a good quantity of guacamole. The dish also comes with chips and fresh salsa on the side. The food was good, the only problem is that you dont always get a table as they have a very limited patio space. The menu was also a bit overwhelming and hard to read.  Overall, a very good place to eat Mexican food without breaking your bank."}
{"text":"Pros: These tacos are AMAZING. The flavors are very tasty but not overpowering... just right! I got the usual carne asada, el pastor, and pollo and every single one was delicious! The best deal is their combination plate of 3 tacos that comes with rice and beans so you'll definitely be full! Coupled with watermelon juice and it will quench your thirst on a hot summer day in Vegas! Just hitting this place up is worth your trip to Container Park (in which the restaurant is made up of a freight container). The staff is very friendly and had us say enchilada before taking our picture... funny guy!  Cons: Nothing off the top of my head. The price, quality, quantity, service, and atmosphere was good!  Overall: For some authentic Mexican food goodness, you got to eat here!"}
{"text":"As far as tacos go, this place has quite the variety on offer. Lengua? You don't see that every day. Beyond this somewhat unusual variety, they've got the basic bases covered: asada, adobada, al pastor, pollo, etc. There's also a mole taco, and a nopal variety. Get adventurous with your taste buds here, because all the ingredients seem very fresh and the preparation is keen. Other than said tacos, I will say you should try the asada fries because they are ridiculous. Think Mexican poutine.  Interior space is nothing special. Pick your tacos, get a place holder, find a place to sit (outside, probably) and they'll deliver. They don't have any brand hot sauce (so no Tapatio) but their house made is good enough.  They offer Micheladas and beer, as well as Mexican sodas, so find a cool spot and enjoy them tacos while watching the container park go by."}
{"text":"The Internet is full of critics. This play was great. The atmosphere was buzzing, the game was on, and they had amazing guacamole. Definitely somewhere you should check out."}
{"text":"I went to Pinches Tacos yesterday for Cinco de Mayo. It was nuts, but I expected it to be. The gringos tacos are probably the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Their guacamole is also delicious. The wait at the bar is why I didn't give them 5 stars. I understand that it was crazy, but we were given our drinks and then had to stand there waiting for the bill on more than one occasion. They need to add another register at the bar if they can't keep up with customer demand at that point. There was one particular man who helped me out more than once and I wish I had gotten his name, but he was in a white Pinches t-shirt and a blue hat. He was very sincere with his checking in on customers and he helped me out very promptly. I live in far North Las Vegas, but I'm thinking of driving over to Pinches for more of those tacos."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this please out, reading reviews on Yelp about how good it is and so on. So my husband and I decided to go try this place out. I love that it's in the Container Park vicinity, kids can play, music, shopping, etc... Anyway, my husband and I ordered the Al Pastor burrito with everything, my daughter wanted carne asada fries, my other kid wanted taquitos (2 in a plate no rice or beans), we also ordered a side of rice, 3 fountain drinks and 2 Blood Orange Margaritas.... Grand total $76.00 and change!! I was like whaaaaat?! But we're like whatever it must be that good and probably lots of food! Because being Mexican our portions are big! They gave us our number and were seated. They brought our food pretty quick, a plus. But to our surprise the burritos were super small and I'm saying this because other regular taco stands or restaurants the burritos are pretty big, the taquitos for my daughter were itty bitty! And the asada fries were blah! As we started eating I ask my husband if he had any meat in his burrito and was like \"NO\", so we just pretty much had a rice, bean and guacamole burrito with like a sliver of meat! Ugh!! So freaking disappointing!!! The blood orange margaritas weren't all that either! Tasted like the ready made margarita bottle you get from Costco ... We were soooo disappointed in this place. I'm sorry but it didn't feel like \"Real Mexican food by Real Mexicans\" I can't say it fell short because it just fell. And for the price, I'll just stick to the taco truck. The decor in the place was nice though"}
{"text":"Went to the one tonight at Gramercy on Russel because I frequent the Cuppa and have always wanted to try it. Servers were very nice and attentive, stopped by several times to make sure we had everything and joke around with my kids. Food came very fast and was delicious!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rice and beans really bland with the combination taco plate. The tacos were served cold it was like that they had all the meat already prepared, took it out of a container that had been in the refrigerator to make the tacos. I ordered a regular my house margarita and of course the waitress asked me if I'd like the blood orange one instead.  I didn't care for it much. We asked about nachos because we didn't see any on the menu and the waitress said that they did have some on the gringo menu. Huh?  Well it wasn't good enough food to come back and the seating was so uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I had the three taco combo plate.  I was so excited because the tortillas were home made.   However they fell apart and were not that great.  The carnitas were NOT good.   The meat was not cooked all the way. Carnitas should fall apart and be well done not chunks of meat.   I Am a white girl and make better carnitas.   The beans were not good either."}
{"text":"Best sopes I've had in a while the people are extremely nice and the food is amazing I forgot my credit card at the register and they were kind enough to return it to me.I'll be coming here again"}
{"text":"March 2016 = We ate at PInche's twice on our trip last year & it was so good. The taco was extremely yummy and the dip was addicting, I wanted to lick the stupid paper bowl! The blood orange margarita was strong and delicious. Pinche's is on our short list of places to visit each day."}
{"text":"Mexican Corn.....yummmmm! I want some now. Weekend get a bit busy so you have to wait but you have to try it. Pinche combo is definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"FOOD-My boyfriend and I go to Pinches Tacos on Tuesdays all the time for Taco Tuesday. They have delicious two dollar tacos all night and we also make sure we go during their happy hour so we can enjoy drinks as well.   SERVICE-The staff is always nice and remember who you are. I even went on my birthday and I received a free cup cake which was delicious. I don't think they give free cup cakes for your birthday....I happened to receive one that day by chance because they had some.  -They also have great customer service. I ordered to go once and they forgot my churros, I called up and they acknowledged their mistake, apologized and gave me a refund with no hassle.  PARKING-Great amount of parking, never had a issue.   ATMOSPHERE-They play greatd music and part of the bar opens up to the outside which is nice when the weather is gorgeous. I highly recommend going for their happy hour or on taco Tuesdays for the food or both!!!!  DEALS-Happy Hour. Top items to get are the Gringo Tacos (make sure to use their hot sauce) Mexican Corn, Churros and Micheladas!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a girls night out not to long ago, and we decided to try out this place.. Just the name attracted us lol The food was delicious! HANDMADE TORTILLAS is a plus! The decoration was as well! i loved it!!They did messed up on our order but they went ahead n fixed it and gave us a discount on the bill, which of course who doesn't love that right? I had some mole tacos with a michelada, and let me tell you.. it was one of the best ones i've had. The staff there is the best, they were all so friendly, everyone in such a good mood! overall i highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is purely amazing.  We've tried the nachos, the pinches combo plate, the carne asada tacos and numerous other dishes...Wow! !!!! Very authentic food. Located in Container Park which is a great place to sit and just chill while being entertained by whatever band is going. Def a place to remember. ...."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place, did so today. Sad to say it will be the first and only time.   I am only giving 1 star since the food was alright. Just alright, nothing to brag about, nothing to make us want to go back. We ordered 1 alpastor torta, 1 alpastor taco, 1 shrimp taco, 1 breakfast burrito and mexican corn and still cost $30 after a military discount!   I asked how big the tacos were, the guy taking our order said \"definitely bigger than street tacos\" .. he even used his hands to describe the size.  The tacos were very small, like street taco small, like only 2 bites small and were $4 each. The shrimp taco had 1 piece of shrimp chopped up. I can get same quality food from a taco truck for half the price. Not worth it.   Breakfast burrito was very bland. Tried adding more pico and mexican crema.. nothing! Again, not impressed. I've had a better tasting breakfast burrito from Roberto's for half the price.  The corn had a good taste but was very watery/soupy.   Worst $30 we've spent on food! The door says real mexican food.. HAHAHA! Not even close!"}
{"text":"Great street style tacos. Tried the mole, al pastor and carne Asada...all were good. Their micheladas are good as well. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I loved the food! The tacos and burritos were delicious and savory! I recommend Pinches to all my friends and owners are awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband came here on a Friday evening and saw this place. I've been wanting some authentic Mexican food and this place hit the spot. I had tacos and my hubby had burritos. My tacos were delicious and my hubby liked his burrito. Way better than Chipotle, in my opinion. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Every time I come to las vegas I always stop by here for breakfast.  I usually get the chilaquiles which are to die for and some of their corn. Yum! This location is my favorite because it's unique and there's always something going on like live music. Highly recommend this delicious restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. My personal favorite is the Gringo Tacos either chicken or beef. The sauce on it is so unique and perfectly complimentary to the taco. I usually eat everything plain. The service is amazing and quick too. Its a great atmosphere to just hang out, go on a date, or grab a few drinks. Everything looks decently clean as well. I love how their is a window to where the kitchen is so you can watch what everyone is doing."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting tacos!  I've tried the gringo tacos, the cactus and vegetarian as well. I like how the chips are thicker here so when I go to dip into my mountain of guacamole, they don't break into pieces.  The churros are great, especially paired with the ice cream. Happy hour and taco Tuesday is a killer deal, I love the margaritas.  Very cool atmosphere, I like the day of the dead skulls, along with the food truck lodged inside of the restaurant. Yay tacos!"}
{"text":"After passing their location downtown many times and never stopping in, finally ventured to the location closest to us...gotta say I wish I passed this one too.  Nothing special. We ordered the taco platter (I ordered the shrimp taco, fish and carne asada) The fish taco fell apart from being too wet (I'm guessing from the salsa they put on) and the carne asada was lackluster.   Service wasnt amazing and there was only us and one other party there so who knows what they were up to while they were all hanging out in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Really happy I don't have to drive to Henderson anymore for good tacos...  In one word, this place is AWESOME!  I've tried a few different tacos and sopas:  Chicken Mole, Adobada and Al Pastor.  While they were all good, the chicken mole tacos were the stand out!  Are you kidding me!?!? Chicken Mole tacos?!?!  Who does that?  They do and they do it well!    The quality is top-notch and while I'm not sure if they make the taco shells there, it sure tastes like they do.  They taste freshly made and are a little thicker which is just amazing.    For dessert I had the guava flan and it was amazing!  While I love flan, most of the ones I've had have more of a jello-like texture, this was creamy, almost like cheesecake.    This will be a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time. I love the vibe and the staff here. It's loud and somewhat family friendly. I called ahead to make sure it was ok to bring my 1.5 and 4 year old, after reading some Yelp reviews I wasn't sure. They told me they had kid friendly food and booster seats. Unfortunately when I got there, only 1 booster seat was available. No biggie, the place was pretty busy and we were just happy to get a table quickly.  We ordered chips and salsa for the table, it was fine, nothing spectacular. I was probably most excited to try a blood orange margarita, it was pretty good! I tried elote for the first time. I never had it before but had always imagined it really spicy! It wasn't, but I still loved it. I had the carnitas taco and LOVED it! I would def go back for that alone. I'm no Mexican expert, this was basically my first real Mexican experience, but as much as I loved the carnitas, I didn't like the al pastor or asada tacos at all.  One of the reasons I liked this place is the loudness (like a cafeteria) and number of children there. We fit right in. We will be back as this place is close to home and we loved the margaritas!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and my favorite items have been the Carne asada fries and the micheladas. If you order food from here they will deliver it to you on the lawn!  Great service. Tacos are ok."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos made by real Mexicans.....yeahhh authentic my bootyhole.  Taco Bell is better and has real Mexicans lol  The chic at the counter was soo sooo snobby. The food was legit awful. My chicken tacos were not chicken. They had no flavor. The rice and beans were super cold and once again flavorless. My boyfriend had a burrito... Microwave burritos are better. So disappointing. I was sooo excited we went all the way from the strip to the container thing just for this place  stupid me.."}
{"text":"I ordered a three taco combination and asked for all tacos to be al pastor. I've ordered al pastor tacos from here in the past and other places, so I know what they look and taste like. What I received was dried up steak and hard rice. I'm very disappointed couldn't even eat my food, everything was old and hard."}
{"text":"Introduction:  What a catchy name, Pinches, LOL. A friend informed me about the Tacos here. Apparently, it's the best tacos you'll ever have. Guess what? Never knew my friend was a carpenter, cause he NAILED IT!   Quality: 5/5 We had the BEST, YES, the BEST Carnitas, Chicken, Asada and Gringo Tacos in this Universe. It was prepared with fresh hand made Tortillas.  I've never had Tacos with fresh Tortillas before. It was definitely a \"WOW\" factor and I don't get wowed easily by Tacos.    I also had the corn on the cob, just with butter, none of that other stuff it comes with and that was just as AMAZING.  Customer Service: 5/5 Extraordinary! Superb! Exceptional! Yes, that good. The girls were welcoming, made proper recommendations and accommodating from start to finish.  Price: 5/5 Definitely FIVE STARS if you go before 7:00 p.m. for their happy hours. Now for their regular prices, some may find it a little pricy.  Not to me, because of the quality.    For example, a Taco can cost you as much as $3.00+.  So if you're use to that $1.25 Tacos, ain't happening here.  But like I said, I don't mind it cause it's top quality.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Immaculate! The whole complex looked fairly new anyway.  Tips: There's another Pinches in Downtown Las Vegas that is just as good.  Also, caution, the spicy Salsa are pretty HOT, eat at your own risk.  Ok, on my way for a dessert to finish this great beautiful night."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! We loved the homemade tortillas and sopes as well as their extensive drink choices. Not the best mole or adobada I've ever had but, the pollo asado and carnitas are yummy!My favorite thing of all was their Mexican elote and the prices! We will definitely be back there again and again!"}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito was good... Daughter loved it. Other daughter loved the asada fries. Carne asada tacos decent. Shrimp enchiladas too sweet for my liking.... Ketchup like..... Eeeeeeew. $52 bucks for 4 of us."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious. Husband and I ordered the gringo tacos with rice and beans, asada fries and of course ELOTE ( the best I've had)"}
{"text":"For the margaritas alone this place gets five stars! They are absolutely delicious. You can tell they use fresh lime juice, and not any type of sour bar mix. I tried the white peach margarita and it was just awesome. They definitely do not go light on the tequila either. They do run happy hour specials with two dollar tacos. I tried a variety of tacos and they were all very good. But this place is worth coming to for the margaritas alone."}
{"text":"A little confusing at first. An interesting combination of restaurant and taco bus. Speaking of tacos, they were fabulous, as was the tostada. Refried beans were ok. Good, but not amazing Margarita and friendly service. Cute space too. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"GOOD Wish I could have more positive things to say about my experience tonight.  In the 20+ times that have been coming here I've never had a bad one.   Food was good as always no complaints =)  Service was something else completely!  BAD Phoned in order (7:55p).. cause I know the food takes a bit from when u order. So I usually call it in...  Fresh made to order is why I come back.  Arrive at 8:05 and no order...3 girls standing up front.  Guy swipes card and takes order..8:18p See ticket pic.    So I'm waiting for another 15 minutes... when they're done eating cake in back...im asked if I've been helped...oh geez!   Never put in damn order 830p rolls around and food comes out...no apology... no service recovery from girls...nothing.  2 other people waiting behind me with ordering/food problems as well.    I didn't see the owner who is usually around cause he is always great to customers and very service oriented...wanted to express my concerns personally  I hope this isn't a trend here...TBD."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for an awesome cocktail! The blood orange margarita blew me away! Thankfully it was happy hour and drinks were half price, I downed four! The chips were warm and fresh and the pico had the perfect amount of kick. We ordered queso to cheese up the matter, but I didn't care for it. It's almost like a smidge of meat chili was added to the queso.. The fish taco was average..it didn't knock my socks off. The corn on the cob is amazing! Best ever! Be sure to try the guac...it's the perfect texture- not too creamy nor too chunky. I've been here three times and have had great service each time."}
{"text":"Yesterday was National Margarita Day, so I went on Yelp and found Pinches Tacos (love the name)   I had their tacos at container park and enjoyed them.   Went here for happy hour and was not disappointed at all.   It was very busy when I first walked in but I was greeted immediately and helped with the menu by Javier who owned the place. He was very hospitable, made me feel like I were in his home. Treated me like a real guest and not just a customer.   His two bartenders were awesome and really seemed to enjoy their jobs as well.   Great Atmosphere.  Great Food  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place 3rd time this week the steak tacos or bad ass and leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"Awesome date night spot!! Me and the hubby come here to eat good quality food. Fresh and authentic  Must try"}
{"text":"This spot is great for a large group of friends. Awesome happy hour & yummy tacos! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm sad and disappointed that I'm only able to give pinches a 2 star when it easily should of been a 5 star! This was my husbands and I first time in and we had been referred here by many family and friends. Pinches is a cute taco spot with a great vibe and delicious food! The tacos are truly amazing but unfortunately I can't say the same for the customer service.  We came in around 10:10-10:15 the latest on Saturday night (4/7/18) and instantly feel in love and the place had people every where and even had karaoke going on.  We were seated on the other side where it was much more calmer by the front windows towards the right (if you have just walked in the front door) anyways we ended up with chavo -younger gentleman medium built with a large black bread - he was polite but he has the worst customer service.  He seemed very distracted with the other side where the karaoke and the bar was happening. Now yes there was a good amount of people in pinches but not too the point that we had to be ignored and forgotten. We order for starters chips, salsa and guacamole, 2 taco combos and a Mexican corn off the cob. We received our food in a orderly manner but chavo was too busy with watching the karaoke and forgot about us and our order. He only came back to the table every 15-20 mins if that and after receiving our taco combos and eating about half way through them we still didn't receive our starter. So we did not receive our chips and guacamole and we didn't receive our corn either at this point. After reminding him of both again and after already eating  more than half our taco combos, he only still brings the chips and NO CORN  was every brought out. At this point we were over the situation and finished our meal.  Again Chavo is no where to be found. It wasn't until i went up to the front where i had to ask him for our bill so we could leave. At the end he got no Tip and when i asked for the manager from another women she stated the manager wouldn't be in until Sunday. So I hope the owner and manager see this and i will be contacting the manager Sunday. Customer service is a 100% must in my book and for the poor service We received tonight has turned us off from pinches and I'm sad to say we will not be returning. Thanks chavo for making us feel like we were an inconvenience for you since the party side is where you obviously wanted to be."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for the basic Mexican cuisine. I grew up in Mexico and the one thing that this place does lack is robust flavors and \"kick\" in their spices and salsas.    GRINGO TACO is fantastic!!!   I love the atmosphere and the place is very clean. Service is very friendly. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and even though the food is still good, the service was poor. They barely greet you when you walk in and don't thank you when you leave. I think I'll just drive the 23mins to the other location on Russell because they are REALLY friendly there."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious! My favorite is the gringo taco and the chorizo queso! The best and so close to where I work!"}
{"text":"Very meh. The food wasn't bad. But there was nothing special about this place. I would have been just as happy to have eaten at Robertos, and for the price would have gotten more food. Honestly very average food, works in a pinch when hungry, but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Me and my family had stayed in Las Vegas for a bit and I came here because of the reviews.   Pros-  taco tortillas are freshly made  Delicious chorizo/bean (if that's what it's called lol) dip Very friendly people  Food made upon purchase.  Use lotería signs for sitting (very unique!)   Cons- Menu was hard to read since it's on chalk and was smudged  No ice unfortunately  No seating inside (well only for about 6 people total , literally)  Very overpriced  I asked for no onion and they said \"oh it just has a Bit\" not even willing to remake it without.  LONG wait! (There are few workers and lots of ppl do order so with that being said , they take quite a long time to serve)  Looks a bit unorganized inside"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great customer service. Not the best food I've had but not the worst either..."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I actually haven't tried this location yet but I did try the one at the container park and yes it is Authentic mexican food.  I've been searching for authentic Mexican for a while and I'm excited that this one is down the street from me!  I would eat there everyday"}
{"text":"Great tacos! The lengua was absolutely delicious. Also got flautas for my daughter . The service was great almost freaky fast and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and I really like it. That's a bold statement since I really don't care for Vegas Mexican food! I was raised on Tex-Mex and we need that here! However, this is an acceptable substitution.  I like the decor-taco truck inside! My kids love it. I ordered Carne Asada Fries with beef which were excellent even the next day heated up. My son got chicken and beef on his. My daughter got the kid's meal quesadilla with rice and beans.   My only complaint is that there really is no service beyond someone bringing your order to your table. No salt and pepper shakers-only packets and plastic eating utensils. When I'm spending $50-$100, I really want a dining experience not a pseudo taco truck experience. I get the concept but I don't care for it.   Bathrooms are cool. Tiles feature day of the dead characters. I hope I posted some. Kitschy.     We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So this place was a complete disappointment... Not just because of the food but the service was just embarrassing and rude point blank ...  They gave us a wrong order first off and then the food we were waiting on they never brought it out because it was passed 8:30 and since we had children with us they wanted us to leave since children aren't permitted there after 8:30 without an adult... About 30 minutes passed and I went to ask them about my food and they said they were not going to serve us because of the children!!! They were not even going to attempt in letting us know to get our money back... They were going to keep our money and just let us leave... It was ridiculous and disgusting customer service... They should put a sign... NO KIDS ALLOWED if it's that big of a problem instead of just taking people's money!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food! Love, love, love their carne asada nachos- I have to get them every time. And the blood orange margarita compliments them perfectly. My favorite part is finding a table outside and listening to some live music in the container park."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Didn't realize they had a taco Tuesday deal though so I ordered the wrong tacos for that... However the tacos are so good that even though I missed out on a deal I'll be back.. And most likely often. The tortillas, made in house are literally some of the best I've ever had, same goes for the lengua which has been chewy every place I have ever eaten it before, but this was cooked perfectly like I made it myself, it fell apart in my mouth which is how lengua should be. My only criticism is it took longer than I expected and the Diablo sauce wasn't really, really spicy like the server warned me. In fact it's mild, good but very mild, so I had to use a lot of it.   Anyway this place is a must, if you like tacos."}
{"text":"New favorite - carne asada fries. Why didn't someone think of these before?   Extra crispy tasty fries, plenty of carne asada, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole...sorry if I left anything out but in my defense I was in a race with friends for portion size.  The staff were super nice, prices were low and the menu looks fantastic.  Later one of the vendors in another container said we have to go back and try the green sauce that's not on the menu...next time, definitely."}
{"text":"very delicious!!! def will go back i tried almost all there tacos and taquitos.. very friendly and food came out fast!"}
{"text":"Location - Southwest off Russell / I-215 ; location is a little secluded which is kinda weird. It's located behind a brand new apartment/condominium complex which looks vacant for the most part. It's not visible while driving down Russell so you're gonna have to turn into the plaza and drive towards the back. Parking is decent.   Atmosphere - Clean and very vibrant ; huge restaurant with tons of tables and chairs. I was the only one eating , however the location is new so it's probably going to take awhile before potential customers hear about it. Decor has traditional Mexican flair to it, complete with Mexican music. Huge windows all around the wall so there's tons of natural light.   Service - Quick service type ; you order at the counter and food is brought out to you. My order took 5 mins so no complaints from me. Lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful.   Food - Decent ; it's not bad but it isn't mind blowing either. I ordered their Torta al Pastor and a drink. Personally, the pastor lacks flavor. It's not horribly bad. I was satisfied with my meal but I wish it could've been better. I guess I'm spoiled by Taco y Taco and Tacos el Gordo's Pastor offerings. On the plus side, their Tortas are huge. I had a stuffed belly after I devoured it.   Final Thoughts - Food is OK. It's my first time and I can't really judge of a horrible experience because of my first meal. I'll definitely be back and try their Asada or something. It's a good quick place to grab a bite if you're craving Mexican food . Just keep your expectations at bay though ."}
{"text":"Located not too far from the GIANT FIRE BREATHING PRAYING MANTIS (like, whoa) in downtown Container Park, Pinches Tacos is in a perfect spot for the AUTHENTIC stuff. Their slogan is \"Real Mexican Food made by Real Mexicans\" after all. We came post-dinner rush & right before a crowd of tourist hipsters & ordered the pinches asada fries (best name ever) to share & it was perfection. Perfect size for two, not too greasy, and just the right amount of sour cream, cheese & guac. The fries were crispy and the asada, while it wasn't the best asada ever (which in my biased opinion is always in San Diego), is pretty good. We finished the whole thing in 10 minutes while watching the praying mantis breathe actual fire, & the Container Park atmosphere definitely adds to the modern Vegas (in downtown Vegas) vibe. Pinches, we'll be back for ya."}
{"text":"Over priced food. I had the Carne asada burrito which is small and it was mostly beans. Sucks don't eat here. Save your money rather eat at taco bell"}
{"text":"Yesss!!! Amazing tacos when around here we always try to make a stop in here. The carnitas tacos are bomb!!! Service is quick and the staff is friendly"}
{"text":"We come here a few times a month to take advantage of their happy hour. Their tacos and margaritas are phenomenal, and the staff is friendly and engaging. Every time my family or friends come to town, I always bring them to pinches tacos!"}
{"text":"My VERY particular husband has loved the food every time we've been (7 entrees). Very good, very fresh, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Yummy and best part was that it was happy hour when we went! They have happy hour everyday from 5-7pm which is nice because some places do not do happy hours on Fridays. I ordered a blood orange margarita because that is the house specialty. It was really good.   I think ordered the three taco combo. I tried the pork, pollo mole and the cameron (shrimp). It also came with rice and beans. I should have just ordered the tacos separately because I was too full for the rice and beans. I really liked the shrimp taco.   Although it's not my favorite it's up there with one of the good taco places in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's in a great location in the container park and the service was up to par.   The downfall was they give no almost no guac and you order guac and salsa! With it being $5.75 for this I expected a lot more than what was given and this impacted my experience a lot. I would not recommend ordering this because it is not worth it.   The al pastor was ok, but I like taco y taco better but that's just my preference. Try it, you may like it!   The Mexican corn on the cob was awesome! I would recommend ordering this. Very tasty and yummy."}
{"text":"Best varna asada fries ever! I ordered it with the pick de gallo and onions on the side and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and it was pretty good!  I got the chips and salsa which was a great starter.  There was a lot more than I had planned.  I had an al pastor taco which was good.  I will probably try another kind of taco next time.  My favorite item of the meal was the Mexican corn on the cob.  It was so delicious and flavorful I can't wait to go back and have more!  I also want to try some of their breakfast items next time."}
{"text":"Located at the Container Park which is a really cool fun place shops, bars , fun area for kids, we had the Carne Asada Fries. Seasoned well lots of flavor highly recommend trying it. Out door & indoor seating. Margaritas served in plastic cups no salt or lime but still ok. We would come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cute Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) vibe to it. They have tables and a full service bar area. From what it looked like, I think you order at the counter/bus and then pick a seat? I don't know because I only ordered take out.   We did 3 combination plates (3 tacos, rice, beans) at $9.50. The tacos are street style so they are smaller but the combination plate is sure to fill you up. All of the tacos were delicious. They even had a special one that was deep fried so it became a hard shell taco. All of us loved the fluffy rice and chunky beans...they even threw in a couple chips to scoop up the beans. The tortillas are soft and taste homemade. I really appreciated how they wrapped up each sauce in its own container and labeled which taco it belonged on to prevent the tacos from getting soggy. If you don't want to gnaw on a corn cob you can get your elotes in a bowl!   Great little taco spot. We will be back! I hope they get busy...I'm sure they rely solely on word of mouth or whatever marketing they're doing as I don't think they get much walk-in business (since their storefront is hidden)! The service was friendly, but I will admit I was not greeted right away and had one of those awkward \"where do I go to order\" moments.   HOT TIP: Happy hour- $4 dranks & $2 tacos!!!! FYI, apparently \"pinches\" is not a bad word ;X"}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good.  It's a solid go to for any need- main go to or a fall back, will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Saw the sign coming out of a business meeting just after noon. First timer, ordered a carnitas burrito. Nice presentation with salsa and a few chips - not too many to go to waste. Burrito texture was excellent with ample guacamole. Salsa was a bit watery. Could do better. Staff is terrific - cheery and helpful. Could be a great happy hour hang. Returning..."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas.  Lots of room staff is very friendly and food is great.   Have to try the chips n dip very yummy.  Love the fresh tortillas very hard to find anywhere"}
{"text":"First of all, you cannot beat $2 tacos and $4 margaritas during their happy hour! That's a great deal. The margaritas they offered were traditional, peach, and blood orange (they don't have them on the menu). They were tasty and didn't skimp on the alcohol since they were happy hour prices. The flautas were delicious! It's the perfect appetizer to go with your first margarita. The tacos were good. I ordered the combo plate with fish, asada, and shrimp. I would've liked some different salsas or a salsa bar to customize our tacos. The Mexican corn is delicious and off the cob is even easier to eat and enjoy if you don't want to get your hands dirty. I'll definitely be back for their happy hour."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 I would. I'll likely come back and do another review, but wanted to be honest. My GF and I came here because we heard the chicken flautas were amazing. So we got to sit and it took a bit to get service, but not a big deal. Server comes up and we order peach and blood orange margaritas and start to order. We ask for the flautas and were told their fryer was down, basically half the menu wasn't available. At this point we had already committed, it had been twenty minutes and had our beverages already. I wish they would have said something when we sat down, but they didn't, so that was a big impact on how I rated. We ordered some tacos, I'll say their handmade tortillas are awesome , perfect texture, but the pastor lacked flavor. Their beef cheek was good, and the roasted chick had good flavor but was a bit on the dry side. We've had good experiences with pinches in LA, but this place left us wanting. Maybe they had an off day , so we will give it another go ."}
{"text":"I've had a friend who has been bugging me to try this place for so long .. I live all the way in north town so I'll admit I've taken awhile to try it out but I'm glad I finally made it to this fun and colorful taco spot ..  My boyfriend lives on the south side so we decided to check this place out after our originally choice had a long wait.. we arrived about thirty minutes before happy hour ended so I went ahead and tried a $4 margarita .. my waitress recommended the blood orange as the crowd please so I went with that one and I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it that I opted to get two lol which was probably a mistake in hindsight after sitting there trying to finish it with such a full belly .. which brings me to the most important part the food LOL   We started off with chips and guacamole which is one of the major reasons I can't go all out with a five star rating .. I feel like it was lacking flavor and just didn't do it for me but the chips were pretty good ..   During happy hour they have $2 taco specials so I opted to try as many tacos as I thought I could possibly stomach a bite or two of without going into a food coma ... let's just say I ended up with five tacos on my plate and the only two I could finish were the Gringo and the mole taco.. honestly the Gringo was my favorite (wonder why?) .. It's an off menu hard shell house speciality I definitely recommend it ... I enjoyed the flavor of their mole taco and I felt like the fish taco was really good (fish and shrimp tacos aren't HH specials ) the shrimp taco was too fishy for my taste buds .. maybe I'm a shrimp taco snob tho... My guy gots Carnitas taco and honestly that was the best flavored meat of the tacos I tried from here ... I also tried the cactus taco which again was good but not worth my tummy space ..  My favorite item here was the Elote (Mexican corn on the cob) I requested it off the cob and they brought it out with a spoon , yes only a single spoon .. I can say that was a bit puzzling to me since we were a party of two but hey .. next time I'll make sure to order and make the special request lol  Overall this place is such a fun experience just due to the decor.. I don't know if I will go back unless it's during Happy Hour and I'm on this side of town but for a Mexican experience with a more Americanized feel without being chipotle .. I definitely recommend checking this place out ... especially if you're a nerd like myself who just loves the ambiance and decor.."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this restaurant because it's different from any other restaurant in Las Vegas.  My first time here I was happy to try half the tacos on the menu and thoroughly enjoyed the meats.  However, some meats like the roasted chicken lacked salt and there's none on the tables.  The salsas that come on the tacos lack flavor.  The green salsa which is made with tomatillos has no kick to it.  Some tortillas ripped as well but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to take for fresh made tortillas.  Do yourself a flavor and avoid the beans and rice.  I will drop by during Happy Hour on a game night, if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"#latereview 8/16/2015  Came in during 1:30pm with a couple people to try them out.  Around that time, they were packed! If that's how lunch rush is on a Sunday I would hate to see it on a Saturday but good for them!   Came in and had the following:  Tacos (Asada, Al Pastor) -  tacos were not my pick because I normally get lingua, cabeza, tripas, so not my first choice but I enjoyed it. I appreciated the hand made tortillas. Fluffy and not hard. Just the right amount of salsa that they put on for you. I'm picky since I would rather control the amount myself but still good. The onions weren't over powering.  Michelada -  perfect amount of Tajin and hot sauce. Not too spicy, but not weak either.   Elotes - nothing memorable. Just your corn, mayo, cheese, and spices. But still yummy to eat. Corn was surprisingly sweet.  Torta - this was actually done pretty good. The bread they chose and the size complimented the amount of meat they put in it. Normally you'll get a soggy bread with very little meat and way too much filler but not this one.   All in all, I would come back again. Nothing that makes it stand out for me to go all the way to DTLV from Henderson but if I was in the area I'll definitely give them a try. I'm just very partial to Taco y Taco that's all"}
{"text":"A los angeles area staple now here in Vegas. Very good tacos for the money. Not the very best and the surrounding area scares me a little bit."}
{"text":"Clearly not paying attention to the details. Has a special board right by the register advertising a queso dip. Took my order, took my money. A few minutes later I was informed they're out of queso dip. You know, the one advertised right by the register. Anyways, I had a few tacos. Very tasty but in the twenty minutes I was there they never bothered to remove the queso special sign. Tables were sticky too. Delicious tacos though."}
{"text":"So good i had to make a yelp just to give a review! I work down the street from here and we all love the gringo tacos!! The staff is amazing and the environment is welcoming! I definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and was very excited to try this place. (It's on the back side of the building, off the street) but unfortunately we just didn't like it. The entrees were small. Salt was in little packages that we had to ask for. The salsa was just very chunky vegetables. We asked for flour tortillas for our tacos and were told they don't serve tacos on flour tortillas."}
{"text":"We have gone to their Container Park location several times and we have always walked away feeling full and satisfied. Now that this location is much closer to our house, we will be going here much more frequently. My wife and I dig the combination plate with your choice of 3 Tacos, beans and rice. I recommend the \"Gringo\" and the Al Pastor. Try it with some Diablo hot sauce and was it down with a cold beer (once they get their liquor license at this location). Thanks for making us feel like friends coming to dinner."}
{"text":"Horrible Service! The service was horrible! The waiter was rude, he got our order wrong and he didn't do anything to fix it. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Okay so I had to change my review I was really excited to come back here earlier today and now I'm just disappointed. I tried their chicken enchiladas and they where just bad. This place claims authentic mexican food and they have a sign that says they want to keep you away from \"fakexican food\" and well this food is really not good Mexican food. Their enchiladas where in the worse sauce I've ever tried, it taste like cheap ketchup or something. The tortilla wrap was just bad...didnt even taste like a tortilla so i dont believe they are handmade. The rice taste burnt the beans are canned. Obviously or something. Jeez...and the corn on the cob sure its cool..but i have to put my own chili powder at home since theirs is just not good. Or at least not traditional.  Overall it's pretty sad that they just claim so much and all I see is low quality food."}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos just opened in my office building and I went today! DELISH!!!  I have visited the location in Container Park but this location is closer to home so I'm super happy about that!!!!  I had the Pinches Taco combo platter, yummy!!!! I enjoyed the chips, super fresh! I love Pinches Tacos!"}
{"text":"So Container Park is super cute!  My friend and I went there for the first time last night and decided to grab something to eat at Pinche's.  We love Mexican food so we were pretty stoked on it.  I got the carnitas taco combo plate.  I was not happy with it at all.  I love the simplicity of street tacos, but that means the meat needs to be seasoned properly!  The pork was so bland!  And they don't give you enough salsa to make it taste better.  The corn tortillas were soaking wet so I couldn't even pick them up and eat them like a taco.  I looked like a real gringa using a fork.  The beans were also extremely under seasoned.  I'll probably just go to the BBQ place next door if I'm ever over there again.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"I just had probably the best nachos that I have ever had in my life! Food was fresh, it taste great and was not overly costly."}
{"text":"My first visit over a year ago was great. Tacos & corn were tasty. Just went there this last Sunday & I was disappointed. The pico de gallo salsa I got with my meal tasted old & sour, only took 1 bite. My $10 carne asada burrito had mostly beans & rice. The avocado slices in it were brown & stringy. The prices are higher than a regular taco shop - understandable given the location. However, they need to step it up & make it worth it if they want locals to keep going. I was not happy when I saw the way the fridge was organized: marinating meat in bags on a shelf above salsa containers. About 3 tables inside only so it's a small place with mostly outdoor seating. Service was so so. No smiling or happiness. Just there."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of a plaza is this Mexican foodie gem, Pinches Tacos. I was hungry for a snack on the road and boy was I glad this popped on my Yelp App because I would have not see this place driving by.  Once I enter this restaurant, my eyes were greeted by a nicely rustic and contemporary street decor. The first thing you see if the \"food truck\" located on your right. It's great you can see the cooks at work through the glass wall. The bar is nicely constructed and I love the fence in the middle of the restaurant. This is a big room restaurant, it can fit a lot of people!  I was nicely greeted by a gentleman and somehow convinced myself to sit-down instead of take-out. Happy hour all night... $4 shots, micheladas, margaritas and $2 tacos (select only). I got a shot, michelada, lengua and adobada tacos and my friend got a shot, margarita, pescado and pollo mole tacos. The michelada was nicely spiced, I loved the spices on the rim. Lengua was very well composed, not a lot of bland taste (I've experienced most places to not compliment the lengua too well) which was delicious. The adobada were so packed with taste, I never thought I'd like that taco as I have never ordered it as where. My friend's fish tacos were delish, crispy and well-complimented with a red cabbage slaw.   My only complaint is that I do wish the tacos were double wrapped as the juices and sauce cause the taco shell to rip very easily. I found myself using the fork and piecing the taco back together. Not a big deal to the overall experience but definitely something that bothered me a bit!  I'd highly recommend this place and will return soon. Great wait staff by the way!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. But it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I've had better tacos and margaritas elsewhere.   The service was really friendly and attentive :) so I give them a thumbs up on that!"}
{"text":"Cute Mexican Restaurant in the Gramercy off Russell and the 215. The entrance to the restaurant is on the side of the building and really needs to be labeled better as it is very confusing on how to enter. There are no high chairs and just boosters for the little ones. There is a designated bar area/over 21 area as well.   They have pretty good happy hour. The food is great. They have a variety of different meats to chose from for a burrito, taco... you name it. It is definitely a casual setting so come as you please."}
{"text":"The service is really bad. And the tacos were cold, the carnitas were terrible. Not a good place to eat at all."}
{"text":"Strong and tasty margaritas!! Loved the paintings on the walls! Food was fresh and hot! Staff was super friendly! Definitely real Mexican food, not too much this vegan could eat tho!"}
{"text":"Came her for happy hour tacos!  From 5 to 7pm I believe and all chicken and pork tacos are two bucks. This place is a more hipster gentrified taco joint. It's not authentic. The walls are pink and drinks are plentiful.   I ordered 2 alpastor tacos and an adobado taco and their Mexican corn on the cob. We also got chips and salsa to share. To be honest I can't tell which taco was which but they were all delicious. It's not a good as tacos el Gordo though and not as good as the street tacos in la.  However for 2 bucks I thought they were a great deal. Their Guac is delicious!  I thought it was seasoned perfectly. The waitress was also really nice and gave me two corns because she said that they are coming out pretty small. They looked really big to me but when I bit in there was no sweet juicy corn flesh.. It was all dried shrunken corn skin. I don't know if it was sitting out for a while.. Boiled since yesterday.. Or the corn was just not in season... But it wasn't that great and I was disappointed because Mexican corn is one of my favorite things.   I would come back here again for happy hour because it's a good deal."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place.  They have a fantastic happy hour - which I believe goes all evening on Mondays.  Food is tasty and well-priced and I love the location."}
{"text":"Very good!  Had the three taco combo - chicken mole, asada and carnitas.  The mole was great.  Loved the green salsa on the asada.  Carnitas was pretty good, but not my fave of the three.  Yummy chips, but wish they'd given a few more.  Watermelon juice is delish!  Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos in town! I usually go to tacos el gordo or pepe's but it was too far. Very convenient and their elotes are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Went in here because a friend recommended this place. The place itself seems really nice maybe family owned? The tacos weren't bad at all and the customer service was ok. Nothing to die however."}
{"text":"The best authentic tacos that I've ever ever tried. I had the chicken taco and the tongue taco which was delish. I also had the seafood taco it was okay but the Mexican corn oh my god the Mexican corn was amazing. It came with a creamy sauce and spice. The service was great if you speak Spanish they hook you up. I would definitely come back to this place and I love love their tacos."}
{"text":"Service is always prompt and very friendly.  The carne asada fries are ridiculously good.  Been here a dozen+ times, and I get it every time.   One of these days I will try something else.  Maybe.  Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"The music and the decoration of the restaurant are a nice touch, their logo \"cooked by real Mexican\" is the catch but unfortunately the food is not that great."}
{"text":"Such a great night getting to know the new Container Park!  I was very happy with the entire evening and wanted to end it on an even better note with some food from one of the new joints.  We decided on Pinches Taco.  One, because the name was awesome and two, I heard the food was great!  It's in the north east corner of the Container park.  Just like all the stores in the park, it's a small joint, however, offers a lot of seating and tables right outside.  When I visited the location, it was pretty heavily staffed.  I didn't have to wait in line at all and trust me, there were a lot of people, being the grand opening weekend.  The staff was super friendly, everyone greeted me and other customers.  Service was remarkably fast!  Might have had something to do with opening weekend :) Awesome!  There was a lot going on in the menu, so I just settled on Pinche Combination plate for $8.95.  You can choose Any 3 tacos from the menu, and it also comes with rice, beans and chips.  I decided on the three most popular things:  Beef (Asada), fish and shredded pork.  Oddly enough, the pork wasn't really the star.  That taco was served with red salsa and chopped onions.  The asada was perfectly seasoned and flavorful, chopped onions, chopped cilantro and green salsa.  The fish (unknown) was THE BEST one for me.  Battered and perfectly seasoned, served with a cabbage slaw and red salsa.  The most amazing fish taco!  Man, those fish tacos alone, are worth the return trip.  I just can't stop thinking about it. I work downtown and think this place is super convenient.  I can't WAIT to get back.  Thanks for sticking around, Pinches Tacos!"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican spot! Cool vibe, great food, alcohol selection and service. Feels like I'm on vacation in Baja! I'm a Lyft driver (gave Jonathan a ride to work here and stopped to eat cuz he was cool). I'll definitely be recommending it to my passengers and friends."}
{"text":"Damn...smh!!! Still shaking my head... I heard that you guys moved to my side of town and I did try the container park one first...and I remember it was good...not great...but good. But damn...those tacos were sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo......bland no real authentic taste. I walked in and yeah I liked the decor...I even can see myself watching some NFL games with some Micheladaz and some great tacos....eeeehhhhh wrong on tacos...the Asada for the price almost $4.00 for one ...no guacamole no real Smokey taste...you can tell it was pre cooked all the way...you never pre cook all the way...it gets hard and the juice of the asada is lost....the carnitas....damn it is the staple if true Mexican restaurant....dry...dry..DRY!!!!  Carnitas are supposed to be succulent crispy on outside and tender and juicy on the inside...and some fatty on it...the fish taco....ok...where is the white cream sauce...every fish taco place has some sort if tangy sauce inside taco....above all....with all those tacos....you forgot the limes...smh.  Beans dry rice ok...man Real Mexican food made by real Mexicans???? Well...I can see the customer base around you and they don't know any better...and I see you have multiple locations and maybe you can say he doesn't know what's to have a Mexican restaurant...wrong 5 in total I come from a Mexican chain back in L.A.  I live here and out that business....I had high expectations from you guys...if you want take a trip to taco El Gordo or Taco Y Taco they know real down homie tacos...here in Las Vegas... Just being honest....the hand made tortillas were good...."}
{"text":"These pinche tacos are really pinche good The only thing I didn't dig was the charger female fan behind the counter...lol J/k"}
{"text":"Ugh I love pinches but my wallet doesn't ! Hands down the best place to get tacos of all varieties. Their micheladas are to die for, I would literally sell my soul for the recipe.   I love coming to the bar and getting my fix of asada, fish, and chicken tacos! Their tortillas are crack, always fresh and the weirdest dough where you can tell they are hand made and hold the taco so perfectly.  It's decorated so cute here, full of color and Mexican artifacts. The staff here are always nice and attentive which is awesome. I love that there is this location in the gramercy because I can get my drink on and take an uber home to my house down the street and it is larger than the location in container park downtown. Thanks for keeping my belly full, taco addiction, and michelada problem at bay!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from many people. I decided to try it out. This was such an amazing decision. The atmosphere was great. I love the street like decor with The food truck inside. The tacos were delicious. I got the taco platter combination and it came out the perfect size to fill me. It had 3 tacos, beans, rice, and tortilla chips. The shrimp, al pastor, and carne asada taste great. The best part, they make their tortillas in house. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"My meal was good.    I thoroughly enjoyed my taco platter, mexican corn, and agua fresco.   They were out of watermelon agua today but had pineapple which was delicious.    I enjoyed my al pastor taco more than the carne asada.    The corn was good but needed fresh lime juice.  I'm sure they would have given me a wedge if I asked but I didn't feel like asking.     Next time I go I'd like to try the Gringo Menu.  Looked really good!!   Try this place and thank me later!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Service was a little slow and unresponsive but the food made up for it. Super great homemade tortillas. The atmosphere was cool and trendy. I'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I love Tacos El Gordo, but actually think that I would go here.  Everything was very good, and fresh tasting.  The refried beans are salty...but very good!  We got three of the of the taco combos.  Wife got the fish, loved it.  Son got the carnitas...it was okay, a little boring considering the rest of the meal, and I got the chicken mole taco, A-, the spicy carnitas, A, and Adobada, A.  The real star is the thicker and mild corn taco they wrap those things in.  The food came quickly, and eating outside at the Container Park is quite cool in its own right.  Oh crap....one more thing.  Three taco plates, a margarita, a Dos Equis Draft, and a horchada for $42.  While not amazing, it is definitely not absurd either."}
{"text":"Pinches makes really good tacos perhaps on the top 5 of all time that I've tried.  The ingredients seem to be really good quality and taste fresh and don't have that \"gamey\" taste you sometimes get at traditional taco places. My favorite is the grilled chicken.  Only reason not giving 5 stars is the counter ordering always seems a little disorganized and they seem to always make you wait even when it's not crowded and though there are like 6 people behind the counter."}
{"text":"First time I came here for lunch and ordered the Al Pastor burrito, it was awesome great ratio of pork,guac, beans, rice, pico, and onion (as described on their menu). Came back a second time got the burrito again and noticed the ratio had changed to mostly beans and rice, thought maybe it was an off night. Came in again tonight ordered Al Pastor burrito to go, what a disappointment very little guac and pico/onion (if any) and all rice and beans. Needless to say I think I will find another burrito place. All rice and beans and no flavor!!"}
{"text":"Employes are very friendly. I enjoyed the decor very much. Very awesome. They make the best handmade tortillas i've had here in Vegas. I will definitely come back here and recommend people to stop by here for a taco or two ..."}
{"text":"For variety, Pinches Tacos is excellent. The menu is quite extensive, boasting a number of tacos, breakfast items, combo plates, sopes, burritos, tortas, taquitos, flautas, enchiladas, soups and sides. There's also a beverage menu that includes cocktails and agua frescas.  We came by one evening, though it was close to closing time so we decided to come back another day so that we wouldn't impose ourselves on the staff who were likely ready to go home by then.  When we returned two days later, we were excited, as we'd seen all the offerings on the menu. My husband decided to order two fish tacos and one nopal taco. I opted for one fish, one nopal, and one pollo mole. Our order came quickly and looked absolutely delicious.  The reviews here about the fish tacos are not wrong; they were incredibly delicious! Topped with slaw and a slightly spicy red salsa, the taco is flavorful. (In fact, the fish tacos alone sway this from being a 1 star review!) The nopal tacos came topped with cotija cheese, but the filling was cold which I did not expect. The pollo mole taco came topped with a red salsa and cotija cheese. While pretty flavorful, there was something slightly off about the taste.  Then, within 6 hours of eating here, I experienced some of the worst food poisoning I'd had in years. The only thing my husband and I could pinpoint, that we'd eaten different from one another all day, was the pollo mole taco. I was very disappointed, as Pinches was one of the places I'd looked forward to visiting even before we arrived in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"gotta say it was the WORSE experience ever!!!...bar tender by the name of Erika was drinking taking shots with people while trying to attend we asked for a split tab specifically telling her what we wanted in each we paid and walked out suddenly another bar tender with short blue hair came out yelling we didn't pay and we needed to return we were embarrassed by her actions we walked back in and we had people at the bar looking at us like we just walked out so obviously it was discussed in front of other customers we talked to Erika she said she made a mistake stood 45 min for her to figure it out!!...trying to reverse transactions and re charge charged us again for what she wanted even tho it didn't make sense!!...VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and the embarrassment we went through was not ok for her mistake!!!!...and mention Javier won't mind because we all make mistakes!!"}
{"text":"Great new location! This is right by my new job... And I miss working downtown since all the good restaurants are there!! It's a very cute restaurant, located in the Gramercy on the back side. Service was fast and great... And food was awesome! I got the potato flautas... Yummy  Definitely will be back once they get their liquor license for happy hours and some margaritas."}
{"text":"Really good food.  The fish tacos and fish burritos are awesome.  Actually all their food is great.  Service quick and friendly. My new go to. weekend late night spot.  Dont forget to treat yourself to a blood orange margarita.  Tasty with a punch."}
{"text":"Really good tacos but their guacamole seems pre-made which was a disappointment :( cool atmosphere and good service but the drinks were also a little pricey"}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from west Hollywood s couple years ago. Seeing pinches tacos reminded me of home' thanks for coming to Vegas"}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually write bad about a business unless I'm really disappointed. I was at an event and me and my coworkers decided we would give this place a try. We got 4 burritos a combination plate and an order of 6 tacos. First they forgot our tacos (which we should of checked the food before we left) the sad part was the big carne asada burrito that seemed just like a bean burrito. Three small pieces of carne asada on all our burritos and just stuffed with refried beens."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     31/100  Influenced by my uncle's enthusiastic love for the Pinches' elote corn, this was the main reason my ohana and I went to Container Park!   This was our first stop at Container Park, and as soon as my uncle parked the SUV he was running off to Pinches.    Quote from my uncle: \"I LOOOOOOOVE the corn, it's sooo GOOD! You have to try it. It's my favorite at the Container!\" This is all he talks about when talking about Container Park. He loves your corn!   I've had the elote corn in a cup from the Vegas outdoor swap meet and I definitely agree, Pinches' elote is sooo good!   They have an extensive menu and I've been following them on Instagram, and I have to say I wish I saved my appetite for this place! We had lunch right before this, and I was too full to eat anything. I managed to eat the whole cob of corn and a drink a cup of beer. Oh! and I got to sip their horchata with cinnamon, it was so good! Better than what I've had at other Mexican restaurants.   Service was 5 star excellente. The women helping us each time we went back for beer were amazing.   I'll definitely be back for the horchata and to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Good food. Large menu with everything Mexican from cactus tacos to Huevos rancheros. The owners and cooks are Mexican. They are from DF Mexico city and the surrounding areas. The food is authentic and delicious. I tried the chicken tacos. very tasty grilled chicken with just the right spice. There is seating inside but its small . I enjoyed outside seating because its on the ground level of container park and I like to see all the activity going on in the park while im eating. The price point is excellent. By the way, they had to remove the \"pinches\" in the sign outside. Im not sure why, I thought it added humor to the place"}
{"text":"I tried the corn and had their carne asada fries. It was very good and filled me up quickly. My husband had to finish my fries.  I couldn't find the hot sauce but it was still excellent!"}
{"text":"Redemption!  They definitely redeemed themselves. The potato flautas and the beef flautas are amazing!  The potato was actually my favorite!  If you haven't tried it,  try it. The best potato flautas I've ever eaten.  So crispy and the taste was just outstanding!"}
{"text":"If I have one word of advice, get the Gringo tacos. Creamy chipotle cream with shredded tender beef fried in a light corn tortilla topped with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. This was my life saver after having a couple of Blood & Cloves with Jameson Black Barrel. Seriously, you need some food to anchor that level of alcohol.  Pinches delivered although they will yell Gringo Tacos at the top of their lungs when you order them. I find no shame it that, I'll eat those tacos with pride. It was a low carb cheat day and I wanted some hot crispy tortillas to fill the void.  My 5 year old liked their basic quesadilla and my husband stole my chicken taquitos after he polished off the carne asada tacos that I had ordered for him. It was a busy Saturday night and we ended up sitting down by JoJo's Jerky but our server found us."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but the was immediately shut down by their tacos. I was so confused as to why the carnitas were just big chunks of meat and had absolutely no flavor even with adding salsa and hot sauce! They only get 2 stars from me cause their carne asada was at least decent and their elote was actually spot on."}
{"text":"I don't remember this place but I started a post and rated 5* so I didn't want to rob this place of due credit so check it out."}
{"text":"I feel like having been ripped off somewhat also. Came with my daughter and ordered her two tacos with fries, for myself a combo plate with 3 tacos/rice/beans and two small drinks. Tacos were like $2.50+ each but total Cost was 33+. Should have ate at Perch or the BBQ place. The tacos were okay, nothing to shout about even if it was made by real Mexicans, as their signs proudly  proclaimed \"Mexican food by real Mexicans\". Cashier did not offer a receipt n I didn't want to hold up people behind us."}
{"text":"I am an extremely picky eater, I don't like most things that go on a taco (i.e. pico de Gallo, guacamole, any onions, cilantro, tomato). So I was really surprised when these ended up being the best tacos I've ever had. I tried the chicken mole and carne asada tacos and forgot to ask for none of the above mentioned stuff on them. I picked off the huge bits of cilantro cause I hate it but even with that and the pico on it, it was enough to make me go \"oh my god\" out loud. Literally the best best tacos I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. Will be returning here time and time again."}
{"text":"Had delicious Pinches Fries which were crispy with quacamole, sour cream, cheese, beef, with or without cilantro. Perfect treat to share with blood orange margaritas which were strong but the perfect amount of strong.   We're visiting from Boston, but this will be a treat we talk about for a long time. Located in the Container shopping district where stores are made out of old shipping containers. A delightful little area to visit on your next trip to Vegas! There's a fire breathing oratory by mantis outside the shops, and a kids play area inside which is extensive."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pastor tacos. Just two tacos for a super hungry 5 year old. Nothing crazy, no giant feast.  Short version: The cashier failed to disclose a 45 minute wait time. After waiting 20 minutes (with 20+ more to go), I went in, cancelled my order and asked for a refund. The cashier then tried to lie and steal his tip back after I paid in cash and left the change as a tip in good faith.   Long version:  The total was $6 and some change. I have never had an issue here, so I paid $8 in cash and told the cashier to keep the change as a tip in good faith. Little did I know, the guy failed to disclose that it was a 45+ minute wait. A group of 3 guys that were already waiting before us went in to ask how long it would be for theirs, my son and I had been waiting for 20 minutes ourselves, and the guys reported that it would be another 15 at least for theirs.   What the heck!!! I went in and spoke to the cashier, who immediately copped an attitude and refused to acknowledge that he should have communicated to customers about the excessive wait times. I canceled my order and asked for a refund.  He complied and gave me the money for the tacos but THEN he tried to lie and tell me he gave me the change back so he could keep the tip!!! THAT is what really set me off and prompted me to write this review.   I refuse to support a business that has straight up dishonest and sketchy employees."}
{"text":"My family was visiting Las Vegas from MN and walked to the container park. We looked around and it was neat, then my mom saw this restaurant and decided she was hungry. I am so glad she did, this was some of the most delicious Mexican food we had ever had. I had the taco platter and the steak was so, so tender and flavorful. I don't think I have ever had steak like that- it was amazing. My brother had the nachos and we could have eaten those all day. The chips are crisp and the portions were very generous. My mom ordered a special none of us could pronounce and truthfully we didn't know what she would be getting. TO DIE FOR. It was 2 chimichangas with beef and it was enough for 2 people. I am legit still thinking about the food, it was amazing."}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos on Russell Rd. is a hidden gem. Very tasty food! Very fast service! Very friendly people!  I had the Huevos Mexicanos. Some of the best Chorizo con Huevos that I have had in a long time. They use the good Mexican cheese! The tortillas were also the best!   I will be back on my next visit to Vegas!!!!  muchas gracias amigos!!!!?"}
{"text":"Perfect.  Nice Pinches portions, big pinches menu, fresh pinches food, decent pinches margaritas, reasonable pinches prices, all from the pinches Anaya family.   I loved the joto chicken taco, the pendejo homemade tortillas, the puto chips, the perra guacamole, and the tu hermano no tiene la ingle carne asada fries (though the fries weren't crispy as advertised).    ...best of all, it's in the Container Park, which is a clean, safe, and interesting oasis within the somewhat trashy and desolate peestain-friendly block beside Fremont."}
{"text":"Got a blood orange margarita and chicken mole burrito. The burrito came with chips (would have liked to have a little more) and was pretty good. They had a good menu selection and authentic food."}
{"text":"Normally I'm completely in love with everything I get here but tonight... not so much. The Carne asade nachos were lacking meat and there was no tomatoes or salsa. The lady at the register,  apparently a newer manager, was not paying attention. She was so busy saying hi to other people she didn't hear what I was asking and kept deleting the wrong part of the order.  I hope she isn't there the next time. Javier is amazing."}
{"text":"Here's my professional review. Mark and I stopped in for dinner this evening.  Our waitress was great. Polite, friendly and quick.  The food was good. Loved the green salsa on the tacos.  We were a little upset that they didn't serve a frozen margarita, but the ones they did serve were pretty good.  The major negative was how noisy the place was. Part of the reason is they were holding some sort of an event there. The other reason was because there were a couple of kids running around screeching at the top of their lungs.   The food was good and the servings were good size.  I'd visit here again. Hopefully next time it's a little quieter."}
{"text":"First of all, let me just say that the tacos are awesome. I've gone twice and tried 4 different kinds. The Mexican corn on the cob and the queso dip are great too. However, the rice and beans are bland, bland, bland. I'd definitely give it a higher rating if it weren't so expensive. 3 individual (tiny but delicious) tacos, a half order of the queso dip with chips, and a regular size fountain drink should not cost $17."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I was looking for.  The decor is amazing, the staff is extremely friendly and of course the food is 5 stars.  I ended up getting a variety of tacos, queso and chorizo dip, Micheladas and some aged 1946 Don Julio neat.  I wish they had one of these in LA. Oh wait, they have four of them! Perfect!"}
{"text":"This is no Baja Fresh. This is a place for real foodies looking to get away from normal day to day \"Mexican\". Good location in container park, clean, and great menu selection. Homemade tortillas. I would recommend the lengua tacos. Decent prices, and a good vibe.   Owner comes around and asks how everything is going. I wish that more restaurants would take notes."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Order the Gringo and Carne Assad Tacos  will definitely come back during their happy hour"}
{"text":"I went with two stars because most times I come here, I would probably give it four stars. I love their blood orange margaritas and corn. The Gringo tacos and the nachos are delicious too. However, today is the second time I have came here and sat in the bar seating and no one ever took my drink order! After waiting for 15 minutes, i left... It wasnt even busy..,"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because the service here has gone down so much. I ordered shrimp Tacos by the bar on a busy. They took forever. I asked 4 additional times where it was to the older bartender with the attitude. One hour later, I left with a freeze cold quesadilla and incorrect tacos. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place today, had the Pescado burrito cuz I like to try new shit and it's amazing!!! Service is great, food is orgasmic. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Bien ricos los pinches elotes!!!"}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos is freakin awesome.  It's a 'hole in the wall' well worth trying.  The Container Park has a cool flaming bug in the front with music playing.  They also have a nice kids area where they can run around.   The food is fantastic.  I later emailed them to see if I could purchase a gift card but never heard back.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at this place! It's in the gramercy complex southwest. The tacos are great and Fernando one of the owners was great! The staff was so friendly and the food was great! Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Cool place in the artsy Container Park downtown Gentrification at its finest. Good food with the hipster flare."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic tasty mexican food? This is not the place. I mean don't  get me wrong. The tortillas are about the only thing thats is really good. They are hand made.  I ordered tacos de adasa combination which came with a side of rice and beans. The meat is bland not seasoned, the beans taste like canned rosarita beans and you have to ask for salsa (also no flavor) And if you want more you have to ask, which they will bring you a small half filled container. Also i think we over paid. Combination plate was $9.95 + .50 more for asada. My husband had a asada burrito and also just ok ($10.45)  Horchata drink was good. $3.00. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The taco plate was a perfect sample of their food. It the Asada tacos was my personal favorite. The tortillas were hand made, and fresh cooked to order. They complimented the dish! They were also served with refried beans, rice, and fresh cooked chips. The salsa was freshly made as well. Highly recommended for anyone looking for fresh Mexican!"}
{"text":"It is worth the drive, the place is really good, the concept is unique and very original, very clean and colorful, the staff is nice and friendly, the food is good especially the tortillas are handmade, you can bring the family and also have a bar just for drinks and friends,I will recommend the place"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool, service was great and the food was awesome! We will be back! The tacos are a la carte, I had the shrimp and a fish taco with Tortilla soup, I liked that it had the option of no chicken. My boyfriend  (Mexican) said it reminded him of home."}
{"text":"Really nice place, has its own style which makes it different. Service was okay, it was dead so the staff just stayed in a corner talking the entire time. You would think because it's dead they would be more attentive.  But regardless of the staff the food was pretty good. I liked the homemade tortillas, definitely made a difference. I would have to say great place to go and chill after work with some friends."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food I got a corn on the cob my siblings got a burrito and carne asada fries we enjoyed them all! I find the the name very funny it translates to fucking tacos!  & yes the food is real Mexican food made by real Mexican people ! The table covers remind me of my grandmas house in Mexico which is pretty cool! I really enjoyed this place and will definitely come back. The taste of food is really good and all but took much guac and rice and not enough meat :("}
{"text":"First, let me say that the tacos are good. Also, it's a cool hang out spot.  I've been coming here several times over the past year and it seems that the service could be better. I know more about the bartenders personal lives than I should. A lot of gossip between coworkers. It's honestly the last thing a customer cares to hear.   The last time we came in they were out of a margarita...? The lady was a little rude and unsanitary.   :("}
{"text":"Just ok,  definitely not real Mexican.  1 star above taco bell.  Pricey for the quality of food you get.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food and I love the ambience, but kinda pricey. The restaurant is very unique that you feel modern. The service is a little bit long, but of course I must expect that since this is not a food truck."}
{"text":"The blood orange Rita is good!! The street corn is the best though. The girl working the register was friendly but she was clearly new. I got a gringo, roasted chicken, and shrimp taco. Says it on the receipt too however my plate came out with 2 beef tacos. They took it back and brought 2 chicken tacos. Still never got my shrimp tacos :("}
{"text":"Went here for an afternoon lunch sat outside. Great location new area of town. Service was alright, not enough staff to accommodate lunch hour. Bartender was hoping the bar area from the inside and back outside while serving us drinks and food. She was funny made this visit memorable. Never seen service with a jumping bartender. Lol...Ordered a chicken burrito it was okay but nothing to come back for. My boyfriend ordered enchiladas and taco meal. Enchilada sauce seemed more like marinara sauce for pasta.... Humm thought this was REAL mexican food...If you want to get a quick Mexican meal just go to Robertos instead of wasting your time here with over priced mexican/ italian food... Oh ya forgot to include the bathroom area men's bathroom door was wide open while i was waiting to use the ladies room crap stains all over the toilet  . Not coming back here!"}
{"text":"VERY mediocre food at inflated prices. Two combo plates, chips and salsa, one water, one beer was over $40. Guy at the counter was nice and the Michelada he made for me was good, but I wouldn't eat here again for half the price. The food just isn't very good. Also long wait and no ice in their soda fountain."}
{"text":"What a fun local find! A friend recommended this place to me and I was not disappointed! Everything was really good and the prices are very reasonable. Fun atmosphere and all the staff was friendly and attentive. They have a bar area and outdoor seating as well. It's in a cute little upscale outdoor shopping center that sadly doesn't have much else in it yet. Anyways food was awesome. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They advertise \"Real Mexicans food made by real Mexicans\" . That's funny . If you're in that area, take the time to drive down Charleston and go to \"Tacos el Gordo\" or even right across from it \"Los Tacos\". Very bland food, no flavor at all. Also over priced for their 5\" diameter torts."}
{"text":"Loved this place at the Container Park in Down Town Las Vegas and was excited to see it at the Gramacy on Russell.  The place is real cute.   One tip, ask for hotter salsa. The Diablo salsa is delish. Staff is fun and amazing."}
{"text":"I've ordered a carne asada burrito from almost everywhere in the city, just to find a place that even compares with a place in California. This has by far been the best, though a little steep for a little container shop at around $10 for food and drink."}
{"text":"Very very underwhelming. They really seemed to get annoyed when you ask for stuff like a simple knife. Oh well. Won't be coming back here ?"}
{"text":"Really good street tacos, at downtown (high-ish) prices. Having said that, their menu is extensive and each different taco is incredibly taste. Located inside the container park, you can enjoy your tacos overlooking the courtyard in the summer and relax. Their food is very authentic and you can tell it is made fresh, right on the premises. Also, do not be intimated by the extensive menu, they will definitely recommend something based on your taste buds and you will love it! I mean, what is not to love about tasty guacamole, fresh salsa, and tender al pastor pork?  Stop by the place, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Its hard to sell me on lengua but totally the ticket. Habanero salsa was the cherry on top. Ill be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Food and drink was really good but it's expensive. Great service. Had music it's a small place hidden."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after the MLK parade.  Good food, nothing to write home about.  Fresh and hot street style tacos.  We did a mixture of beef and chicken ones.    All good, not great -- just good.  Green sauces were much better than BBQ (pollo mole) or red ones.  Picnic table style eating.   Make sure you sit in the shade -- it does get warm on those benches, even though outside air temps were in 60s.  Container park is fun place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"My friends who live in Vegas recommended us to eat here, and I urge you to try it if you haven't. Shout out to the chefs who cooked up our meal and did not keep us waiting for long. We were hungry, we came thirsty for some dos X cocktails, and we did not get let down.   We brought a big crew with us and gave warning a few days before. When we arrived, on the roof of Pinches, they'd put a table together to seat all 13 of us.   I stood at the front of the line and got each member of the group to tell the cashier their order; she was patient, friendly and a lot of fun. Same with the chefs; whilst I waited for people to decide what food they wanted to order (we all got the three combination taco plate, some couldn't decide what mix of tacos they wanted), I joked around with them in Spanish - they were good sports and were really focused in delivering for us.  End result? 13 happy out of towners who got served in the best way possible. Food comas all round. I highly recommend the Chilaquiles!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service in a great location,  but those qualities are overshadowed by largely bland and tasteless tacos al pastor,  carne asada,  and carnitas. The beans and rice had to come from a white labeled can that simply reads \"beans and rice\"."}
{"text":"Cool taco sport in The Gramercy Center . Mexican Corn \" Elotes \" was very good . Tacos & Enchiladas were pretty good . I'll visit again if I'm in the area ."}
{"text":"In my opinion one of the best taco spots in Vegas and this is come from a real hispanic"}
{"text":"We stopped by for some tacos before we went to the Fremont experience. I was actually surprised on how good they were. I totally fell in love con su salsa verde! The only thing I wasn't  really a fan of was the tortilla as soon as I picked it up it ripped and the edges were a bit hard. A bit pricy too! Almost $4 for each taco!  Friendly staff can't leave them out the girls were nice! Overall the place/food was good I would come back though."}
{"text":"Very good, very nice area (Container Park). Highly recommend the Asada and Carnitas Tacos, get the combo (3 tacos, rice, chips,and re fried beans). Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Service was good until our waitress decided to go eat while serving us and not tell anyone . So we sat there a good 20 min . Than my husband had to get up and ask another worker can we pay. Food has no flavor . Salsa has no flavor . My husband ordered flautas and got taquitos . Overall I'll go to robertos before I come back here ."}
{"text":"First time to Container Park.  Walked around and decided to try this place.  The inside is tight quarters but there's a nice outdoor patio.  Staff was friendly.  Great chips and salsa.  Had the three taco combo and a Dos Equis on tap.  Carne Asada, Chicken Mole and Pescado (fish.)   Tortilla was soft but held together nicely and the meat and fish were a generous portion, well seasoned and tender.  Look forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Food was great and the staff was very friendly, great local spot. However, not a fan of the fish tacos. The must try menu items are the gringo tacos, carne asada tacos and the corn(its prepared off the husk with mayo and chili pepper in a bowl, super yummy!) Love the decor and the vibe. Staff was super nice, although service was a bit slow but it was pretty steady so i didnt mind:)"}
{"text":"Food Is Great  SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!!  Need a new staff that's more service oriented.  Being going to PEPE's instead"}
{"text":"Had the Al Pastor Tacos, 3 would have been enough to fill me up but they were so good I ate the 4th one I ordered also."}
{"text":"I've came here THREE times in one week before, could you tell I was obsessed!?  First time I brought my parents to experience this place in cute Gramercy plaza. The ambiance and vibe when you walk in is super trendy and cute. They told us to sit anywhere so we sat near by the food order station. Then we had a server come up and take our order. I ordered the carne asada fries and let me tell you, it was the BEST CARNE ASADA FRIES EVER! I was hooked! Then I decided to order churros with the horchata ice cream on top for dessert. Wow, talk about cherry on top. It was so good and it came with 4 mini churros and the scoop of ice cream in the middle!   Second and Third time I went with a few friends and ordered the same thing cause I was that OBSESSED! We went for event one time and the place was packed, but you can tell it was family owned that night since the whole family came out to help! It was awesome!  Totally a great spot to come and enjoy real authentic Mexican food with trendy vibes."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try Pinches before an event in container park!  The food was amazing! The taco tortillas Arhaus me daily, and the taco selection has a wide array of vegetables including fresh cilantro and pico-also there's a large selection of different kinds of meats and Styles to get your tacos made.  There was so much to choose from, so for our first visit I decided to stick with tacos and some flautas which are corn tortillas rolled with meat inside. I loved the guacamole and how it was full of flavor and not onions! I definitely want to come back to try the tortas which are Mexican sandwiches and I also want to try some more from the gringo menu which made me chuckle.   The staff was very friendly at pinches tacos. I came back to get my husband some food to go and the owners and employees all remembered me and were open to my crazy little jokes and laugh and smiled the whole time."}
{"text":"I love this place !!! The decor and the staff are very friendly.  You can't get more AUTHENTIC THAN THIS!!!  Only place where i found original oaxaca mole tacos .The food is amazing! I myself are mexican. For me to go eat at a Mexican restaurant, where most likely I can get it at home is rare. The prices are reasonable and the food is on point!"}
{"text":"Great place for fast Mexican in Vegas; their Mexican street corn is good, potato flautas good, taquitos good...it's not the best Mexican food you'll ever have, but the standard is consistent and definitely higher than a fast food Mexican place like Qdoba or Chipotle, so you will always get the same quality and be happy. I love Container Park, too."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite food spot downtown and my favorite Mexican place in Vegas. Great atmosphere. Amazing service. Incredible food. Quickly served hot and delicious. I recommend the burrito. Can't go wrong with this place and a table overlooking the fire mantis on top of their \"container.\" About a 20 minute drive from me but worth every mile and every penny."}
{"text":"Food was really great, staff was really friendly, and super cool atmosphere. My only complaint is, I'm allergic to peanuts and it was not on the menu that the molé sauce is made with peanuts. Partly my fault, I didn't know, and didn't ask. I just think it would be really helpful if it was stated on the menu like most places. Hopefully it will prevent someone else from an allergic reaction. Overall it is a cool place to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service is ok. The employee who took our order was kinda rude. But the food kinda made up for it. The elote is great and the potato flautas are delicious and not too over fried. One of the best micheladas too."}
{"text":"I guess I'm biased when it come to Mexican food because I'm Mexican an know what it's supposed to taste like. I ordered the potato flautas and the corn the flautas were ok but very soft and had tomato sauce on them which I have never seen on flautas.  The corn on the other hand looked beautiful but when I bit into it I was instantly disappointed. It was hard and so hard to eat. :(  I was there with a friend who ordered tacos which though she was starving could not eat because the meat was tasteless and to chewy to enjoy.  Overall this place was a bust."}
{"text":"I have only tried the cactus and roast chicken tacos but both are delicious, albeit pricey. 6 tacos came out to around $18 with tip. Service is fast, not especially friendly but not rude either. The restaurant itself is cute but I have only ever ordered to-go, never dined in. Great authentic street style tacos!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR!! $2 tacos are a great deal.  I only ordered the mole, carnitas and adobada but hey we're amazing. I also had the the blood orange margarita and that was strong but good. For $4 u can't beat that.   OMG the corn is to die for.  It beats going to the park and trying to find an elotero with the fresh corn ."}
{"text":"What was I thinking waiting so long coming in???? I came in Friday during the busy week of BIKE FEST and I had the fish tacos and they were made fresh and right there and so yummy!!!!  And the prices were affordable .... You must go!   :) support Downtown LasVegas small businesses!"}
{"text":"I only tried their Pollo Not Nachos and it was really good. We gobbled it down and got seconds. They were a little weird about people taking pictures. A lady was ask not to take pictures of the menu. I thought that was odd. Their slogan was real Mexican food by real Mexicans...or something like that. I thought it was pretty authentic! Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Visited during the Life Is Beautiful event in September. Food was decent, but a few days later when the charge hit my credit card I found that they gave themselves a $25 tip on a $27 check. OK, I understand they were busy and someone probably just mis-entered it... no big deal. However, after trying unsuccessfully for 2 months to get it corrected I'm done with this place.  Tried repeatedly to get in touch with the local manager. Finally did after about 6 tries. He took my info and said he would correct it, but never did. After that, any time I've called (no matter what time of day) the manager isn't there. Tried to contact their offices in CA directly and via social media, but no response there either. Just poor customer service all around.  Adiós, Pinches."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with coworkers. What a unique spot! The food truck (I'm guessing the original pinches tacos) is IN the restaurant and it's still where you order!  The decor reminds me of a food truck park too. Log picinic benches, wire fencing, and bright colors and thing hanging down. I had the chicken tortilla soup and carne Asada fries and both were tremendous! The chicken tortilla soup was creamy and delicious. Would definitely return for more.   A little surprising but their chips were pretty subpar. A little stale and a bit on the thicker side =\"}
{"text":"Nice location and interior deco, friendly staff (although bit forgetful waiters on 2 tables waiting)  Tacos are not so pleasing, pastor meat quite chewy, lingua not cooked so well, the nopales salad too slimy and frijoles to be honest would be embarrassment to any amateur cook, dry and seem Old.  They need to step up their kitchen act, place looks like great potential.  Oh, and both drinks I ordered from the menu were not available....but that can happen sometimes.  On top of all the above pleasures, they add open food items $0.50 on the bill which is no where on the menu, when asked the lady claim that this is extra costs for the lengua....LMAO !!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times  Great little hidden place  Beautiful atmosphere  Great food Fast service"}
{"text":"Love the look.  The Bar doesn't carry lemons or oranges so was a little disappointing when ordering drinks.  The waitress was supper nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"Really cool spot. The restaurant theme is bad ass. The food is good and one of the owners was there. He was super down to earth. The flautas are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Not a fan  I ordered the chicken enchiladas. The chicken was dry and tasted canned.  The service was ridiculous.  Very slow, unfamiliar with the menu, and unconcerned for the customer.   The waitress also was too distracted taking shots with bar customers rather than taking our order.  In addition, their fryer was broke so there were many menu items not available.  The staff overall was very immature and had high school mentality.   The only thing I enjoyed about this experience was their decor of graffiti and the indoor taco truck was cool.  But not cool enough to suffer through the lack of service and below average food."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place 5 stars, but the service is non existent. Tacos are great, the salsa is bland, the guacamole is basically only avocado with no other additives such as cilantro, onions, salt, pepper, jalapeño, etc. I'm really unsure how this place has 4.5 stars, must be friends and family giving good reviews. If your hungry for tacos and have 1.5hrs to waste waiting for drinks, food and sub par service.... Then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The location always threw me off about this place but once I got there, the energy and vibe made me feel like I was in another city. so vibrant with great selection of music while seeing the views of the chef at work.  I consider this place a 'quick service' restaurant minus the quick. I walked in very confused; wasn't sure if I went up to the 'food truck' to place my order or sat down and had a server come to us. The gentlemen, not 100% sure of his role told us to choose any seat and a server would come to us. This guy was the one we placed our drink order with; micheleda and a Bloody Mary. I felt like the process was very delayed in getting drinks but then again there was only one bartender for a Saturday night. Aside from that, the drinks were perfectly made! Our actual server came by and took our order. We placed chips and salsa as our appetizer because let's be real, if a Mexican place failed at a good guacamole and salsa dish then we would be in for a not so good Mexican experience. This place passed! It reminded me of my best friends mother true authentic cooking. Our order was in and was eyeing everything that came by. Mind you, there were only 3 tables at this time. We devoured our entrees and continued to sit at our table with no drinks; water or adult beverage. yet, the server just leaned up against the truck with her colleague and chatted while making direct contact with us and never approaching us with 'is there anything else' we can get for you.  As a service critic, when a server drops off a dish that you ordered and sees an empty one, they should take it. Well, dishes piled up quick!  This place does lack service and has a very very laid back vibe so if you're there with no time constraint, it's definitely worth it.  Again, great energy, pricing is affordable and great food. I just wish their service was more focused on the little things."}
{"text":"Just became my number one taco joint!  Had their al pastor and lengua taco and both were deliciouss! that al pastor is special.   Will be my go to spot at container park.   The use of comic sans on their sign has been forgiven."}
{"text":"I'm not really a Mexican food person but this is my favorite Mexican/taco place by far and really impressed me!   First, I'm in love with the interior decor and atmosphere. They really spent some time to emphasis the theming and branding. This is something that will always draw my attention and earn my respect!  We got two of the taco combos with 5 different kinds of meat - carne asada, beef tongue, fish, shrimp, and roasted chicken. It's really so hard for me to pick a favorite because they're all really delicious in its own way! But if I really have to pick.. I'll say carne asada and the shrimp.   The chips that come with the combo is also good and made fresh, little too salty though. And my true favorite thing here that will definitely make me come back is the CORN! Sooooo delicious! Juicy, flavorful, huge, and so sweeet! Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A good atmosphere and delicious food. Strongly recommend the gringos tacos."}
{"text":"Cat the bartender is amazing! She is a hustler behind the bar and very cool to talk to! Here when the Knights beat the Jets to go to Stanley Cup! The tacos are very good too!! #Vegas #BestBars"}
{"text":"Can definitely say it's REAL Mexican food!! Habenero salsa is mouth on fire.amazimgly.hot!!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical but this place was so good I had to get the asada fries and the asada burrito and it was way better than I had expected. All of the ingredients were fresh, the line was about 8-10 people but my order was taken in less than 3 minutes. The atmosphere was great and so was the price. I will definitely be back, I can't wait to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"If they're busy don't expect decent service. Spent over 30 minutes in line for them to take two peoples orders to just say forget it. Their food isn't worth the 45minute to an hour wait."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Delicious and probably the most authentic tasting Mexican street tacos that I've had in Vegas so far. Love the happy hour $2 tacos from 3-7 and all night on Sunday and Monday.  Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"THIS is how you do mexican food.  I love everything about this place, from the decor to the staff and the incredible food.  Hands down the best tortas I've ever had.  I am thrilled that I work so close by."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and they serve authentic Mexican food. I got two shrimp tacos and one asada. The asada was great. The shrimp was fried. My co workers didn't like the shrimp, but I thought it was good. It's an order from the counter type place, which can cause the line to back up. I recommend this place. Next time I'm trying a Bloody Beer!"}
{"text":"Pinches tacos is alright ??? I didn't really like the tacos very much but the elote is pretty good Becuase it's huge. The reason why I say the tacos are okay, it's Becuase the tortilla was falling apart a lot and the meat was kind of dry. It's pretty expensive for just three tacos and I paid about $11+. I don't know didn't really hit my spot in this one."}
{"text":"Came to Container Park for the Vegas Knights game. The menu to this spot looked really yummy so we decided to try it out. I ended up getting the horchata and nachos de pollo (chicken nachos). My friend got a carne asada torra. On my nachos they forgot to add beans so I was bummed out about that but overall they were good. My friend asked for no cream (she's lactose intolerant) and they did added cream to her torta. The horchata was bland. Overall not a bad place, the service was great the ladies were very friendly."}
{"text":"The place is welcoming, trendy, nicely decorated, clean, spacious, and family friendly. The downside is the food is not good at all. I had the three pinche taco combo and tried the fish taco, chicken mole taco, and the carne asada taco with rice and beans. I did not like how anything tasted. The tacos come preseasoned with a sweetish salsa taste. I'm not into sweet salsa. There was no salsa bar either. We were told the tortillas are freshly made so I ordered a few. When the tortillas came, I was disappointed because they tasted like the tortillas sold at the supermarket, and not hand made gorditas. I'm not going back. I'm not sure why this place has so many five ratings and am wondering if the reviews are friends or employees of pinche tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos, sopes, flan, agua fresca, and everything was great! Delicioso!! Hubby and one year old daughter loved food too. Definitely coming back since it's close to home and good flavor food."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this is in Container Park! To start things off, the menu was hilarious. They have a chalk board menu that was split between their regular menu and the \"Gringo\" menu. That one included chimichangas, tacos that had lettuce, sour cream, etc.  I had elotes, two tacos, and some chips and salsa. The chips that they used were delicious! You can tell their tortillas are homemade. The tortillas for my tacos were also homemade, delicious, and held up really well to the taco meat. I ordered the al pastor and Adobada. The Adobada wasn't very flavorful--I felt that it needed some type of sauce. The al pastor was delicious! Loved the flavors.  The elotes were, of course, to die for. A must try!"}
{"text":"Now this place is the real MVP! FORGET (Tacos el Gordo)! FORGET (ROBERTOS)! FORGET (Don Tortaco)! This place is the real deal. So good, it got me to write my first review on here! When we walked in, I was pleased how clean and friendly the staff was. The ambiance of the place was great also! Now the food was AMAZING! I got the tacos. It tasted really fresh, and the meat was cooked to perfection! Very flavorful!!! I was even pleased with the salsa! I hate going to places and asking for their spiciest and when I get it, it's not. Except for here, it was really spicy! I LOVED it! My boyfriend got the carne asada fries and he said they were BOMB! He said the avacado was reeeealllly good! Totally worth the price! Now I don't always eat Mexican food, but when I do, I choose PINCHES TACOS! Choose wisely my friends! Lol! :)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Very authentic!!!  We come down to container park just to eat here!!  It's small with a few tables inside and plenty of seating outside and upstairs. I love the asada, so moist and tasteful. The tortilla shells are homemade, soft and the best damn corn tortilla I've ever had.    They use all fresh ingredients.    The service is a hit or miss with friendliness."}
{"text":"This place is in a little strip mall that's in downtown. It was just a mile away from my motel so my bf and I decided to walk.  He got carne asada fries and I got chilaquiles and they were both really good. They use seasoned fries for the carne asada fries. I enjoyed that the chilaquiles were crispy and came with guacamole and sour cream. Their guacamole is FIRE !!!  This place is a must when in downtown !"}
{"text":"I've given this place a couple different tries... the staff is always so careless and lazy. I don't ask for much, being that I only order takeout. Knowing that this location is open til 11pm; I ordered at 10pm. Plenty of time to make an order and close out. The cashier always has an attitude, and her \"boyfriend\" is the one doing the transaction. Whoever owns this spot, is clearly not aware of the staff and the direct effect that leads to downfall."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend Maria A. last night (12/11/13) for dinner last night. I had never been to the container park so I had to look at the menu from outside the shop to make sure it was the right place.   My phone was dead almost a second after I walked in, so I had to stay in place while I waited for Maria to show up. There are only a few tables, but that's okay. At first I was a bit startled because of the flame shooting praying mantis outside literally shakes the building!   I ordered a lengua taco and a sope de pollo. Instead I got charged for two sopes and no lengua taco. They gave me two sopes and I asked when my taco was coming. When I realized the discrepancy, I told them that it was okay, but they still gave me the taco on the house, which was nice.   Maria got a burrito and I believe she really liked it. I also gave her my second sope and she loved it.   I want to go back to try a few more items before I up the stars because I currently feel that Tacos El Gordo has them beat. The service is great but the food is just okay to me."}
{"text":"Pinches Tacos is the reason I came to Container Park again. I looooove their food here!   The first time I came here, I got the Chicken Nachos which were BOMB. They came with queso fresco too, which I love and is such a deal maker kind of topping for me. I also got their Watermelon Juice which was just a lovely as the nachos.  The second time I came to Pinches Tacos, I got their Elote, which tastes just as good as the elote you get from the neighborhood carts! I tried the Blood Orange Margarita, but ended up just trading it for a Watermelon Juice because the margarita was much too strong for me at that time.  Anyway, go to Pinches Tacos! They have real Mexican food that you will love!"}
{"text":"Food:9/10 Service:10/10 Price:10/10 Atmosphere:10/10  Pinches Taco is one of the few places I could eat at every single day and love it every single time. We go here every so often and we've never been disappointed. Taco Tuesday is a must! The food is to die for and it tastes even better when mixed with the chill atmosphere and great service you get whole you're there. 5/5 would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, we tried 3 different tacos they all were great. The staff is so warm and welcoming and so are the owners."}
{"text":"bomb bomb bomb. carne asada fries blows robertos out the water. the taco plate rocked too. the horchata was the business too."}
{"text":"On my first visit to this location there was a hair in my taco. I came back because I wanted to give them a second chance. The Coke machine was out of flavors and when asked about this, one of the female employees responded, \"that's life.\" Instead, she could have apologized and said she was working on fixing it. The food is average at best. I guess if you're into Americanized Mexican food served up with a bad attitude, it's a place to try. Won't be back fellow yelpers but I wish you all the best!"}
{"text":"Quite different but very delicious! Their spicy bloody orange margarita is outstanding. I ordered the pollo mole tacos and they were very good! I wish the tacos came with rice and beans but you have to pay extra for it. I also ordered the Mexican corn in a cup and that was also very good!"}
{"text":"It was OK Mexican food. Nothing to write home about, because I can get better Mexican food at home. I had taquitos and beans and rice. It was all decent. blood orange margarita, which was okay. Not much flavor. I wasn't super impressed. I probably wouldn't return to try anything else, either."}
{"text":"So gud! Their tacos are amazing and as far as i know they're authentic. I like the fish and al pastor tacos. Almost 4 stars bc Ive had one of their burritos before but i wasnt a fan & I wouldnt order it again. My dad always talks about their blood orange margarita, so try that! My favorite thing is that they always play selena's music!! And not selena gomez.. the og selena! My dad said hes been here over 30 times LOL and he would give it 5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to put it out there into the universe and let you experience the love, hope and joy that is Chicken Oaxacan Mole tacos. I've found my true culinary love and when I am put to rest my tombstone will read \"He loved Pinche's Chicken Oaxacan Mole Tacos."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour.    The blood orange  margaritas were a huge hit with the crowd.     The burritos were also quite tasty.  We did carnitas and Asada.  They have an outdoor seating area and a decent sized bar.   This is an ideal after work spot with the team.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night, and it was not busy.  I thought it was a bit strange that one of the workers or owners was sitting at the bar and another was sitting at one of the booths when we came in.  Once we were greeted and served they both went back there.  I guess it  seems a little unprofessional to me.  The decor was unique,  but the chairs uncomfortable.   The food was very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Craving for Mexican food and ready for a late lunch, my boyfriend and I walked over there from Freemont Street after reading the reviews... And for us it was a hit!  I went for a combo plate with 3 tacos, rice, beans and chips and my BF went for the burrito with lengua. We also took a plate of chips, salsa and guacamole.  The plate with salsa and guacamole was very good, both dips were so fresh, not overwhelmed with spices so you could actually taste the flavor of the avocados and of the salsa. The chips were great too! I got the al pastor, carnitas and pollo mole tacos. Neither of them disappoint. The meats tasted great and well prepared. Personally I actually prefer when the tacos are coming with just one tortilla, you are full less quickly. The sides were both very good too, particularly the beans.  Regarding, the burrito. My boyfriend said the meat was excellent and with a great taste of lengua. It is not over packed with rice. And the cilantro finish to give a fresh taste.   Now the service... The all crew was very friendly. When we entered, we looked at the board to decide what to get and the waitress just told us to take our time and go at the cashier when we were ready, it was nice. For once we didn't feel rushed into making a decision. After getting our food, both the cook and the waitress came to check if everything was ok and seemed very pleased when we told them we greatly appreciated the food.  Finally, regarding the quantity-price. The portion size are good for us (both European). We were both full at the end of our meal and felt that the price were quite good for the quantity and quality of the food you get."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting ! Bland flavorless food ! Don't believe the hype. Mediocre micheladas , flavorless tacos and to top it off EXPENSIVE !! Not even my kids are their food"}
{"text":"WHAT TO GET? Pinches Combination Plate, of course!  You get 3 tacos (add $0.50 for asada and/or seafood tacos) along with rice and beans. Chips.  I got Carnitas, Al Pastor, and Fish Tacos.  Of the 3, I'd probably only get the al pastor ones again. The other two were good, but I can do without them next time.  They've got a bunch of other stuff on their menu so check them out but this is a sweet deal! And around this time, it's nice to sit out there in the day with the sun shining on you. Perfect sweater weather with some nice Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was great - fresh tortillas, nice portion and nicely marinated meats. Decor is an A. Had 3 tacos chicken and pork - both were excellent. I'll be back with the family next time. I've been to the one at the container park and they've done a great job transitioning to a full restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Two items for dinner: a beef sope and a fish taco. The sope was, surprisingly, disappointing--just not much in the way of flavor. The taco was better, and something that I would get again. But given the price point of the sope, I would give them only 3 instead of 4. If I go again I'd just get tacos."}
{"text":"It was OK. The server was super nice and the food was just ok.  I will say while I wasn't blown away by the tacos the carne asada fries were awesome.  I probably wouldn't go back unless I was close by and in a time crunch."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this place, the food was very bland! Not well seasoned at all. I've had better salsa from a jar off a grocery shelf. About average price for a sit down place in town. Waitress was hard to flag down for a night when not even half the restaurant was occupied."}
{"text":"This location is in a condo development. Definitely a different set up, but it's convenient for the residents who live above the restaurant. First impression looked like a food truck inside of a building. Pretty neat idea. The flautas were AMAZING. Overall atmosphere is chill. The servers were attentive and friendly. The only thing that bothered me was the cracks between the tables were filled with some kind of silicone. It looked pretty dirty so even if they cleaned the table you could still see the leftover crumbs or dirt on the table."}
{"text":"The atmosphere alone gives this restaurant an automatic 5 stars. The food is actually authentic and the service is always phenomenal!! If you haven't tried their micheladas,  your are in the dark!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Disclaimer: ***I dont ever rate or review for incentives or freebies."}
{"text":"I frequent here. The staff is very friendly and honest. They give the best seggestions  and help. Happy hour is amazing. And it's super relaxed."}
{"text":"Went to taco shop it was good the guy was really nice I love the habanero salsa so much!! So spicy sopes are so huge you really only need 1!! Margarita was really good there was a bug in the first one that flew in they were happy to replace it no problem! We will see you soon"}
{"text":"Great food, environment, and service! We went in on a football Sunday for our 1st visit and loved it. We had a great Bartender and found her to be very attentive and welcoming."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before but never made a review.  On this occasion, we didn't eat we just ordered margaritas.   I like the food here.  The menu is kind of large and makes your head hurt a little but if you go in with an idea of what you want, you'll be fine.  I've had tacos and nachos here in the past.  Very good.  They're a little pricey but I think a lot of things at the Container Park are kind of pricey.  I feel like all the places charge a lot.  The margaritas were ok.  Very strong but also very sweet.  I felt like I needed way more ice to weaken it a little.  Next time I know to ask for an extra cup of ice on the side."}
{"text":"OMG... I love this place! Everything about this place is fabulous! The food and cocktails are absolutely the best you will find. I love authentic food and this place hits the mark every time. You won't find a better happy hour for the quality. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is everything you could hope for. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Had a business associate introduce me to Pinches Tacos.  Best Tacos I have had in a long time.  I brought clients with me and had a good experience again.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Great variety and reasonably priced - can't beat that!  Try the guacamole, but head's up....it's spicy! Not mind-blowingly so but a little surprising. Especially for my wife who doesn't like spicy food - she ate it anyway.   I also got the chicken flautas. Plenty of chicken filling, great sauce on top and a dollop of guac as well.   Great place and a nice place to hang out. There are only a few seats inside but plenty outside where you can see the show of Container Park going on."}
{"text":"Great staff! Very welcoming & friendly! Fresh food, tasty food, everything about this place is a 5 star! Always keep coming back."}
{"text":"So good! On Valentine's Day we ordered two of each of the tacos, plus corn, flautas, fried quesadilla and churros. All of the food was amazing! The aguas were excellent, the sauces and flavors of all the tacos are awesome. I went back today and got the guava flan finally. So good! I seriously love this place!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour on Saturdays from 4-7 pm. $4 margaritas, yummo! A great patio area, only a few seats though. They've got really good tacos and guacamole. The bartenders are cool and friendly. The bathroom was clean. And the interior of the restaurant was cool with a giant taco truck as part of the place to order food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Got the three taco plate. I tried the carne asada with verde sauce. It was delicious but expensive. The plate comes with a small portion of beans, rice and chips. The food is pretty good. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but I would come back for lunch if invited. My friend had the tongue which he described as squishy. He wasn't necessarily impressed with the dish. Since I'm not that adventurous I'll take his word on the tongue. The food had a decent heat but not as much as I usually like. All in all, I would come back if invited but probably wouldn't go on my own."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with casual open  seating. This family owned restaurant uses their father's recipes.  The chicken mole is one of the best in town. Very attentive folks and delicious food.  Order the mole tacos and Asada or steak tacos. If you're not into spicy ask for the salsa on the side."}
{"text":"Honestly if you're a fan of pinches you know the service is shitty and the food is good, but tonight when I found plastic in my taco the waitress seemed more concerned about saying she didn't serve the meal rather than apologizing. I wasn't trying to make a scene or blame somebody, but when I find things in my food that shouldn't be there the first thing I expect is an apology. The service continued to go down the shitter after they figured they weren't getting a  20% tip and after all that I would've at least picked up the customer service as an apology.. Not even being over dramatic, but I'm done with pinches."}
{"text":"I read about this place on eater las vegas fb page..not a far walk from my hotel..in container park..i tried the pinches combo plate..u get 3 tacos..choice of taco i chose was 2 asada n 1 shrimp...asada was bettr but they couldve added a bit more of it in tacos..comes with beans n rice n chips n salsa..but they forgot to add my chips oh well..i will go back just for the asada tacos if i'm at container park...they were good"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place but it was honestly disappointing. The food was bland, I don't believe they've heard of salt or pepper. The gringo taco was like a stale cheese taco with lettuce and tomato. The only thing I liked was the strawberry Fanta. The service sucked, our server asked for our drink orders then said hold on she'll be right back, a different girl came back 10 mins later and took our entire order. 15 mins later the original server rushed back to take our order and said she forgot about us. All the while I watch another server stand at a table for 10+ minutes chatting it up, leaves for 10 then comes back to chat for another 10 mins. I seriously sat there an hour and watched everyone else get service and I couldn't even get a refill on my drink. Then a different girl comes to our table with a mouth full of food to check on us. When we asked her to split the bill she said she can but we'd have to wait when we said that would be fine she said are you sure cause it'll be like 10minutes or more. Tacky and careless staff everywhere."}
{"text":"OK for a quick bite but really not up to par for Mexican food.  The carne asada tacos were OK but nothing special and this is a place I will probably not visit again.  Better off going to Lindo Michoacán.  If in the park and hungry go to the BBQ joint."}
{"text":"This is a nearby taco place. My kids luv the quesadillas. I like the chicken tacos and street corn. My hubby likes the iced herbal tea and burritos!"}
{"text":"I have been to the location on Fremont about a year ago, it was great, so I was expecting greatness from this location closer to my house. I was disappointed with my experience. I went around 2:30 on a Wednesday. The two women working were more into their own conversation and made me feel like I was interrupting them. The tacos Al Pastor were dry and lacking flavor. Too bad, I was hoping for a new favorite place to spend my Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't be so harsh with a one star review, but they say that have \"real Mexican food made by real Mexican people\", but it was terrible!  It's also very expensive for the type of food they serve, which I wouldn't mind if it was good! Everything was so drenched in cooking oil and took FOREVER to make!  And why do they put orange grease (and it is grease, not chili powder) on their corn???  What a shame to all real Mexicans who know real Mexican food!  It has the right name though..... \"pinches\" tacos!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos are just a chunk of plain fish on a plain tortilla. Look at my picture. I did not ask for any ingredients to be removed.  It's just a chunk of plain  fish on a plain tortilla. $3.50? Screw that."}
{"text":"Best elotes I have ever eaten. We are visiting from Denver Colorado and must say this place will be on our to do list anytime we return to Las Vegas! Delicious"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the 3rd time in a week and every single time it was excellent! First trip I had the chicken burrito, second trip I had the beef burrito and today I had the veggie burrito and all were great! Nice decor and great vibe with friendly staff and owners. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had the elote and taco de asada. Both were great! Taco had alot of flavor and the green salsa was good. Will definitely go back here to try more of their food."}
{"text":"I am IN LOVE with these tacos. I've tried every kind they make, even the lengua, and the food is seriously outstanding. A must-try if you're down on Fremont near Container Park."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, everyone in family enjoyed what they ordered. Nice décor, friendly service."}
{"text":"I ordered al pastor and lengua tacos as well as some potato taquitos for my son. The lengua was very good and tender. The tortillas are fresh made, but somehow still very dry. The al pastor was terrible, not tender at all, slightly dry and no flavor or pineapple. All in all this review should probably be 2 stars, but that lengua was super good"}
{"text":"Cool spot away from the strip. Great service (very attentive and friendly staff) and atmosphere. Went during happy hour... $2 tacos. Very flavorful food. I ordered the adobada and the chicken mole tacos along with the corn, all flavorful y muy bueno."}
{"text":"This place in the somewhat new Container Park down in \"old\" Vegas is the right pick for authentic and crazy fresh tacos.   We had tree different tacos with meat, pork and white fish and they where all supercrisp and very tasty with cabbage and great tasting cactus salsa that added that extra twist to the food.   Beware if you ask for hot salsa on the tacos though as hot is really HOT in Mexico. We are used to very spicy mexican, thai and indian food but we where sweating after eating this salsa and had to flush it down with a couple fo extra beers. Yeah i know its a hard life........ha he.  All kidding aside. If you love tacos, just go.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"People write reviews because of great experiences or terrible times. They feel so passionate of how the business got it right, they have to share their moment. I was not one of those downtown project followers, until now. I love the container park and their mission. I just wish it was bigger and had more shops. It's sort of an eclectic type of mall that has great eateries, notably Pinches Tacos. I ordered the combo taco plate, with chicken and shrimp... and corn. You rarely find street tacos with good meat. I've found a place. And, the corn was so good. Im writing a review of my second experience... The prices are a little high for the portion size, but once in awhile I find myself craving some Mexican food... I can see myself coming back for more. Like now!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of overpriced for mediocre food. The location is perfect & the restaurant is super cute. Not very much seating because it's a small place but on a good day you can eat outside in the patio area. The street style corn is pretty good!"}
{"text":"OK I am a bit of a taco freak but with that said, very well done.  Nice choice of tacos, sides, drinks, etc...very friendly staff - simple, small & cozy atmosphere...  I found it easily enough but I could see how some might have trouble with the lack of a sign.  The inside of Container Park is pretty simple though in what you see is what you get.  Clean & easy to navigate.  Be careful with the hot hot salsa though - they are not kidding with it.  Had the Al Pastor, Chicken Mole & Fish tacos and found them all to be very satisfying.  This place is nothing earth shattering mind you but it is solid and for the price it was exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday. It was a perfect day to sit outside. With my tacos.  For $10.50, I got the taco combo with 3 tacos of my choosing and a small side of rice, beans, and a handful of chips. To be frank, the tacos are tasted very similar. I got the El Pastor, Pollo, and Carnitas. The pollo was a little too bland.  Don't get me wrong, it hit this East Coaster's spot, and eating outside in the sun was right on, but I wasn't blown away. Maybe I should have gotten a beer with my lunch!"}
{"text":"Let Me Give You Something To TACO 'bout!!  I patronize Pinches for happy hour & T-A-C-O Tuesday ($2 tacos) ;)   I am always greeted and helped right away. I love the food truck & \"Dia de Muertos\" decor... They even have a live DJ playing old school hip hop. I usually order the roasted chicken tacos, but have to admit the Carne Asada fries are the BOMB!   The BAR, what can I say...the seats are padded, games are on & drinks are flowing ~~~ I love the blood orange margaritas!   Great place for a fun friends night out or a family dinner!   **Happy Hour All night Sunday and Monday. Tuesday thru Saturday it's 4pm-7pm**"}
