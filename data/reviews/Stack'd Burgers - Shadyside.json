{"text":"Look, I'm not an expert, but I can say for sure that this is the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh to date.   The ordering and service model is similar to Burgatory, but the actual product runs laps around it. The burgers are mouth-wateringly flavorful and endlessly customizable.  The shakes are definitely a 'meh' and are what holds this back from a 5/5 for me. Not to keep invoking B-tory, but their shakes are way better. The beer and TVs here also make this a great gameday joint.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff was freaking awesome! So delightful and very easy on the eyes. The burger was delicious and I would totally recommend this place and the service was grade A!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the burger and Old Bay Fries kicked it up a notch.  Great place with an excellent beer selection"}
{"text":"I found this to be exactly what i needed.  I was able to watch some March Madness while enjoying a nice selection of craft beers and some good grub in a smoke free, friendly place. The burgers are MYO; I made veggie with fresh jalape√±o,  avocado and Chipotle mayo.  I'm picky when it comes to veggie patties, so i consulted the chef/bar tender first.  He said it was made with black beans and very  good.  He was right.  It was great. Fresh,  tasty,  slightly crunchy on the outside, warm and moist inside. I didn't order fries,  so you're on your own there.  That guy, and the other bar tender were both very friendly and attentive.  I'll be back,  for sure."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great curly fries and great prices! Also, it serves until later than most places in Pittsburgh which makes it even greater. We go to this place very often with many friends and all of us enjoy it. Never had any kind of problem so far. Good atmosphere also."}
{"text":"Curly fries rule so that will be what draws me back in. The concept is cool in that you get a card to fill out with all the different choices you want on your burger. There's a bunch of different choices of cheeses, toppings, sauces, etc and can range from peanut butter and jelly to fried bananas and grilled pineapple. Unfortunately, there are way better burgers out there. Not much flavor and (as i order a 1/4 lb burger) the bun is usually too big for the burger leaving a lot of bread and confusion. Good place for a quick bite but not flavorful enough to be a regular go-to"}
{"text":"This review is for STACK'D 2, their new venture on Ellsworth ave. Instead of build your own burgers, the concept is build your own cheesesteaks. I'm indifferent to both of those.   My point about STACK'D 2 is that I, and I'm sure plenty of Shadyside residents, looked forward to a new establishment in the neighborhood. However, I've had to seek and solicit the staff's help every time I've been there, and they're usually rude.   A big space with nice TVs, yes. But overall, what a big disappointment to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The bartender, Jess, was super friendly. She was efficient and very personable. She was really hustling around both the bar and dining area. I really enjoyed my experience there."}
{"text":"Went here hoping for a burger without the fuss.   What I  got reminded me of all the marginal places near campus of every college town I've  ever been in. Disappointed"}
{"text":"The honey sriracha chicken tenders are probably the greatest things I have ever placed in my mouth. These little crack nuggets are incredible and an incredible price. I dive face first into these every time I go."}
{"text":"This place has become my (not so) hidden gem in Shadyside. A great place to come during the week and weekends.  Stack'd has two identities the downstairs is usually full of college kids while the upstairs caters a bit more to young professionals... or at least that's how it seems to me .   Staff seems more friendly and outgoing than the normal bar in the area, so thats always a plus.  During the week you can get their build your own burger/ veggie burger on Tuesday and Wednesday for $3  and a pitcher of yuengling to wash it down for $5. There are about 25 free options and a few more for a dollar or two extra. Burgers are well executed even if you are like me and get more than one sauce.  On the weekends if i am looking to avoid the crowds and just chill with some friends I got upstairs. Its never crowded service is quick and prices are good.  I always try to go here with my friends even though most don't know it exists or have never been, so if you are looking for a chill night this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"This was my second STACK'D experience in two days. This was way better than the first.   Food is really good for the price, service seems a little blase, but they have a decent beer selection.   If you like their Facebook page and submit a photo of your burger, you get your fries for free ($1)."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect of this place, which occupies the former Pittsburgh Deli Company.  Once I had a look at the menu (featuring burgers, alcoholic milkshakes) I instantly thought of a BRGR wannabe.  However, STACK'D does set itself apart by allowing intense customization of a burger, from the bun (Pretzel buns!) to the sauces to the toppings (up to 4 for free, with traditional and \"unique\" options such as Fritos and peanut butter?)  Some more \"premiere\" ingredients such as fried mac and cheese can also go atop your burger for an extra fee.  With the option to make a perfectly customized meal, I was naturally pleased with my outcome and will give this place another try......perhaps for their $3 burger nights on Tuesdays after 9 PM!"}
{"text":"The guy at security was extremely rude and impolite, my recommendation - change him. Won't be going back there, ever. There are enough better burger restaurants in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Great burgers.. interesting topping choices and great prices.  Gets a little crazy with the college crowd, especially on the Tuesday nights (half off burgers), but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Stack'd is a small, quaint bar in somewhat of a pricy area, but believe it or not, their prices were very reasonable.  The burgers came out fast and were delicious (as were the fries) and we even got an order of Pierogi (which were also very good). Great selection of beer, and just a nice, casual place to hang out, have a beer and a great-tasting burger without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best burger I've ever had.  And as a carnivore-for-life, I've had my fair share of burgers.  The toppings were creative (fired mac n'cheese?  get out of town), the beer selection was choice (there was Pumking on draft when we were there), and the siracha honey sauce had me licking the plate.  I can't wait to go back (and have been pestering my friends to do so repeatedly) to satisfy my burgery hunger once more."}
{"text":"Stack'd does produce good food, but the rest of the experience is not so good.  The environment/decor confuses me because it's somewhere between bar environment where dirtiness/upkeep is somewhat expected and fancy env where I'd expect cleaner, better ambience.  The staff were not very attentive and when we walked in we sat a table that was just vacated. I'd expect the staff to see that the table still needed some cleaning/wiping but we had to ask for these things to be done. At least for that night, they didn't seem to check up on us enough to at least to see what else we needed.  Lastly, this one is an easy fix, but they don't seem to read the menu that customers fill out in full. If you order something on both sides, make sure you let them know you have something on the other side (eg appetizers are on one side of the sheet, while burgers and the main sandwich is on the front). They missed our order for onion rings."}
{"text":"Stack'd is an excellent place for great burgers and beers. The staff is extremely friendly and nice. From Wayne the bartender to Yves who mans the door, everyone is courteous and friendly, making stack'd a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Stack'd is a solid burger joint. My friends and I go once a week during happy hour (5pm-7pm, I believe) for half-off beers and appetizers. The place is usually pretty packed by 7pm though, so plan on waiting for a table if you show up after.   Now, on to the burgers.....DELICIOUS! You build your own burger from bun to meat to toppings. They have a huge variety of toppings too.   Not giving five stars because sometimes it takes a while for food to come out. We've waited 30 minutes for our burgers at times, BUT they are so good that keep coming back. The wait staff is always courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Foood was good and service was great. Despite the large GSPIA crowd that was present, the bartenders did a great job of attending to all. Aside from beer, I only ordered the ffried mac and chese (which was delicious) and service was impressive."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a great time here during our brief visit to the 'Burgh.  My bacon-cheddar burger on a pretzel bun w/ spicy garlic BBQ sauce & cajun fries was the perfect way to soak up Saturday night's alcohol.  My girlfriend really enjoyed her turkey burger wrap w/ guacamole.  They have the NFL Sunday Ticket with plenty of TVs (our booth had it's own TV), and plenty of seating between the downstairs and upstairs bars, so it's a perfect place to watch the games.  Our waitress was attentive and always ready to refill our drinks before we had to ask.  The GM came by our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and put the game we wanted to watch on our booth's TV--he's a good dude.    If you're in/around Shady Side and haven't hit Stack'd yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"It seems that this restaurant cannot serve its burgers any less done than medium-well plus.  If you want to know what eating at Stack'd is like, imagine ordering a burger, fries, and beverage.  Now, imagine that sandwiched between two pieces of bread and your favorite condiments is a patty that was tortured into submission until it became a grey, grilled hunk of amalgamated animal protein.  If you're one of those people who is willing to stomach this desecrated sandwich on account of the 'craft' (overpriced) beer, you still don't know a good burger from a solid waste treatment pond."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the Thanksgiving holiday and stopped in Stack'd with the family for lunch today.  The build your own burgers and milkshakes were delicious!  The service was also great with Rachel & Derek being very attentive!   We will return during our next trip to town."}
{"text":"The Birthday Cake Milkshake was good, the Burgers been ok but it wasn't special. The service was very nice!"}
{"text":"After a long drive from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh to visit a friend, we arrived in Shadyside hungry about half an hour past midnight. It was the night before the 4th of July and the kitchen was about to close. Thankfully they took mercy on us and let us place a quick order. The Build Your Own STACK'D was probably one of the most daunting food decisions I've ever had to make. And I had to make my pick very quickly. There were so many different topics that the combinations were endless. There is a burger or 50 burgers for everyone's taste.  I ended up with the quarter pound beef patty on a sesame seed bun with buffalo sauce, jalape√±o, banana pepper, red onion, Fritos and avocado. Of course I second guessed my choice as soon as I placed the order. It awesome. It was my unique burger. I probably would have went with a more cohesive, possibly Thai style burger had I given it more thought but you really can't go wrong. They had some bottled and draft beers as well, but since they were closing shop we just stuck to the food.  STACK'D is overwhelmingly awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place! The burgers are awesome! You fill out a check card of everything and anything you could possibly want on a burger. We also got the basket of fries with cheese. I was pleasantly surprised when they served the fries with liquid nacho cheese. I prefer that to melted shredded cheese which I found is popular in other places around here. Highly recommended! The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because of how loud/dark the bar area is and how rude they are about the TVs in the booths. All we did was turn ours off and we ended up getting a 5 minute lecture about breaking it. Besides that I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago now, to celebrate my 21st with my a couple of my girlfriends, and I had an overall positive experience.  The Long Island fish bowl was worth its cost and it wasn't too overwhelming, though it was my first official drink.  We ordered a side of onion rings and it was really good! Fresh, not too heavy and perfectly crispy. I'd get it again. I've also come to this location for burgers too, and I'm never disappointed.  The service was friendly, and chill. I didn't feel rushed out or pressured to buy anything.  I'd definitely bring my friends for their 21st's!! You get a cute little rubber duck with the fish bowl!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. Buffalo Wing sauce had good flavor, but was a little thin. Fries weren't bad, but a little soggy. Burger was pretty good and so was the service. I'd eat here again, but it's not on my 'to do list'"}
{"text":"Stack'd is always a solid choice if you're going out to Walnut St. Their burgers are great and I love the fact you can customize what you want on your burger. Their house sauce is delicious and I always get that on my burger. While you can drop a lot of money at Stack'd, there are certain nights where you can get good deals on items, like half-off burger nights. I especially love the $1 drink nights on Thursdays where you only have to spend a few bucks to have a fun night out. They make their drinks pretty strong so you'll get the bang out of your buck. Stackd's milkshakes are pretty good as well and offer a lot of good, basic flavors like chocolate, vanilla, peanut butter, etc. Their fishbowls are a fantastic deal and are only $15 and even cheaper if you split the cost with friends. Stack'd is my favorite place to go on Walnut st. and is a Pittsburgh classic for college students."}
{"text":"This place is really underrated in Shadyside.  I think it has some of the best burgers in the area.  You're able to customize your own burger so you can make it to your liking.  I got a double burger with onion rings and mango habanero on the side.  Just a heads up, the mango habanero isn't like Buffalo Wild Wings, it's more of a buffalo style sauce.  Also, on Thursdays, they have $1 drink night from 10pm-midnight.  Definitely a good pre-game spot.  Big Stack Burger: 8.5/10"}
{"text":"This place has gotten better with time. Usually a good place to get a quick burger yet still sit down for your meal. Lots of beer on tap and in bottles. Nice half off apps happy hour and usually good service. Definitely has grown on me."}
{"text":"This is a great bar for a Tuesday night and highly recommend going after 9pm to get the $3 burger special.  Go early to get a seat because this place fills up slightly after 9. I sat all the way upstairs and the bar was quiet but it was a Tuesday night after all.  They had a great list of draft beers including Pumking which I would have normally gotten but at $10 for a small glass that was a little much for me. I ended up with a bottle of Purple Haze another favorite of mine. The bartender told me there was a glitch in the computer system and it only rang up for $3-nice surprise.  Unfortunately this didn't happen for the second round but the bartender made sure to tell me in advance which was perfectly fine.  I stayed for the 9 o'clock burger special and it was declivous. Pleasantly surprised by the double burger and highly recommend the Stack'd special sauce!"}
{"text":"Came here not for the food but for their legendary fishbowls!   I've never heard or seen drinks served in an actual fishbowl before but I was definitely impressed!  For $15, it's about the size of a spherical object used to house miniature aquatic animals. Jokes aside, I'd recommend you bring some friends to help you finish it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  The Good:  - Half off appetizers M-F from 5PM-7PM. This is why we go. They also have other half-off deals that are good deals.  - Their appetizer menu is fabulous. Chicken wings, pretzels, 3 different kinds of french fries(curly fries, normal McDonald's like fries and cajun fries with a little spice), tater tots, nachos, very good fried mac and cheese balls and nachos. It's maybe my favorite appetizer menu in the whole city. Good luck getting curly fries anywhere else in the city except Arby's.  - The staff is quite nice.  - They have you fill out check boxes for what you want on the menu. Due to this, they never get my order wrong.  - They have a lot of different options for toppings on burgers. Fritos, chicken, fried mac and cheese, the usuals and more.   - They offer cheese sauce on the side. I can put cheese sauce on anything so this is a huge plus for me.  The Bad:  - This location is not really good. You wouldn't know about it unless you got lucky.  - It's small and gets insanely crowded fast.  - Parking in Shadyside is never fun, easy or cheap. We don't go a lot because it's a hassle.  - They don't advertise, which is a shame, because I know people would love it.  - It is expensive. We only go when it's half-off because we like to order lots of apps  - Their burgers are a bit small, and I'd think you'd have to get at least a double burger to be satisfied.  - If you get take out, the discounts and specials don't apply. I'd go more since it's so small if I could get the usual deals on takeout.  Overall thoughts: I really do like this restaurant and foodwise it's a 10 out of 10 for me. The bad thing is that I really can only go during a weekday around 5pm due to pricing, which sucks. Keep an eye on this place because it's going to be a big thing real soon."}
{"text":"The worst!! Dirty Loud Drunk and Gross   If you are over 25 do not come here.  Burgers are overrated and suck !"}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Fast-food style, thin patties (which I much prefer over the thicker burgers). A lot of great options to top off the burger with and all were very fresh."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night. We ordered a banana split shake which was the most tasty thing we had there. The baked potato skin we had was ok. But they are too thick and greasy to my liking. The onion rings are greasy too and the onions were not soft enough. The burgers were good, normal fastfood good, not amazingly good. And the top bread was cold when they were presented to us so points off. Honestly I don't even know how this place gets an average 4. Anyway, my favorite burger joint will still be the Winghart's!!"}
{"text":"What a little gem in Shadyside. I lived here for 3 years right down the road and never went here. However, I just went in last night for the $3 veggie burger special! Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the special was only for 9-midnight, but that did not stop me from still getting the burger and leave me wanting to go here next Wednesday night. A friend and I stopped in here after work and just made it in time for happy hour- which I would say is not very good compared to similar restaurants (drafts are only $1 off). However, the list is pretty incredible and they do have good drinks specials on other nights (I think I read they have $1 mixed drinks on Thursday nights, which makes me want to go back tonight and take the morning off work tomorrow!). We received our burger check list and I was pleasantly surprised and the diversity of sauces, toppings, and add-ons to my burger. You can get up to 4 toppings free- further, the happy hour included half-off a basket of fries. The quality of the burger was very good. I enjoyed the food, the venue (which I didn't realize until I walked out that there is an entire second floor with a full bar and tables upstairs), and I am looking forward to coming back to enjoy some of the specials."}
{"text":"Stack'd gives you the option of customizing your burger through a checklist type menu. You check off what you want! This is a cool idea and it makes ordering easy. Burgers are solid but they won't be the best you've had. I'm not sure if Stack'd can really compete with other local burger joints like Burgatory (which has the same make-your-own-burger concept) or BRGR. Luckily for Stack'd, there isn't a competitor too close by. So if you're craving a burger after shopping on Walnut, this is a cool place to go."}
{"text":"Came here one time, the food was good but the service was mediocre. We were the only two people in the place and there was nothing but dead air. The kid working there wasn't even talkative or friendly."}
{"text":"I hate to write poor reviews, but wanted to share our experience.  First of all the service was way above average...which made our visit okay.  My wife and I were hungry for a burger after many thanksgiving leftovers...we chose Stack'd.  We stared with an order of wings, $10 for 10 very small wings...okay I guess you don't get wings at a burger joint.  Our burgers came...both looked good and presented well, but the meat was way over cooked (no choice of doneness) and dry.  It was like the meat was pre-cooked and held in a warmer, definitely not cooked to order.  French Fries were good, fairly fresh, but a small portion.  I had two beers, my wife had water...$46+ before tip (yes we left 20%) is a lot for what we got.  I know, we should have said something while we were there, thus not a one or two star review.  Also, something small, but the entrance steps are poorly lite and one of the steps is a little tricky.  Overall not horrible, we may try a different location."}
{"text":"Stack'd...your concept is brilliant but your dining room could use some extra side work.  The choices on the burger BYO was impressive.  But why be so specific about toppings and then not ask me what temperature I want my burger cooked to?  I like the decor and the music selection, but when there are six people in the restaurant, why is the bar music at a level that makes conversation near impossible...?  The food looks and smells fantastic.  I just got a glimpse and a whiff of the stuff the annoying hipsters next to us ordered.  My own food, however, has taken over twenty minutes at this point.  (We ordered two burgers and an order of ten wings.)  Your bartender texts a lot but at least she makes rounds frequently.  My burger was good.  So were my wings.  The fries were a little lackluster, but hey, they're fries.  And they're not bad, just not what I expected.    Your napkins are too soft for wings.  And the bartender just took a plate out from under my girlfriend's face while she was eating.  Like elbows on the table chowing down on a wing.  Now, we both work  in the service industry - I'm a chef and she's a GM - and that just isn't done.  I have to say, until that, I would have given you two stars for food and thrown you on my take-out list.  Now, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Your typical burger in a pub.  The great part about Stack'd is that you get to build your own burger and put whatever toppings you want on your burger, from guacamole to a fried egg to whatever vegetables your heart desires.  A little overcooked for my taste and the meat is 'eh', but the toppings and cheap prices are enough to satisfy your late night burger cravings (and the 3-star rating)."}
{"text":"I got a 3/4 lb burger, fries, and fried pierogi for take out (I hate sitting in that extremely noisy place).  When I went there on a Saturday, 18:40, the place seemed understaffed and the staff appeared really stressed. You are expected to seat yourself, so I sat down and rotated my head looking around for about 10 minutes before a staff member came and threw a menu card/order sheet at me. It then took about 25 minutes for my order to be completed -- fairly reasonable speed considering how busy it was.  The 3/4 lb burger came with three 1/4 lb patties. Each was a bit dry; but overall the burger was pretty good. The fried pierogi were big and pretty standard. The fries were nothing special -- a bit worse than McDonald's fries. Overall, it was decent value for the meal considering how customizable everything is, but nothing is particularly outstanding. The value is even better if you show up on half price time (Tuesday 9pm to Midnight)."}
{"text":"First off, I just want to say that I don't consider myself a \"burger type\". It is not something I normally crave or order from a menu.  So, if I say I liked the burgers I had here at Stack'd...that's quite a big deal.   I'm a total cheapskate, so when I heard about the $3 specials on Tuesdays, I had to give this place a try. It was pretty packed for a Tuesday night and seemed to appeal to a more college-age crowd. There are definitely certain college-bar features: loud music, poor lighting and drunken college kids. There are two floors so plenty of seats. The service was on point. Even though it was crowded, the waitress spotted us right away and came by for our order.   The food came pretty quickly. The meat was juicy and flavorful. I really appreciate the fact that it was actual burger juice that dripped down my arm, not grease. I couldn't really taste the sauce or any of the other condiments, which isn't a bad thing because that great chunk of beef stole the show. For an extra $2, you get a handful of fries on the side. That was a total rip-off though. The fries weren't that spectacular, just your ordinary fries.       Overall, I thought it was great place to grab some late night fatty bites. For those on a budget like myself, go on Tuesdays after 9pm for their $3 burger special. With an additional $2 for fries, you're looking at only $5 for a pretty fulfilling meal. I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this place. I really liked it...can't beat $3 burgers."}
{"text":"Customized burgers are here! (for other options, consider Burgatory)  Burgers are good and quick. Size seems a big small, even though you order a pre-determined size patty. The burger is as good as you want to make it, depending on what you choose, but some of the ways where places can try to stand out, such as buns, weren't all that impressive. Indeed, I often miss the Fuddrucker's down by the Waterfront for this reason; they had fantastic buns. (side note - screw you owner of Pittsburgh burger company, for taking over the Fuddrucker's location and then TOTALLY messing that up).  I still think Tessaro's has the best burger in town. But, to be honest, burgers are not my thing, so, in a pinch, Stack'd is a perfectly reasonable place for a meal."}
{"text":"Coming from MI to compete in the IFBB North American Championships (bodybuilding) I was on the lookout for the perfect post competition meal. This place was IT. My boyfriend and I got the mac and cheese balls as an app, wished we would have gotten 2 orders. SO GOOD!!! I got a peanut butter banana burger with cheddar cheese & bacon and a chocolate peanut butter milkshake. WOW. I don't think I'll ever have another burger that was that good!!! I wish we had a Stack'd here in MI! Definitely recommend. Only downfalls were that the \"bouncer\" was pretty rude, the waitress seemed new, and the people were LOUD.. but nothing worth complaining over! The food made up for it :)"}
{"text":"Bambi  best bartender ever.  Food and drinks were great, thanks for the attention to detail. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Try getting peanut butter and fritos on your burger!"}
{"text":"Oh God I had such expectations for this place. I tried to order the most basic burger possible, since the place looked promising. I marked what I thought it would be a 1/2lb burger, but I got 2 1/4lb patties instead. The worst part is that them both were overcooked - I totally forgot to ask for medium point, and I wasn't given that option either (signs of a not-so-good burger place). The burger stuff like salad, condiments etc. were undersized. We had to order fries separately, and for my surprise the fries were also undersized.  I tried the Nutter Butter milkshake as well and at least that was very good.  I'll have to go back there for a double-check, but boy I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm an unusual burger customer.  I am not impressed by a slew of toppings and opportunity to make my own crazy sandwich that is 5 times the size of my mouth.  I am looking for a good tasting burger on a complimentary bun with toppings that make sense.    Since toppings on huge burgers is Stack'd's (?) thang, I was expecting to feel stressed and overwhelmed about what to order, then spontaneously blurting out random things that separately may be delightful but smashed together are a horrid nightmare.  This did not happen at Stack'd.  Maybe because fried mac n' cheese is good with/on/in anything?  Same with bacon and egg?  Yes, I played it safe and picked toppings that could do no wrong, but even angelic toppings could not elevate a burger than isnt good in the first place.  Stack'd has good, big, juicy burgers.  On big, hearty buns.    Great beer selection, tater tots, friendly service.  I'll take Stack'd over BRGR any night."}
{"text":"It's pretty simple: well-priced made to order burgers, good but not write-home-about beer selection, alcoholic milkshakes. Overall, one great thing is that everything's really consistent: I've never had a bad meal here, unlike many other similar shadyside restaurants.   Burgers are cooked medium-well and aren't made out of fantastic meat, but are consistent and solid, and never bad. You can order whatever you want, and get a generous number of toppings for free. The check-the-box-style ordering is nice, since you get exactly what you want, no matter how weird (three types of lettuce, for instance).  Service is fast and good. There are a terrifyingly large number of TVs, which may or may not be the atmosphere you're looking for."}
{"text":"stack'd is awesome. read some reviews before going and tried the veggie burger. not a vegetarian myself but wanted to try it out and am really glad I did. the veggie patty was delicious. also tried the pretzel bun which was amazing and well worth the extra charge. wish they had an option for how you want your patty cooked"}
{"text":"The best burger I have eaten and the cheese sticks were just as good. The Banana Split milkshake was quite possibly the best I have every had. The wait staff is friendly and very good at their jobs"}
{"text":"It's a sports bar, that's the attitude you need to come in here with. Its loud, there's beer on the tables, the waitresses are super cute and they come just often enough.  I come here for the Tuesday night half off Stack'd Burgers - its a pretty decent deal. I wish they were't so well done, but there's probably some system of patties being made and they can't customize to that level, oh well. Here's what did bug me though, I get my check and the burger was $6.50.  Me: Hey I'm wondering if you could help me add this up - I see its $6.50 Waitress: Yup, burger is $3, cheese is $1, cheese sticks are $1, and fries are $1. Me: Yeah - so that adds to $6. Where does that extra 50 cents come in? Waitress: I have no idea.  Now, whatever, its 50 cents. But its the principle. When I come back and its not a game night, I'm going to raise this issue with the manager."}
{"text":"I came right after my shift at work with some friends for a burger and a drink. Even though I was a jerk and showed up at 11:45pm and wanted a burger, I was grateful they allowed me to order a burger and didn't put to much of a fuss up over it.   The burger was tasty and just what I needed, it reminded me of burgatory but cheaper and closer, and since it was pretty late on a weekday it wasn't crowded at all although the staff seemed in a hurry to get out. I'd be interested to come another time when I haven't just got out of work and am slightly inconveniencing them. I hate being that person."}
{"text":"We went to the opening of the new Patagonia store on Sunday and decided afterwards to go get something to eat and watch some football. It was 2:00pm and even though the door said they opened at noon not a single person was inside! We didn't want to be the only ones inside and thought that might mean they're not good so we left and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was in town looking for a fun place to eat. I was staying near the area so walked to the location and found the community charming and busy with people.   I ordered a 1/4 on a kaiser roll with blue cheese and other fixings, with tater tots as a side. All was outstanding! I was by myself but wished I had friends with me. It is a quaint space with TV's around the room. Glad I found my way there!"}
{"text":"Food is what you can expect for a burger joint- good, nothing special. But if you are going out in Shadyside with the intentions of drinking to get drunk, this is one of the places with the best value. They have $15 fishbowls that have 10 shots minimum in them (we counted their count before and it was way higher than 10 shots). You also get a rubber duck in the fishbowl, which is a nice added bonus. The fishbowls are great and make it worth going 100%."}
{"text":"One of the best places for getting cheap and tasty Burgers. They have some specials almost every day. Sometimes the place is really busy, though, and you have to wait for a little bit. Still really a nice place to hang out at!"}
{"text":"This is probably the 6 th time me and my boyfriend coming here. There hamburgers are awesome and so are there wings. We found this place by going on yelp. Boy am I glad that we choose this place and the waitress Jess is GREAT!!! They have the fishbowl drink specials on Fridays $10. And they are normally $15. Either way worth every penny not watered down. They are 84 oz. always a great time"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best veggie burger in Pittsburgh can be found here.  I brought a buddy here for dinner one night and we were both impressed. The options for customizing your burger are quite impressive and overwhelming.  I literally garnished mine with pretty much every ulcer inducing spice available.  My carnivore friend really enjoyed his burger as well.  The quantity of food in one meal is enough to feed a small African village.  The price is fair.  Service was good.  If you're looking to catch a game or just chill in a nice area, go upstairs and have a seat at the bar where you will enjoy dining in front of numerous and huge flat screen TVs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here in search of a cheap burger place within walking distance of our house. We both spend a decent amount of time near Walnut Street shopping and going on runs and such, but we have never found a place for a quick bite in the vicinity. I'm sure we'll come back here, but only during off-peak hours since the atmosphere isn't as nice as that of some of our favorite spots.  We walked in and figured that it was seat yourself. I believe there was a sign saying that, but I remember it being turned around so I couldn't really read it. We got a roomy booth and were soon greeted by the waitress for our section. The draft list and BYO burger sheets were on the table, so ordering was pretty self explanatory. We went with soft drinks, since the draft list had no prices anywhere. I feel awkward asking about beer prices, but at the same time I just won't get a draft of something if it's $2 or $3 more than somewhere else where I just had the same thing. Call me crazy, but I'll probably go with the slightly cheaper option in that case. I've been skewered paying $8.50 for a tiny pour at places with no listed prices before, so that's probably just a (very) personal pet peeve of mine. The lack of beer prices on the draft list and the fact that there were TVs at every single booth were my two biggest complaints. It seemed like a sports bar for pretty boy bros, when it really could have been a cozy burger joint tucked away off of Walnut Street.  The food is the reason this pace gets 3 stars from me, since it was reasonably priced for the quantity and everything came out hot and well-assembled. During super busy times this probably isn't the case, but $6 for a 1/2lb burger (before fries) isn't a bad deal overall. I also liked how their hot BBQ sauce was actually spicy, and I'll definitely be getting all my sandwiches with it in future. My boyfriend loved his burger as well. We'll be back during times when it's sure to be less crowded, like for an early weekend dinner or a lunch, never when there's a game on."}
{"text":"Food is good and love the idea of half-off make your own burger night. 2/3 of the time you get charged full price and if it is busy, it is a pain in the butt to get anyone to fix it. Would like to bring people to try it out on half off night but don't want to risk it. Instead my place to grab a quick bite late at night"}
{"text":"This place..... ROCKS.   I first came here between lunch and dinner (we woke up late) with my boyfriend. Their customizable sheet is what makes this place so awesome. There was 1 waitress I had a bad experience with (mainly inattentive, seemed to prefer flirting with the guys at the bar rather than taking her customer's orders, never once got my order correct--I had her 3 different occasions and each time she always forgot at least 1 thing), but everyone else has been spectacular.   There is one waitress in particular who is my favorite, and the next time I go I will write her name up here because she is fantastic.   Also, you can't beat the Tuesday night stack'd burger special, but I'd still go back any other time of the day."}
{"text":"The burgers were quite good.  Rubbed chicken wings were better than good.  Fried pierogi were tasty, but really not needed considering all the food that came later.  Service was courteous and fast, and the server knew her beers really well, so the training must be rigorous.  Seriously, all three of us liked this place.  We took half the food we ordered to go, promising not to eat for 23 hours."}
{"text":"Veggie burger perfected to the way you like paired with incredible Cajun fries! The service was fast and friendly and the prices are reasonable, what else could you ask for? We stopped in late at night for some good food and they truly delivered!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite of something, while on the run, not really knowing what this restaurant was all about. We had good service and a couple of really great nicely cooked well priced burgers. Design your own checkbox menu allows a great deal of personal customization. Can't really ask for more that that. Would certainly go back when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! I found this place after they followed me on Twitter so I looked up what it was. After visiting  their website my husband and I were there the next week. We loved Burgatory, so we weren't sure how we would feel about this place... However, after our first visit a few months ago we have been back multiple times and take friends to experience it each time we go.   Just like Burgatory, you can create your own Burger/sandwich, but the choices are way better and everything is much bigger and the prices are amazing for the amount of food you get not to mention it tastes delicious! They have specials on different days of the week, but they always have $6 pitchers of Yuengling and $15 fish bowls.   I have yet to have their milkshakes, but hear they are comparable to Burgatory. If you love Burgatory, this is a must visit restaurant! You'll love it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Very friendly staff! Quality food with out the crazy price! Next time we are in Pittsburgh we will definitely be coming back to Stack'D!"}
{"text":"Horrible people.  Were you ever in one of those positions where you looked up the reviews for a restaurant and saw that they had tons of 1 star reviews and then decided to yourself, \"Well it can't really be that bad, I'll give it a try...\" And then it was one of the most horrific experiences of your entire food ordering life? Well this is that, so please listen to this review and DO NOT EVER EVER EVER order food from this restaurant. PLEASE listen to this... You will be so thankful. HEY! Don't do it... Don't place that order..."}
{"text":"I just came here for an early dinner and the service was good and the burgers were really nice. They have a fully customizable menu so you could have any burger one could want.   Only complain was that my order of curly fries seemed a little small compared to my friends but none the less it was a great first impression"}
{"text":"I waited to try this place, given the iffy reviews it got when it first opened....  I'm glad I finally did try Stack'd because last night I had one tasty burger!  I think my first question about Stack'd was...  where IS it?  It's in Shadyside off Walnut, in the space that was the Pittsburgh Deli Co.  Last night was a Tuesday, which meant that the Stack'd burgers were 1/2 price.  The special applies *only* to the Stack'd burger which is a two patty burger.  I was disappointed because I wanted the small burger, or the chicken sandwich.    I think this is the kind of food issue only a woman would have, as my males friends were ready to chow down.  There are endless combinations of ways you can order your burger.  You chose the size of your burger, and they also offer chicken and veggie burgers. You have your choice of bun:  sesame, kaiser, wheat, no bun, and a wrap.  There is a very long list of sauces to choose from, and just about every topping you could ever imagine.  I had the Stack'd burger, on a sesame bun, with American cheese, sweet baby Ray's bbq sauce, a little bit of pineapple mayo, pickles, romaine lettuce, red onions, and a toasted pineapple.  It was EXCELLENT.  My friend got fritos and a fried egg on her burger.  i would never ever order that but she seemed to enjoy it...and you know, I like having the opportunity to have, say, fritos and peanut butter and general tsos sauce on a burger!  My burger and a pitcher of Yuengling ($6 pitchers on tuesday) came to $11.50.  Not too bad!  I recommend this place highly, and if you're not sure about the food--just come on a Tuesday night when the burgers are 1/2 off."}
{"text":"Good place for beer,burger and curly fries. They have $5 burger on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Great place to go with some bros for some brews. Especially if there's a bunch'o'babes. Go for the party, leave with the babes ammi right ?!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for the opportunity to test out STACK'D for almost a year.  As they have a half price burger on Tuesday nights, STACK'D even fits my budget!  There is tons of burger competition in Pittsburgh, but most of those places are just not in my price range.  I LOVE the personalized checks menu, and it was very clear which add-ons cost extra.  No surprises here!  I brought my brother here for his birthday, and we each ordered different burgers.  First of all, each of our half pound burgers covered in toppings were $5.50, for a grand total of $11.  The half pound burger is actually two quarter pound burgers, which I prefer.  My brother is super picky so anywhere that does not force vegetables on a burger is good by him.  He ordered the 1/2 pound burger on a sesame seed bun, with American cheese, mozzarella sticks, and fried mac and cheese.  The mozz sticks looked amazing, and my brother finished the entire burger is a matter of seconds.  I ordered a 1/2 pound burger on a sesame seed bun, with Cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, house sauce, and fried mac and cheese.  The fried mac and cheese tasted homemade, and I could have eaten a whole plate of that.  The combination was great, and the price was unbeatable.  The actual quality of the burger isn't quite five stars, but this is a great place to build your own burger!  Our server was great, and the place was really crowded.  We were in and out in forty five minutes.  The only slight detriment is that this place is small and not so shockingly gets packed.  I will definitely be back on a Tuesday night for some more burgers here!"}
{"text":"I really like it here. Been several times to happy hour and enjoy the atmosphere. 4 of 5 because they can use more servers. The limited staff prolongs the time for drinks or appetizers. The only other complaint is wish they were open for lunch, but cool vibe and friendly service."}
{"text":"On par with the other build yr own burger joints like BRGR and Tipsy Cow. A lot of young adults of the college age come in here. Good but small rotating draft selection. Good place to brood at in the presence of raucous youth."}
{"text":"I had one horrible experience a year ago and didn't want to comeback... Eventually I caved and dropped in as a last minute game time decision. I now come here all the time! They have many great options other than just burgers. I'm a BIG fan of Stacked!!   There is also an awesome little bar in here!  I wish they would fix some of the booths, some seats are on the verge of collapse. Overall though I would say it's a great affordable sports bar."}
{"text":"I've been to Stackd twice now and the food was good both times! I prefer burgatory, but stackd has a pretty good veggie burger (love their ghost pepper cheese) and great curly fries. The service is slow, but aside from that I think it's a good option on walnut street"}
{"text":"OK I gave this place a 4 some time ago. I want to change my opinion now, it's a 5.  This place serves $6 double burgers. You get to choose the bread, the sauce, and up to 4 toppings (which is usually enough). Cheese and special toppings (eggs, bacon, chicken fingers, peanut butter, fried bananas...) are not free, so if you want to add those, it's going to cost more, but still below $10 usually. The burgers taste very decent for $6. I've been to Burgeratory, and they serve pretty much the exact same burger for twice the price.  If you consider the specials (Monday night $5 wings, Tuesday night $3 double burgers, Wednesday night $3 veggie burgers, and the drink specials) this place is very, very well priced. Be sure to order between 9-12 though. I think one of my orders went in at 8:55PM and it was full price.  Their milkshake is also really good. I know it's $5, but since their burgers are so cheap, I'm okay with this. And it's still cheaper than Burgeratory, which serves milkshakes of the exact same quality anyway.  Asides from the burgers, other food are just okay, and they're usually not as valuable as $6 burgers. They're probably still pretty cheap compared to places like Shady Grove and Mario's that are not far away though.  Environment's fine, never seen it dirty, bartenders are nice, and there are always sports shows on the screens. On Tuesday nights the place is super crowded. I've seen parties lining up at the door. Other times are okay."}
{"text":"Absolutely loveeeeeeeeeeeee this place. Burgers are always hot and fresh everytime I get something different and still love it. Plus, the servers are nice"}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious!!  Mostly quiet but I've never been during the weekend.  I like the customizable aspect. They give you a menu and pencil, you select what you want and just give back the \"menu\" to the waiter.They have a larger choice of sauces than most burger joints.  I am gluten free (celiac) and I can eat their burger (no bun) and fries with no problem. You know the burger is good when it is tasty even without the bun.   My favorite combo is regular burger, no bun, avocado, red roasted pepper, mayo and ketchup. Pretty delicious.  They also have a veggie burger option that my friend said was amazing!"}
{"text":"Hmm..I was a little disappointed that I didn't love Stack'd, especially since I love burgers and this place is so close to my house.  We went on a Friday night (Pens game on), and it was loud as expected. There isn't as much seating as I thought, but there was no problem getting a seat, though we had to wait for people to clear tables. You get a sheet where you can mark the qualifications of your burger- bun, size, condiments, cheese, random toppings, etc and hand it to the waitress.   The burger itself was OK- nothing stood out for me. The price point was fine as well. It was hard to get service, and when at first we didn't remember who our waitress was, we made the mistake of asking another, to which she replied, \"What?\" when we asked for help, and then \"You have to ask her,\" pointing to our presumed waitress, who was sitting down at a table with people she knew. All in all, a normal burger with bad service. With all the other competition out there, I can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Stack'd is such a solid go-to burger place that you can pretty much text someone \"Stack'd?\" and they're in.  + As a build-your-own-burger place, you can satisfy pretty much anyone you want to bring. Even your vegetarian, gluten-free, spice-loving friend will be able to make something that suits them.  - This place can get really crowded (especially for the Tuesday night deal), and it's seat yourself, so come early or you might have some wait. There's upstairs seating too, and a bar! - Service is kind of hit or miss. It seems like the staff is always rushing around, so don't expect much individual attention unless you flag them down.  + The burgers and toppings have always been on point for me!  + The $3 half-pound burger on Tuesday from 9PM-midnight is AMAZING.  +/- I've split a milkshake from here with a friend once. Trust me, even as someone with a sweet tooth, I found it to be quite a lot of sugar. Make sure you've got room if you're getting a burger too, or split it many ways.   I'm pretty sure there are more combinations of burgers here than I can eat in a lifetime (you can literally make a burger with PB&J), so I will definitely be back to knock a few more off the list."}
{"text":"The size of the burger here is crazy, especially for the price. It can get relatively crowded. Took quite a bit of time to get our food.  I don't know who eats the fries, but they are SUPER salty. I don't normally like to send back food but I thought I was going to get hypertension eating the salty fries. I tried rubbing them on a napkin before eating them, but that's a lot of fries to wipe down.   Their beer selection was just okay.  I was there in October, and I wanted to try an Oktoberfest beer, and I wasn't impressed with their options.  I like Oktoberfest beers that don't taste like sugar syrup (the few and far between).    I like their fish bowl thingies, and honestly I should've ordered that with my husband, but it wasn't that sort of night.  We had somewhere to be in the morning."}
{"text":"Stackd is my go to takeout spot! I'm not sure why I'm seeing so many negative reviews, I really enjoy the food here. I've had a variety of items on their menu, but surprisingly my favorite takeout item has to be their chicken tenders dunked in blazin BBQ sauce. This is the first spicy BBQ sauce I've truly enjoyed!  I'd also recommend the buffalo sauce, and I've had their veggie burgers/chicken as well! You can't go wrong here, and it's very reasonably priced  (I don't eat red meat, so I can't judge on their *specialty* but everything else is great!)"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Pittsburgh from Orlando; my friends and I went to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (half off after 3pm on weekdays! and discounted with student ID!) and were really looking for a solid burger place. Stack'd was kind of hard to find since it's so small, but we parked around the corner and walked over.  I like the customizable individual menus that you can mark with the pencils provided at the table, with your choice of sauces, cheeses, and toppings. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get the pineapple mayo in lieu of my usual honey mustard and I was not disappointed. Burger came out great, tots were great, especially for the price! Meal was easily less than $10. Ambiance was what I could have hoped for a small sports-ish bar; we enjoyed watching MMA and the US summer Olympic team trials for men's gymnastics.  What I thought was interesting was that they did not ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, so I guess all of them are medium well? I don't remember them having pink in the center, but it tasted good regardless. I would definitely recommend this place if you were walking around shopping or strolling around in that neighborhood; if you traveled out of the way specifically to eat here, keep an eye out for it because it can be difficult to find."}
{"text":"Stackd has a really awesome down to earth staff who are always helpful and attentive. The burgers are awesome and they always put on what football game you wanna watch. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Stack'd just might have the best vegetarian burger in the 'burgh.  It's homemade, and either fried or baked to have a super crispy outside.    As other reviewers said, the best part about this place its the choose-your-own-adventure type of menu.  Unlimited different sauces to top off my burger? Don't mind if I do!  You get a giant burger and you can add a generous heaping of fries for $1-2.  They had several beers on tap and more in a cooler behind the bar.  I really enjoyed the food and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The burgers and sandwiches here are usually just consistent. That does not necessarily imply that they are anything spectacular. The chicken tastes as if a plain chicken breast was thrown on the grill without any seasoning and there has not once been enough sauce to compensate for this. I have been turned away during college night before turning 21, and then ignored at the bar very blatantly after turning 21 (my brother and I then promptly left the restaurant due to no service at all). Go up the street to Mario's for $5 burgers with fries on Wednesday and better service"}
{"text":"This is an amazing burger place !!! Double stack with Lett, Tomm pickles and onions with the house sauce was so good and cooked to perfection ... Tater tots were a lil greasy but awesome as well... I enjoyed it and cannot wait to go back ! Staff was also very friendly and helpful !! It's CYOB style! All burgers are cooked med-well unless other wise specified !"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the Shadyside area today and were looking for a place to eat lunch because we couldn't find parking around Pitt's campus. We were walking down the street and saw Stack'd and I gave Yelp a quick look and saw some good reviews so we walked in.  First off, we were only on the first floor so I'm not sure how much is upstairs but the I was concerned walking in about having a kid with us as our 2 yr old daughter was with but they had highchairs and also they had a chalkboard on the wall. However, the first floor was small. Again, maybe more room upstairs but I'm not sure.  We had fried pierogies, two burgers and my wife has fries and I had tots. Everything was delicious especially for the price. I was surprised that my burger had two patties but then realized the place is called Stack'd so two stacked patties shouldn't have been that surprising. The only thing I would have liked was a few more tots on my plate. Seemed like my wife got a lot of fries and I can't say the same for the side of tots.  Overall value here was fantastic. Great food comparable to BRGR in Cranberry but literally at half the price. We would definitely go again and are very glad we happened upon it."}
{"text":"Okay, I finally got to visit this restaurant and we definitely enjoyed it! I decided to pass on the free burger offered to me by the owner; I figured I would give Stack'd an honest chance as a regular paid customer. I appreciate the gesture from them though!  I can't believe the wacky things they have to put on burgers...mozzarella sticks, PEANUT BUTTER, etc. Very cool. I stuck with a rather traditional bacon cheeseburger to test the waters. I like that they offer pretzel buns, and it was tasty although I wish it were slightly sweeter like pretzel buns I've had in the past. The beef itself was very tasty (luckily I like my burgers well done, and it as actually very juicy for a well done burger). My onion rings on the side were standard but tasty. We got a milkshake for an extra $5...eh. It was good but it wasn't $5 good.  I'm not in Shadyside often because I don't like paying $4 to park for a couple hours...but if I am ever in the area this is definitely a place I would visit again!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and I left disappointed. I went opt here on $1 well night with my roommates. We went early and all ordered food. I ordered a burger with BBQ and Chrissy Onions. I was disappointed when I got my burger and it was just a burger with sauce on it. My other roommate ordered onion and mushrooms on hers and received hers with no mushrooms. Turns out my missing onions and her missing mushrooms ended up on the other roommates burger. Good thing she likes onions and mushrooms. It was starting to get busy by the time we got our food and the waitress just disappeared. She dropped off the checks and then an hour later she came back to pick them up. I was expecting slow service due to the $1 well night and completely understand due to being in the service industry before. Over all I was very disappointed with the food. My burger could have been amazing. But it wasn't. There are so many other build your own burger places in Pittsburgh. I'll probably be going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Drove an hour round trip for the food. I had the Buffalo Parmesan wings, which were good. Similar to Fatheads version. Also tried the 3/4 burger - bread less. I was disappointed. The burger patties were small. In addition, usually when you order a burger or sandwich most places wrap it in iceberg lettuce. Not the case here. I chose the House sauce, grilled onions, mushrooms, jalape√±os, & tomatoes. I didn't ask for lettuce because I figured it would be wrapped in it. The topping ratio was good except the onions. There were barely any onions on it. Also, they only put the House sauce on the top patty, which the 3 were fanned out. The burger itself was ok. I guess I was expecting more from this place. I don't regret trying it, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was here for a Steeler's game 2 weeks ago and decided to try a chicken wrap instead of a burger since I've been pretty disappointed overall in the burgers I have received and maybe this is just what needs to be ordered more often. I dressed it up with sweet thai chili sauce,sauteed mushrooms,sauteed onions, and spinach and this is probably the best meal I have eaten at Stack'd."}
{"text":"Stack'd has the same concept as Burgatory, but wiith less options. Basically, it's a build-your-own burger, so you can choose any kind of combination you like, and you can add fries for an extra dollar or two.  The strange thing about this place was there was no option for the way you want your burger done--they have a standard and that's it.   The burger was good when it came out, but service was a little slow and there weren't that many people there. I will definitely be back when I'm craving a good burger, but honestly, I'd rather go to Burgatory (except it's really far away from Carnegie Mellon)."}
{"text":"Found this establishment while strolling around downtown Shadyside.  There were three of us, my wife, and 18 year old son.  They use the \"build your own\" burger concept where you fill out a questionnaire type menu with the burger type, bun, toppings, sauce, etc.  They also have a large selection of beers, domestic, import and craft.  What seems to set them apart are the choice of toppings and sauces, some truly original!  Choose from toppings l like mac and cheese, olives, fried egg or Fritos, or standards like bacon, lettuce and tomato.  Sauces are unique too - Jerk, Cajun, OMFG! (Hot), and basic like BBQ, or Teriyaki.  I had the standard beef  1/2lb burger, and the sear and meat was truly excellent.  The meat was tender, tasty and well prepared.  They seem to cook everything to a medium well, but nevertheless the meat was delicious.  The wide had a veggie patty that I tried and found tasteless and boring.  She said she liked it, so go figure.  Summary: worth the time for a quick brew and burger wither lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Great atmosphere. Very chill"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. First, the good. Service was decently fast, and our water glasses were never empty. The menu had tons of options for toppings. Our   Now, the not so good. We overheard one of the servers telling another table that the ordering process was \"just like burgatory\"- probably not a good idea to cite your competition. My burger was pretty good- nothing spectacular, but certainly passable. My husband's burger was so greasy that it was dripping, and his two patties really weren't any more beef than I had. They had a local beer on tap, but the waitress didn't even know what brewery it was from. Our son got sick later that night from his burger...and he usually doesn't have food disagree with him. Our sides were ok- the tater tots were crispy and salty, but the onion rings were greasy and not very good."}
{"text":"My first venture to Stack'd was for a Pitt Young Alumni Council event, and I was pretty disappointed.  While the service was excellent, and the drinks cheap, the food was underwhelming.  Not bad, just meh. It's basically the same concept of Burgatory without all the choices.  I detest well done burgers and that's all they offer. The burger was greasy, tasted like it had been prepared ahead of time and just had my toppings added. I did have the crab seasoning fries, and they were pretty tasty, along with my friends tater tots. ( I will give them mad props for serving tots.) It was a nice large space, perfect for group events, or going with a crowd.  They have a lot of TVs upstairs, so it's a great space for watching a game.   I feel like if they could improve the burgers this place would be awesome!  I'll give it another shot..."}
{"text":"I decided to up the review after a recent visit to a competitor.    These guys havea  build a burger with a check sheet like that PIZZA place on elmsworth across from walnut grill.  All in all I think I am likely to return,"}
{"text":"Stack'd is your typical burgers and beer bar/restaurant, located in an area where most of the clients are college students looking to hangout. It is self seating, and the wait staff eventually will find you - typically takes longer on busy nights.  The food comes in large portions and like most meat off the grill is greasy but very tasty. The available toppings are numerous and combinations endless. This alone can provide you with entertainment and an interesting burger/experience.   The half of specials are worth it - Monday - half off wings, Tuesday - half off regular burgers, Wednesday - half off veggie burgers. Just make sure you get there early on Tuesday!  Stack'd remains one of my favorite burger joints, for a half price, meaty meal."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks with a friend on a Friday night. We sat downstairs at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and attentive. We opted for the special-the $10 fishbowl. For $10, the was more than enough alcohol for the two of us."}
{"text":"In my mind, this place is 3.5 stars, but they get the bump up for the truly excellent prices (especially for Shadyside).  DJ went through the burger process pretty well so I'll just add a few comments-- --Burgers are only available medium well.  We asked for less, and were told this was the only option.  Still, the burger (stack) that arrived was indeed medium well and not well, so that was something.  It was also surprisingly juicy for something cooked that much. --$6 for a half pound of meat (double burger) with lots of free toppings.  Many creative ones as well (peanut butter, fried mac & cheese ($), mozz sticks ($)) --$1 extra for a variety of fries--we tried the curly, the cajun, and the Old Bay.  The Old Bay fries were way oversalted (like they had been seasoned with Old Bay, which contains salt, and then salted as if regular fries), the curly fries were good, and the cajun fries were really tasty.  This was a nice portion for $1. --$1 off all drinks during Happy Hour weekdays until 7 (not sure when it starts), and $6 Yuengling pitchers until midnight.  This part is a continuation from Fieldhouse (the previous tenant).  Fieldhouse was probably my favorite Shadyside bar, and Stack'd hasn't changed much except for the burger twist (and they're missing the zucchini fries).  This is still a great place to catch a game, or three--there are enough TVs to follow many games at once, and there are TVs in every booth. Definitely a solid option if you're in the neighborhood!  Update: their dry-rubbed wings are really really good.  The sauced ones are okay, but for $9/dozen I want excellent.  Give them a try (and they'll let you do 6 and 6 instead of the whole dozen as one flavor)!"}
{"text":"This is quite the momentous occasion for me...my first yelp review!  Do I get some type of reward?  Preferably it'd be something edible.  I was pretty thrilled to hear that a Burgatory-esque joint was opening up in Shadyside, but would it match up to Burgatory?  My experience at Stack'd was interesting: UPS: -My burger was pretty delicious.  Fritos, guac, banana peppers, grilled onions, lettuce, pepper jack cheese and stack'd sauce...That is just a clear-cut recipe for burger heaven. -It's a nice sports bar, good deals (Tuesday's burgers are half off!) -Location, location, location.  It was nice to eat dinner/get some drinks, then venture off to the other Shadyside bars for the night.  DAHNS: -There is nowhere to check off on your order sheet how you would like your burger cooked.  All of our burgers were close to well done, this seemed to really bother a couple of my friends...and it makes sense.  Why try to give us the experience of total control over our food, but not with the most rudimentary element of the experience itself?  Seems backwards to me. -The service.....oh the service.  I try to be patient, understanding, etc, with food service having had experience with it, but this brought poor tending to a whole new level.  The only example I need to give is after we ordered a pitcher of beer and it was delivered to our table (about 15 minutes later), we didn't have cups to drink that beer for about another 10 minutes.  My friends contemplated passing around the pitcher and taking sips communion style (My friends are jags, clearly).  Overall:  -I'm a sucker for anything burgers, so I'd rule Stack'd as a good burger place, local to me.  But, if I feel like making the trek to Burgatory, they shall victor over Stack'd easily.  I will definitely be visiting Stack'd again, in hopes that the poor service was just due to chance.    4 stars for you, Stack'd.  Albeit if half stars were available, i'd give you 3 and a half...just to keep you on your toes."}
{"text":"love love love this place. Burger Bar and Bar. Excellent food lots of toppings and if you'r efeeling adventurous, order the Burger of the Day and don't ask what it is before hand. One criticism, you can't ask for a medium/rare burger-- well you CAN but it's not standard for the waiters to ask. Great beer selection, decent price."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love the food here. However, when my friends and I visited Stack'd this previous Wednesday - Thanksgiving eve - I was surprised by the poor service, and the waitress's unwillingness to serve us at all. When we walked in around 11:30 pm, the downstairs bar was fully seated, and a few tables were filled. We sat down at a booth to order some burgers and appetizers. The waitress working that night promptly told us that orders were only being taken from the bar, she wasn't serving to tables. I was surprised by this because it was still early and I know that they usually stay open until 2 like other bars. So we walked up to the busy bar and were able to place our food order there. We went back to our booth and I heard her telling a friend that she was trying to close up early. It was only around 11:30, but this explains why she didn't want to serve us. She seemed annoyed when she delivered our food (one of the burgers was made wrong), and rolled her eyes at us when we requested things like more water, ranch dressing, etc. When we were finished, she hurriedly cleaned off our table and delivered the check. After we paid, we were waiting at the booth for our ride to come pick us up. We were the last ones downstairs (around 12:30 am), and we could tell she was waiting for us to leave. So, we gathered our things and waited in the doorway while she locked up the downstairs dining room and ran out with a couple of friends. I was so shocked that she blatantly tried to avoid serving us, was unhappy when she did have to provide us service (during normal working hours of the bar), and was closing down almost 2 hours before the restaurant even closed. The food was good for the most part - but the experience was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I have been craving a burger for about two weeks now. So long that I've gone from wanting a crazy gourmet burger (aka Burgatory) to just wanting ANY DANG BURGER. Finally yesterday, a Sunday, nothing to do, I can go get my burger. I found out from the Yelp forum about this place and, as it's closer (and cheaper) than Burgatory, we decided to check it out. We are pleased.   So I have obviously been setting up this review to compare it to Burgatory because after you've eaten there, every burger place is compared to Burgatory (or Winghart's). Winghart's and Burgatory are the kings of gourmet burgers, in my opinion, but Stack'd delivers a really, really, REALLY good burger.   They offer a $6 build-your-own option. There are no options on the meat besides ground beef, vegetarian and chicken (so no bison or crazy meats) and whether you would like a double, triple or quad burger - or as big as you can possibly handle. There are a few selections on bun type, sauce, and cheese and then some great options for toppings. I went with a double provolone cheeseburger on a kaiser bun with BBQ sauce, banana peppers, grilled mushrooms, field greens, and bacon. $9. Yessss, this place is so on my price-wavelength! You can add fries for $1 or onion rings for $2, and they have regular, cajun, curly and old bay fries. The fries were my least favorite part, though. I could have done without them.  The burgers come out and they are freaking huge. Like, can't get my mouth on it to get a bite huge lol. One of my first thoughts when I was cutting it in half was that I wasn't asked how I would like it cooked. I don't know if they don't take requests or the bartender just forgot to mention, though. The burger was more done than I like (think well vs medium), but surprisingly still very juicy and tasty. I was hesitant on the banana peppers, as much as I love them, but the bartender recommended them and I am super glad I got them. They added a nice crunch and sweetness to the burger.  Their beer selection for a small place is incredible. Any place who has Pumking right now is an automatic win spot for me. The also had Magic Hat's Hex, Brooklyn Brown Ale, and a few other great selections on tap with a very good varied bottle selection.  The bartenders were friendly and it was neat being off the main road in Shadyside. Less traffic and noise. TV set up is great for catching the game, any game. I'd highly recommend this place for a lunch or game watching spot. They offer other options for food like wings and salads, but I obviously was only in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"I moved to Shadyside this past week, and after an intense morning of heavy lifting, I thought I'd try ordering some pick-up from a local spot. My neighbors were talking up Stack'd, saying they had a pleasant experience on their $3 burger night, and their website touted themselves as the self-proclaimed Best Burger in Shadyside, so why not?  Ah, Shadyside. Don't let the promising menus and beautiful restaurants fool you--this aesthetic appeal is all just a clever ruse, masking the overpriced mediocrity of a bland experience. Regrefully, the food is just as gentrified as the neighborhood, and although solid experiences exist (e.g. BRGR, Soba, Casbah), they are startlingly few.  The burger--I had a Stack'd Burger (2 1/4 pound patties) had a well-made garlic BBQ sauce on it, and I don't have any complaints about the presentation...but the burger itself seemed frozen. Now, I don't want to make any accusations, as the menu says that it's a special blend recipe made fresh, but they were in perfect circles and had that flattened look of the frozen bulk-brand school-lunch burger. And, I don't want to make any accusations, but the taste verified my thoughts.  The fries--I added a side order of fries for an extra buck. I was given eighteen thin, fast-food style fries. So what, I counted. I like thin fries. But I also like Wendy's, and so far this meal has added up to be a little bit more expensive than the fast-food alternative.  The milkshake--this five-dollar milkshake provided yet again an overpriced let-down.  The salad--the final blow was the salad. I ordered a grilled chicken caesar, and was given grilled chicken, shredded lettuce, and Kraft parmesan cheese. I'm not sure if they under-dressed the salad or forgot the dressing altogether, but it was surprisingly bland and bare. Hello Bistro offers a great $9 salad, and you can get caesar dressing on it, too, but you also get a little bit more than Kraft parmesan and lettuce. Even Wendy's throws in cherry tomatoes.  All of this came to a whopping $23. I understand that fast-casual isn't fancy, but it also shouldn't equate to fast-food at double the price.   My gripe is that a place like this has so much potential, and from the look of the menu, it's everything I've ever wanted in a fast-casual experience. I love the atmosphere, I love the options, I love everything about it...except for the food. Best Burger in Shadyside? Sorry. I might come back for a $3 special sometime, but other than that, let's just add this place to the ever-expanding list of Shadyside let-downs."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! I love that they a extremely customizable by filling out the 'burger form'. The ingredients are always fresh and the meat is soft and juicy. Even the chicken is really soft. Their milkshakes are available in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions which taste delicious.  I like the fries too which are on the thinner side although I wish that they make it more crispy. Overall it's a great burger place with a casual ambience."}
{"text":"Such a fun place. Half off burgers on Tuesday's and the best bartenders the guy was really cute. First time coming but will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ventured here to have a nice bite to eat after we escaped the rain of the Pitt game, and I have to admit, Stack'd has me hooked and wanting more.   My biggest compliment is the fact that they have a variety of food, not just burgers.  Wings, yes, wings, and they are delicious wings with many sauces to choose from.  Lots of appetizer choices, and everything is very affordable.  I was actually blown away by the affordable prices since it is in a more upscale area.  Burger was really tasty.  Toppings that usually cost extra at other burger places were free here.  I got a double blue cheese burger with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, roasted red peppers, and spinach all for $8.  At other places that would cost me like $12 for all those toppings.  Sides are a la carte, but for only a buck or two you can add fries or onion rings.  One of my complaints is that their burgers are cooked well done with nothing stated on the menu otherwise.  I honestly didn't mind it being cooked so much, but next time I go, I am asking for some pink.    Biggest complaint was that both my friend and mine's buns were cool, like refrigerator cold.  I was surprised when I went to go pick up my burger and was caught off guard by the chill.  I figured all places have gotten to the point of throwing the buns on the grill before they served it up?  Hmmmmm.. maybe next time.  All in all, absolutely delicious.  I cannot wait to go back and build another delicious burger.  Next time I am saving room for a milkshake."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I would compare it to burgatory. The food was excellent and I maybe a little bit obsessed with their pretzel bun. They have some awesome add ons for your burgers like peanut butter, Fried Perogi, and fried bananas. My only complaint would be the service, I asked the waitress for some some suggestions for my burger and all she could say was \"people do some crazy things\". I really wanted a fun suggestion."}
{"text":"First off I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how clean it was in here, especially at the bar area, and the reason I am not giving it only two stars is because of the cleanliness.  My friend and I always order two things and split them in half to share since we usually want the same things. We ordered potato skins (I had been craving some for awhile now and saw them on the menu here so that's why we decided to give this place a shot) and got a quarter pound burger on a pretzel bun. We got the burger with lettuce, grilled onions, frito's, spicy ranch, and avocado's so let me just say I was excited for all those flavors! When it came to the potato skins I was disappointed even at first glance since I noticed that the cheese on top had not melted all the way and they seemed very oily. As for taste they were bland and greasy. The burger was disappointing as well. Let me tell you now that I do not recommend getting a quarter pound burger on a pretzel bun because it just is too small for that amount of bread, there was a least an inch of extra bread around the burger. The burger meat itself tasted unseasoned and not that great. The toppings made it slightly better, but there were maybe two frito's on the burger and I basically only tasted the avocado. We also got curly fries on the side and they were lukewarm to start and cold after a few minutes had past.   On the plus side, the prices were a little cheaper than Burgatory or BRGR, but the taste does not make up for it. The bartender was also super nice and attentive. I don't know who controls the music, but it was perfect! It was like they took all my ITunes playlists, so that is another plus.   I might come back for just drinks, but there are plenty of other options on Walnut street that might be better quality overall."}
{"text":"I would honestly say best burgers in town....period. And I am comparing to the well known competitors."}
{"text":"Really good deal if you go on the 50% off days! Food is solid, and has a fun college atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like the idea of Stack'd but I was a little underwhelmed when I actually came here.  First, kudos to the bartender who didn't show that she was frustrated with me when I had so many requests for an order to-go.  The ambiance was also nice; it was pseudo-industrial/urban and clean.  There are four TVs at the bar and it looks like it seats a lot of people in a small space without being crushed.  Second, I'm struggling with the value.  The burger was okay.  When you're only known for one thing, you should do that thing really well.  I elected to go with the 1/4 pound burger instead of the 1/2 pound (one patty vs. two patties).  My burger was quite frankly dry and didn't taste like much.  It was also quite a bit smaller than the whole wheat bun.  I tasted the toppings more - tomatoes, spinach, and Fritos.  There were only about 5 Fritos on top.  I think I also put a honey ranch sauce or something - clearly it didn't make an impression and was really only there to give it some moisture.  Third, the fries.  They were good, but again, average.  I understand that in America we're used to getting 3 serving's worth of fries, so when I was presented with the small pile of fries, I was a little miffed.  $2 extra for just plain fries.  No curlies, no seasoning, nothing fancy.  If you want fries on the side, get the fancy ones because no matter what, you're paying a flat rate of two dollars.  I don't know what their business model is, but I would happily have a small side of fries or chips given to me and if I wanted something special (seasoned fries, curlies, etc) I would gladly pay extra.  I would come back on their burger night for half-priced burgers, but I'm not sure if I'd make the trip out here on any other occasion."}
{"text":"The burgers are Ok. Definitely not the best burgers eve and not a bad burger at all. Its just Ok.   The enviroment is kind of different if you go to the top level. Its somewhat between a bar and a restaurant. Fun with a lot of beers on tap.  The Tuesday half price burger deal is definitly great.  I used to go there on Tuesdays regularly. But I stopped going there evetually because the staff were not welcoming at all. Its seems they are angry with the customers. However, I have heard this has improved since the last time but I haven't been there since."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot if you're looking for a quick made to order burger. You pick everything out that you want on your burger, check it off with a pencil and hand it to the server. Tried the appetizer of pork nachos this time- absolutely terrible. It was a sloppy BBQ chili mixture on top of generic chips you probably can buy at Aldi (I wish I was kidding about the chips). Absolutely nothing special about these and sort of gross when you start eating.. they should try to improve by making their own chips or at least trying to fake it.   Also- just like burgatory everything costs extra- cheese is $1 and a choice of a side (general fries for example) is $2... the base burger is $8 itself plus add-ons you're not leaving there without a 12-14 dollar burger plus your side of choice. Personally, there's a lot of other small burger places in Pittsburgh that make just as good of burgers and don't charge the shit out of you for every single thing. But hey, if you're looking for a burger, willing to spend 2.00 for approximately 12 fries... go for it, but it can be better elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this past Sunday and our experience was not what we hoped it would be. The reason it gets 2 stars is for service and choices of toppings. Our waitress was super polite and attentive. The amount of toppings to choose from in order to build your burger was awesome. They pretty much have every topping you could think of, plus more. As for the actual food, eh.   We ordered the mac and cheese bites for an appetizer and they were really good, so I guess if I could give a half a star, that would be worth a half. It was served with a spicy ranch dressing that had a ton of flavor and was great for dipping.   For our burgers, I had a hamburger on a kaiser roll with cheddar cheese, garlic aioli, lettuce, tomato and grilled onions with a side of fries. The garlic aioli was really tasty but the actual burger was disappointing. It was dry and tasteless and you can tell they don't really use quality beef. The french fries were just regular ol' fries, and I was really hoping for fresh cut ones seeing as they do so many homemade sauces. My husband had a hamburger on a wheat roll with ketchup, house sauce, hot pepper relish, cheddar cheese, lettuce and red onion with a side of onion rings. He thought the same thing, the toppings were great but the actual burger really lacked in taste, making the whole burger really unenjoyable. We both agreed afterwards that we much prefer burgers from 5 Guys and that's practically a fast food restaurant!  All in all, unless the quality of the burger meat improves dramatically, I can't see us every going back."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure you should call yourself a place that specializes in burgers when the burger meat only comes medium-well.  I take that as either the cook isn't confident enough in his abilities or the management isn't confident enough in the quality of the meat to not poison the clientele.  Because of this, Stack'd automatically lost one star before even I even ordered.    There are a few other things that Stack'd needs to improve upon.  First, while there is a pretty good Yeungling pitcher special on weeknights, the rest of the happy hour isn't really that great (only $1 off drinks).  Second, apparently there wasn't a server in the upstairs area, so if you want to order food or drinks, you either have to sit at the bar or keep going up to the bar to order.  Third, if it's quiet in the bar, there is some awful game in the back that plays the most annoying little tunes every few minutes.  To some, that might not even be something to notice, but for someone who cringes at loud, unexpected noises like that, I found it unsettling.  Now for the reasons that Stack'd salvages a 4th star... The kitchen is actually open until 1 am, which if you've ever found yourself looking for a damn open kitchen in Shadyside after 10 only to be disappointed, this is a big deal.  The bartender was really friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  There are many, many TVs (including a TV in each booth) and if you're an out of town football fan who can't get the game at home (think Eagles, Raiders, etc.), you will be able to find your game playing - and you won't even get harassed for not being a Steelers fan.  Finally, the restroom was probably the nicest in Shadyside so that wins big points with me.  Overall, I would most certianly go back, but I truly hope the ownership reconsiders its policy on buger cooking!"}
{"text":"My friends and I go here A LOT. They have half price stack'd burgers on Tuesday nights starting at 9. I pretty much only go here for half-off burgers, but I've been here a few times for full-priced food. The food isn't all that great, so my review is essentially: for a half-price burger, it's awesome! But for a full-price burger, it's ok.  They make you get the burger well-done and don't ask a temp. For people that actually like burgers, that can be kind of a deal breaker. But you can choose your bun, toppings, etc, and add fries for just a buck! They are also one of the only places that offers peanut butter burgers. I love a peanut butter burger with iceburg lettuce, fried bananas, and pineapple mayo. Seriously so good.  The fries are always just a TINY BIT too salty for my tastes. And I looooove salty fries, so that really speaks to how much they tend to over salt them.  The beer pitcher deal is great. I think it's 6 bucks for a pitcher of Yuengling. The service is always friendly. They've messed up our orders a few times, but when we're paying half-price, we don't even bother complaining. It's just not that big of a deal.  All in all, decent place, decent service, AND I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER BURGERS.  Oh, also, for the vegetarians of the world, the veggie burger is pretty good. Nice and crispy! Nom nom!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to go and get a fish bowl but they took it off the menu but we ended up staying and to get some apps and we started to eat and soon enough we found a bug in one of our dishes and ruined everything else. So just be mindful."}
{"text":"Went twice now before Pitt BB games.  Burger was over done first trip but it was decent.  Biggest issue is the bar stools in the bar.  They are attached to the floor and uncomfortable.  When its crowded as it is before every game, you can't really get to the bar or let other people through to order.  If you could stand sideways like other bars you could fit 50% more people at the bar.  Serious design flaw.  The Bar Rescue guy would loose his mind if he saw this set up ."}
{"text":"Hamburger was pretty decent. Especially for the price. Can't beat 7 bucks for a good burger and fries. Also $6 yuengling pitchers. In a nice area to walk around after."}
{"text":"BYOS - Build Your Own Stack.  You get a pencil and list to check off your burger preference! Step 1 - Select beef - # of burgers, or chicken or veggie.                The burger is 1/4 pound but you get 2 for $6.                 And you can add another.  Cooked mild well, only.                 Stack'd has its own blend of fresh meat for the burger. Step 2  - Choose a bread - 5 choices including a wrap. Step 3 - Add a cheese - 5 cheeses.  American blue, provolone, feta, cheddar. Step 4 - Slather in Sauce - about 20 different including OMFG (Very HOT) Step 5 - Top it off - about 20 toppings - from lettuce , to various peppers, pickles, etc. Add to your order if you want fries, from regular, curly, cajun, old bay.  Wait and get hungry watching everyone else in the place chow down.  My burger was stack'd high, very good and juicy.  Would have preferred medium burger; seemed to be a little to well done for my taste.  The cajun fries are very good and spicy; long thin crisp fries.   The back of the checklist has salads, crisp wings with about 8 dipped and 5 rubbed flavors.   Add another good burger joint to list.  Stack'd is rather small with 4 booths, 4 tables and about 10 bar stools.  4 TV's and a large beer list with about 20 drafts. Service was very friendly made sure we had refills."}
{"text":"We heard of the new burger joint and decided to give it a try.  My fave burger place is BRGR and my boyfriend says the best burger is to be had at Meat and Potatoes.  The place is nice, although small.  We were the only customers on a Sunday afternoon.  We were given a menu and a pencil.  You check off on the menu what you want and the waitress comes back to pick up your choices.  We ordered the chili cheese fries as an appetizer and they were really good.  After we ordered, I realized we weren't asked on the menu card of by the waitress how we wanted our burgers prepared.  We do not like our burgers cooked well, so I went to find our waitress at the bar.  I asked her if we could have our burgers prepared rare.  She said that they prepare all burgers medium well, but would ask to get ours as rare as possible.  I'm a little confused on why a burger joint would prepare all burgers medium well, when there are so many ways to prepare a burger.  The burgers were ok, nothing really to brag about, but my onion rings were very tasty.  Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I went there right around close on a Saturday night and the service was mediocre at best.  The burger was not even hot or tasty. This was my second time there and I would not recommend it.  It was noisy as well. I understand it's a bar, but it could have been a better restaurant."}
{"text":"The bottom floor is a restaurant and the upper floor is bar and restaurant. Pretty similar to all the other Stack'd locations. There are so many options to build your own burger. I am a fan of the cajun turkey burger with fritos, tomatoes, field greens, and onions. They also have a lot of sauce options from spicy to sweet to creamy. There are also a variety of $1 toppings such as fried mac and cheese, pineapples, chilli, etc. If you aren't in the burger mood, they also have quesadillas, and lots of different appetizers. Pretty good standard American fare. Prices are pretty reasonable as well."}
{"text":"We came upon this place after the recommended Italian restaurant across the street had a long wait.  We were weary from travelling to Pittsburgh from Va and hungry so we opted for burgers. What a great find.  You build your own tasty burger!  The beer was great and we ordered the peanutbutter bacon milkshake...this may sound gross but it was unique and yummy!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I absolutely love curly fries but for some reason they're hard to come by in Pittsburgh.  Thank you, Stack'd!  Always delicious and never seems to be enough.  Here's a tip: If you want curly fries forego paying the $2 to get them on the side and instead pay $4 and order a basket.   When sharing with someone else I feel this is the perfect amount.  The veggie and regular patties have great flavor and could stand on their own - but this place is called STACK'D for a reason.  I love that you can sit down and just put a check next to every single topping you want.  I haven't tried the peanut butter on my burger yet but I like having the option.  Also, they have avocados!  As a California native I can always appreciate a place that offers avocados.  If you're craving a burger or curly fries I would highly recommend this place.  They also have quite the beer selection and offer tv screens playing whatever game you may be interested in watching.  Also, the veggie patty is MUCH better than either Burgatory and BRGR!  Best time to come is Tuesday between 9 and midnight as burgers are only $3!"}
{"text":"Solid burgers.  Nothing amazing but they are highly customizable which is nice.  Fries were good as well  Could have been more generous with toppings but that's really my only complaint.  Can't beat it for the price IMO"}
{"text":"Half-priced burgers Tuesday Night (I kinda don't want to advertise this here at the fear of the place being crowded when I go!). A great deal - 3 bucks for a 1/2 lb burger and then you can add a bunch of free toppings and then other toppings are like a buck each. My burger with cheese and fried egg, cucumbers, relish, sauteed mushrooms and banana peppers with cajun fries was a total of 6 bucks (as a graduate student, I will gladly take up on anything that gets me full in 6 bucks) - and can't forget the 6 dollar pittcher of yuengling.  The thing I like about the upstairs is that it doesn't really get crowded until a bit later (I am talking about the weekends) - though right off of walnut. They have a ton of TVs and decent drink prices, cheap beer, a couple of dart boards as well. So they do have that going for them and I usually like coming here if I want somewhere happening but not somewhere where I have to bump into 40 people just to get to the bar.  As for the burgers - mind you they are tasty. Mine was a tad bit over done yesterday but I finished the whole thing - so that is a testament to my hunger as well as the tastiness of the burger (my friend got chicken fingers on a burger - where else can you add chicken fingers on a burger for a buck).  All in a all, a toned down version of walnut that I don't mind going to. Thursday nights aren't super crowded either (and for you vegetarians out there - it's half price veggie burgers on wednesdays)"}
{"text":"Soooooo good.  Great for a late night binge. I've experienced the food three times. The first experience wasn't so great, but boy did they redeem themselves!  I ordered through postmates (which is a great delivery service), and I was very pleased with the promptness of the order. The food was still hot, and delicious upon delivery, but I digress...  My guy and I always build our own stacks. He gets a plain jane burger, American cheese, and bacon with tater tots- he loves it! I get the chicken breast with other toppings... I don't want to name these in hopes that they name it after me one day ;-) I also got the tots. So amazing!  They don't have a ridiculously extensive menu, but the food sure is fantastic."}
{"text":"The server provides with a checklist where you build your own burger. My only criticism is that the range of options was so great that I would have appreciated some suggested pairings. We started off with fried perogies. They were warm, crisp, and tasty. I'll definitely have them again, after I've tried a few more items in the menu. For my burger, I had a stacked burger with ranch, jalape√±os, and fried Mac and cheese. The meat was juicy and the flavors came together well. The tater tots were crispy and so full of flavor that I forgot about the ketchup."}
{"text":"Great veggie burger! BYOB'd w/ pepper jack cheese, stackd house sauce (their chipotle sauce), field greens, tomato, dill pickles and red onion on a wheat bun. Delicious and well put together. The veggie patty had a bit of crunch on the outer edges which was nice. I ordered a side of curly fries and also got to try old bay fries (they were out of onion rings), which while were overcooked just a tad (a little on the hard side) were still awesome. I would eat it all over again and order the old bay fries. Yum! We sat at the bar cause the tables and booths were filled around 9pm(!). Service was great though - friendly and attentive. The bartender was nice enough to change one of the tvs to the Texas Kansas State game."}
{"text":"Awesome build your own burgers, great specials.  This place does not disappoint.  Fun place to get your Shadyside night kicked off (or ended!)!"}
{"text":"Stack'd burgers is an awesome place for a good burger. We went when apps were 50% off which is a nice surprise. The burger was awesome, I loved being able to personalize every step and it came out really quickly. Overall a great place and will be back!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are so yummy . They have a pretty wide variety of beers as well . Pretty good place to hangout with friends !"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - A great sports bar with plenty of space. Plenty of televisions and a good beer selection.   Service - As good as it gets. They changed two televisions for us and we changed tables for a better view of the TVs without any issues.  Food - Typical bar food menu so expect about what you would for sports bar food. They do get major points for their extensive wing sauces and ability to customize the burger in about a million different ways.   Wings - 5/5 Everything you'd expect from sports bar wings Burger - 4/5 Good burger, not great.   Drinks - Good prices. Cold beer. You can't ask for much more at a sports bar.  Overall - A great place to watch a game. Knowing I'd get great service and good food with plenty of televisions makes this a go-to place for watching a game.   Points for: Service, wings No negatives."}
{"text":"The burgers here are decent. Not the best but decent. You customize the burger and have so many choices. In talking from eggs to pierogies, it's insane. They have specials too. I think Tuesday is half off burgers. I know we went during happy hour and our apps were half off. I'm not disappointed in our meal and the service was good but I don't think I'm in a hurry to get back."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding service, atmosphere, drink specials, and food. The burgers are delicious, and it is hands down one of the best hidden gems on Walnut St."}
{"text":"Stack'd has got some stacked burger competition. With BRGR right around the corner, two Winghart's locations and two Burgatory locations... along with Tessaro's and a handful of other joints, you gotta really make those patties shine to get noticed in town.   Did they shine? Not so much. It wasn't a bad burger. It just wasn't great either. To be honest, I really think that it may have been a frozen patty. It had that perfectly rounded shape that you see when you buy them pre-pattied (is that a word?) in the store. You're able to pick from a checklist of ingredients. I mean, TONS! And not just ketchup and mustard, but mac n' cheese and tator tots on top of the burger. I literally don't know how you'd eat the thing!   What I've learned in my burger eating days is that I like to keep it simple. For me it's #1 the burger quality, #2 the cheese and #3 the sauce. I was really excited to try the Big Mac sauce they call McDowell sauce (why that name, no idea). Listen, I can't lie. Sometimes scarfing down a McD's burger is delicious. It may be when I'm super hungry and craving that type of food, but I'll instantly regret it after. I did not instantly regret it after, but the whole burger just fell flat. While the sauce was good, I really think it was the issue with the burger. Just not quality meat, no taste and possibly from a frozen patty.   I ordered the tots on the side because they sounded so good on the toppings menu. They were tots. Again, I could get these tots out of the frozen section of Giant Eagle. Not that I'm expecting gourmet tots... this was just something I that I knew how it would taste before I got it. I was just lusting after some fried potatoes.   The beer list actually looked decent and so did the boozy shakes. But after the burger, I'd be afraid to try them. Knowing that around the corner in East Liberty I'd be getting a delectable shake from BRGR. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Actually, I'd probably not even suggest it. Just go to Winghart's, you'll be happy you did, I promise!"}
{"text":"Won't come back. Lame service, lame food...let's just sum it: LAME.  The HH was cute though."}
{"text":"UPDATE:   I previously gave this place 1- star but let me tell you have things changed. I believe that if you give a crappy review and the place has turned around you should inform people that you have had a change of heart. After my first post the manager got in contact with me and I answered some of his questions. He genuinely wanted to know about my last few experiences, and how he could make up for them. I was just appreciative that he saw a problem and wanted to make his establishment better. I went in a couple of nights ago because grad school is frying my brain, and I needed a burger. When I went in Jessica was there and she greeted me and was extremely kind and helpful. I went back again and I got the same service :attentive, and welcoming, AND My order was correct.    This place found a problem and made a change. I haven't been in when Jessica isn't working so I cannot speak for all of the staff, but it was enough to make me not want to cringe about the thought of going back.     --------------------------------------------------"}
{"text":"Very average, in a town with an extraordinary number of burger joint options, many of which are actually fantastic.  Not awful, but not worth a rave either.   First, a basic description.  It's small but very brightly lit, which could be a pro or a con, depending on your preferences and mood.  It's got a bar, but the whole vibe is more breakfast-at-the-diner than evening hangout.  The booths have individual TVs, which is kinda cool, but I didn't get to try them out because the only one available when I got there was right in the front.  That would have been fine, except the outside lights were shining right into my eyes, which live at a fairly low elevation in relationship to sea level, and the paramedic in me is constitutionally incapable of eating with my back to a door or window like that, especially when alone.    Food wise, you mark your choices on preprinted pads and hand it to the server, so there should be no ambiguity about your order.  Pretty simple.   My burger came overcooked to almost completely well done, but since I had not been asked how I wanted it *and* I had forgotten to specify it on my own, *and* it was late and I was hungry, I let it go and ate it anyways.  It was decent, and at least not completely dried out, but definitely nothing special.   I ordered the Stack'd burger, which was supposed to be a half pound burger, thinking I'd cut it in half and take part of it home since that's really too much meat for one sitting.  Nope, not gonna happen; all they did was put two regular size 1/4 lb. patties on one regular size bun, which just made it impossible to get in my mouth, especially with the toppings I ordered.    It was 1/2 off, though, because it was a Tuesday night, so that was nice, and eased that pain. Which turned out to be irrelevant anyways, since I ended up inhaling everything on my plate, but I digress...  Fortunately, I had also actually planned to eat it with a fork and knife that night, to skip part of the bun's calories (what is that they say about the road to hell and intentions?), but since I ended up ordering fewer toppings than I initially intended, the thought to pick it up like normal did cross my mind, but alas, it was simply not possible. I've got a big mouth in general, just not literally :-)  And... they left out the mushrooms, so I had to send it back to get them.  They left out the mushrooms!  Not the end of the world, really, but they *did* have it in writing right in front of them.  Rather than come to the table when I signaled her desperately, the bartender/waitress asked from the bar what I needed -which would have necessitated my shouting over the music, which I declined to do.    I had already also had to ask for a napkin and indeed a setup at all when they brought my beer, so I was just a wee bit irritated, and the server was paying a lot more attention to the guys at the bar than the rest of the room. I don't like having to drag the most basic of basics out of restaurants like that.  The fries were only sort of edible because they were literally soggy and almost dripping with grease, not even close to crisp and fresh.    That was so disappointing.  If you're going to blow your diet, including the one you had only just decided to start, at least it should be worth it.  But, see above about inhaling.  I was more overcome with hunger than I had realized and also figured that the odds of anything better coming out if I complained were likely slim.    I do have to say that they got the parts of my order that I wanted on the side and not on the burger correct, including my decidedly odd request to put the sauce on the bottom half of the bun instead of the top.  Kudos for that!  And they have a very nice beer selection, with a number of good options on tap.  The server was very willing to bring me a taste of something I wanted to try, and very nice in general.    They are also open late, which is great for us night owls.    They advertise that they are open until midnight, but I don't know if you can actually still get food then, since they told me at 11:55 that they were closing in 5 minutes, as in hint, hint, your stint in here is through.  I was the only person left in there by that time, though, and I *had* been taking my sweet time with my beer and a good book on my Kindle.  I won't take off a star as I often do because the place is completely inaccessible, with a very steep staircase, because it really is not fixable in this case, but potential customers should be aware that they are not going to get in there with a chair or walker, or even \"just\" difficulty walking.    I do wish that businesses would not rent inaccessible locations like this to start with, though, and generally try not to patronize them even when I can, because I *do* use a chair sometimes myself (and numerous friends do as well, some of them full time), and it always just feels like a giant slap in the face, or at least something dangled in front of us only to be told we cannot have it."}
{"text":"J and I came here last night for a quick bite before heading home. I've been to the Oakland location and love the food. This location is a lot smaller, however the staff were just as friendly and efficient. J ordered a 1/4 pound burger with bread and butter pickles, provolone, and bacon on Brioche with tater tots. I had curly fries and a chicken sandwich on pretzel bun with avocado, cucumbers, spring mix, cheddar, mayo, ketchup, and pesto aoli. Everything was delicious and around $25, which makes us happy. Definitely plan on returning again soon!"}
{"text":"We were here for the Stanley cup final. One of my colleagues recommended this place for the match day and I don't regret taking their advise. Service was great even though it was a busy day.   First things first, if you are looking for a place to watch a game with a group of 4 -5 friends, I highly recommend this place. I suggest you to occupy one of those cabin seating that has a TV. It was a good experience.  We ordered milkshakes, drinks, fries, chicken tenders and fried pickles. Everything was great. The Cajun flavored potato fries are the best fries I ever had. I will go back for those fries again after completing this review!"}
