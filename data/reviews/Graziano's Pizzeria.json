{"text":"How do they keep it so cheap during happy hour? Food is just average but since I can pay for my meal with the spare coins found within my sofa I wouldn't mind going again"}
{"text":"I ordered a Veggie Pizza with 4 different toppings and did not really enjoy it a lot. They use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza. Also, the toppings were not greatly blended, just rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy the pizza crust.
I work right next door, but wont go there again.
I usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp had 4 stars and I was disaoopinted, so writing my experience.So sharing my input that may help others make an uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars is misleading."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My 29 dollar pizza was not only cold when it showed up, but flavorless as well. At least my toddlers seem to like it..."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this pizzeria. the pie was excellent the wings were delicious and the service was friendly. I would recommend this neighborhood joint to anyone. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in AZ. Their crust is perfect! I love that they don't have a sweet sauce. It is perfect. There is just something about pizza from the East Coast.
Their sub sandwiches are like the hot crispy bread baked grinders you can get in the Midwest. I have never bad food here.
Don't think about being a rude customer because they won't put up with you.
Give it a try.. I bet you will love their food"}
{"text":"Service is bad, pizza is mediocre and they charge full price for 1/2 toppings. You can easily do better."}
{"text":"Closest thing to New York pizza that I've had in years! I ordered the white pizza and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!"}
{"text":"Been here once bebefe and boy will i not be going again. Worst customer service anywhere. That old lady behind the counter needs to learn customer service and how to treat her employees better. Such a disgrace. Sorry grazianos. Glendale is better without you.


So I decided to give it another try here we showed up with about 30 people hungry from a football game the lady immediately pretty much said get out of my store I don't have enough room for you and I don't want to cook your food we took our business to Stevies across the street wow what a service and food they have give them a try"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Saturday (today), service was great, pizza was yummy. My favorite part of the meal was the wings. We love this place and will go back!"}
{"text":"Went for the award winning Clam Chowder. Disappointed. More like cream of potato soup. The small amount of clams were very tender. Pizza was good and the crust is excellent."}
{"text":"RUDE OWNER!
We have been going to Grimaldi's now Grazzianos for 10 years.  We are a family of 5 and My stepson who is 26, and husband are BIG eaters. They can easily eat enough food for a family of 6 all by themselves. Today, we walked out and vowed never to return because of the owners rude behavior. We love the wings and the happy hour specials and always support a family business over the big boys. Anyhoooo....
If you order hot wings it must be in increments of at least 6 and you get a dressing. If you order in increments of 12, you still only get one dressing. So my stepson has 2 orders of 6, just so he can get his 2 dressings. Well when they refused to give him 2, without charging him the extra .59 cents. I mean the money won't break us, but the principal of it all is crazy. So he calls the owner over and asks her. As soon as she got to our table she was rude and told him in a tone \"so basically your wanting to get out of paying the extra .59 cents. No\" I have never seen a restaurant owner speak to someone like this. Then we called her back when the food arrived, and she struts over to our table and first thing out of her mouth was \"Now what?!\" Really? That left a bad taste in our mouth and he told her \"forget it. Give me the check for the drinks and salad. We are leaving\" She argues and says \"over .59 cents?\" He says \"No. Over your attitude, I did not need to be talked to like that\" She says \"You don't understand how expensive ranch dressing is!\" In her condescending tone. I was floored. She lost our weekly business for sure. Now, as a restaurant owner she should have written off the ranch dressing as we have been loyal customers for YEARS. The other people who work there are nice and I feel bad for them, if she treats her customers like this imagine how she treats them. I hope she sees this review and responds with her feedback. SHE has no one to blame  for lost business but herself."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The place inside is small, but popular. Solid local pizza joint when you just want a good pie."}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever tasted. Nice variety in flavors, but I always stick with medium buffalo sauce. Wings always come out steaming hot and have never been anything but satisfying. You should also give the slides a shot too. 

Happy Hour prices are great as well. 50 cent wings and $1 slices of pizza before toppings is great. Fair warning about the happy hour pizza slices, I think those slices are just heated up. Grazianos pizza tastes much better when it isn't happy hour or if you get a while pizza. Draft also becomes $1.25, even though their selection isn't that great (I just get the shocktop). Still, I can get a whole meal plus refreshments for less than $10.

Service is always good and polite. The atmosphere is also very family oriented. If you have a big party, they will try to accommodate you by moving the tables around.

The combination of food, service and happy hour pricing is what keeps me coming back for Sunday lunches!"}
{"text":"Grazianos in Glendale ------DON'T GO EVER great food but an very rude and mean owner to staff and customers. We have been going here for almost six years and noticed over time the owner is getting much worse....we were there last evening, with our almost 3 year old grandson....asked waitress if there was a charge for a few celery sticks as he was very hungry and was told no. Front door was open and fans were on, abit chilly so asked the waitress if the door could be shut, she said yes so hubby closed the door, moments later owner came out and re-opened door. We asked waitress and said owner wanted it open, we asked if they could turn the fans off...few minutes later they were off. Got our food, ate and the fans were back on we all put on our sweatshirts and another table was wearing hood and covering mouth, she went to close the door, again it was re-opened. Got our bill and was charged 75 cents for celery, not big deal but was told no charge so I asked, then owner overheard and came out and said \"What do you think we are a FOODBANK\"....omg what rudeness....I told him that we were told no charge....he said who told you....the waitress said she did so he said then don't charge her....I told him that although we loved the food and have always referred friends and strangers alike that would be no more. We would never return he said, good don't ever come back.....If you value human kindness then you should never return to this restaurant....his staff fears him."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite pizza in the 'burgh! The cheese mix is amazing, and the crust is nice and thin. Awesome people work there and good beer prices/selection."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood to eat fair priced, decent Italian food, and not get dressed up to do dine, I go here. The key here is the service. The people are running a very nice, clean, friendly establishment.  The wait staff has always been young, smart, and attentive.  When one staff member is busy, someone else will kick it up and serve you. This is so refreshing. The pizza is good. Crust can be a bit chewy but the delectables on the top are always fresh and well distributed. Beer selection is good enough to please many palates and yet is not over the top. I don't drink wine but I see glasses of it on tables so regulars know the choices which I will guess are like the beer, enough to get yourself happy. The mussels marinara are a huge hit for my hubby and a friend. They will actually call ahead to see if  they are fresh and in season, then plan a feastival around it. Many of the main dishes are huge so split one and get two salads. They do have deserts that always appear amazing but I am too full. I would love to try them for catering as they just seem so customer oriented and know their product. This place is for regulars in casual dress who need to fill  tummies with yummies without emptying wallets. SNOBS, stay away."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and wings. We usually take advantage of the happy hour beer special... $1.25 drafts. Order an appetizer of fried zucchini, then get the pizza and wing special to go. Can't complain...food is good, and the young girls that work here are always friendly, and helpful"}
{"text":"I'm not proud, I like this place.  Close to home, decent pizza and pasta, big portions.  We've never had a problem with service, or anything for that matter.  I would vote this \"way better than most crappy pizza places in AZ\""}
{"text":"Gracianos or Greasy-anos? The food here is far from spectacular. It's only mildly clean. However, when drunk, this food hits the spot."}
{"text":"RUDE, RUDE, OBNOXIOUSLY RUDE owner! Do NOT go here. Our family of 4 shared a similar experience....being talked down to, being argued with over prices, etc, before we even got our food. I mean, it was so bad we were looking for hidden cameras in the place! Never before have we experienced such an experience when dining out. The lady that runs that place has no business even running a business because she clearly knows nothing about customer service. To tell you how bad it was: we left before even receiving our food and cancelled our whole order. THANK GOD we didn't pay $50 for a crappy lunch and to be treated like dog poo. BEWARE, the other reviews are spot on!

I find this quote from their website interesting....

\"We look forward to providing you with the finest, freshest ingredients available and we will do our best to ensure your visit is one to remember. Your continuing patronage and suggestions will be much appreciated and also a major factor in our success.
Also, don't forget to tell your friends about us!\"

You have got to be kidding!! I am laughing out loud! \"Memorable visit\"? Oh, you bet, just  not the kind of memory I wanted. And \"tell your friends about us?\" Don't worry, we already are!"}
{"text":"I recently enjoyed lunch at this great little family pizza spot despite being on the third worst date of my life. Extensive menu of Italian American favorites despite the tiny dining room. They relocated from Cape Cod for warmer weather and to fill the gaping lack of decent pizza near Arrowhead. Service was stellar, informed, attentive and patient. Pizza was typical East coast style with a substantial crust and flavorful but not overbearing red sauce. The sausage is whole cooked and sliced lengthwise. The toppings list is limited but read through the specail pizza listing to find unlisted items like spinach and feta. The $1.25 slice and 50 cent wing happy hour prices are the best bargain I've found anywhere like it.  2 to 5  and all day Sunday. The portions are large and the prices fair to average on the regular menu and special board. I'll be back but not with her."}
{"text":"Decent pie and close to Children's Hospital. Don't be scared off by the long wait times and surly staff. Good enough"}
{"text":"Definitely in our top 3 pizza places in the area. We go here at least once a month for takeout. The pizza is definitely worth it if you use their coupon, and the clam chowder is just amazing. I do wish they offered it in a bread bowl though. We have also had their wings and they are above average. We have not tried their pastas yet but plan to in the future."}
{"text":"First time here and it was really good. My lasagna was delicious and I have enough left over for 2 more meals. My husband had the sausage and tortellini which he really enjoyed, although he did admit that mine was better :) Also got a \"kids\" pizza which for plain cheese was quite tasty and a great deal. I did not experience any of the problems with the wait staff that some other reviews mentioned; friendly, prompt, and kept our drinks filled, I really don't ask for more. Looking forward to trying the wings and a few other \"specials\" since neither of our dinners were actually on the menu."}
{"text":"Not only is this the best pizza in the neighborhood, it is very very good pizza.  The crust is crisp and has good flavor, the sauce has good flavor and is not too sweet or acidic, the cheese is flavorful and the prices are good.  I wish they had a larger variety of toppings and I especially wish they delivered.  The guys working here could lighten up a bit, maybe they should relax and take a drink from the large selection of forty's that they carry here."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Pastrami & Roast Beef sliders were great! Cheese fries with bacon,  yummy. Heaping pile of fries well cooked, cheese and bacon throughout. Will be back."}
{"text":"Ive ordered from this place at least 8 times for delievery . A couple times the delivery took over an hr one time they called me and said they were redoing my pizza because the driver got lost  witch i understand . Every driver ive goten has been a young kid . The last time i ordered was a couple months ago i just remembered to post my review after i placed an order with another place.  My problem is their service , customer service and their managers.  I ordered 2 calzones one egg plant the other meatball.and cheese with 2 sides of ranch . I also order their clam chowder because it is really good . This time the driver a young kid says  we gave you back your (i believe 1.50) because we didnt bring your ranch ... oh thanks  (not really)  and matter of factly says it . Then when handing me the calzones in one brown bag sideways and the chowder plus marinara sauce in another bag sideways  the contents of soup.and sauces falls out and splatters all over my doorstep . He doesnt say anything and im frustrated i tip $4 and tell him to go .  When my girlfriend eats her calzone the eggplant since shes vegetarian  she says its bland and all they put in it was mazarella cheese no ricotta but my meatball calzone had both cheeses. Also even though i had no chowder because it spilled  they didnt give me crackers for it like they always do . I was fuming and called to.speak to a manager , of course there wasnt on there so i left my number and they said a.manager would call me  . I waited 2 days and still no.call so i remembered to.call at 8:53  they closed at 9   a person answered.amd said we are closing and trying to get out , i said i.want to speak to.a.manager he said he was one but they were closing and he would have someone call me the next day of course no one did . Its sad customer service and pride for your job amd business are hard to find . This places food is pretty good but i wont support lack of caring or follow through when it comes to paying customers ."}

Great Happy Hour! No bar so you have to grab a table, but they have TV's so all's good.
Pizza is pretty good; though needs more sauce. Easy fix, ask for more sauce.
Pasta dishes and the specials are really good, and you can eat for 3 days on the portions!
Really good local spot, and wings are pretty good as well/"}
{"text":"I had a gift card from restaurant.com, meaning for $10 gift card I had to spend least $20. I went with my date yesterday. 

The 2 topping pizza was pretty good and well priced ($7 though 10' and pretty greasy), the mild wings were very good ($8 for a dozen, crispy with just enough strong flavor. Date liked both the pizza and wings so that was a big plus. To make sure I spent $20 also got large fries (it was fine and a LOT) and to finish it off we got one of their big cookie desert but never got to eating it...still in my car. 

After spending 20 bucks, plus 18% gratuity and tax, minus the gift card, we spent $16.08 (plus the $1.5 I paid for the gift card thx to the promo) which isn't cheapest thing but for all the food we got it was a great deal and way better than the $49 I spent at Black Angus.

All the grease made me need to really wash my hands and their bathroom was very nice and clean as far as I could see. Though I have to admit, I've been eating fairly healthy for the past 2 months and eating so much food that isn't exactly healthy made me hit a wall and I had to just stop after 2 slices of pizza, 5 or 6 wings and like half pound or 3/4 of fries or risk throwing up. So if you're looking for healthy meal, don't order this stuff go with their salad or  Eggplant Parmigiana, etc. 

My big complaint was that the place was pretty hot, like maybe 85 while we were there thought to be fair we were very close to the counter since that was the only 2 seated table that was open, the rest were 4 seats or more and there were was a family of 5 there and a group of like 7-8 people having a birthday party dinner. 

While I would go again, I might not for a little while just since it's not in the typical location I visit and it's the type of food I try not to eat too often these days."}
{"text":"Im updating my review for this place.  We've always come here for pizza and wings.  The last two times we came in for pizza and wings it seemed like something has changed in the food and you can tell the difference.  I picked up wings and when we opened the box they were dry.  Next time we ordered again for pick up and I asked for more sauce but the wings didnt seem fresh for some reason.  The skin seemed to be falling off.  The pizza was very bland.  It had almost no sauce in it.  We won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Staff rude food large portions of flavorless slop don't bother , don't say I didn't tell you"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices, but only if you eat in. A slice of pizza is $2 to go, but $1 if you eat in...so I ordered 2 of them and decided to eat in. When I realized I couldn't finish the second massively sized slice, I asked for a to-go box, and the waiter told me he'll have to charge me extra then since I'm not eating it in...not cool, and very silly. It's not like I planned to take it to go. They were decent about it though and told me they'll just charge me \"next time.\" They deserve a great review because the pizza was delicious and huge and very cheap (even w/out happy hour prices) and the seating area is very clean and cute and cozy. I would recommend however that they relax about charging people 75cents if they can't finish their pizza and ask for a box."}
{"text":"Let's start off with business... parking is completely adequate being located in a strip mall.  Seating seemed to be plentiful (we were here new year's eve afternoon). They had football on the TV which gave this a comfortable feel inside.

Now for the food. We ordered the New England clam chowder first since they claim to have the best . It was delicious with just the right ratio of potatoes and clam. I've had better in Boston but this was pretty good for a desert restaurant .

Our pizza came hot to the table with pepperoni, sausage (thinly sliced not crumbled), ham, bacon and extra cheese. The sausage was very good but it didn't quite seem like extra cheese to me. The crust is homemade so it definitely has a chewy texture with the right amount of air bubbles.  The sauce was nothing special with little taste.

I've had better pizza around the states but this was one of the better pizzas I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Lived in a number of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and finding that locations best pizza is always a challenge.  I have followed friends advice, magazine reviews, etc., etc. with mixed success.  Having moved to Stanton Hts. I was at a loss, but driving around Bloomfield, the first one to catch my eye was Graziano's. A great mix of locals, students and employees from Children's Hospital.  The pizza was great.  Somewhat thin crust, baked bubbly and crispy around the edges, can use more sauce but the mix of cheeses quickly remedies that shortage.  Toppings are great.  Makes a great breakfast the next day outta the fridge!!
The beer selection is admirable.  The service varies depending on who is at the counter.
Since discovering Graziano's I have been up and down Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield and always return to Graziano's.  The only other place to get my business would be Aiello's in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Bravo! Loved the gluten free pizza.  I have had more than a few bad ones and this was delicious.  So much so I thought it might not be gluten free but my boyfriend's same sized pizza was way different. It's gotten so bad I give up and just eat salad.  But this,  this was num-nummers so Bravo to this joint."}
{"text":"Yo people this is a really cool place kind of small which for me is a good thing...don't really like  going into a place to eat that's huge...the small intimate kind of thing is cool...we haven't ate in there a lot only because we live close to them and they deliver...that way I can sit at home and enjoy myself as they bring me my food...that may not sound like a big deal but they are a small Mom and Pop kind of business...not like these chain stores...and they really do care about your business.  

Sometimes so of the help hasn't been the best when I've visited but the next time I'm there they don't seem to be around so maybe they figured it out and got rid of them...I'm sure it's probably really hard to get really good help...never owned a business like this so no clue...but I so enjoy their subs and french fries...both are done to my perfection...so I love them...check them out and see what you think...you just may be pleasantly surprised..."}
{"text":"Best garden salad in town. Loaded with provolone to boot. Will try the pizza next. Check out their giant iPod in the back room!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for awhile so we decided to try it out again.  Small place but nice with two TVs and around 10 tables.  Waitresses were friendly and service was pretty fast.  Ordered the pizza and wings combo.  Pizza was cooked good but flavorless.  Added some salt and pepper but still needed something more.  The wings were crispy like I like them but had a batter on them.  Wing sauce was ok just not hot as advertised.   Prices were a little on the expensive side too."}
{"text":"I agree with Margaret's view below. There is a lot of attitude at this place. Until recently, they used to charge you for refills on drinks.  There is a lot of attitude here from the waitstaff.  They hire a bunch of kids who don't know there menu and really don't care about their food....or you for that matter.  

The pizza has no taste. The cheese clumps instead of melts. The toppings like the pepperoni tastes as if came of a DiGiorno frozen pizza and their other Italian dishes taste as if someone bought some Hunts Ketchup and poured it over pasta. 

Oh yeah and did I mention the attitude?  The only reason this place is still in business is because its become a happy hour hangout among the students in the area and the blue collar workers who to get their fill of their dollar Budweisers.  I feel bad for anyone who actually takes this place seriously and drives here to have dinner. 

Their wings are good and their happy hour is amazing otherwise, I'm giving this place one star"}
{"text":"Oh, come on-this place isn't awful :)  Seriously, the wings and chowder were good, and I'd actually come back here for their happy hour.  One thing about the pizza, which was the low light of our dining experience, was the sliced sausage.  Now, I know what you're thinking-little sausage discs all over the pizza right??  WRONG!!  They slice the sausage paper thin LENGTH wise!  It's like thin gyro meat or something...I've never had that and I've had a LOT of pizza over the years :)  I'm a Chicago gal, this pizza is just different and doesn't hold a candle to the good Chi-Town joints for 'za.  Not that that's a bad thing, but it's all about expectations."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a mom and pop pizza place with good pizza, this is your place. The sauce is homemade, cheese is the real deal. The food is made with love, a must try in the north west valley!"}
{"text":"the food was standard and okay. the service was mediocre. but what i really want to talk about is the menu.

first, the entertainment book coupon is only good for about five dinner-menu items. there isn't even an alfredo option. so that was limiting and disappointing.

next, the regular menu also includes a catering menu, and there are far more enticing options on that menu. but they won't make any of them unless you are buying in large quantities. if someone could explain that logic to me, it would be helpful.

with so few choices available, i don't really see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"We like the pizza here. The staff uis aliso friendly. I always get Xtra sauce on our pizza and use the coupon."}
{"text":"Food was just okay , customer service is horrible ...LADY UPFRONT said that are NOT OBLIGATED to give out Parmesan and red pepper packets !!!! What the heck ! Just asked for a couple but she was not happy about it"}
{"text":"Oooh forgot to do a review on this place when i was in Glendale, AZ!

So after a long, painful, strenuous 3-4 hour hike in Camelback...the 6 of us were about to eat each other in the car....so even with bleeding arms and legs (for me since i fell when coming down the hike 
-_-\") they convinced me to try this place before heading back to the apt to bandage myself...

it was a relatively small pizzeria...max capacity was maybe 25...but thank god we didn't have to wait..or we would have started eating other people's food! well we ordered a 24 inch pizza with half n half sausage and pepperoni and 24 wings. The wings came out first and they were pretty good...decent size and just the right spiciness for the medium ones. Then came the big 24 inch pizza....i took one slice onto my plate and the grease started dripping everywhere..! omg this was one super oily and greasy pizza! it was somewhat horrific the amount of grease and oil coming from this one slice of pizza...but i was so hungry i gobbled it down in a matter of seconds...then i went for a second slice..then a third....then i thought i was going to die because my arteries are now all clogged. =/ 

well despite the fact that i had three slices of pizza....it wasn't really good...it's good if you are starving and about go cannibalistic.....  but otherwise on a normal day i don't think i would have eaten three slices...so why does my bf and his buddies like this place?? from what i was told it's because they are cheap and super cheap at happy hour. and well the service is not that bad either."}
{"text":"This place has been a must go to every time I come back to Pittsburgh for a visit. There is nothing like having food that brings back the childhood memories. 

Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from this place a couple times. It's a mixed bag at best.

Our first order was the white pizza and some wings. Frankly, the white pizza was disgusting. It was overloaded with ricotta and in my opinion, was undercooked. But the wings were really good. Good size, cooked crispy, good flavor. 

So we gave it a second shot a couple weeks later. Skipped the white pizza, went for the \"FAVE\" which was pineapple, ham, black olives. Pretty good, but the crust was a bit soggy. The leftovers will probably reheat in the oven and be better than the first go.

This time, the coating on the wings was wet and mushy. Still nice sized wings and a good flavor, but very unappealing texture.

I'll say ordering through UberEats (first time for us) was pretty easy and the food came unbelievably fast.

Ultimately, the place is barely average and I'm being nice. I can't give a recommendation and I don't see us ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The pizza is good overall--not too much sauce, fantastic crust, okay cheese--and it is great for the price.  A little greasy, but once that's wiped away and a little parm is sprinkled on top, the pizza veers towards excellence.  $12 and change for the large pie.  They also sell 40's and 6-packs of beer, ranging from PBR to Victory and Bell's for somewhat decent prices, around $9 per 6-pack.  You can also pick up some Boone's Farm, which I only mention for the sheer hilarity.

While I'm happy to take-out from here, I'd probably end up dropping a star if I ever stayed inside for longer than 5 minutes--it's fairly filthy.  However, the staff is nice and it never takes longer than 20 minutes for a take-out order to be ready."}
{"text":"This is a mom-and-pop restaurant for sure. I've been here twice now. I would say they have 3 star food but the prices are worth another star!! The last time I was there with my mom and brother, we got 3 appetizers, 3 large slices of pizza, 3 beers, and a soda. After tip I think it was all of $23.00. I don't know of a time when they aren't on happy hour. And I really like the fact that you can get just a single slice at any time of the day. I will say the food is average. Pizza is not anything special at all, although Ive never had anything besides the single served slice that comes on the happy hour. Maybe if you ordered it fresh with some different kinds of crusts... who knows!? The fried zucchini is definitely something you could buy at the store and pop in to your oven. The wings are pretty tasty! They are nice and big, a little crunch to them, good sauce. And the potato skins are your average, everyday potato skins. The inside of the restaurant is very small and cute. My mom and her boyfriend frequent this place. They love the staff, the prices, and the food. As for me, I'm a bit more picky, but I will for sure come back with my family to enjoy a nice cheap meal and a beer."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the anti pasta salad for two at $13 was totally not worth the money. Never had we had so little meat and cheese. Contacted waitress right away to no avail. Even the owner, Keith, would not come out to talk with us. Not good PR Keith,  you really disappointed us today. Sorry but there will be no tip or favorable review. Several days later we had the antipasto salad at Oreganos, $2 less but 10 times better. Just look at the photo."}
{"text":"I had food delivered to me they where quick and got to my location with out an issue; the food it's self looked fairly good . I had the antipasta salad mild wings and cheese bread;  the salad was awesome! The wings were mediocre not the worse I've ever had but definitely not the best and the bread was nothing spectacular but for a regular  small size it was huge; would be good for a family. There was one major issue though and I gave them 3 stars still because there is no way to know for sure if it was the food except for the timing. I ate dinner at about 6:30 then at 2-3am I woke up to Experience the food all over again and trust me is was less pleasing the second time around probably not Gona try this place again"}
{"text":"This by far is the most disgusting pizza that I have even eaten. I ordered 3 pizzas while staying at children's hospital. Needless to say, we threw the 3 pizzas out and ate at the cafeteria. 

Please don't waste your time and money on this god awful food."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great staff, delicious Italian food, and low prices on happy hour. My favorite place close to home where I can grab a couple of very yummy pizza slices, delicious crispy hot wings, and draft beers. The happy hour prices are unbelievable!! I love that I can get 2 slices, 10wings, and a draft beer for less than$10.00. The food is delicious too!"}
{"text":"What is not to like about this place?

Their pizza is awesome.  I cannot rave enough about their pizza... did i mention that it is good? All of their other food is great too, but 90% of the time I couldn't pass up the pizza pie.

I love their happy hour (2-5PM Mon-Sat) with $1 beers and $1 slices.  The staff is very friendly in this family-owned restaurant.  They are transplanted from Cape Cod, so their Clam Chowder is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Graziano's is one of those places that you could walk right past and not even notice it.  Rumor has it that Graziano's are related to the people that own Angelo's Pizzeria on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield.  They got into a fight, and Graziano's was born.  Who knows if this is actually true, but they *do* have very similar pizza:  on the thin side, crunchy and chewy, with a great mix of cheeses on top.

They sell beer (bring your own paper bag-LOL) and from time to time there are some neighborhood cronies in there that look like they've helped themselves a bit to the 40's in the cooler.  But since it's strictly a pick up your pizza and get outta there place, it's more comical than scary.

I have the good fortune of living about 2 blocks away, but it is a bit strange that they don't deliver.  But it's worth swinging by and picking up a pie."}
{"text":"This place is solid for happy hour. It has a small dining area and a mom and pop feel to it. As others have mentioned, the food is good not great. However, I tend to also look at value for the money. The pizza has delicious thin crust due to the type of oven they have. Toppings are mediocre, they tend to put a lot of sauce and not enough cheese. That said, do you know a better slice of pizza for a buck? I don't. They have very good wings which are usually cooked perfectly and seasoned (sauced) likewise. Sliders are decent too. In this economy a dollar beer goes a long way in my book.
    The servers have always been friendly to me, I guess I am usually in a good mood when I go out and it shows. I generally do not allow people to give me bad service. 
    The prices are unbelievable during happy hour. 40 cent wings, dollar drafts and tons of daily specials.
     I would like to give 3.5 stars but will make up for the peron that said the same thing and lowered his to 3 by giving 4 stars. I'm an optimist.
     See ya for happy hour @ Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Freakin' Delish! Friendly, delicious,  happy hour rocks! Even the normal prices are killer!!!"}
{"text":"Too bad I thought this was the same Grimaldi's as the ones found in Peoria, Scottsdale, Chandler etc. that are also related to the Patsy Grimaldi's in New York. I was so so wrong and I'm surprised they are able to have the same exact name. This place has nothing to do with those delicious places which is obvious from the pizza we got, it tasted like something you'd get from pizza hut. Hardly any flavor and very generic. Service was horrible which was disappointing as we were the only customers in there so you'd think they could find a way to be a little attentive rather than chatting away with each other. The food was inexpensive which was great considering it was a complete flop. One member of our party did enjoy their ziti but the pizza is horrible and with practically no service I would never go back there again, no wonder why they were empty when we went"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan.
Small, family place with great happy hours deals on pizza and beer.  Service is fast and I tried a mushroom slice and the wings, ordered them hot.  The girl serving beer was on me every time I needed a cool off drink from the heat of the wings.  I was completely full and she offered me a free slice, stating they had made an extra by mistake.  I was full but really appreciated the offer.
Thank you"}
{"text":"For starters we ordered the Mild wings. They were just that perfect amount of crispiness on the outside and very tender and juicy on the inside. Sauce was savory and the winds were not swimming in it. I would say best wings I have had in a very long time.  
We also ordered the cheesy breadsticks. The crust was light and flaky. Cheese was even portioned across and had amazing flavor. A must order item!  
Beer comes ice cold in a cold glass! 
Pizza was huge! Sauce tasted fresh and light and not from a can or mass produced. Crust was light and flaky.  Very flavorful and we added fresh garlic which was amazing! All ingredient came fresh and no caned or frozen toppings.   

I will come back. I think maybe my new favorite pizza place EVER!

Food came fast and the waitress was very friendly.
We came here with our Restaurant.com coupon and had no issues. It was happy hour and the coupon restricted speicals but they did allow us to eat and pay full price for the items as we intended in the first place."}
{"text":"Anti pasta salad was absolutely terrible and they wouldn't make a right, we complain never came out when we asked to see him.  Keith the owner/manager never came to talk to us.Maybe on the entire salad for two there was a 1/2 piece cheese sliced there was not enough for two people!
For 12.95 we mostly got lettuce! What a disappointment !!!"}
{"text":"RUDE OWNER, NEVER GOING BACK!

I am the Stepson Theresa D is referring to below. If you read all the yelps you will see that we are clearly not the only people who have run into the nasty owners. No food is good enough to pay for and be treated like you are crap. I will NEVER go back to this place and I highly suggest you avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"We are staying at Childrens Hospital and accidentally stumbled upon pizza shop.  Delivery was within 30 min.  Kind and friendly employee's and probably in the top 3 best pizza places I've ever had!  A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's probably some of the best pizza I've had in the area (and we are very discerning, being from Chicago). However, don't limit yourself to the pizza - their meatball sandwiches are not only HUGE, but tasty as well. I love the fact that it's a small, local shop and not a big chain. Those are the best places."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this little gem driving on the101.  Italian eatery.  Small but big beer selection.  Ad baked Ziti.   It was huge and tasted great.  My co-hort. Got a roast beef sub.  Neither of us could finish.  Great portions. Great food. Support local eateries. Eat here when you're in the mood for italian. You won't be disappointed!  Service was great."}
{"text":"Now I am a looong time Streets of NY fan so Grimaldis was an exciting visit as I had been told by many that it is simply the best pie around.  I was not disappointed.

The first thing that you notice about the pizza is the sauce!!!  Deep deep tomato flavor, matter of fact so tomatoey that you might think your standing in a field of San Marzano tomatoes.   All the other ingredients to include the delicious crust married-up to produce a very satisfying meal.

For me I am still a Streets of NY fan but I will be giving the fine folks at Grimaldis a visit or two or three in the near future.

Wait staff was very nice and very efficient."}
{"text":"When I heard we were going to Grimaldi's I had my heart set on New York Style Thin Crust Brick Oven pizza.. THIS IS NOT that Grimaldi's. 

Normally if i want pizza - I will just make it myself, BUT I had been hearing great things about Grimaldi's. I didnt realize that this wasnt the same one as the one in scottsdale or the one on 99th and Northern... That being said... 

This is a nice \"family\" style pizzeria that is from the East Coast, small cozy atmosphere. There are roughly 12-15 tables in the restaurant.. When we walked up I thought it looked like it was a carry-out only type of place. Several items on the menu we found out were only for \"CATERING SERVICE\"

Service was mediocre. Food however was fairly good. I love a good calzone so we ordered two meatball calzones, a small kids pizza for my daughter and my son got a medium pizza and we got an order of wings. The kids said the pizza was good ( I thought the sauce lacked garlic and spices ) The calzones were huge and stuffed with meat, cheese and a tiny bit of sauce. They were lacking in flavor though. There wasnt enough garlic in any of the food, The sauce was more of the consistancy of tomato paste. Our glasses all ended up dry several times and while there were three waitresses they all seemed to rather hang out by the register than help customers - except for the few friends they had come in - they got great service. 

Had to go to the register to get our check at the end of the night and we had to get our own refills a few times. 

all in all the food was ok. I'd recommend adding some spices to the food (GARLIC, some oregano, a little salt... ) - its an ITALIAN restaurant NOT DOMINOS. 

I will give them one more try... being that they are 20 minutes from my house, I don't think I will go out of my way anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Graziano's until I began working in this neck of the woods... and I have to say it is a great little find!

Great food (pizza and salads are fabulous), no problems with take out orders, etc.  No complaints!  Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout here a few times and they do pretty well flavor-wise.  Love their chicken strips and garlic bread! 

This having been said, the last time I ordered takeout they forgot to include the side salad.  Also on another occasion the spicy sausage in one of there dishes did not quite agree with my intestines if you catch my drift... but my friend with a strong South American stomach was ok so it might have been my gastronomically protected upbringing ;)"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER!!!!

During happy hour, they have $0.50 wings!! They have happy hour everyday and it usually starts around 2pm and ends around 5pm most days. They have happy hour all day Sunday. Their wings are a good size, totally worth it! They have a variety of flavors. I typically get the hot. It's the perfect hot sauce. It's hot, but not too hot. They are fried to perfection! 

Their service is great and so quick!  The staff is so friendly! They bring your drinks right away. There isn't any waiting for someone to check up on you. They come by often and make sure you're enjoying everything. Even when I come with a big party, like ten people, we still get the same quality of service and the food still comes out fast!

10 out 10 would recommend these wings to a friend!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 4 item pizza via DoorDash and it was one of the best pizzas I've had in the valley!  Will order from Graziano's again, great pizza."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and we were pleasantly surprised!  The pizza was so good!  Delivery was fast and hot!  Definitely will try them again!"}
{"text":"20\" pizza was burnt beyond being food. All food was room temperature. Of our $70 order only half was salvageable in the microwave."}
{"text":"Found this place on YELP and it was fantastic.  The staff was very friendly and the food was great.  Ordered the lasagna and pizza and both were awesome.  Will be going back soon to this place, loved it."}
{"text":"I eat a slice almost every night after work.. yesterday I was in there and a man rides in on an electric scooter- I kid you not - completely butt-naked!! He was served beer from the cooler by the employee (tall with blond hair) and she bagged it for him. BUTT NEKKID PEOPLE! NOT KIDDING. Everyone working acted like it was a normal occurrence. Then he road off out the door and almost killed someone by running a traffic light. I am still in shock. Good pizza, but this was strange."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wing...$0.35
Draft Beer...$1.00
Slice of Pizza...$1.00
Grimaldi's during Happy Hour...Priceless"}
{"text":"After visiting Graziano's it's clear why they sell so much booze. You have to be totally plastered in order to find the food edible. The pizza looks like an Exon-Valdez reenactment (enough oil and grease to lube your Hummer) and the sandwiches are just gross. If it wasn't for their location, this place would have been turned into a liquor store decades ago. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"The eggplant parmesan was delicious.  I ordered it with the Angel hair pasta and it also came with a large piece of garlic bread.  The portions were huge and only $10.95.  I'll definitely be eating here again.  Thanks Aly!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and will probably be the last. I ordered a white pizza and mild wings. The pizza was cold and the only flavor I could taste was onion, so that kinda ruined it imo. Not onto the wings, they were so dry! There wasnt any any sauce and not much flavor."}
{"text":"OMG! The baked Ziti is awesome. Service was great and the beer is cold. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places to eat in this area. steak subs are definitely best around, I've been eating here for over 20years"}
{"text":"Growing up on the East Coast,  I'd like to say I know a decent grinder when I see one. Grazianos does not disappoint!  The Italian grinder is heaven in your mouth!  The portion size is huge and the prices are amazing,  makes my mouth water just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are at the children's hospital with our daughter and we are a long ways from home. We had flown in late one night and got up to our room at the Ronald McDonald house so we needed something that could be delivered. I just searched for delivery and Grazianos came up, so we were like sure. We told them where we were and they sent plates cups and napkins with our order, we thought that was nice. The pizza was great, we got pepperoni. We've ordered from another pizza place that wasn't all that great so when we get sick of cafeteria food, we order from Grazianos"}
{"text":"This place is not to be confused with PATSY Grimaldi's, which is in SCOTTSDALE, but also quite good. I think a lot of people come here thinking it is something else, and then get their panties in a bunch and whine because they're stupid and can't read.

If you're looking for simple and delicious pizza and wings then you have found the place. This is one of the best classic pizza and wings joints I've been to, easily in my top three. The pizza is thin yet floppy, the toppings are great (try the sausage, it's sliced like pepperoni), the wings are crispy and the sauce is nice and hot... The food is just good. 

It is a full service place, I've never had any service issues there. The counter register is for take-out orders (duh) They have some good beers on tap too. I like to get a pitcher of Amber bock there with the folks when they're in town.

If you're a coupon person, they are in the 2009 Entertainment book, very much worth it.

The bottom line is that both Grimaldi's pizzas are outstanding, but know where you're going before you go there and complain."}
{"text":"The owner Ang and myself are cigar buddies. One day he told me about this place that sells beer and food. He said you have to try their pizza. So being the critic that I am. I went here. Tried a slice of pizza.  One slice turned into a half a pie. Ran into Ang, and I told him, you were right the pizza there is one of the best in the city. They use real chicken breast for their chicken sandwiches. And their pound of fish is to die for. Did I tell you, Ang, then said, I forgot to tell you why the food is so goddamn good, because I own the place. Beware, if you know Ang like I do, he love to tell corny ass jokes."}
{"text":"We love this place. We go about once every 2 weeks. Great service and addicted to the HOT buffalo wings with a side of suicide sauce. Sooo reasonably priced and tasty!!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh since yesterday from out of town on business. Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that!  Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in. There are tables and chairs, but as I mentioned...the smell is a little off-putting. like the inside of an old dish cloth.  If they could fix that, they would be golden."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and wings and the pizza was terrible.  The pizza had no taste to it. The wings looked like they were cooked and then the sauce was poured over them.  

Had no problem with the service, the young man who was our server was polite, helpful and attentive.

I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I stopped by Graziano's last night for some pizza with a friend.  She had suggested that we eat there because she had heard that they had some good pizza.  The outside of the place doesn't have the appearance but is consistent with all of the buildings on the block.  Once you are inside though the place is pretty clean.  There are probably around 10 tables in the dining room portion of the restaurant with a single flat screen hung in one corner so that you can watch as you eat.  Just past the dining room and on the way to the register were about 6 beer coolers filled with everything from your normal adjunct lagers to Four Loko and even some more expensive 22 oz Dog Fish Head bottles.  As a beer lover who normally doesn't drink adjunct lagers if I can help it, I was really impressed with their selection.  As a matter of a fact in the hour or so that we were there, I actually saw more people get beer to go than order their food.  For our dinner we decided to get a large pizza with chicken on it.  It came out piping hot and I was surprised at how large it actually was.  What I was not as big of a fan of was the amount of grease that was still on the pizza but I understand that is what happens with cooked cheese  As with most pizzas, there are the three major components to them cheese, sauce and crust.  The crust was definitely the standout of this pie as it was crispy while not being too think.  The sauce was merely average as I did not really notice any spices in it or anything to distinguish it from anything else.  Finally the cheese was decent, there was a lot of it, and I enjoyed the garlic flavoring that was with the cheese.  Overall it wasn't the best pizza in the world but I enjoyed eating it and it got the job done.

The bottom line for me is that I may head back here in the future.  The price is definitely right and the food was decent enough but where they really shine is their beer selection."}
{"text":"Pizza is so really good (some of the best crust in town) at this place as are the wings and the baked Ziti! The ziti serves two easily. Its enormous!!

It's a relaxed restaurant with lots of TVs for sports game watching. The staff is friendly and efficient. Highly recommend the pepperoni and jalapeño pizza! Fabulous! A great selection when you're in the mood for good grub in an easy-going atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a couple of months ago hoping to find something to replace our old delivery spot....it was ok, slightly disappointed due to all the high reviews here....the antipasti salad was excellent, the pizza was okay, not bad but not outstanding either...the wings were very different, no sauce & all buffalo flavor seemed to be baked in.  Fast delivery, but wasn't impressed enough to make it our regular place."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming here for there pizza and wings! Oh did I mention the happy hour specials! Can't get over it! Great for Sunday football as well. Multiple TV's in the establishment so you can watch sport center highlights and the game at the same time!"}
{"text":"While the quality of the pizza depends on the time of day you order and the decor leaves a lot to be desired, for a transplanted resident who HATES PA liquor laws, they have a great variety of beer available for what is basically a hole-in-the-wall pizza place. Also, delicious provolone sticks, but why doesn't anyone in this city sell mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Meal was Overpriced.  Pizza was terrible.  I'm from Boston and have been here for 6 years and I still haven't found a good tasting pizza anywhere in the valley."}
{"text":"Out of kindness I am giving this place a 2 star just for the good crust--and it is really good crust--but their idea of pizza is lots of tomato sauce.  Where is the cheese?  I ordered extra mushrooms and pepperoni, and the owner is so cheap that he scrimps on anything that costs him money--altho he has no problem taking yours (money, that is).
Never again will I order their pizza cause it sucks totally.
Their ziti is good.  Stick with that.  

On another note, try going in there with a Groupon-type coupon and you will find you cannot order anything that smells of happy hour prices or any of the specials listed on the blackboards.  

I think the person who runs Grimaldi's at this location sits and thinks of any way he can cut costs--even if it means a pizza with so little cheese you need a search party to send out to find it.  He gives so little as he can on the extras you order for the pizza, too.  All he does is give you lots of the cheaper stuff like flour and water crust and tomatoes which aren't expensive.  I get what he's doing, and hope some here aren't so blind and stupid that they don't get it.

Very disappointing management decisions.  Either raise prices so you can give better food or close up."}
{"text":"Adequate. $17 for a large. Canned mushrooms a big bummer."}
{"text":"A great little pizzeria for Arrowhead! Cheap prices on brews and food during happy hour and happy hour is almost all operating hours. You get a true east coast feel from this place that really does more than just pizza. The wings are the best item on the menu for times when you want to hangout but don't sleep on the ziti, pizza, or chowdaaaa as they say it. Grazzianos is a great family place that has incredible prices, great service(Steph especially from all the incredible waitresses), and even better brews."}
{"text":"Had a family gathering recently and no one could decide on what food was wanted.   We finally settled on delivery from Grimaldi's, as I had recently learned of it from some other Yelp reviews.  We ordered the pizza and wings special, with half cheese/half mushroom on the pie and half mild/half honey bbq on the wings (note: was not consulted on the wings, as I definitely would have gotten hot wings...).  

The pizza had nice flavor, but as I've seem to run into lately, I never get nice crisp on my thin crust pizzas.  I know, part of that is having it be delivered, but I have certainly have had crispy thin crust delivered before, so why not now?  Anyways, I think getting a pizza onsite hot and fresh would probably be pretty good.  The mild wings were okay, the sauce had a nice flavor to it, but needed a little more kick.  I really liked the honey BBQ wings (which is normally something I don't like).  Perfect amount of sauce, and the wings had a nice crisp to them, along with a good flavor.  

Grimaldi's receives a 3.5, but rounded down to 3 stars.  I would definitely like to try them again, dine-in this time."}
{"text":"It's ok. The Sicilian pizza tastes and feels somewhere between a frozen deep-dish pizza you buy at the grocery, and the thing they used to put in school lunches labeled \"pitza\". Will you eat it? Of course! Will you look forward to the next time you have the time and the luxury to eat pizza? Eh..."}
{"text":"Pretty darn yummy etc. Wings are to
Kill for, or at least poke eyes out for."}
{"text":"What a shame.....amazing food that doesnt make up for the rude service from Judy.  If she can become more pleasant,  this review could become 4 or 5 stars"}
{"text":"We went through GrubHub to have Graziano's deliver to us.  They arrived within a half hour and the delivery driver was incredibly friendly - kudos to the man with the long beard who didn't make me feel rushed to get my food inside and tip him! We got garlic bread with spaghetti and meatballs. The bread was soft and fresh and it was not overly greasy with butter.  Their marinara sauce is also very flavorful - I could have eaten the the garlic bread with sauce for dinner and been quite content.

My only complaint was the meatballs. They had absolutely no flavor to them and we ended up throwing them away.

Otherwise, the food was great! We'll be trying their pizza next time."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with everything from this pizzeria and was very happy with the taste and the quality of the pizza. I went to pickup the pie and the place is super cute with lots of TVs on the wall and very friendly staff. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There's not much really to say about this place.  In a boring location, dull decor, and food is mediocre.  It serves a purpose for people wanting pizza in the nearby area and that's about it.  The only other thing the restaurant has going for itself is that it's a family run mom & pop place and not a chain.  I have no problem supporting local businesses.

The pizza and pasta I've had here was just ok, nothing special.  If a little more love was added to their ingredients I think they could get a few more bodies in there.  They also may want to train their servers to help patrons have an enjoyable time while dining.  That's one of the things that keep people coming back."}
{"text":"We got steak and cheese hoagies to go.  Everyone in the party, agreed these were the best we ever had.  They pile it high with the meat and toppings. The special sauce is to die for!  We can't wait to go there again.

We did order Sicilian pizza too. This was also great. I will say though while the pizza was good, the hoagie was unbelievable  !"}
{"text":"great pizza from the graziano family. 

great subs, tasty sauces, nice crust, lots o beer.

no complaints what-so-ever"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Grinder I've ever had. Fresh, lots of quality meet & delivered on time. Great value for the money & will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Love this place....maybe not the fanciest place, but the food is great, portions are hearty, clean atmosphere, and although the servers are young and not the most cheerie, they  are absolutely nice and attentive!!!!

I live in the area and find that you give what you get.  If you have attitude and treat people poorly then expect it back!  I'm a beliver in treating servers with respect and not like your personal butler.

I've never experienced anything bad.  The food is great the waitstaff has always treated us very well!!!"}
{"text":"I tried Grimaldis Pizzeria (located in the Albertson's Shopping Center) with a co-worker one day...food was ok, but the service was TERRIBLE and rude. NOT worth visiting at all."}
{"text":"Wings are great! Favorite flavor: honey cajun! Vant go wrong with happy hour specials! Service is always on point. More servers than tables. All personable locals, mostly high school kids, but super down to earth."}
{"text":"They have great lunch specials. We were really happy with the price. MORE importantly though they have the best clam chowder. Five stars because I honestly crave their clam chowder on a practically daily basis. Seriously, go try the clam chowder."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place. I'm glad he did. We enjoyed two lunch specials--2 slices of pizza and the pastrami grinder sandwich.  Both were delicious. The server was very friendly and on top of things. She even brought us carry out cartons for our leftovers without us asking. We would come back."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and was certainly New York style! Not a pile of grease. Crust had a great taste and the cheese was not lacking. The marinara sauce with the bread sticks was excellent. To top it off the service was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place - I was so happy to finally find a decent restaurant in the West Valley.  Love that its a local business.  Pizza is great and I've heard so many great reviews about the rest of the menu.  Great casual local neighborhood restaurant!  Great customer service and prices too!"}
{"text":"If I didn't have a big pizza in front of my face, I would have thought I ordered a big serving of attitude with a side of screw you.

Maybe it's because we came in with a coupon...but this place had more ego than a 15 minute celebrity.  

Not to knock small, family owned places (usually I love going to places like that, because USUALLY you get a friendly family feel), but for a pizza joint located in a shopping center next to Albertson's, they sure wanted to make you think you were eating caviar.

Things not so awesome:
1.  Whomever answered the phone didn't know East from West to be able to give directions
2.  Our waitress couldn't give any suggestions on the food
3.  They can't do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra
4.  You pay a charge if you want to split a plate of food
5.  ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE
6.  Tip was already included in our bill

I've never been to a family run pizzeria that can't do a half and half pizza, and the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you'd feel more comfortable wearing  a dress - definitely not one in a strip mall like this one.

I swear if the two waitresses rolled their eyes or huffed any more than they already did, they probably would have fainted from lack of oxygen and vertigo.

And last time I looked, I believe I was old enough to do my own math for your tip.  If you were so scared we were going to stiff you on your tip, maybe you should learn a little something called Cuss-toe-mer Sur-viss.

Foodwise, the pizza was not the best I've ever had, in fact it was a bit on the dry side.   I can't say it was absolutely horrible, but neither can I say I was in heaven.  The wings were much better, in my opinion.

For the pain of the drive and having to dodge eye daggers, this is a definite no-peat."}
{"text":"Get the half-pesto, half-marinara pizza ... it is amazing. We've always had pretty good service. Only once did we have a problem with our order, which we would have ignored, but we accidentally got pepperoni on the pizza and I've got an allergy. They brought us a new pizza and gave us a discount on the check. Great tasting pizza, incredible crust, great salads and desserts, good beer and good service. I like both the Scottsdale and West Valley locations, but West Valley seems more open and easier to get a table. We will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Great food and best bang for the buck! Go in during happy hour and you wont regret when you leave! Must try their wings and sliders, i prefer mild wings and tuna melt sliders."}
{"text":"Oh, do I love this place!!!! Me and my family always go here for there happy hour, their pizza is great and the prices are great! The staff is friendly and the place is clean, a little small but I would wait for this place anyway! But the best part, is their wings!!! Perfectly crisped, amazing quality, and good taste!"}
{"text":"Food and service are  still 5 stars 

Lack of comfort : hot dinning room: 1 star!

Ive been to many other restaurants that had pizza ovens and fryers but still cool and comfortable in the Phoenix summer. 
Their AC maybe needs some maintenance!"}
{"text":"Little neighborhood pizza shop with beer to go. So convenient. The pizza is ok. I've had better and I've had worse. Of course I'll eat there again. When going to a party I like to pop in and grab a couple of beers as to not show up empty handed. They have a nice little selection."}
{"text":"I have been at this place several times.  They've got an awesome Monday happy hour that includes pizza, wings, beer and other stuff.  I gotta say, the pizza is much better when you don't get it on happy hour b/c they just reheat slices with new topping on top during happy hour.  But the wings...coming from someone who is picky about wings...they are what keeps me coming back again and again.  

I think this place is family run and not related to another Grimaldi's in Scottsdale.  

Overall, this place is pretty nice on the inside, but can get kind of crowded b/c it is small."}
{"text":"This is hands down the most authentic Italian restaurant I have yet to eat at! I've tried everything from pizza and wings to spaghetti and meatballs and  shrimp pasta. Everything here is very delicious and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Super excited to make this our new neighborhood pizza joint. The are really good....Yum Yum Yum... love the Clam Chowder-best ever! Only issue is it gets hot inside, need more AC."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! Boyfriend enjoyed the hoagie also. Delivery  took 30-40 minutes as they said it would. Reasonable prices. Worth a try if you're thinking about it! Also their white pizza sauce is very good! The staff seem upbeat and friendly with a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"So impressed! Amazing staff! Wonderful food! This place is clean and delicious! We ordered pizza, wings, chocolate lasagna, & chocolate chip cookies! Everything was tasty! I will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Is this full service or not? The entire little room of maybe ten tables are clearly viewable by the 3 ladies behind the counter, yet many of us are walking up to get our own refills and pay the check.  They must really be struggling because it must have been in the low 80's in the dining area, and they actually have handwritten lunch & happy hour menus that were xeroxed.

I dined well after the lunch hour and it looks like my 2 slice special was from whichever pie was made awhile ago.  Pizza was just ok, mainly for that reason.  

Only beer available on tap is Budweiser products.  No craft beer.  

Wow just noticed similarity of experience to my last visit a year ago.  Maybe I should give up trying."}
{"text":"I like these sort of \"mom & pop\" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but we've tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!"}
{"text":"The food at Graziano is very good, the owner is very friendly and kind. The on true thing that is missing from Graziano -  customer service. On one occasion, I ordered my favorite wings, they told me 20 minutes, so I arrived which was around 22min-25. As I was walking in the door, this very chubby with bright blue eye shadow girl, starts barking \"when is this girl with the wings coming to get her order, it's been here forever.\" I stood by the counter, and said ,\" This girl is here.\" on another occasion, I ordered 6 pies, and the cashier at the counter (with the same bright eye shadow girl standing behind her)  hands me 3 plates. For 6 large pies. I asked her, can I get a few more plates and napkins. I have a big party and this is 6 pies. My niece was there, and she blurted, we need like a lot, there least 50 of us. I say a nice stack or 20 plates I would of been happy. not 3.  The cashier (curly brown hair - short) , goes with major attitude ,\" You need more?!\" then rolls her eyes. Pains me to say, I do not think I will take my staff or myself to this place anymore. I truly love the food and the owner. But the girls that work there are awful. 4 stars for food, 1 for customer service. Which as you see, is why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love the steak sub & zucchini strips !  Though they forgot my side of ranch or sauce on occasion They were apologetic and quick to redeliver sauces...  Can't get that from other take-out !!! :)"}
{"text":"Grazianos is your typical local mom n pop restaurant. Good food. Great service. My favorite part about this restaurant is their family meals. I can cater large parties on a budget with good food that tastes like mom made it. I recommend Grazianos on any night your not up for making dinner. They are always there to help you out. My favorite dish is the mushroom, tomato pasta in a red wine reduction. So yummy! And their wings are the best in town."}
