{"text":"The food is good quality in general, the atmosphere and service is very good as well. I think the price of food compared to size of portions is a bit too high. I also hope that they either change their menu frequently or expand it a bit: otherwise next time I am there, there won't be a lot of new dishes to try."}
{"text":"Unique dishes that we can all share and enjoy amongst our friends! The Kaarage and Yokozuna Street Roll was amazing! Nice place to have some drinks just chill too! It's really opens up good vibes for an area that needed this type of thing."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and 2 other couples went to KAGE as we have received recommendation for it from our friends and online. 
I didn't know what to make of the Japanese Peruvian inspired cuisine.... I was not at all disappointed! The decor, the layout, the service but most of all the food! It was full of flavours and the portions were good for the price. As there was 6 of us, we had ordered practically the entire menu. We started with the Beef Tataki, Kage Slaw, Shisho Tofu. Then made our way to the Karaage, Eli Myo Shrimp, Kimchi Mac and Cheese, Street Corn, then we ended it with the Hot Stone Duck Fried Rice, Steak. As dessert we did the Mini Donut.
Wow! We were full but so satisfied, we had their Japanese inspired beers and their Moonstone sake. Which for a person that doesn't like alcohol too much, it went down pretty smooth. Their Lemon Grass Mojito was so good, tasted liked lemonade with a kick.
I was extremely happy thay we chose this place as a few of us are pretty picky with food. 
My favourite dishes were the Kage Slaw, Shisho Tofu, Kimchi Mac and Cheese, Hot Stone Duck Fried Rice and of course the mini donut (which we are now officially addicted to!). The main reason why I liked Kage is that the ambiance was very relax and chill, a great place to go with your girlfriends, friends or a date and just have a good time munching on Sharable dishes while drinking some good Japanese alcohol. Each dishes was a decent size but mainly the sauce/season for each was not too overwhelming but not at all plain! You can tell that they took their time cooking each dish to perfection.
I love their Duck Fried Rice, the three way cooked duck and the sweet spicy pepper gave it a great kick and because it was cooked in a stone bowl, it gave it an extra crunch. Also, we're not a fan of tofu as I always found tofu not be worth the money at a resturant but wow! So good and cooked so well and the sauce is lays on, just so mouth watering.
Overall I had a good experience with Kage and I woild definitely recommend it to anyone whose looking for something different from the mediocre resturant. If you are looking for a fun night trying some Japanese Peruvian dishes... You need to go here!"}
{"text":"A new hit in sauga with good food, chill ambiance and great service. My husband is normally not a fan of fusion food but because it was my special day he gave in with my request to try something new without having to go downtown and he loved all that we ordered. Now don't get me started with our server that evening. Josh...wow...he explained all our dishes precisely and talk about customer service at it's best. Actually come to think of it they all show what customer service and teamwork is all about. Kudos to u all  I would have to say when we go back my must have would be the beef tatake and kimchi mac & cheese and my husband's the ceviche and duck fried rice."}
