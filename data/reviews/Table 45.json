{"text":"Four stars for the service. Grace lived up to her name. Gracious and patient. It was as if she is an actress. Hope we'll get a chance to return."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Cleveland! I don't care for the dinning room setup (very hotel'ish) but my taste buds don't seem to care about all that. :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I felt our dining experience at Table 45 was fair but not overwhelming. Probably a 2.5 on the Yelp scale. Given other exciting dining options in Cleveland, I doubt we will return soon. We ordered the curried plantains and the cider-brined chicken special. Both were decent but they did not offer any outstanding flavors or presentation. For a Saturday night, the energy level was lower than expected and slightly disappointing. The service we received was courteous and attentive overall."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the hotel and thought I'd try this place. I read the reviews first before going. While the reviews were few and varied I had little options with the snow and lack of vehicle.  The service was excellent. The hostess and my server were both sweet and attentive.   The food was OK. I had the naan to start. It was just ok. I've found better at Trader Joes. The trio of dips were interesting... Spicy mayo was good although it was an unexpected sauce for naan. The olive tapenade was decent but had a funny aftertaste. I blame the sun dried tomatoes that they mixed in. The hummus was flat and without much personality.   I then had the tostada salad. I think that there were many things done right on this plate individually but it didn't come together collectively. Avocado was not ripe and the tostada was more greasy than crispy ( kinda had that rubber thing going on)  I guess overall not bad for a hotel, but definitely not worth the price or return if there are other options in the neighborhood.  I'm glad I stuck with the basics as it's usually a sign of a restaurants overall performance."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  I've never been disappointed with the food or service here.  Both are excellent.  Perfect place if you're staying at the hotel or visiting nearby hospitals."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to go after work to unwind and the like. Te food there is not cheap. On some days (or is it everyday?) They have the free samplers which is nice to go along with a drink that you order. One thing to note is that if you are coming at peak times, don't because you might not b able to find a seat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Table 45 for his BD. We had a Groupon coupon and I should say that it was such a waste of money and time for us. We expected for the price that we pay, get tastier food. But all we got was very tasteless food in nice decoration and plate. The waiter was not with us that much and we wanted not to tip him well. However, they allready put an 18% tip on our bill to pay. Overall was such a regretfull experience. At least we know not to envy since we work across the street (at Cleveland Clinic) to eat there ever.  We recommend going somewhere that has better food than this, even the location is not so sleek looking with poor quality food.  I suggest chef taste his food or give some people to try it to give him some feedback."}
{"text":"Overall, it was an ok experience. My husband & I ate here for dinner for our one year anniversary. I must admit, sitting outside on the patio while patients were pushed around the CCF in wheelchairs was not the most pleasant of experiences while trying to celebrate. Our waitress seemed to be really nice and complemented me & later on I heard her say the SAME thing to the table next to us.   The scallops were amazing and had great flavor. Lobster meatballs were disappointing. The sugar on the creme brûlée was burnt in places and made the dish tastelike charcoal. Not only that, but I bit down on a giant fig pit that was hidden within our sticky toffee pudding & almost broke my tooth. We can't change anything now and didn't want to ruin the mood on our anniversary by complaining, but we will probably not return."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time unless you want to wait 45 minutes for food that is \"meh\" at best. I'm going back to my room and ordering Pizza Hut, which will be far superior to the dishes they serve here."}
{"text":"I highly recommend NOT heading here. Lousy service, the food was cold by the time they brought it to the table. Had to ask for the dinner rolls that other tables were enjoying with their dinner, but they were microwaved and as hard as a rock in a couple of minutes. We complained when the manager came around and he did reduce the tab significantly but we will never be back. Burger King is across the street, just might be a better option."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I order a fried chicken dinner thinking it would be succulent and decadent . The chicken was rubbery, crust greasy. The black eye peas were okay but bland, and I got about 4 leaves of greens on the plate. A buttermilk biscuit that was okay  My husband tried to cobble a few appetizers together  for dinner. The mussels were okay, not  great, beans at bottom better than the mussels. He ordered some roasted green peppers thinking they would be roasted with spices, etc. They were bland and there was enough to feed 6 people. Only ate a few. He shared my biscuit. Beer choices he was offered was minimal and not great. Service was rushed. Given dirty plates which the server did profusely apologize for.   When got back to room I was still hungry and ate a $9 snack from room fridge.  We will stay at the intercontinental hotel next clinic appointment but will not be back to Table 45."}
{"text":"I ordered the tandori Naan and the classic bouillibase and like it. It is a bit expensive but worths the price."}
{"text":"The new Patio Rio Brazilian feature is advertised as an \"Unlimited Experience\", but when you arrive there you are told that it is in fact not unlimited and that there was an error in the advertising. If that is true, the restaurant should be honoring what is advertised and not continue to run this ad that can be seen in the Scene magazine weekly. Don't be fooled by this false advertisement."}
{"text":"I bought a gift certificate through the Cleveland Independents website for Table 45, so we decided to use it one Sat night.  Our waiter seemed to take himself pretty seriously but maybe that's the ambiance they're going for there.  I've liked the service at L'albatros, Chinato, and Cowell & Hubbard much more.  Also preferred the food there.    I had the duck, which was just okay.  Normally when I hear \"duck\" and \"curry\" in the same dish I prepare myself for something truly amazing.  Sadly the curry dish with duck confit from the Umami Moto foodtruck is vastly superior to the curry duck dish they serve here.  Or maybe not so sadly, since Umami Moto's is about 1/4 of the price.    I also had some chocolate penuche cake for dessert.  Normally I don't order dessert but I anticipated that it would be really amazing since this is a Zack Bruell restaurant, but I should've known better from my disappointing entree.  The cake was dry and flavorless.  Probably not made in house and if it was, it's kind of embarrassing for them.    I wouldn't pick this place for dinner again but their happy hour is pretty good, which is why this gets a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"We had a lovely early dinner Friday afternoon.  Tasteful decor and relaxing atmosphere.  As soon we were seated, a variety of breads and EVOO was brought to the table - interesting cumin bread and a black olive bread.  We each started with lobster bisque which was good but not great, and a nice Riesling.  The rather large serving of bisque warmed our bones on that windy afternoon. I had a great lime tandoori chicken with a corn and hominy mix with fresh cilantro greens. The skin was left on the chicken and cooked to crispy, crunchy perfection.  I was reminded of pork skins. My husband had the beef brisket with sushi rice and vegetables - a new take on a Thai noodle or rice bowl.  The menu was very creative.  The unexpected treat was the separate dessert and after dinner drink menu.  It was very difficult to pick from all the unique offerings.  We shared an apple palette with pistachios. Along with this perfectly prepared tart was a small scoop of gourmet vanilla ice cream, a lovely textured cream sauce and a super-sour cranberry relish.  By husband, who won't eat cranberries, loved the mouth puckering taste in the same way some like eating super hot peppers.  Though the meal would have been too slow paced if we had somewhere to be (my chicken took 35 minutes) we had good company, making this one of the better meals I have had in Cleveland!  You should go!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Zach Bruell restaurants.   Their lunch special of a soup, salad and small entree is a hearty and tasty lunch.  Very good location for a business lunch.   Impressive, great service and nice dining room,  Free valet parking is icing on the cake."}
{"text":"There are worse places to be stuck while attending to a loved one being treated at the adjacent Cleveland Clinic than the Intercontinental, right?  And after a long, dreary day in a hospital room, what more could you ask for than attentive service and a hot, savory, comforting braised lamb shank with polenta, even if it comes at an Intercontinental price, right?  That was exactly what I expected after my first meal at Table 45 last night, when the server was excellent (even suggesting a salad ideal to accompany the spicy ramen noodles I ordered as my main) and food that came out on time and on target. Not tonight, however.   My server went MIA soon after taking my order, leaving me thirsty for a second beverage. The lamb was delivered by someone else altogether and to describe the entire $32 dish as lukewarm would be an insult to Luke (however that term came to bear his name). The same person who delivered the dish gladly took it back and my original server finally replaced it with a hot version that met my expectations for taste, comfort and temperature. So maybe I shouldn't complain, right?  Wrong!    It is a Saturday night and Table 45 is bustling with about a half dozen occupied tables. Last night was about the same but these seem like two different restaurants. Schizophrenia is not a desirable trait for a hotel restaurant that neighbors one of the foremost medical facilities in the States. Perhaps it's just bad luck; perhaps it's what the docs next door would call \"idiopathic.\"  Whatever the cause, it shouldn't happen at a place like this.   If you choose to give it a try, hope for the best but plan for--perhaps--something worse.  P.S. The Intercontinental made it right when I checked out by taking the entire meal off the bill. Class act."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve at Table 45 did not disappoint.  With 7 in our party including 2 children, our service was impeccable.  Our waiter, Jhonathon, was attentive as was the other wait staff. The food was simply delicious."}
{"text":"Average hotel restaurant. Convenient to the Cleveland Clinic and University circle.   The average is review is based mostly on comparison to Zack Bruell's more interesting local offerings. The menu seems without a cohesive theme and offers indian/japanese/chinese and other asian influenced dishes without seeming to master any particular cuisine. The tofu Cesar salad is best avoided. The entrees we have tried were overly salty or bland.  For the price there are many more interesting options in the area."}
{"text":"The service is generally good but the food is variable. For example, at my last visit, the kafta meatballs were good and my salad itself was tasty, but the grilled chicken on top was dry and unseasoned. Way overpriced for what I actually got.   Maybe Cleveland Clinic has gotten to them in their crusade to make food as bland and \"healthy\" as possible."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation for Table 45 for my girlfriend's birthday on Open Table. We like to get out and try different restaurants in the area and this was one we had never been to. I should also mention that I booked the reservation before looking at any reviews on Yelp. After looking at those reviews I got a little nervous.  All and all, I would say we had a really great experience. I will say up front that parking can be a bit challenging if you don't use the complementary valet service. So do yourself a favor and take advantage of that. Getting into the restaurant from the parking deck across the street is a bit of a challenge is you're not familiar with the Clinic layout.  The restaurant is a fairly nice, modern looking restaurant. It does seem a little out of place in a hospital/hotel setting. It seems more like a restaurant you would find over on East 4th street. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Of all the places I have ever eaten I would say the staff here is top 5.   The drink menu was great. My girlfriend has a mixed drink, a spring elixir, that was good. Their beer selection isn't great but they have enough selections that, if you're a craft beer fan like myself, you won't be left out.  The food was great, almost perfect. I had a bowl of the tortilla soup which, in all honesty, tasted a little like tomato soup with tortilla chips and sour cream in it. However, the main courses more than made up for the appetizer. I had the chicken two ways and my girlfriend had the scallops. Both meals were exceptional. Portion sizes were good, flavor was fantastic. I really couldn't have asked for a better dinner.  I was admittedly skeptical about trying Table 45 after reading reviews. However, I we left satisfied and we will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"What is everyone complaining about? It is odd that, so far, most of the reviewers have not eaten the food...   We are in Cleveland to visit old friends, having moved to Seattle nine years ago. Let me tell you, Seattle has a million good restaurants so I feel qualified to judge this one.   I liked it. A lot. Went with five people and sat at table #10 which is nice and private. Started with a warm mushroom salad (good but not the best ever) and then had cumin lamb which was way yum. Others ate crab cakes or oysters as appys and salmon and pasta carbonera for entrees and everyone seemed happy. I thought the service was fine but maybe the slow pace was just what we needed since we had so much catching up to do with friends.   I did think the restaurant was strangely huge so it seemed a little under filled on a Saturday night.  Come on Cleveland, give it a try."}
{"text":"Meh. I was expecting a lot more from Table 45. Not worth the money or time, as far as I'm concerned. I've been twice, and have been underwhelmed both times.   The appetizers I've had have been very good. The naan pizza and roasted portabello mushroom are very good. It is the main entree I have a problem with. The first time at Table 45, I ordered the grilled strip steak. I ordered it medium, but it came pretty much tough and well done. It was also quite flavorless. The second time at Table 45, I decided to try the golden trout. Now, I don't eat trout very often, but I am fairly certain that you don't normally have to pick tiny little bones out of the meat with every single bite.   Table 45 does have some good deserts (not amazing, but good). However, this is not enough to make up for the mediocre entrees that I've had. I would recommend spending your time and money else ware."}
{"text":"Their desserts are overpriced, small and not very flavorful. Their cocktails are very good, specially the martinis. The food is nothing spectacular to pay a 100 bill for two people again. I don't think we will be back, specially with the many good places to eat at similar price range where you get better quality than here. The lamb chops were not bad but nothing else we tried was worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Table 45 for a special occasion dinner, and it was a dud.  I wanted something light for an appetizer, so I ordered the seaweed salad.  It was outrageously priced for some dried up grated carrot, and commercial seaweed.  There was nothing added to it that might have made the flavors interesting.    For my entree I ordered the spicy curried seaweed stew with basmati rice.  The menu described it as having mussels, clams, shrimp, and fish.  Imagine what I was thinking when it was delivered to the table, and I realized that I was spending $28, for 4 mussels, and 2 shrimp.  There was probably some other minced seafood in the rice, but it was over overshadowed by the uncooked hunks of carrot.  When I brought this to the attention of our waiter, he offered me a free dessert next time I visited--we didn't want any dessert at that point.   Next visit?  Seriously?  Why would I go back to this pretentious, overpriced, and underwhelming restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago for a family dinner and really did not see anything on the menu that interested me so I thought I'd play it safe and order the chicken tenders. It took forever for them to come out and when they finally did I bit into one and the inside was COMPLETELY RAW. The outside looked fine but it was straight pink on the inside I almost threw up. I told them what happened and they offered me a bowl of ice cream(seriously???). Never went there again and never plan on it."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here while in Cleveland.  Table 45 is highly esteemed.  On our visit in May 2014, we had the tandoori pork on polenta, salmon sashimi, salmon roll, ice berg wedge with mid-rare flank steak, hamburger with kimchi slaw, bread basket with a bright green olive oil and a nicely aged balsamico.   The ingredients were all very fresh.  The execution was excellent.  The restaurant was odd; we were seated waaay in the back, hidden from the entrance.  Why?  From the entrance, it looked abandoned.    It also smelled like it had been a smoky karaoke bar the night before."}
{"text":"I have never been to the happy hour but only to dinner twice. Our first experience was decent but not exceptional by any means. Our second visit this past week was disappointing.  We ordered the kitchen burger, the pho noodle soup, the calamari and the crab stuffed trout. The burger meat was dry and the bread was not fresh.  The pho noodle soup was so soul that it was not eatable.  There was nothing special about the calamari-- just deep fried.  My husband said the trout was ok. Our final bill was close to $90 (the noodle soup was listed at $24.  I could have gotten one in China town for less than $10 and it would have been delicious).  To conclude, we are never visiting table 45 again. My husband works at the clinic and we thought it would be convenient to just meet there for dinner as a family since he was working late.  This is actually my first review online on a restaurant and I only decided to write something since I was so disgusted by my experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Table 45 earlier this week and I couldn't disagree more with many of your reviewers who have panned this restaurant.  We found the decor to be very sleek and handsome.  The menu was very creative and the meals we ordered were delicious.  I had the warm wild mushroom salad and my wife has the beet salad.  Both were different but still very good.  For my entree I ordered the Shrimp Fusilli Pasta in sun-dried olive pesto sauce - very tasty.  My wife's seared sea scallops were ok, but not great.  Our deserts were the real treats.  I had the chocolate raspberry cake which was absolutely delicious.  My wife's flourless chocolate cake with peanut butter topping was good too.  The real highlight of the night was our waiter, William, who was one of the most professional, conscientious waiters in memory.  His food descriptions and recommendations were absolutely right on.  He is the consummate professional and should be requested as your waiter.  We visited the Cleveland Clinic from out of town (Chicago) and were impressed with the restaurant, the food, and our service.  We dine out frequently and as I previously mentioned, vigorously disagree with those earlier reviewers who have criticized Table 45.  Try it yourself and see if you don't agree with me."}
{"text":"I had to go to Table 45 for work related lunches for one month and that is how I got to try pretty much every vegetarian option they have.   Interior is nice and well maintained. Their service is good. The menu is a hit or miss. They have an Indian curry wrap, which is the worst food I have ever had with name curry in it! There is plenty of ethnic food on the menu but everything is altered to suit the taste of american palate. I don't have an american palate and if I had one, why would I order ethnic food and not American food. I have struggled to find something to order after four visits at this place.   As soon as the North coast cafe was open for lunch buffet, we moved over and are very happy about it.  I just changed it to two stars from three after 5 minutes because I will never go back unless I have to and it is free."}
{"text":"The spicy tuna roll was very good.  But the edamame...not so much.  Over steamed/overcooked whatever you want to call it it was limp and mushy.  Service was on the slow side for a Thursday night that didn't have much of a crowd.  Our server, William, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients of each dish.  Wound I come back?  Personally I don't like hearing the Life Flight helicopters landing at the Cleveland Clinic while sitting on the outdoor patio...so I don't think I would seek this place out just for good sushi.  I would rather go to Pacific East in Coventry or Sushi Rock downtown."}
{"text":"Overall I am fairly satisified with the food. Table 45 has great ambiance and an aura of escaping a large hospital, or to me work. I was here for a goodbye occasion and while somber to see someone leaving; I felt that it was an accommodating space with great staff. The serving size was a tad below what was to be expected and the size of our group could have been a strain but I personally did not receive much attention. Of course, I was with a lot of well groomed, properly dressed people and I was sitting here drinking my water like a camel and with hair that badly needs attention with shears and a comb. That is my rational; take it from the plate or push it aside. The meal I ordered was a hamburger with fries. They give you a small dish of ketchup and I am one of those who appreciates the sog of a well fried  potato so I had to keep asking more, and since I looked like a gutter rat; it took time. The lot of the table ordered off of their red leather menu with a good dose of options but not one I would take grandma who is a picky eater and has no teeth so usually goes for the applesauce and liver. The table was fine quality with linen covers and fancy but comfortable seating."}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel and you are looking for convenience, this might be the place for you. Otherwise, you might want to seek out an alternative. A friend and I arrived and were seated promptly, but once we arrived at our table there was absolutely no service. We had to flag down a waiter and ask to order. The prices for entrees here are relatively expensive and my meal was cold and mediocre at best. My friend did enjoy her burger and the banana tiramisu was pretty good. Overall the quality of the food and the service was not worth the price. I had the lunch buffet and breakfast buffet in the cafe in the same hotel and both meals were significantly cheaper and of much better quality."}
{"text":"Not bad for a high-priced hotel restaurant. I got the burger, and I thought it was great. The fries were well seasoned. The service was very nice. I wish there were more 'bar/pub' types of appetizers, but this IS an Asian/fusion restaurant, so I'm glad they at least had a burger :)  I thought the service was very nice. If I stayed at this hotel again, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Table 45 used to be one of my favourite Cleveland restaurants. I really enjoy Zack Bruell's culinary mindset, and at the time this joint opened, it was a diamond in the rough for adventurous Cleveland diners. It was global cuisine finely executed in a haute atmosphere many of us were looking for. But a few recent experiences have soured my taste.   The world offerings have definitely decreased in quality the last few times I've been there. The Chinese noodles, which used to be one of my favorite dishes there, were cold the last time I ordered them and featured that red-dyed pork you get at the poor quality Chinese restaurant down the street. The Pho was limp and colorless. A lot of the ethnic meats are overcooked and underseasoned. Where did the sense of adventure go??  Word of the wise to young diners, this is the type of place where waitstaff will make you feel bad about coming to with a date, regardless of whether you're polite, articulate, or order more than your fair share off the menu. I came here for New Year's Eve and we were seated in the corner by the fire exit (even though half the restaurant was empty) and rushed in and out like they couldn't wait to get rid of us, whereas the oldsters were hanging around all night. Sincerely hope they improve on this aspect.  By all means, go experience Table 45, just know what to order. The sushi is beautiful tasting, fresh and finely prepared,  the cocktails are smooth and creative, the desserts are delicious and sometimes get a little molecular gastronomic on ya. Enjoy it, just take it with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go to for a horrible experience from the crazy scenery that will haunt you when you sleep from the Roadkill meat they put in their tacos all starting with the stuck-up waiter we're asking for a refill of water was such an inconvenience. I waited 45 minutes to step into a nightmare you have to be completely hammered to be even able to enjoy anything there and even then I don't think that would be enough. Completely horrible experience skip the trip it's all hype just go hit up Olive Garden at least their food will taste halfway decent."}
{"text":"Sa?l?k için geldi?im bu otelde 45 in güleryüzlü ikramlar? çok güzel yemekleri leziz hele ekmekleri Türkiyemin ekmeklerini hiç aratmad? burdaki personele koçaman te?ekkür.."}
{"text":"The mango ahi papaya avocado plaintain chutney on brioche was great served with quail egg marmelade and pickled Mesopotamian marmoset kidney-foam toasts.   I like how they use local ingredients and offer discounts on tartare and sashimi items reflecting the lack of expense associated with not cooking the food products.  Chef and servers alike offer an experience befitting the proximity to a world-class healthcare facility and associated forensic pathology laboratory where more than a thousand non-specified autopsies are dutifully performed yearly.  Hats off to the gang at Table 45. You'll see me again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is TERRRRRRRIBLE. Horrible service. The food sucked. The only thing that was good was the water."}
{"text":"Valet parking-$5 with validated valet ticket.  You'll have to ask for validation- not asked by servers.  Had I not called ahead to ask  this would have cost me $18. Just my opinion, but meals are not worth the cost.  Basic salmon, plain white rice, and steamed bok choy- lacked flavor, not cooked as requested. I was very disappointed, for the cost and expectation this experience did not meet expectations.  No reason to make a trip back here."}
{"text":"The food was good but it sure wasn't mind blowing. I will say that I am glad this restaurant exist because after a long day working at the Cleveland Clinic it is pretty convenient. I'll probably eat there again but mostly out of convenience."}
{"text":"I always get a bad vibe whenever I go to a restaurant in a hotel. It always feels like people are just trying to get a convenient meal instead of it being a destination restaurant.  I had high hopes for Table 45 since it was a Zach Bruell restaurant but his tried-and-true touches weren't enough. About half of the diners were in shorts and polo shirts. The clean-lined, simple furniture that is a Bruell staple worked against the ambiance here as the bright sunlight streaming through at 6:30 made this feel more like a nice cafeteria than an expensive, romantic restaurant.  The drinks put us in a better mood as my Watermelon Sangria showed some originality and was perfect for summer and Jeannene loved how her peach/vodka cocktail embraced the peachiness. We followed those up with an Old-Fashioned each and those were equally satisfying.  But the food was lacking. My spicy tuna sushi roll ($10) had almost no rice, which put the focus on the chewy seaweed wrapping. Jeannene's eel roll ($10) had proper ratios, however.   Then, my Oven Roasted Organic Chicken ($25) was coated in a mole sauce which was decent enough, I guess, though I was expecting more of a zing on the taste buds and Jeannene said the \"Mexican rice\" that came with it reminded her of the taco seasoning that comes in the packet at a grocery store.  She had the salmon over Hong Kong noodles special ($32) and while she enjoyed the fish she thought the noodles were way too salty (Something I've never heard her say outside of a wing or burger joint). I had a few and didn't think they were that bad.  The $170 dinner did end on a high note as we had the chocolate and cherry bread pudding special ($9) which had just the right hints of bitter chocolate and tart cherries to go with the dense, eggy bread."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one additional star for the presence of a 4-6 pm happy hour.  :)  $2.50 Guinness is an attractive thought, isn't it?  Couple that with hors d'oeuvres gratis, and we're talking a winning afternoon combination!"}
{"text":"I recently had a prolonged stay for a relative at the Cleveland Clinic (where this restaurant is located on campus in the Intercontinental) so I had the chance to eat here 3 times in 7/2010.  Basically it is a dark modern restaurant with a slightly Asian decor.  The menu is \"world.\"  They have a sushi bar which looked nice but I didn't try. The menu has some of everything from around the world ranging from Asian dishes to Mediterranean to American comfort food.  Some appetizers were: steamed mussels with a S. American pepper sauce, a fried wanton mille feuille with smoked salmon and an Asian vinagrette, a saffron-infused clam soup, and a rustic gazpacho -- all were excellent. Some of the dinners were paparadelle pasta with preserved lemons, kalamata olives, feta, and grilled octopus, a braised short rib dish with spring pea risotto, and roasted trout with grilled asparagus and fingerling potatoes.  My only warning is that there are very few \"normal\" things on the menu if your party includes some non-foodies. We had very attentive service at all 3 meals.  Prices: appetizers were 6-15 and a la carte entrees about 20-30 -- about what you'd expect at an Intercontinental."}
{"text":"Just eh so so  nothing to write home about. Not worth even 1/2 the price. Best thing on the menu - Mitchell's ice cream. Location -1 mile from here. Go figure"}
{"text":"I just had the worst sushi of my life at Table 45. Also possibly the most expensive. $18 for the truly horrible, rubbery 45 Roll, and another $9 for a repulsive spicy tuna hand roll. Tasted like last year's fish. I'm just thankful I only ordered two rolls. Seriously, avoid the sushi here at all costs."}
{"text":"I think the food here is overpriced and I've had some expensive sub par dishes. I've also had some excellent dishes. I wouldn't recommend the stuffed tomato or the shellfish pasta. I really like coming here for happy hour drinks and snacks. The bartenders service is excellent and there's a couple TVs."}
{"text":"This restaurant is convenient for lunch or happy hour if you work in the area, however the service is really slow! On multiple occasions, I would have liked to have ordered something else off the menu, but there was no server in sight for 30 minutes. It's also a pain when you are trying to leave but need to wait and wait to flag down a waiter to get the bill.   Overall: the food is good, the happy hour prices are good, but the service is bad."}
{"text":"Eh.  This is a restaurant that seems more concerned with ambiance than food.  My husband and I dined here and he had the chicken while I had the pappardelle.  Both were lame excuses for upscale food.  The pasta was under done and had a terrible after taste.  My husband's chicken was bland.  We both agreed that it was not worth coming back to try again as chicken and pasta are hardly things that one should be messing up and a more complicated dish would make for a less than savory dining experience."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the happy hour which is actually really nice. Beers $4.5, Mixed $5, and Wine $5. Plus open appetizer buffet.   I snagged a drink and then ordered the Steak Tartare which I have been dying to try for ages. It was really tasty! Some people may gripe about the tiny portion, but you live and learn.   I browsed the menu and thought it was a bit too eclectic for my tastes. There's a little bit of everything on it, with a hint of curry in almost everything. I'm not sure I dig a menu with a focus that I cannot pinpoint. Anywho - I do recommend the happy hour~!"}
{"text":"A brand new restaurant, Table 45 is located in the Intercontinental Hotel.  In general I am wary of hotel fare, but beiing in an adventurous mood I decided to try this place.  The decor is clean and has a modern feel to it.   There is plenty of wide open spaces between tables, something missing from many restaurants.    The menu is quite ecletctic, pairing international appetizers like pho with more traditional american main courses like lamb and salmon albeit with a hint of Asian flavor.  In general the food is okay.  I had a lamb shank.  The meat was tender and flavorful but the fat had a gaminess that really detracted from the main dish.  The service also seems a touch spotty, maybe with a few more months under its belt this place will iron out all these kinks."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the brunch here:  I was impressed with the selection of options at this all-you-can eat buffet which also includes not only juice and coffee but an actual full-sized entree.  (Suffice it to say, I did not need to eat again for many hours, which worked out well considering those hours included a 4+ hour flight back to Phoenix.)  In addition to the standard omelets, waffles, and the like, the buffet included many \"intercontinental\" options including 2 kinds of delicious naan, 5 or 6 types of potstickers, and some sushi.    There were about a dozen entree choices, including stuffed French toast (extremely sweet and rich), crab cakes, and a slightly Mexican-style eggs benedict with chorizo.   Everything I sampled was delicious except the chorizo, which was in a thick patty and was just really meaty-tasting, as opposed to being crumbly and full of Mexican seasonings.  Sadly, I did not pace myself and didn't even make it to the dessert table, which was covered with artistic- and tasty-looking options.  The decor was cool and modern, with stylishly shaped utensils and sleek rectangular spare plates for sharing food and/or storing your silverware when it was time for your food plates to be taken away.  The steaming hot pitchers of milk for the coffee were a nice thoughtful touch.   And then there was the magician...  I have to admit that as table-side entertainment goes, this was surprisingly cool and unobtrusive.  Whether we wanted to or not, my brunch companions and I were suddenly drawn into a magic card trick that was well-executed, thankfully didn't take too long, and really did leave us going \"How'd he do that?!\""}
{"text":"I've been to just about all of Bruell's restaurants. I would have to unfortunately say I was least impressed with Table 45. I understand that it is located in a hotel, but there is no ambiance. The food was pretty good. I enjoyed the soy sauce for the sushi. I liked the salmon, however, it was a bit too salty."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on a weekday afternoon.  My friend and I had planned to go to the other restaurant in the Intercontinental Hotel (North Coast Cafe?), which serves an upscale buffet lunch.  That restaurant was full to capacity, so we wandered across the lobby to Table 45.   We were seated immediately and an assortment of artisan bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar was placed in front of us, while we reviewed the menu.   I ordered the Fattoush salad and my dining companion ordered the Greek chicken sandwich which came with a choice of fries, slaw or salad.  There were a number of options on the menu from appetizers, sushi, flatbread etc.  My salad arrived a short time later, I was a little disappointed in the portion for $11 especially with no protein.   I must admit the salad was very good, nice mix of romaine lettuce, bell peppers, toasted pita, tomatoes, cucumbers dressed in a Sumac spiked vinagrette dressing.  My friend's sandwich consisted of handcarved, grilled chicken topped with feta cheese, cucumbers and roasted peppers, which a garden salad on the side.  Our server was attentive and friendly. All in all this was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times with business clients.  Each time has progressively gotten worse.  For a restaurant that prides itself as being a trendy restaurant associated with a big name, trying to attract foodies and rich clientele, and located in the Cleveland Clinic downtown, it really sucks.    The food is OK.  Nothing that really excites, although they certainly try.  The service is absolutely slow and horrendous.  The wait staff really does not have a clue about service and how to ensure that customers are actually taken care of.  They always look flustered and seem to not know what is going on with any of the orders.  In addition, they do not seem to know how to apologize when they screw up.  Bottom line: if you are trying to have a business lunch with clients and actually impress them, and have a schedule to stick to - AVOID THIS PLACE.  Go to NorthCoast Cafe located on the other side of the lobby instead."}
{"text":"The duck was a little tough. There was no horseradish available for the oysters. Yet, the ahi tuna, the tempura oyster salad, the red snapper? Quite nice."}
{"text":"I debated a lot about how I wanted to approach this review. Table 45 is touted as a restaurant that has a high attention to detail and delicious offerings, sadly not so much the case. I gave myself time to cool off, the standing eight count if you will, but alas, my disappointment has not waned.   I came with a party of seven for restaurant week last Friday. The reservation portion was a cinch, took care of everything via Open Table (LOVE this site). However, from the moment we walked in it took a turn for the worse. Four of us arrived first and waited at the host stand, not for an inordinate amount of time but long enough that we wondered if we should be seating ourselves. Once the host arrived he was unprepared for our arrival and we had to wait a few more minutes for our table to be made up.   We were seated in a nice, secluded part of the restaurant, a spacious booth off to one side. Once seated however, it was only set for six instead of seven, not a big deal, just stick a place setting and chair on the end of our table.  Two other gals arrived and were shown to an empty table to wait, they then realized we were already there and found us themselves. A few minutes later the host came back, asked if I was myself or Dr. whomever, asking how many we had in our party. Clearly confused and potentially seated us at the wrong location but as nothing was communicated we may never know.  Long waits and sporadic service were next. When we did get our drink order in they came in waves. Either the bartender was behind or the server could only carry a few drinks at a time, either way it was just bizarre.  More waiting and lulls pre and post food order. Once the food did arrive it was again disastrous. The first course was pretty good; after all, it is pretty hard to make a gross salad. The second course, however, was horrible. I had the fish with wild rice. The entire plate was dry and tasteless. For those that had the pork chops and winter squash, the squash was so overpowered with raw red onion that it literally stayed on the palate through the end of the meal and beyond. Dessert was by far the best course and even this was riddled with frustration. While the server did an OK job of describing the options it was still a guessing game. Once it was finally decided, we find out they are out of the 'best' dessert, the macaroon...an 86 list anyone?  I could go on and on and on but I will spare you the boredom that we felt throughout. The service inefficient. The food was OK at its best. Some random gal in black kept poking her head in (the manager I assume) but never actually cared to find out how the experience really was. I get it, restaurant week means there are a lot of orders for the same thing. However a). the restaurant was not busy and b). you choose to participate. I am put off by the whole experience. It was a waste of my money and had I not been with six gals that I enjoy spending copious amounts of time with it would have been a waste of that as well. Save your time and money, Table 45 can be avoided."}
{"text":"Five people in our party and all dishes ordered were average. Ordered a steak and it arrived cold. Restaurant should not serve steak if they can't supply you with a steak knife. Service was awful too. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Cleveland is blessed with talented chefs.  Our usual go-to is Michael Symon, but we've had a few great meals at Alley Cat and heard good things about Zac Bruell's other restaurants, so for my husband's last birthday we gave Table 45 a try.  Long story short, we had a good meal, but it  didn't live up to the hype or our expectations.  The food: --Caesar salad: we don't get any points for creativity on our order here, but they don't get any points for extra effort, either.    There are standout Caesars out there, and while this was tasty, it wasn't memorable. --Short ribs: my entree was the best thing we ordered.  The short ribs were fork-tender and the sauce was excellent.  The polenta had a wonderful flavor, but could have been thicker.  The portion was huge, and I enjoyed this one twice. --Grilled beef tenderloin: my husband's steak was very good, but not $58 good-- there's more impressive cuts of beef to be had in Cleveland.  They did a good job making it medium rare, but could have seasoned it a bit more.  They were a bit skimpy with the brandy cream sauce, but it was delicious and they did eventually provide a little more sauce upon request. --Creme brûlée: very good.  Service: friendly and professional, but not as responsive as you'd hope for at this price point.  Atmosphere: odd. This is in the first floor of the very modern InterContinental Hotel in the Cleveland Clinic, and instead of feeling chic, it ends up feeling kind of sterile.  It's also distracting when hotel guests use the restaurant back door as an entrance to the hotel; hotel guests have every right to be comfortable in gym clothes and hoodies, but it kind of detracts from the fine dining vibe the restaurant is going for.  \"A-OK\" is three stars, and that sounds about right. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but it didn't discourage me from wanting to try more of Zac Bruell's creations, and I wouldn't discourage you from going if you're staying at the hotel or visiting the hospitals or university."}
{"text":"Perhaps you'll like the menu?? Had their sole special- that wasn't. Another night their chicken paprika -not not exciting. Service good Wines somewhat pricey I would venture elsewhere IF you're not trapped there."}
{"text":"I love Zack Bruell's restaurants. L'Albatross, Cowell & Hubbard, and Chinato are among my favorites in town. That said, how I wish this place was as awesome as the others. Let me explain.  Don't get me wrong, the quality of the ingredients and the food preparation are excellent. The servers are upbeat, attentive, and the service overall is just as good. The type of food here is \"unclassifiable\", so I put it in the \"fusion\" or eclectic category.  Of all Zack's restaurants, this one seems to have the experimental role, a clinical trial if there was ever one for food -- so is it fitting that it's next to the Cleveland Clinic? Here's a few examples: turkey burger with wasabi, strip steak with sweet red pepper sauce, calamari in a sauce that's sort of like sweet tamarinds... get the point? My taste buds don't. The \"East\" and \"West\" mixes they attempt are like oil and water. Order the \"safe\" dishes if eclectic is not your thing.  Yet I am here more often than any other restaurant because of, you guessed it, work meetings... Ironically, the last meeting was about how to get different people to work together. While of course, wishing how the different ingredients on my plate could work together."}
{"text":"A friend and I checked out Table 45 out because he'd heard they have a solid happy hour. I typically try to steer clear of hotel bars/restaurants, and I probably won't be back here.  For happy hour you get your choice of 3 bottled beers (Dortmunder, Guiness or Sam Adams), wine or a couple of mixed drinks. There are no taps, it's $2.50 for a 12 oz bottle. Not a bad deal, but hardly the best happy hour in Cleveland. They advertise \"free appetizers\" but what they serve can hardly be classified as an appetizer in my book. There had chips/salsa and 3 choices of h'orderves.  The atmosphere wasn't particularly comfortable. There are huge windows on one side of the restaurant but the bar side was kept dark. It just felt awkward.   I can't comment on the food because we didn't eat. If this place has a saving grace, it might be the food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a group of 6 people because we primarily wanted highend steak. When you enter the restaurant the lounge is visible and the bartender greeted us immediately from afar. Very friendly. And that's where any goodness ended.  The waitress who seated us and waited on us was very frazzled from the start. Completely caught us by surprise. It took some negotiation to get a table where we wanted versus them sticking us off to the side. I hate that. I'm the customer. When the restaurant is empty, I should have my choice of where to sit.  When it came time to order, she was even worse. Had to write our order down multiple times and still got it wrong. We said it so many times that two weeks later, I have all of our orders engrained in my head. Literally.  We waited for our food for 45 min even though we were the only folks there. Not to mention waiting a really long time for water refills.  When the food came it was an utter disaster. Every order was way too over cooked and didn't have the vegetables the person requested. I ordered mine medium well and it was literally burned. I think sucking on a charcoal briquette would have been more appetizing.  I'll never return."}
{"text":"A splendid evening at Cowell and Hubbard a few months ago encouraged me to make Zack Bruell eateries a destination for special nights with my wife. Though we certainly enjoyed ourselves overall, a few quirks in the food and service prevent me from assigning Table 45 a covetable 5-star rating.  The complimentary valet service, prompt and friendly, met us upon arrival at the InterContinental Hotel. Entering the restaurant, my wife rightly observed that Table 45's ambiance is quite distinct from Cowell and Hubbard. The latter has a very purposeful \"let's go out to a nice dinner\" feel, whereas Table 45 is perhaps patronized by business people looking for evening relaxation. Consequently, the decor feels more like an extension of a high-end hotel lobby than a quiet, romantic eatery.  The first quirk of the evening occurred when the hostess, helping the couple waiting in front of us, took our reservation, stated, \"I'll be right back,\" left with the aforementioned couple, and then never returned. We waited around three minutes before another hostess arrived. We told her we were being helped, so she helped the couple behind us, and we continued waiting. Five minutes passed until another hostess arrived. Desperate, I re-stated my reservation and she took us to our table immediately. Strange.  Highlight of the evening: on my OpenTable reservation I had stated that, since it was my wife's birthday, I wanted a table in a quieter part of the restaurant. As a result, they kindly provided a secluded booth right by the kitchen. Indeed, Table 45 is not a quiet restaurant at all, so I cannot overstate how much we appreciated this.  Our order began with Glenfiddich scotch and steak tartare. The scotch---excellent. The tartare itself was also incredibly tasty but to our dismay the accompanying crostini was completely stale. My wife had a tough time getting over that, and I have to agree---it seemed oddly out of place given the exceptional quality of the rest of our meal.  Choosing an entree was difficult, given the melange of mouth-watering international options. I succumbed to one of the Thai entrees: half-roasted duck with stir-fried rice, orange glaze, bok choy, and thai curry sauce. Absolutely fantastic, though the serving of rice seemed unnecessarily small. My wife went for the salmon in mushroom broth with potatoes and scallions. Her blissful description: \"First, a grilled texture and the flavor of smoke, followed by the sweetness and warmth of the broth. A well-soaked piece melts in your mouth like butter. Finally, a spicy finish.\"  We topped off our meal with macadamia nut mousse and poached fruit with marscapone cream. Delicious. As with every dish, the presentation matched the taste. Pleasantly, given my wife's birthday, the waitress kindly removed her dessert from the check.  My other complaints are minor, perhaps, but notable given Table 45's high price tag. First, the service is a little slow, particularly in water refills. Crowd is no excuse---the restaurant was half-full, if that. Second, the waitress said she was taking our desserts (plural) off of the check, yet only my wife's was removed. Not a big deal, but my wife and I would have gladly shared dessert had we known that only one was on the house.  Taken together, Table 45 is a very good establishment but perhaps not on the same level as some of the other elite Bruell eateries. Indeed, it is also telling that on a Friday night, getting a Table 45 reservation for any time slot was no problem, whereas availability at his other restaurants was scarce to nonexistent."}
{"text":"The service was terriblely slow, but once you get the food, it's tastely.  Also have an interesting cocktail list. Convieniently located for anyone on the hospital campus."}
{"text":"Let's start this on a high note:   Complementary valet parking = balla' when you live in a city that snows five months out of the year..  A table of 3,  My order: seaweed salad and the soup of the day (which was a vegetable/meat some european origin name) Both were really really good, I even recall telling our waiter to complement the chef for me.   My company: Seared Scallop dish w/ Red Pepper Sauce & other accompaniments that are now currently on the menu.  The Lamb Dish   Both were very pleased, and were of good portion size.   Yeah, the restaurant is located inside of a hotel. But, seriously, who cares? Open mind--people. They have to get their base clientele from somewhere...this is Cleveland, not Miami.   Down note:  Let's just say the interior, is not so 'easy on the eyes'. The decor and layout looks like an upscale dining room of an assisted senior living home...  And the front dining/bar area is a tad better with a airport-boarding area feel. I'd love to know who deemed this look as 'modern'. 2.5 stars   Thankfully for Table 45 I base my return on food not decor, so my return is likely. I'll just be that chick in the corner eating with her eyes closed."}
{"text":"Didn't care for the food. My pallet isn't refined enough. Food on the fancier side. Servers were very attentive to special needs and allergies.  Ambiance was delightful."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with Table 45. Have eaten at Zach Bruells restaurant parallax and really enjoyed it. Went to Table 45 really excited after reading the menu and looking at the visuals of the food. I tried a little bit of everything off the menu. Started with a sushi roll it was good, nothing crazy though. For and appetizer had the lamb sliders wasn't impressed, the mussels were so so. My entree wasn't much to speak of I had the braised pork I felt like I could have actually made that dish better myself. All and all wanted to like this place maybe i just went on a bad night."}
{"text":"The gnocchi was great, but the rest of my meal wasn't so hot. The edamame was over cooked and the roll I had, the seaweed paper smelled awful. Almost not edible. Tuna sashimi was fine but the service honestly shit. I would think bringing drinks to increase the tab and tip would be welcomed but it took me 20 min to get one drink"}
{"text":"At first I thought that this place was going to be great because it is in the Intercontinental Hotel in the Cleveland Clinic and because it had a name chef associated with it.      However, after eating there twice while visiting someone at the Cleveland Clinic I have to say that I was severely dissapointed.  The service was mediocre, the food was just okay, and the prices were insanely high.     If I knew anyone visiting the Cleveland Clinic, I would tell them to spend the $10 to go downtown to another restaurant rather than eat here.   It was that bad.       See my other review on the Greenhouse Tavern if you want some good food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of other Zack Bruell restaurants, but this one is a disappointment. The menu is just boring. The food is well executed but uninspired. The dining room is cold and institutional.  On the positive side, the sushi is amazing. Stop in for happy hour and it's affordable, too. Unfortunately, they took it off the lunch menu."}
{"text":"We tried to get into L'Albatros on a Saturday night and they were just too busy, so we decided to try Table 45 since we were going to a Jazz event at the Intercontinental Hotel and I have to say we were very disappointed.  Located inside the Intercontinental Table 45 is a sprawling space which struck as as sterile and off-putting.  When we walked in at about 9pm on a Saturday night the place was nearly empty with no energy at all.     The service was slightly off the whole night, from a hostess who was too busy on the phone to greet us and who didn't know who the chef was, to a waiter who wanted to over describe dishes, this was very disappointing for what is suppose to be one of Cleveland's better restaurants.  The menu is a bit hard to figure out with a mix of different cuisines; Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Mediterranean are just some of the influences.  This can be exciting and innovative when done right, but it seemed to us to just end with uninteresting dishes.  We started with the Eggplant Fries, which were strips of eggplant panfried with chickpeas and with a side of spiced yogurt; the dish was ok, with a slightly Indian flavor, but it was overall bland, no tang or spice to my taste.  I had the Walleye entree, a nicely prepared square of mild fish served over a potato and edamame hash with what was described as a dashi ponzu vinegar.  While the fish was nice, the hash lacked any real impact and the sauce did not have any acidity or flavor profile like it was described.  When I spend $28 for a fish dish I expect something interesting and impactful, what I got was OK, but that is not sufficient.  Over the years I have heard good things about Table 45, what I found was disappointing on almost every front.  Overall Table 45 seems to have run its course and is desperately in need of a redesign both for the room and the menu.   There is no energy or buzz for this restaurant, and with all the new places opening up it is time to try something else."}
{"text":"Eclectic menu takes you on a culinary world tour, but maybe it's too eclectic for its own good? We searched in vain for really standout flavours."}
{"text":"First night in Cleveland wanted to hit up something good & gluten free which was close to our hotel (Intercontinental). Found this joint on Yelp and took a shuttle from our hotel to this place which is located inside another Intercontinental hotel.  This restaurant and bar is decorated very cool, and has like a shoot a music video inside of here feel to it, none the less first impressions of a Cleveland restaurant were legit. Real sleek and elegant and good views, the bar is pretty large itself. The bartender however lacks basic drink mixing skills, 3 cocktails he made completely sucked.   Appetizer: Pork Wraps, these were pretty decent, tasty, and gluten free. Appetizer 2: Lady got the naan bread appetizer and liked it. (not gluten free)  Main Course:Burgundy Braised Short Ribs (GF) which was pretty tasted and had a good beef stock juicy flavor to it, id order it again. The carrot side mixed with the sauce was nom nom.  Dessert: Creme Bru Le which was a little cold and not really a toasted top but none the less was tasty.  Service: Our lady was pretty decent for being a dead restaurant, however at check out took a few minutes to find her.    If your in the hotel's around here and looking for a decent bite to eat with a slight tough of class this place will do it for you."}
{"text":"Another Zack Bruell's restaurant. One of these days, I'm just waiting to find a Bruell restaurant that disappoints me terribly but so far, i'm growing to be a HUGE fan of bruell.  I've been to Table 45 before for their happy hours and I loved the restaurant atmosphere and layout, and although their happy hour food is good, it never was memorable. But guess what... I came here the sunday before Valentine's Day and Table 45 blew my mind.  Service (5): It was great! If you've ever read my review on Parallex, you would understand my fear of going to a Zack Bruell's restaurant because of the service. But you know what? My bf and I had an awesome waitress who would really time when she approached us. She was friendly, she was helpful, and she was very on time. Our meals came at perfect times and our drinks came on time. She made great recommendations and I couldn't ask for a better waitress.  Appetizer: Lobster Bisque (3.5)-- my bf and I decided to share a lobster bisque and the waitress was so thoughtful to split a soup into 2 cups for us. I liked the lobster bisque and I loved the hint of curry in it. However, like my bf critiqued... the bisque didn't have enough lobster flavor to it and I (not bragging) have made better lobster bisque through Viking School.  Seafood Pappardelle (4)-- I soooooo do not regret ordering this dish. If Zack makes his own pappardelle, i would say they are the BEST pappardelle ever! I had them at Parallax and again at Table 45 and they are just soooo delicious! There's 2 minor things I've complain and warn though. First, I noticed that Zack tends to like to cook on the salty side. Now, good thing I like my foods salty but even as a \"salt eater,\" his food are a bit salty for me. Second, the seafood pappardelle sauce was pretty much my lobster bisque which I wished was either warned ahead of time not to order them together or that Zack would make a separate sauce for it. By the time I was down to my last 3 bits, i was just so sick of lobster bisque from my apps and entree. But still, this was one great seafood pappardelle.   Pork Tenderloin with Parmesan Gnocchi (4)-- If you know me as a huge seafood eater, you should know that my bf is a huge gnocchi fan. Because of that, he almost always orders dishes with gnocchi, not to mention he makes his own too! And because of that, I think together we are qualified to say that Bruell's Gnocchi's are AMAZING. Parmesan Gnocchi?!?!?! His gnocchi had a reallyyyy unique texture and flavor to it that we both just killed the meal. At the same time, the pork tenderloin was cook to perfection too.   What would I recommend? Zack's Gnocchi and Pappardelle!!!!  Oh... last thing, Zack Bruell is pretty much now my favorite chef in cleveland. Only 2 of his restaurants left to try!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I wanted to like this place, especially since I luuurve L'Albatros and Parallax. This place was horribly disappointing. Service was meh and the ambiance is that of a typical hotel restaurant (read: boring). I'm all for east-meets-west fusion food but the execution here is clearly lacking. The seared tuna tataki was okay. The spiced chicken was dry and way overpriced. No one at my table of four seemed particularly impressed. Give this one a miss."}
{"text":"This review is specific - go to the bar and ask for Chris. He's just the bomb and pours a damn fine glass of wine (for my mom). Thanks Chris!!!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with Table 45. I think it's wonderful that you can use valet for free at the Intercontinential if you dine at the restaurant.  The atmosphere is fun but elegant.   And the food was amazing! We sampled a number of things and were impressed with everything. The ravioli in particular was out of this world delicious.  I gave Table 45 four instead of five stars because the waiter was a bit pretentious, which I have no tolerance for. Also, it is a bit pricier than it should have been.   Despite that, I would go back here for sure and I absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Table 45 has a fantastic happy hour. You really can't go wrong with any of their appetizers, but the fries and their chicken wings are a few of my favorites. Food always comes promptly and service is great as well."}
{"text":"We were in town for a night of comedy at Hilarities and decided to give Table 45 a go.  Apparently, this place has a reputation for slow service but we didn't experience that. Everyone seemed fairly prompt and friendly.  One server gave us a high five while being led to our table for some reason.    The menu is decent with a few options from different parts of the world.  I had the yellowtail roll for an appetizer (fresh and delicious) and the Cioppino for my entree.  The Cioppino had a ton of mussels, lobster, shrimp, scallops and white fish in a nice tomato broth with shaved fennel and Israeli couscous.  My only issue was the pieces of white fish were practically inedible. Salt block city! If I would have eaten all the pieces they'd given me, I would have left on a gurney.   All in all we had a nice meal and a good time.  Yellowtail sushi roll, cioppino, 2 Coors Lights (classy). $50 + $10 tip.   Despite the salty-ass fish, I'd still go back and get it again."}
{"text":"Most people would probably warn me to not eat sushi in Cleveland (no tuna in Lake Erie I don't think). But I felt like something relatively healthy and a cold beer after work. So I took a seat at the bar at Table 45 inside the lobby of the Intercontinental (best hotel in town, FYI).  Spicy Tuna and California Roll. Basic, right? Well, you should have warned me. The ST was slimy. The CR was tasteless.  Oh, and the beer on draft was bitter thanks to what the bartender surmised was a construction issue where the fridge might be turned off at night. Not good for kegs.  Good service. Ok ambiance. But sort of sterile. Lots of servers rushing around in a half empty restaurant. Slow your roll. And don't eat one."}
{"text":"I live in Cleveland and only go here for dinner. An okay place, with valet that's comped which is nice when the weather is unfavorable. The food tastes \"healthy\" which makes sense since it's attached the to Clinic, but I really like flavor (read: fat). The bar is a nice place to work during dinner, one of the better places I've found."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar if you can. The bartenders are extremely tentative and will remember your drink of choice. I have been here a few times and have always had the best experience when sitting/ordering from the bar. The place is good for happy hour with a decent selection of cocktails, beer  and wines. I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese and Italian Parmesan Truffle Fries. Sitting in the lounge area is another story you never see the server. It was the getting towards the end of happy hour and no one came around just ended up going back up the bar to get a drink. Not sure if they understaff that area but it seems like there is only one server and they are always busy especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"We came here with a big group for happy hour.  Table 45 has a pretty good deal for drinks.  Wines, beers, and cocktails are all part of the deal and cost about $5.    They are limited in the appetizers they offer though; two of their choices are different types of fries.  I will credit their food for being good though.  Their Asian street fries were particularly addicting and offered a sweet and sour flavor.  Their truffle parmigiana fries were okay, but they essentially tasted like fries with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  Even though their food is good, it isn't as good as what you would expect for such a classy, somewhat expensive place.  I would recommend this place, but wouldn't come back too often."}
{"text":"Really disappointed... First time I disagree with the reviews from my Yelpers...  Ambience: I thought it was actually very nice for a hotel restaurant. I sat by a window and the fall colors on the trees outside were beautiful!  Food: bland would be a compliment. I was craving sushi, and this place was at a walking distance, so I decided to give it a try. What a disappointment. The best part of the meal was the bread, had a slice of asiago bread and one of olive bread, both delicious. Ordered edamame as an appetizer: overcooked, mushy and tasteless. Ordered salmon roll and scallops spicy roll, they served me the smallest, less filled with fish sushi I've ever had, and I've been to some bad places in my life...  Desert: chocolate cake, again bland, tasted like it was store bought and just warmed right before serving.  Really disappointed. I don't mind paying a lot for food if it is tasty, fresh, looks good and is well prepared.  They got two stars because staff was great!"}
{"text":"So close to five stars! The service is excellent, the ambiance is classy, it's a shame my entree was so flat. I don't mean flat as in pancake. I mean flat as in, 'meh... nothin special', which is entirely unacceptable at a restaurant in this price range. Actually, most of the food was great, the only problem was my entree.  The great: * Ahi Tuna Tartare was great, but sooo tiny.  * She got the 'Butternut Squash and Truffle Ravioli with Sage Creamed Spinach and Toasted hazelnuts'. Absolutely perfect! Delicate and sophisticated both at once. * Our waiter was professional and knowledgeable.  The meh: * I had Braised Pork with a Bacon and Chihuahua Cheese Stuffed Potato Croquette, Haricot Vert and Charred Tomato. The croquette was amazing, but the shredded pork was flat.  * Where did they get that hostess? She has the surprising skill of simultaneously conveying boredom with you, her job, and her life.  Finally, we sat along the perimeter, it seems to me that if you were seated in the center it could get quite loud."}
{"text":"Service was painfully slow at lunch with less than 30% occupied seats! Only game in the area (Cleveland clinic) no value/food was good not great I wouldn't buy into the hype"}
{"text":"Wow how do I start a review on this disastrous evening at table 45? Starting right with the reservation, I was told the only times available for dinner on New Year's Eve were 5:00 PM or 10 PM. Eventually, I was able to negotiate a 6:45 reservation.   When we arrived, the restaurant was only partially filled and emptied out by 8 PM. The young lady who made The reservation may have been following the old trick of creating artificial scarcity, but it only created resentment in our party of four.   After we were seated, our waiter, Mark, announced that the oysters served fresh and baked were no longer available, even though it was a fixed price menu. About 15 minutes later he returned to say that the chef would make mussels instead for us, which was disappointing to my partner. Then after we ordered and had a glass of wine, our dinners were brought out in about 45 minutes after appetizers and salad which were well prepared.   Next,  three out of the four dinners came to the table with flourishes and efficiency while our fourth party sat for about 35 minutes waiting for her dinner to be prepared. Not only did the wait staff forget about her dinner, they forgot to order it and make it happen.   The manager eventually arrived and claimed to have cooked it himself -- which we knew to be untrue since he had been cruising around the room just before arriving with the very late dinner.   Disappointed not to have dined with the rest of her friends, she asked the staff to box up her dinner as it came too late.   The rest of us finished our meals, and then awaited desserts which were pre-ordered from the fixed-price menu. Only then, we discovered that they were out of one of the desserts we ordered, so they offered a substitute which unfortunately was unacceptable.,  Ernesto, the manager, stood and patiently listened to our complaints about the menu and the service, said he was sorry and disappeared. We called for the check and waited another 15-20 minutes for it to arrive. At last we decided to put on our coats and head for the door, in the hopes of inducing the nonexistent staff in the by now 95% empty room ( it was 10:00 pm by this time) to notice our immanent departure and deliver the bill, which they did, breathlessly explaining that after long consultation, the staff had recommended that they comp 2 of our 4 dinners.   Small recompense at this late hour! We were already annoyed and had vowed never to return -- ever! -- to this silly, screwed-up place.   Recommendation - STAY AWAY.  Two stars for the food. No stars for everything else. The hotel needs a new F&B operator, and soon!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that a hotel restaurant on a medical campus would be the source of the most delicious pasta I've ever had.   The noodles and vegetables were dripping with flavor (or butter) as was likely my face.  The pasta even managed to outshine the delicious rye bread and olive oil starter, which would normally win my heart and spoil my appetite.  And after all that I still managed to kill the apple crumble with marsala ice cream.  A true fancy spot for work dinners or special occasions, in the middle of the Cleveland Clinic, where people expect excellence."}
{"text":"For being so upscale, I wasn't impressed with the menu flexibility. Not great for vegetarians. Cool environment though, because it is located in the Intercontinental Hotel."}
{"text":"Avoid the Kitchen Burger! Grass fed beef and lamb with bacon sound pretty tasty but apparently what they do is grind up the bacon and make a burger out of it. This means it comes out with a very pink and raw look to it. It was really unappetizing. I tried to send it back for being undercooked but the waitress said it just looks pink because of all the bacon. It did not taste raw but it did taste like it was pure grease. Basically it just tasted disgusting.  We did come back another night and I had some yummy sushi but their rolls are extremely small so you would have to get 2 or 3 to make a meal out of it and that would be ridiculously expensive. I left hungry even though I had also ordered the seaweed salad (which was delish).  So, overall two strikes based on the food but the décor and service were ok."}
{"text":"I have been staying in the hotel, with my family at Cleveland Clinic.  This is the main restaurant at the Intercontinental Hotel and BEYOND a disappointment!!  This is an expensive restaurant and most would have certain expectations. Tuesday night w4 of us came in for dinner.  There is an Asian pork & shrimp noodle dish on the menu- sounds good.  I order with extra shrimp or chicken- no pork- as I do not eat for religious reasons.  Ten minutes later the waiter comes back and says- sorry- -it is made with pork broth so guess it won't work.  Don't you think he should have known that?  I then ordered the roast chicken.  It was absolutely inedible!  There was so much cilantro on the chicken that was all that you could taste.  It did nothing good for the chicken.  Then I ordered sushi- -had a spider roll.  The ends were great with fried soft-shell crab- -the inner pieces- had tempura crunch- no crab.  Never once did the manager come over.  No apologies--not anything!!!  So tonight left the hospital at 9:15-- where do you go- -the hotel again.  We ask what the soup of the day is- -we are told \"something & ham\"- -I say I cannot eat ham/pork.  He suggests the vegetarian Spring Onion soup.  Get the soup- -a few bites in, see a piece I assume is bread- -take a bite and it is chorizo!! For someone who cannot eat pork- -not a good thing! Barely get an apology- but bring a new bowl.  At the end of the meal the bill comes- -guess what - the soup is still on it! I demand it be taken off.  Again-- no manager- nothing!  The only redeeming quality about the place- - a very friendly and helpful bartender- Grace!  Thank you for trying to make my experience better!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem at the Cleveland Clinic. Forget about hospital food, this restaurant has a very diverse and interesting menu. From Oysters Rockefeller to Strip Steak Bernaise this restaurant was a very pleasant surprise. Very quiet and classy atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"I've never stepped foot into the Intercontinental Hotel, even though I've passed it hundreds of times from construction to completion. I knew the hotel had a restaurant, I just never knew anything about it.  My boss took us here for our department's holiday lunch. The four of us arrived almost exactly at noon and the place seemed barren. Our reservation seemed very unnecessary. We sat down at an U-shaped booth and were given bread and greeted by the waitress (who was also shilling the lunch special). She seemed knowledgable about the wines and the food. The lunch special looked great, but we all passed.  I originally wanted the muscle and saffron chowder, but it wasn't available. Boo. Instead I went with the sweet potato curry soup. It was heavier on the curry flavor than it was on the sweet potato, with a hint of spice at the end. Very good. For the entree I chose the Bangkok Caesar Salad with Salmon. The waitress brought it out and put it on the table and it had chicken on it instead. Before I could say anything, the manager immediately came over and picked it up and apologized because he knew I ordered the salmon. Within minutes a correct plate was brought to the table.  My salmon was a little overdone on the bottom and I'm not sure what made the salad 'Bangkok.' There was no spice or anything special in the salad besides a few rice noodles on top. Regardless, it was very filling and tasty.  During the course of our meal the place filled up quickly. I thought for sure the staff would try and get us to leave as soon as my coworkers finished dessert. Nope, we were never pressured to leave or free up the table. I really liked that.  I don't know if this place is accurately described as New American, since the menu (at least during lunch) is a world tour. The prices were very reasonable as well, but I'm used to insane upscale lunch costs in Chicago.  I would definitely come back here again with friends. It sounds like the happy hour is amazing so that will be high up on my to-do list."}
{"text":"Bribed chicken breast was excellent.  Husband said his hamburger was one of the best he has had....and he knows how to grill a delicious burger!   Unfortunately, bread came out nicely wrapped in a napkin but it wasn't warm and it was tough.  Don't waste the calories."}
{"text":"We had a lovely experience on a Saturday night.  Wine by the glass was enjoyed by both red and white drinkers at my table.  The walleye with risotto was fresh and perfectly cooked, the squash ravioli was awesome.  One minor complaint was rushed service.  Our appetizer was on the table for less than five minutes before the entrees appeared.  There is no great desert for chocolate lovers, but the apple cassoulet is very good.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice due to its proximity to Cleveland Clinic, and I unfortunately have to say I'm not a huge fan. We had a lunch meeting, and while they accommodated a request for a quiet table, service was so slow that one of our party had to leave before we even got our food over an hour after sitting down! We had to take his portion in a to-go bag.  I has the chicken BLT wrap in naan and gazpacho. The gazpacho was fresh and tasty with little chunks of goat cheese. Unfortunately, the wrap was not exciting. Barely warm, and the chicken was dry. I detected none of the pesto allegedly on it.   While I have been to Cowell and Hubbard and loved it, I probably would not return to Table 45 if it was not located where it is.  I have been there for happy hour, and drinks are fine, but I recall being unimpressed with the sushi rolls and dinner entrees, as well."}
{"text":"Mediocre food: grilled watermelon salad with watermelon that was not grilled and was drenched in balsamic vinegar and a risotto dish that has nothing to do with real risotto. Awful service, not just slow, but incapable. One has to ask for everything: a wine menu, salt and pepper,  a bread plate!  Jack Bruell should take his time and sit down in this place to experience how despicable his restaurant is."}
{"text":"On Christmas day my wife, her mother and I dined at Table 45. Frankly, I was NOT looking forward to it because we'd dined there before, and this emperor had no clothes. NONE.   However, while Cleveland does not lack excellent restaurants, try finding one open on Christmas--which, by the way--I appreciate as I wouldn't want to work that day, either.   So, color us amazed that everything--and I mean everything--was excellent.     The menu is not boring by any stretch but for some reason I ordered their strip steak special.  As I almost never order steak and there were plenty of other interesting items from which to choose, I plead guilty to succumbing to 'can't-make-up-my-mind-so-threw-a-dart' disease. My MIL ordered it as well but did so intentionally.  Forgot what Wifey ordered and she's not around to ask so, SHHHHHH, please don't tell her I forgot.   I DO know, however, she loved whatever it was (oh, she DID get the shrimp in puff pastry appetizer which was awesome. Hey, we shared). And our steaks? Wow, they were just outstanding. Each was cooked exactly as requested. Side items were also perfection on a plate. Desert, ditto.  Service was very solid as well. The decor IS a tad on the cool side; kinda neat for a Saturday night but less so for Christmas dinner.   In a nutshell, we would have given our first visit a one but this one a five, so I averaged them out. The xmas experience absolutely made me want to go back, and we will."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with some friends a few days ago. We really enjoyed the food and drinks (the happy hour prices were great for such great quality food!). Where the restaurant stumbled was in the service. Our server was inattentive and rude to us during happy hour, forcing us to flag him down three separate times for our drink and food orders during happy hour, and then completely disappearing once happy hour was over without asking us if we wanted our bill. After waiting a good half an hour, we flagged down another server and asked for our bills. When he brought it over, we found that our server had charged us full price for the items, rather than happy hour price. The second server fixed this for us, but by that time, we'd been done with our food and drinks for over 45 minutes. While I'd like to return at some point, I'm reluctant to recommend it, based on the quality of service."}
{"text":"The service was slow, and the food was subpar and inconsistent. Although some of what we ate was decent (the rolls are what I would order if I were forced to eat here again), the other half wasn't eaten.  Additionally, it took over 45 minutes for us to get our first course (edamame), and the waitress got our order wrong at three different instances, which resulted in additional wasted time."}
{"text":"I am only giving this review two stars because the wait staff was very friendly, albeit slow, but friendly.  When I see $$$ I like to think that the chef at least tries to serve $$$ food.  Not the case here.  Where to start...  Day 1 - the squash soup was bland and watery, with cumin and turmeric overpowering any sort of sweet creaminess that may have existed from the squash, paired with a lack of salt, the soup was an assault on my tastebuds.  The dish would have better been described on the menu as 'Curried Water.' Next up, the Pad Thai - the closest this came to Pad Thai was the naming of the dish on the menu.  The noodles, while cooked perfectly, could not compete against the over-sourness of the tamarind and the heavy-handed saltiness of the fish sauce and I found myself adding sugar to the dish to balance out what should have been a perfect umami!  The shrimp in the dish were so small I think it came from one of those 80-100 count frozen bags you get at Costco.  For the cost, there should have least been prawns (or at least 20-30 count bags).  Day 2 - Kept it light, sushi.  The roll was typical of what I could have picked up at the cafeteria in the Cleveland Clinic (actually, I think CC tasted better).  $9 for salmon sushi was actually a good deal because the fish was cut so thick I actually made 4 normal size bites - so a good value there.   I will say, GET THE EDAMAME!!!  It was the best thing I ate.    I only ate here twice because I was staying at the hotel.  Overall, save your money, grab an Uber, and check out one of the other hundreds of restaurants choices available to you in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went here because I was staying at this Hotel.  I was expecting a pricey somewhat average meal but was very pleased both times that I went.    The first time I ordered the mutlicourse special for $30 on a Thursday and the food was innovative, looked apetizing, and tasted great.  Second time I was trying to keep the cost down and just went with sushi, which was good and the service was excellent both times."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: I really think they missed on the \"modern\" feel. The bar area at least, resembles the boarding area of an airport. Maybe that's the look they were going for. I didn't like it at all and felt it gave a weird vibe. They did have another dining room which looked comfortable and cozy. We were sat in between the two in front of the sushi bar and kitchen area.  Is this place dressy or casual? I went thinking it was dressy --- it seemed half the patrons were dressy and half were casual. The wine offerings also confused me. They had bottles on their wine list that you could purchase at Giant Eagle. They have expanded their offerings at GE, so maybe this is not as weird as it sounds? I don' know.   We had a big group so I was lucky enough to try a few different things off the menu. Onto the food, AMAZING! Everything was great. We started out with the Naan which was accompanied by 3 delicious sauces: hummus, olive tapenade, and some sort of spicy  mayo-y sauce possibly. The naan was perfectly cooked and served warm. Of the three dipping sauces I preferred the spicy one and olive tapenade to the hummus.  We have the Table 45 roll which was delicious. Followed by the Arugula Salad --- with pine nuts!!! I love pine nuts so that was a great addition and the light citrus vinaigrette was a great balance to the bitter arugula.   Entree wise: I ordered the short ribs. WOW! They were packed with flavor and fell apart like butter. I didn't use a knife at all. The mixture of the squash and potatoes was pretty good. The short ribs were really really great and I'm salivating thinking about them. I also tried the duck. It was excellent - packed with flavor. Cooked to perfection. It was my dad's entree and he enjoyed it more than the duck he ordered from Lola last weekend.   Needless to say, food was delicious and we will definitely be back! If only their \"look\" matched the quality of the food ...."}
{"text":"One thing before I talk about food for this restaurant... the service sucks. It was ridiculously slow. I had to wait 10 minutes just to get seated, just to wait another 10 minutes for someone to come and get my order. Then I waited another 20 minutes for food, and then another 10 minutes for someone to notice I needed to get my bill paid. So, service was horrible.  In terms of the food, it was pretty good. I ordered a sashimi (which wasn't that great), but the main entree made up for it. I ordered the trout per recommendation of the waiter. mm. It came complete- head, bones, everything. Me, being the eater I am, ate the whole thing. It also came with asparagus and other veggies. Although I wish it had been less salty and a tad less oily, it was a pretty good overall fish.  So, if you do decide to go here, go in an off hour (although I went at 8pm) and get the fish. It was super convenient as it's in the Cleveland Clinic's International Continental... but I definitely despised the wait."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in such a great location - CCF but their food is surprisingly disappointing. Maybe I just had too high of an expectation for it. My boyfriend and I ordered oysters as appetizer - it was fresh, which is important! The cocktail sauce was pretty good, not the kind that you can buy in a bottle from a super market. The entrees were very mediocre. I guess they were trying to do some asian fusion but I am an asian and I was really not impressed by their fusion, sadly. Oh yes they participate in cleveland restaurant week, so you can go during that time, but the menu for restaurant week might be even worse."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great service.  Bartenders who know how to make great cocktails and there is an amazing chefs table actually In the kitchen. Located in the InterContinental hotel so parking is also very easy and safe."}
{"text":"We headed out for happy hour and sushi at Table 45 before the orchestra concert tonight and it turned out to be a fantastic pre-symphony dinner! When we arrived around 5:45 p.m., the bar was PACKED, so no chance of getting the happy hour food (happy hour only goes until 6), but we got happy hour drinks and waited for a table.  Happy hour drink specials were great!  They had three cocktails for $5, Dortmunder for $3, and three wines for $5.  I opted for the happy hour Chardonnay, and my friend got the lemon drop, a vodka/lemon elixir.  Our waiter was friendly; however he pressured us into ordering more sushi than we had planned.   BUT it turned out that he was spot on with his recommendations, so we didn't mind in the end.  We ordered the InterContinental Roll (Lobster and Avocado inside topped with Mango, Eel, and two types of fish roe) and the Lora roll (Shrimp Tempura, Mayo, Spicy Sauce, Mango, and Lettuce inside Soy Bean Paper), and both were outstanding.   (Our waiter confided in us that his favorites were those two and the Table 45 Roll (Tempura Shrimp, Tuna, Cucumber, Mayo, Scallions, Spicy Sauce, and Red Tip Clams)).  We were still a little hungry after those so we ordered the salmon roll as a snack, and that was great, too!  Their dessert menu looked nice, but we were full so skipped it.  According to the waiter, the ice creams, gelatos, and sorbets are all made in-house so we'll try that the next time!  Overall, a cozy and surprisingly bustling restaurant with a huge menu and excellent service.  One more plus: free valet parking!"}
{"text":"In a hotel connected to Cleveland Clinic. Its a nice fancy little spot. Dim lighting. Service was great. I ordered Unagi and shrimp tempura roll. Had edamame for appetizer. Honestly, sushi here is not great. Ive had some amazing shrimp tempura elsewhere and this place doesn't compare. Unagi had a weird texture and again wasn't that good. They have other stuff besides sushi so I would recommend getting other stuff. Save the sushi for a better spot."}
{"text":"Food was not good for the price. The \"warm\" cookie served with the ice cream came out harder than a brick. Not impressed at all! Gave an extra star cause our waiter was really nice."}
{"text":"The appetizers were the highlight of the experience. The Moroccan Kafta Meatballs made of lamb and beef were my favorite. They were very tiny and there were only four of them, but they were served in a chilled sauce and with a side of naan and tomato and olive salsa ($14.00). Great appetizer, but definitely not large enough for more than two people to share.   The other appetizer I had was The Table 45 Cleveland Pierogi. This was served with 2 perigees piled high with caramelized onions and set on a bed of sour cream. The dough of the perigees was interesting - thick dough. These definitely are not Polish pierogis, and the cheddar flavor was not really noticeable, but they were good.  I tried the Grilled Peach Salad. It contained goat cheese, pecans, and spiced balsamic vinegar. For $12 it was very small. There were three wedges of peach provided with the dish. The wedges were set off to the side and were not in edible sized pieces or incorporated into the salad in any way. I had to cut them up and ended up eating them separately. The dressing flavor was good, but the salad was badly mixed. The goat cheese was clumped off to the side and the large pecans off to another side. This was more of a deconstructed salad whether that was the intention or not.   I ordered the Deconstructed Puerto Rican Skirt Steak Burrito for my main. I love Table 45 for it's \"world\" dishes; I usually find them so creative. This dish however, the flavor was not bad - but it did not wow me. There was no overwhelming spice or heat and my steak was cooked to the temperature I ordered it (medium well) but it was uncomfortably, oddly soft. The dish came with some pita so you could make your own burrito if you wanted to, but I chose to just eat the meal sans wrap. That's the point of deconstructed anyways isn't it? I suppose the steak pushed the price of this entree up to $24, but really it seemed to me like a basic lunch entree, not dinner.   Our server was blah. There was no energy or excitement or enthusiasm. The only time she really opened up to us was when she said she tasted the blueberry sorbet that came in that day and that she thought it was really good. Even as she said it was really good though she didn't sound like she believed it. (And after I tasted it I didn't believe it either).   You get bread with oil and balsamic vinegar to start the meal. In the past the server would pour oil into a small plate on the table. Now they put oil and vinegar bottles on the table and let you pour it yourself. I don't mind this as it prevents wasting the oil and vinegar if you don't really want it but touching the caps and getting all greasy fingered is not ideal so this process still needs to be reworked. It's also pretty funny for people who used to come here all the time. The same oil plates they used when they poured it for you are still on the table when you are seated.   Valet parking now costs three dollars where previously it was free. There is no sign indicating this upon arrival - it is stamped on the ticket they give you and the valet doesn't mention it.  I hadn't been here for awhile because the kitchen messed up the last time I was here. After trying it again I think for now I'll stick to this place for drinks and appetizers and enjoy mains at the other Zack Bruell places which have recently been much better."}
{"text":"This place is classy with a wide variety of food choices. I came to Cleveland for a work conference and stayed at the InterContinental. The service and atmosphere at the restaurant was great.   My coworker and I ordered a dragon roll sushi and each got an Argentinian steak. The sushi was delicious and had just the right amount of avocado in it.  My steak was cooked to a medium and was quite tender. I will try getting it a medium rare to have a better taste of the juices and meatiness of the beef. They also included bone marrow with the dish which I didn't particularly like because it was very fatty.   There was a corn dish on the side and it was sweet with a dash of healthiness.   We came back later the next night for drinks and watched the game on one of its TVs. The bar is pretty live at night, mostly from travellers and people visiting the area.   I would definitely recommend staying here and checking this resto out!"}
{"text":"I have to qualify my rating with the preface that this restaurant is in the Cleveland Intercontinental Hotel connected to the Cleveland Clinic. While staying there for a family members surgery, I got to know the area eateries pretty well. Restaurant 45 was the best around (in & near the complex). They have sushi, steak, salads, and fish. The food was really good. I only had one item I didn't care for. The guacamole roll had promise, but the seeds were not removed from the jalapeños. The rolls were way too spicy to eat (I love jalapeños too). When I asked waitstaff to remove it, because it was inedible, she said,\"well I told you it was spicy\" and was not concerned about the quality of the roll. However, I ate there 4 more times,because I was at the hotel/hospital for 9 days, and had an enjoyable experience and VERY good service. Also of note, some serious VIPs come to the Cleveland clinic and stay at the hotel before their surgery. You may see foreign consulate members with body guards, or even recognize someone famous."}
{"text":"This is a disappointment! I had steak. The worst steak I have ever had! Worse than steak in a chain! The hanger steak was awful. I couldn't even chew this piece of meat. The carrot purée was not good at all either. They have a mediocre sushi. And that is about it. I wouldn't go there if it was not in the clinic and the rest of the group wanted to go somewhere close to work. Not a fan at all!!!!"}
{"text":"The Easter brunch buffet was honestly laughable. Everything was over cooked. The prime rib was dry. Will never return."}
{"text":"So, I've been here a few times by default, since its located so close to work. The food is actually decent and the drink specials are good. A few weeks ago I had a wrap with egg, bacon, and grilled chicken that was excellent. The service is a little shaky though. They're slow... and not that organized for such an upscale attempt at dining. In fact, I once had a waiter ask me to pass the drink to my co-worker dining next to me. Hmph. I'm not incapable of doing so... its just.... really?!   There are definitely better upscale options in CLE that far surpass Table 45. However, if you're stopping for a quick drink during happy hour, then have at it."}
{"text":"While the food at Table 45 was satisfactory, the service was abysmal.  Having explicitly order a salad as a starter and a small plate as my main course, our server brought the small plate as the starter.  It then took a long time to fire the salad and the new small plate took much longer than my dinner companions' entrees.  The server having made a big deal about taking orders consecutively did not result in her colleagues knowing which dishes went where.  In terms of the food its-self, Table 45 has a nice selection of local craft beers on draft.  My Korean short ribs were well grilled but excessively sauced."}
{"text":"I work at Cleveland Clinic and it's amazing to have a place within main campus to literally walk over to right after work for a drink or a bite to eat with your coworkers. And, if it hadn't been for the horrendous service we received when we went for happy hour last week, I would be just as excited to return! Not so much, anymore.  The reason for the 2 stars is that the food was still decent and the convenience to work or people visiting the clinic. For food, I ORDERED the tandoori naan shared plate and what I received was a dollop of hummus and naan. I figured I misunderstood what the description meant (but thought I was supposed to get two additional dips). After seeing my receipt, I realized our server had decided to order me the happy hour naan (just hummus). Don't get me wrong, the hummus and naan were delicious, I just didn't order it - and since I didn't get what I ordered, I was still hungry - so got the truffle fries, which were also delicious. Other items ordered by people in our party included various sushi rolls, calamari, and the kafta meatballs. Everyone enjoyed their food.  Service was immensely lacking. It wasn't busy by any means; the bar area was full of people there for happy hour, but that was it. The rest of the restaurant was empty. Our server, Chawki, was barely able to keep up with his job. We saw him once when he dropped off menus and we had to flag him down to take our orders. It was a long wait before we received our drinks and even longer before we received our food. One girl in our party arrived late and since he never came back to see how we were doing, we finally had to flag him down so she could order off of the happy hour menu; at which point, he kept saying she had one minute before the system locked happy hour out.... thanks? that's why we flagged you down. He never returned for second drink orders and when another coworker said something about that, he did bring a free glass of wine for her, but the service never improved. At the end, two of us remained and we didn't see him for 10-15 mins after the last plate was picked up. We weren't sure if everything else was on the house?? But, we finally flagged down one of the other servers who said our server was on break, and he brought us our check.   We will drive somewhere off main campus for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"This place was just not what I though it was going to be. My friend and I went thinking it would be a little more trendy and we honestly were the youngest people there by far, not that it really matters. The food was only so so my friend and I agreed that it was something we could have made ourselves, and it probably would have tasted better. The drinks tasted like there was zero alcohol in them as well."}
