{"text":"All the juces i tried is just delish. Tried sweetie pie, dos leches, kitchen greens, and karrot top, im doing day 1 of 3 day cleanse.  So far I'm doing great.  I will be a regular to this one for sure."}
{"text":"Yep!!! We are back again. Can't get enough. Love the #15 Coco Crack!!  The granola used in Acaì Bowls is the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is some of the best customer service I've ever received. From the moment I walked in to the moment I left I was taken care of. Our \"barista\" gave us samples of anything we wanted to try along with recommendations of what we should try. I ended up getting the Holy Shot which was extremely good and EXTREMELY gingery (as it does note on the menu) as well as the Green Milk which I opted to turn into a smoothie. I'm impressed by the freshness and overall cleanliness of this juice bar however $17 for a smoothie is to me, extremely pricey (holy shot was free with yelp check in - saved me an additional $5)."}
{"text":"I am officially in LOVE!!! Raw Organic and Delicious! I just had a Raw Latte-Cold Pressed Coffee with the Dos Leches Nut Milk. It was AMAZING! They even have juice flights! I am definitely impressed. Plus they have free WiFi :)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic ,great juices and the staff is amazing Velarie and Iris sat with us and gave us tips and advice on what juices to combine for our cleanse, highly recommended if you like juic"}
{"text":"I'm always lazy to write reviews..but this place just made my day.. So I must share my experience that I had here. I've been wanting to try this pressed juice place for awhile now! I came in today half an hour before they closed just to pick up a juice for lunch tomorrow. When my friend & I walked in there were 3 workers there and they were all very welcoming and friendly. I knew they were closing soon so I wanted to make it quick.. Since it was our first time there they asked us if we had time to sample their juices and nut milks! We sampled all 20 & I loved all of them except 2 that had cilantro. (Not a fan of cilantro so that's just me) they also explained the ingredients in each drink that benefit you.. I've tried most of the pressed juice places in Vegas & this one is by far my favorite! I purchased the green milk, Karrot top, coco crush, coco crack, and the kitchen sink. Love that they come in a glass container & their prices range from $8.95-$10.95 they have happy hour 2 hours before they close 10% off your purchase. & they will give you a stamp card buy 10 get 1 free. This will definitely be my go to place now! Going to try their acai bowl next time. Thank you for your awesome service & giving my friend & I such a fun experience. :)"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times now and it seems their products as well as the service gets a little worse each time. I do like their juices, acai bowls and chia seed pudding. BUT the juices they give me have a day expiration date when I know for a fact they have juices in the fridge with a longer expiration. If you are planning on drinking the juice right away ask for juices that expire same day for a huge discount!"}
{"text":"All I've tried from here was the Dos Leches nut milk, and it was enough for me to write a 5 star review. Holy yesssss!!!!! So good."}
{"text":"Came in today for my first time and had an amazing time! Who knew a juice bar could be so good and fun. The two workers (a taller young man and blonde girl) had great customer service! It was very busy and they seemed to greet everyone and get everyone taken care. #11 and #6 were my favorites!! Highly recommend!! love how they have a rewards program and even happy hour"}
{"text":"Love this place. The kitchen sink is my favorite. Also, love that they use glass bottles and not plastic!! If you have never been here, go check it out and do a juice tasting!!"}
{"text":"They had a lot of great options and actually let us try every single one. Jennifer was wonderful in informing us about all their products. It has a very modern vibe to the place. It's a great place to lounge and hang out."}
{"text":"I went to Pressed for Juice for a 2 day juice cleanse.  My experience was absolutely fantastic.  Before I purchased the cleanse, the staff strongly recommended that I sit down and sample every juice on the menu.  From there, they helped me hand pick my favorite juices to form a cleanse that best matched my taste.  From a customer experience, this was light years ahead of any juicery that I have ever been to.  Their cleanse is also $10 cheaper per day that some of the local competition.  Just an awesome place.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for me to stop and get my smoothie fix when I'm out working in that area.  Friendly, patient staff that doesn't rush me to make my order, as they have a lot of options that allow for me to try something new.  I can't complain about being able to sample before I buy, so that I know I'll enjoy what I pay for.  Good work, keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pressed For Juice numerous times, most recently for the last time.  I've done the 3-day cleanse and convinced several friends and family members to try as well.  I'll no longer recommend PFJ to anyone.  While I do love the quality of the juices, the price and service are heavy detractors that far outweigh the taste.  The knowledge of the staff is inconsistent (it depends on who is working that day) and It's clear the owner is not receptive to feedback, improvements, or interested in sustaining a a loyal customer base.  On several occasions they have been out of certain juices or \"shots\" when I had gone out of my way to stop by and grab something before work.  When I mentioned it, or the inconsistent service (thinking the owners of a new business would want to hear that stuff) - the response was apathetic at best.  It seems they only want to hear how well their doing and how delicious their Coco Crack juice is - not where they can improve or better serve their loyal patrons. As a long-time supporter/blogger, etc...and friend of local LV businesses, and as a leader in the customer service industry, I'm not sure how this place can survive when there are other healthy, delicious pressed juice options in town (like Pressed Juicery) that are better priced and have spot-on service with caring/responsive owners.  My guess is...they won't."}
{"text":"After every cancer treatment I have to get a juice flight because it quenches my thirst and it gives me all the nutrients that I need.  I love all the blends because they are all tasty and creative.  Even though I live far, I will keep coming here until they open new location, I have tried other juice places and there is no comparison to the quality and service provided here!"}
{"text":"New addiction... Acai green bowl, so yum. Satisfies every craving... Veggies, fruit, sweet, crunch, nutrition packed! Gonna try the couscous next."}
{"text":"What an amazing juicery! Chris was amazing. Helped me find the perfect cleanse and offered samples of everything. Yum!"}
{"text":"I loooove this place. It's pricey but the taste is spot on. I've been spoiled by going here first and then trying others. Highly recommend their Açaí bowls as well as their chia pudding. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place as a plant based eater it's one of my favorite places.  I stop every time I'm close and grab a few to get me through the week.  My faves are Beet Junkie (I'm a runner so beets are an essential to recovery), Green Milk, and Coco Crack are just all so yummy.  I have yet to try the Acai bowl but plan to the next stop I make.  The staff is super helpful and knowledgeable and always eager to answer any question you have or set you up to try samples.  They always have awesome suggestions on what to try."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The man who helped me was so pleasant and accommodating. Juice was delicious. This is my new go to place!"}
{"text":"Impressed, I must say. My experience here is always welcoming, the staff are friendly. Didn't know what I wanted the first time I visited and staff gave me a sample of all the juices I was interested in. Also gave me knowledge of what juice is good for. Juices are fresh and tastes delicious!  Never fails me, always consistent. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"1/4/17 about 5:45 pm I was just in there. Ordered the PB&A acai bowl. Had coconut substituted in for the hemp granola. AMAZING. I can tell the kindness and passion that was put in to making this little bowl of fuel for me. I can TASTE it. Thank you for the beauty of this goodness I just put in my belly. So delicious. So good for me too. THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and service!! I come in about twice a week and they consistently provide friendly service and fresh products. The menu is just right, not too much yet very creative. The Acai Bowls are highly addictive so watch out!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now, 3 were all within a 24 hr period, and every visit has been no less than perfect. On my first visit, Iris was behind the counter and she gave me an amazing experience, letting me try every juice I was interested in and showing me some she thought I might like based on my description. It's literally a juice \"bar\", you walk in and can sit on a high top at a bar countertop and sample all of the juices on the menu in a cool little shot glass, awesome concept. I ended up getting the O-M-Ginger and The Kitchen Sink.  O-M-Ginger: when they say \"extra ginger\", they're not kidding. This one has extra ginger, fresh squeezed lemon, and apple. Very very strong but cleaned me out and made me get over the sickness I felt coming on better than any medicine would have.  The kitchen sink: I really really enjoyed this one. Had several different vegetables along with some fruit but this one was awesome. Definitely felt it boost my immune system also.  On my most recent visit, I also checked in on Facebook and posted a picture which earned me a complimentary shot. I got the \"holy shot\" which had cayenne pepper, lemon, ginger, and apple cider vinegar. Oh my god intense. Was harder to take down than I thought but my allergies and sore throat were gone so quick!   All in all, it's definitely on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. These are real ingredients and real good for you so I think it's worth it. Plus every person I've met that works here is so personable and delivers outstanding customer service. If you're looking to try new flavors or save a couple bucks, they offer 10% off during Happy Hour which is the last 2 hours before closing! Also 50% off the juices that are expiring the next day, but great deal if you're going to drink that day!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff; more importantly delicious juices! #18 Dos Leches is my favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing staff!!!!  Which can only be out done by the juice.......plus it's local and organic"}
{"text":"Just tried to do a 3-day cleanse to detox. Unfortunately, after the first bottle on day 2, I got so nauseous and couldn't handle it anymore. No complaints about the juicery though. Staff was friendly and helpful. Juices were fresh and delicious with a 5-day shelf life. Premises was clean and spacious. Prices were competitive with a 10% happy hour discount available. I would recommend this place to anyone that is accustomed to juicing. Although I didn't quite finish my detox, I did lose my cravings for my daily favorite drink at Starbucks. So it was all worth it. Thank you Pressed For Juice. :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I tried their Kitchen Sink juice, but it gave me a migraine within 30 minutes of drinking it. I am a fairly healthy vegetarian, and consume greens on a daily basis. I don't know what happened... ;("}
{"text":"First; let me start off by saying their juices are pretty good.  The Bad;  i've been going there for a while and I'm OK paying $20 for a protein shake but now they stopped giving you the extra. My shake is a little big after you add the protein and stuff and they always gave me the little shot glass of the extra on the side the last three times I've been there they haven't been doing that it's pretty annoying when you pay $20 + tip for a shake and they save what you paid for already for themselves later.  Reduced to one star for the crappy response by the business owner and not  even apologizing for a poor experience at their establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today and I was amazed by the quality of service and products provided. Juices are fresh and taste awesome, acai bowl was no different, and staff was super nice and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm not a juice guy but my family and I were on way to Red Rock Canyon for a hike and wanted something light.   This place was prefect. First, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. There are 20 different types of juices and the girl who helped us was more than willing to let us try every single one of them if we wanted to.   I got #11 Sweet Greens and the juice was great. Tasted so fresh and delicious. I will comeback and try #8 Beet Juice which I had a sample of and it was pretty delicious too."}
{"text":"This stuff is my crack.  I've been dodging my allergies & cold the past few days. The first signs of my allergies I drank a bottle of Local Hottie and Sweet Greens and my runny nose diminished within a two hours. With the type of work I do I'm susceptible to getting sick.  As a night shift respiratory therapist, I have to constantly maintain a healthy diet, but sometimes my schedule is so hectic I don't have time to grab groceries and prep meals. These juices help when I need a quick fix meal & I'm on the go.  I'm hooked.  I love almost all the flavors, especially Green Milk."}
{"text":"Any juice place that gives samples of any and all of their juices is legit. The nut milks are delicious here. I like that they had a straight ginger shot. It was potent, but that's why we love it. I recommend the Pina Colada smoothie. It was a great combination of tart and sweet."}
{"text":"This is my favorite juice spot! I don't visit as often as I would like only because prices are a little steep. My favorite drink has to be Coco Crack; it's so refreshing. I've also tried the chia seed pudding and the Brazilian bowl, both are very delicious. I usually visit in the morning and the two men who service the juicery are always helpful. According to other reviews, you get a 10% discount if you come two hours before closing. I need to start taking advantage of that so I don't feel guilty spending $12 on a drink."}
{"text":"I finally decided to give this place a second chance and once again I'm really DISAPPOINTED! I was in the area pet sitting and was craving a salad & juice then remembered this place was down the street so I said you know what why not splurge and see if they've improved since the last time I was in.  Both the associates were friendly but one of them complained when I ordered a \"Vegan Cesar Salad\" which when I read the menu online just sounded delicious and I was willing to pay the big bucks for a freshly made salad with as I read their menu online states \"ROMAINE, AVOCADO, VEGAN PARMESAN, CASHEW CREAM, LEMON, BLACK PEPPER, SEA SALT, GARLIC, PUMPKIN SEEDS.\" Sounds delicious right? Well apparently this associate had already \"made it for himself to have for lunch\" and asked me if I was sure if I \"really wanted it\" so I said \"yes, I want the vegan salad, it sounds delicious and then I want a great juice to go with it as I haven't been feeling well lately and I'm just trying to be more health conscious.\"  That's when both associates were really nice and let me try maybe 5-8 different juices and mylks which for that I will give them credit for and I did leave them a tip for the time they spent helping me pick one out. Finally they sold me on the #4 but...when I got to my destination I open up the salad to find only romaine, avocado, cashew cream and vegan parmesan. Where was the lemon, pepper, sea salt, garlic and pumpkin seeds? And it made me think...if this salad was for you, why didn't you just make me a new one or say \"I'm sorry we are all out\". The fact that you gave me \"your salad\" and it was missing items from the menu is just odd....very odd for a $10 salad.   I will absolutely come back for the delicious juice and mylks when I skip my Suja's but seriously, DO NOT bother coming here for \"food\". Please remember this is not a restaurant and don't make the mistake I have. Juice and Mylk only!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the customer service. Omg some of the best I have had in Vegas. We usually go to juice standard but they were closed today. Lucky us we went here it's right up the street and they let us sample everything we wanted. We ended up getting a few smoothies cookies and the 6 juice combo it is pricey but real organic juice isn't cheap. I will gladly drive the extra 10 minutes to go here from now on"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and I was supeR impressed. Friendly service from the moment I walked through the door,  the sampling was awesome,  the girl was so nice and helpful with great knowledge of tastes and ingredients. I ended up buying the \"Sweet Greens\" and oh my goodness..... it was deLish!! I will definitely be back soon,  and it won't be long before I fill my \"Drink Up\" card"}
{"text":"The smoothies are great however they are ridiculously priced. I don't think they are worth $10++ for a tiny cup.. I went here after the gym and I was kind of annoyed at how high everything was priced. I ended paying $13 for a tiny peanut butter smoothie. Never again. Also customer service was ok. Girls were friendly but didn't seem well versed on the menu"}
{"text":"SO. EXPENSIVE! My carrot cake smoothie was tasty, but not worth the $12 it cost after I left a tip. I cannot see any reason to return."}
{"text":"Great place to get cold pressed juices, interact with fun and friendly staff. Also, love the names for the juices! The Local Hottie is my favorite! They have a loyalty program that awards you 1 free juice after 10 purchases so it helps a little of you have a juice addiction! :)"}
{"text":"Love love this place, drinks, and staff. The staff is so helpful. The juices are delicious. My favorite was beet junkie, threesome, green milk, o-m-ginger, etc I can go on lol. I wold go weekly and stock up about 7-10 juices mainly for a quick breakfast or lunch at work. And I lost a good 13 pounds in 2 weeks without exercise. Wish there was one in dc"}
{"text":"I love their juice! Best in vegas by far. I believe in juicing and have been to many juice bars. The owners of this bar take a lot of pride in being the best. Just stop by sometime and let them tell you how they buy and prep their veggies. And also their fair priced. It's same cost as buying from whole foods but at least ten times better. Keep up the good work fellas!"}
{"text":"I love the modern design inside and very welcoming once you enter in the door, no need to feel intimidated walking in here. I've bought 8 juices from here, so my stamp card says. Yes, 8 juices in about 3 weeks since I first started coming here. My first time, I was given a sample of every single juice on their menu. Wow, what a nice welcome! Forget feeling guilty asking for more samples, I was happily surprised I could try every single one without feeling bad. Thank you for doing this for your customers. It works, I was hooked right away.   So far, my favorites are #2 Gin and Juice, #3 Nojito, #6 Kitchen Sink, #10 OMGinger. I am happy with the change in the recipe, please keep it. I did not like the original O-M-Ginger that I tried. But I like the new one! #11 Sweet Greens, #12 Snoop Dog, #15 Coco Crack (lloooooooveeee), #16 Green Party. #18, 19, and 20 are nut milks and are delicious! They do have added maple syrup which I was disappointed to see. I think the juice would be great without it. I no longer will buy those since they have added sugar. The owner told me the sugar in it is minimal, but I just think why add sugar to something that is supposed to be healthy. Unfortunately, I have it in my head that I am drinking sugar and can't get over it. I really love those drinks and wish they would stop adding that maple syrup to it and I will gladly buy it again. So if you are watching your sugar, beware of the added maple syrup. Thank you to the owner for standing by your products and allowing me to do a return. I really appreciate you backing up your juice and treating customers well. Please consider removing the maple syrup and I will be the first to come try it and give you my honest opinion of the taste.   I like their packaging, simple way of identifying drinks with a number system #1, 2, 3, etc. I like the glass bottles they come in, easy to drink out of. I like their happy hour specials 10% off during the last 2 hours of the day (but beware that they run out of the most popular juices by then often times), great customer service.   If I could afford it, I would be here daily."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for Acai bowl!   I'll get the Swole Bowl twice a week \"Yah You\"!!! (\"hint\" almond butter)  And there juices is on point and priced right in my opinion.    Staff is also on point too!!    Point system to get a free juice is awesome too!  \"Bong-Appetite\""}
{"text":"I got the Green Milk for myself and the Threesome for my child. Both are really good and sweet drinks. I don't believe I've had juice this tasty before. Shopping Center kind of tucked away just north of Southern Hills Hospital. I live across town but I just might have to make the occasional stop in."}
{"text":"5 star all the way. Great selection of juice & great combination and use of veggies / fruits. Super friendly &  very well put together & decorated inside & wonderful service & presentation."}
{"text":"Juices are great and açaí bowls are delicious - well done. The best place in Vegas! There are a lot of juice places in town, but not all are organic and most are bland. Pressed for Juice is my new to go juice bar."}
{"text":"Been here twice this week already. Love the \"amateur\" cleanse. My favorite two juices so far are The Local Hottie and Bloody Beetroots. Both have a great kick.  The 1 day cleanse left me feeling great. It was the first juice cleanse I've ever done, and I felt like I got a fresh start when it was over.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came in not knowing what to expect.  :) I mean how many juice bars can a person goto right? Lol  I was greeted right away and when I told them that I had never been here before and that I knew nothing about cold pressed juices.... He told me that I could have a sit at the bar and he would let me try some. So I said sure!! :)  I sat and he basically gave me a tasting of all their juices. He stated of with the Greens and went until he finished with all the nut milks.... Service (5/5)  Now I can say that I've tried every single juice that they make. They were all amazing!!  Some of them were not my favs... But they were all decent and well balanced.... And some were surprisingly delicious!! And if u know someone that is not into healthy drinks... Bring them here... They can try some of the juices and they'll never know it's healthy for them! Lol ;P flavor (5/5)  Ambiance (5/5)... It's very clean and bright here. The stools at the bar were very comfy as well. :)  Prices... That's the only thing that is not a 5 for me. They were kind of expensive as the juices range from 8.95 to 10.95 for a 16 fluid oz bottle.  And the acai bowls are about the same.   But having said that I have to say that the quality is top notch.  And I can tell they have alot of pride in what they offer. And they are very knowledgeable about what they offer.  If u are not sure... Ask and they can totally help you figure out what u want. :)  I'll be back for sure!!  :)"}
{"text":"Love it!  Kid friendly too! Was impressed when I came in for a dose of the Holy Shot when they asked if my daughter, Rylei, had any allergies.  They offered her a free shot of the Nutslide.  What thoughtfullness!  Rylei loved being able to enjoy a shot with her Mommy!   Staff always so nice and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a little out of the way so I don't get to come here as much I would like to. The only thing that sucks is they don't use al organic produce but they did mention they use from local farms. I love the concept of trying something and they give you a nice presentation that looks like a sake cup. I love the heathy quotes on the wall and the bright white atmosphere. They have no problem with you trying anything so don't feel bad. The Coco Crack is to die for and literally is like crack! You'll be craving it and have to come back! Every time I'm sick I come here to get my cure!   One of the workers, Skye, is great and very helpful!"}
{"text":"After living in CA, where you can throw a rock and hit a decent juicery, it's been difficult to find a place to frequent in Vegas. Each of the places I've tried in Vegas has had at least one major drawback (pricing, selection, service, etc)- until now. Pressed for Juice has it all and then some!  SERVICE: Go in and you'll be offered a juice tasting! Cute tiny cup, little pours of each flavor, the full attention of an employee, actual service! I was attended to by two different ladies, both of whom were genuinely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I've literally never had such great service at a juice place!  PRODUCT: With 20+ drinks to choose from, all with clever names (Gin & Juice, Soup Dog, Threesome, Sweetie Pie, etc), an ingredient list, and the purported benefits of the combined fruits and vegetables, there's something for everyone. Three or four different green juices with a range of sweetness, various spicy juices with cayenne and jalapeno, several fruity concoctions, and three different nut milks.  PRICING: Bottled, cold press, non-HPP juice will run you an average of $8-13/bottle in most major cities, Vegas is no exception. Prices here are in the average range but they have several ways to get discounts: Happy Hour is the last 2 hours of every day, and gets you 10% off your order; they run various promotions on FB and Instagram; and you can use a stamp card for a free drink with every 10 bottles purchased!   Pressed fulfills all of my requirements in a juice place- other than being far away from my house. Can't fault them for that one, though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! If you haven't tried pressed juice or haven't been to this place they will give you tastings so your more familiar. I love the kitchen sink and the green milk  green milk you can drink as a post work out. So delicious and filling so you can replace it for a meal!"}
{"text":"Great service every time I come here. Everything is raw, vegan and organic!  I love the juice called the Threesome (it's three fruits, hence the name). Or if you're feeling more for a milky type of drink, the Dos Leches is my absolute favorite - this drink is dairy free, animal product free. I would also highly recommend the Full Brazilian Bowl. It's an acai bowl that tastes like it was made from the gods. I would say it's in my top 3 acai bowls in Vegas.  If you're an early bird, this place opens at 6am!"}
{"text":"First time doing a juice cleanse and I actually feel great (down 3lbs after day 1)! For day 1, I bought the virgin cleanse. Then came back and got 2 more more days. I customized my 2 days and my favorite so far are sweet greens and dos leches! The Brazilian acai bowl is also delicious! I'm glad I gave this place a try."}
{"text":"Saw that they had happy hour 10% juices so I decided to bring my husband in here to get some juices. Skye was very helpful and let us try the entire menu. 20mins & $90 later we are happy customers.  Great service and yummy juices"}
{"text":"I love their different variety in juices! So refreshing and they taste amazing ! My favorite juice place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Whoo! New juice bar for \"South Summerlin\" definitely worth a visit. Lots of choices using cold pressed local fruits and veggies. Go now."}
{"text":"Another super option for cold pressed nutrient dense JUICES. First thing I noticed was how clean everything seemed. Super modern and simple decor and menu. Juice by numbers, I like that the menu was easy to read. My best experience with menu simplicity in any juice spot I've been to. They do free tastings and Sky behind the bar was awesome...very helpful and extremely knowledgeable staff. Fair priced all around and I noticed their shots are actually cheaper than some others in the market. I saw some juice options that were unique to this business and had not seen anywhere else. Great experience. My only regret is that your not in southern highlands. When will a healthy option come to SoHi ?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service - informative, helpful, fast. And delicious juice. A little pricy at $10 a pop but it is a great meal replacement. And they have a loyalty program. You can taste test any juice you want in a healthy bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the best juice in Vegas. Pre-bottled, tons of selections and delicious. Always a good choice to come over here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Step right up to try and taste what juice blends best suits u before you commit to buy. Staffs are knowledgeable and friendly about their stuffs. I tried \"green milk \" #20. Everything is made on site and fresh. Would recommend. Best tasting juice in LV."}
{"text":"Great place for people like me who are new to cold pressed juice. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and down to earth with the introduction of their recipes and what cold pressed juice is. I was able to sample their unique and cleverly named concoctions (there are 20 of them!!) My favorite so far is the Bloody Beetroots and I will be back for more. Very modern and clean facility where you can relax and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of excellent customer service & delicious product. There was a sweet bubbly girl at the front and 2 knowledgable employees (maybe owners?) helping and offering every answer to our questions. Not only was the staff so helpful, they let my friend and I try every single juice they offer. They were super friendly and had such positive energy. Their juices were so fresh and extremely delicious. I am normally not a huge juice fanatic but this place may have changed that for me. The #15 Coco Crack, #8 Beet Junkie, #17 Threesome, #3 Nojito were my favorite! Amazing selections and such a clean and modern environment. Everyone should try this place and see what it's about, they have something for everyone! I'll be returning for sure! :)"}
{"text":"The owner, Elle, reached out and apologize on behalf of her team. Instead of just brushing off my review, she reached out to me. For that, I've changed my review to 5 stars. Thanks Elle, I'll be stopping by shortly."}
{"text":"Have I entered the pearly white gates of  heaven? Or is this real life?! HOLY HANNAH! This place has my heart (and my belly) so full! Between the cute little emoji faces letting you know which juices are unavailable, the adorable tea cups they use when you do a full tasting of all their juices (complimentary I might add), and the heavenly combinations of fruits, spices and veggies that make up their concoctions...(one even has rose water! Say whhhaaaaaaa???) I am BEYOND imPRESSED! Lucky for them I work right around the corner and will not only be frequenting this place, but I will be giving taste tests myself to guests of the salon I work at so that they don't miss out on this healthy addiction!  I also love their approach to juice cleanse packages! They not only have different cleanses geared towards your level of expertise and taste buds, but they allow you the option to choose your favorites as well! I seriously can not say enough about this place! Not to mention they are open every day! This is a hairdressers dream and I couldn't be more excited to not only experience this place myself, but to tell the world about it! Thank you guys for being so amazingly friendly and down to earth! Congrats on your new business and may it flourish! :D  oh yeah and PS... They even have a stinking punch card! Ummmm...OKAY! ;p"}
{"text":"This place has the best Açai bowls! I have tried acai bowls at many different places and this is still my favorite for bowls. I always tend to get the PB&A because I love peanut butter. Their nut milks are also very delicious. My sister is obsessed with the purple rain smoothie. They even have vegan desserts and of course a wide selection of cold pressed juices. I did come here once however, and I was pretty annoyed because I wanted to make some substitutions to my acai bowl and she charged me about $1 for every substitution I wanted. So if you want a customized bowl (not adding extras because of course I would charge you too) then you will end up with a $13 small bowl lol. The staff is pretty friendly most of the time."}
{"text":"Best acai bowl.   Best juice selection.   Best presentation of menu.   Best juice bottles.   Intelligent business owners who are meticulous about their health and the health of their customers."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful juice bar. It is by far the best one in Las Vegas. I moved here from Los Angeles and this place beats anything I have tried in southern california too!  First off, Portia was so welcoming when we came in. She offered various samples and told us the health benefits. The juice was sooo good...my favorite being the Green Milk. My daughter, who his a big time juicer and very picky, said it was the best juice ever. They are also very creative , offering a \"flight\" of juices, avai granola and fruit, and the most wonderful \"Cleanse\" packages at the best prices we have seen. The decor is modern, clean and spacious, with a long bar counter. We are planning to be regular patrons. I definitely recommend going here...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars because they really do have exceptional items here. They make hands down the best acai bowls in the entire city.  Just wish they're customer service was better. It is definitely a snooty environment..... but idc, I will forever come back for the swole bowl."}
{"text":"Nice to have a juice place close to the office! Love the feel. Sat down was able to taste a ton of different juices u tim I found the one I really liked. I am extremely pleased with the customer service as well as with the lovey suggestions on which juice to buy after a hangover.  Heroes indeed."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff. You can sample the juices and milks. I recently did a juice cleanse and wanted to maintain a milk for dinner. I tried other places which were all ok but all the milks here are very tasty. I recently had the #20- Green Milk and I'm satisfied. It's my night time dessert"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for an after school treat. Very nicely decorated. I love how if they're out of a certain juice, the sign flips over and there's an emoji on the back.   I got the Green Valley (a bunch of green stuff) and my 2-year-old the Nojito. The girl at the counter was super sweet and made sure my daughter tried the flavor before purchasing. The samples come in little Japanese tea cups, so my daughter wanted to have a little tea party.   My juice was very green tasting, and fresh (obviously). The Nojito was so good!   The employees seem passionate about the place and who doesn't love fresh, organic juice?  I can't wait to try one of the nut milks next time. I might even do a cleanse soon."}
{"text":"They let you sample before you buy your drink! Great customer service, worth every penny."}
{"text":"They are definitely on to something with the samples! I had my two year old with me and they even poured her some samples. Very patient and informative. I will be returning even though it's a 20 min drive. They did mention something about opening a location in Henderson, which would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Great flavor combinations & love the fact that they have nutritional info on every bottle. My favorites are the #1 green valley & #8 beet junkie. Only reasons they don't get 5 stars from me is that they don't recycle their glass bottles (at least last time I checked) & they aren't 100% organic, but their prices and some advertising lead you to believe it is."}
{"text":"I've the 3 sets of cleanse: virgin, amateur and pro. So far, the best juicing i experienced for 3 days. Their juices makes me crave for more juice than food. I will definitely buy my stuff here again."}
{"text":"Best Acai Bowls I have tasted so far. I've had many in many different places and I keep coming back time after time for their Swole Bowl. It's so good guys I can't express myself enough. The Best!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't had Pressed For Juice before until coming here and I completely fell in love!  They let us sample every juice which I was thankful for as well as let us know that when we came in it was happy hour so our order would be 10% off.  They also do a thing where they have 50% off their juices that are going to expire that day. There was their ginger shots on sale before expiring as well and she let us chase them with the nut milk blend.  I tried apple cream pie and mudslide and those were both delicious! Super flavorful and sweet while being all natural.  I can't wait to come back and try their smoothies as well as have another \"fireball\" shot, so good for inflammation with turmeric, orange, cayenne, and black pepper.  If you buy 6 or more juices at one time they give you a better deal as well because it is considered a \"cleanse package\"."}
{"text":"I have to say I have never been into juicing. I am new to the area and I stopped in thinking it was a smoothie bar. I was greeted by Andria, she is such a sweet girl and very informative. Since I found this juice bar I have been getting daily shakes and am now doing the 3 day cleanse. I can not believe how fresh and tasty their juices are and you know your getting the real stuff! Fresh as fresh gets. Fell in love with the green milk today, unbelievable flavor! This place does it right and I am so happy I work right around the corner. I will continue to be a regular there. OUTSTANDING!!! Thank you for creating such a wonderful and healthy place!!"}
{"text":"Service and their products are fabulous! Coco Crack has got me hooked! Everyone is super friendly and so lucky that they're by my house!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Very knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, affable, pleasant, helpful staff. Delicious juices. Fresh ingredients. Feel super healthy drinking them.  Nice location.  BUT----reason for 4 rather than 5 stars----I'm incredulous Pressed for Juice doesn't re-use their expensive, well-made bottles.  Instead they indicate they \"Recycle\"? I'm sure they know (they've got to know this) the environmentally responsible standard is: (1) reduce, (2) re-use, and, only then, if you can't do either of those two, (3) recycle. It's unfathomable, and seemingly out of step with your principles, that you don't re-use. So many other organic juice and milk businesses around the country find a way to do this.  And---there's a small incentive for returning them.  Even if there were no deposit or incentive, I would still return the bottles. Why do I want a collection of bottles---or to recycle them, or have you recycle them?  I honestly patronize Pressed for Juice 1/3 of what I would if I knew these bottles weren't going to waste---all the energy spent in destroying them via the recycling process and what goes into making all those new bottles. Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"Such a gem! They had me sit at their \"bar\" and taste all their juices. My personal favorite was local hottie and gin and juice. The names are hilarious and the juice is awesome. I definitely love the \"happy hour\" which is the last two hours of the day, for 10% off and their stamp card. I will most definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the girls name who is always there but she's is so nice! (She has blonde hair and colored eyes)Anyways, my go to is the purple rain smoothie with the #18. It's sooooooo good! The açaí bowls are alright but if your looking for a snack I suggest the cookies. The chocolate cookies are cold which may sound weird but they are soooo good!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for fresh juices and nut milks. Friendly and knowledgeable staff willing to get creative with their recipes is a huge plus. Try the roots with coconut ice cream or add almost butter to your Green Bowl!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on my way home to grab some mixtures for my husband that's highly gluten sensitive, and some detoxing juices for myself. It was my first time and the staff was SO helpful! They let me try most of the menu and I decided on the 6 pack of juices. They were very knowledgeable and patient with all my questions and curiosities. Definitely worth the money! The Gin & Juice is amazing! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is always so clean & the staff are very nice! I know this place is known for their juices but if I may add their acai bowl is AMAZING!! The one major thing I appreciate about this place is consistency. Their is never that thought of, \"wow this was so much better last time.\" Same goes for the juices. They will even let you try which ever one you want. My favorite would have to be coco crack!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered Pressed For Juice. I visited during happy hour last night and ended up splurging and buying 3 bottles, #18, #11, and #20. So far I have tried 18 and 11...delicious! I can't wait to try the Green Milk.   Sweet Greens (11) had the usual green juice smell to it, but tasted so refreshing and sweet, but not too sweet.   Dos Leches (18) Believe the reviews. I JUST opened the bottle on my lunch 10 mins ago and its basically gone. Love vanilla? Try this one!  Bottles are pricey, but their glass bottles are larger than anywhere else I have visited (16.9 fl oz.). I went in 20 minutes before closing and the employees were helpful and friendly.   RECAP: -Bottles are 16.9 fl oz! -Juice prices range from $8.95-$10.95 -Happy Hour: 2 hours before closing, 10% off purchase. -Rewards Program (via telephone number): Buy 10, get 1 free."}
{"text":"On the east coast, I was drawn to the popularity of cold juice press.  I am so glad that Las Vegas has finally got on that trend.  I've tried multiple juice press venues, but this BY FAR is my #1! Ironically I was on my way to a juice press place this morning when I saw an \"Now Open\" sign for \"Juiced for Press\"  -- its a lot closer to my work place so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Boy am I so happy I did!!!  With the helpfulness of the lovely staff by offering samples, I was able to come to a verdict: The Local Hottie... my NEW FAVORITE DRINK!! The taste of pineapple with a slight hint of coconut... sweetness from honey and tanginess from the lemons... not to mention the kick of cayenne pepper creates such a unique flavor!   Let me tell you, I was overwhelmed with the selections and all the deliciousness of sampling different drinks.  I'll def. be a regular so I can one day try them all!   Soooooo excited!!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw this place while driving by. I wasn't sure that they were open until I drove around back. As I entered I was greeted with a friendly hello. I ordered the Local Hottie. The lady behind the counter gave me a complimentary sample. I don't know if that's the protocol or she could tell this was my first visit. I really did appreciate that. After sampling the local hottie juice I was in love with the flavorful spicy hydrating juice. I will definitely come back and try the variety of other juices and Brazilian bowl."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious selection of juices and treats! I kept hearing great reviews about this place, so I took my boyfriend and I to try it out. Can't get enough! Obsessed with Perfect Pear, Coco Crack, The Kitchen Sink, and Threesome"}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles area where cold pressed juice bars you can find in every city, but none of them compare to this place.  I tried most of there menu and there was not one that I didn't like. The staff was educational and catering. They use local farmers and serve you as many samples as you request, kinda like sitting at a wine tasting bar.  I left with a \"Threesome\"\"Sweet Greens\"\"Gin & juice\" and a big happy face."}
{"text":"First time here today and tried one of their juices and acai bowl. Tried the Full Brazilian and it's the best acai bowl I ever had! The acai is smooth and the coconut chips works well with the rest of the fruits and the acai.  The local hottie has a great kick to it! And very refreshing. We will definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars because I don't want to lead anyone astray. However; this place completely deserves the five stars. From the atmosphere to the customer service all the way to the last drop in the glass, this place is amazing. Everyone is super friendly and will make you feel at home. They take time to help you find something that you will like and also what will be best for you. And the acai bowls are number one. The best you will ever have!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for awhile and I'm glad I finally made the decision to stop by.   Upon entering, the decor is super cute. Rustic was the term my friend described the furnishing to be. Every table had a cute succulent or plant of some sort.   How they set up their samples is so simple & cute! They placed a small, ceramic cup (looks like a shot glass) on a wooden block and I chose all of the nut milks that I wanted to try. They were all super tastey!   Conveniently enough, this place also offers ACAI bowls and shakes in addition to their wide variety of juices and nut milks. I only wish they also offered Pitaya/Dragonfruit for their bowls as I do favor that more than Acai. I tried the PB&A bowl, size small.   They have a juice cleanse too that looks very interesting to try! Quite pricey though, so maybe one day and I'll work up the nerve (& the money) to give it a try.  Curious if they have stamp cards? Have no fear! For every 10 items you purchase (juices, bowls, smoothies) you get a free juice! They save your cellphone number and your \"stamps\" are kept there. I was also informed that they have a happy hour during the last two hours of their business day; all items are 10% off! If you need to know their business hours, they're open everyday Mon-Fri 6:30am-8pm Sat 8am-7pm Sun 9am-6pm.  They're open every day! So you have no excuses for not going ! :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite juice place. I live in Los Angeles, but I go to Vegas often, and I love their juices. At this point I've tried almost all of them and haven't had a bad one yet. The store is clean and the staff is friendly. Everything is made there, and is raw, vegan, and organic. I always feel so healthy and pure after I drink a juice from here. I highly recommend coming here. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great juicery... Number 12 is my favorite  Would be great to have more delicious edibles too to go with the juice! Just in case you're hungry and want to have something with your juice except the açaí bowls!"}
{"text":"Been to a few juice joints, this popsicle stand is hot an got all the right juices melting under that press."}
{"text":"I was hooked from the first visit!  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  As a first timer-they gave me several samples.  The quality and freshness is outstanding.  My favorites are the PB and A bowl, and the PC split w #19 nut milk.  So many of the fresh juices are wonderful and we also feel so good after eating there.  And worth repaying, the staff is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Super cute juice bar with the best menu display ever. I almost like this place better than Pressed Juice because they offer acai bowls and smoothies too. The only downside is that most of their juices seem to contain a lot of sugar with all the fruits they put into it. Pressed Juice gives the option of low cal/low sugar juices. The juices are good, though.  The juice shots are fun and a good way to get a little taste of everything. Highly recommend this. It's also gram-worthy ;)  The workers here seem pretty slow at everything they do. Cashiers are always so unfriendly and unwelcoming. Please fix this."}
{"text":"Was a bit skeptical when my bf wanted to stop in, but they give you samples to first if you like & I was pleasantly surprised.  I got the Coconut one & my bf got the Kitchen Sink (greens, which I don't usually like when he makes at home, but liked theirs)...I also got the A?ai fruit bowl which is AMAZING!  Now one of my fave foods (even beating out a DQ blizzard ;p) Also they have a Happy Hour (10% off).  Since I put away our juicer due to bulk & mess everyday I think we'll be making the drive from Southern Highlands more regularly now :)"}
{"text":"Updated- I gavs them another shot, and had an A+ experience!   Overall an ok experience at Pressed For Juice. I really love the ability to try the juices - definite points for that! I do have a couple of things that would have made my experience better. One, the shake I purchased was made with a very brown, over-ripe banana. Because of this it was so sickly sweet I couldn't finish it! I'm not sure if they use brown bananas on purpose, but I don't love that overly ripened flavor. Secondly, I purchased a cleanse. However, it came with no \"instructions\" - not even a list of the order to drink the juices. I've done juice cleanses from several other places and they always include some tips for cleansing and the recommended order to drink the juices. I did look up the order online - I just think it would be nice to include that. The juices do taste great."}
{"text":"I go 'gaga' for fresh juice of all shapes and sizes. Pressed For Juice serves up multicolored juice tonics to appeal to both the novice and the more experienced 'juice' nut. They have something for everyone and delivered on all fronts.   My friend and I each ordered a Juice Flight ( $11.95) which included 10 (2oz) juice samples that offer a little taste of everything - tastes range from Spicy- to Tangy- to Creamy- to Sweet. They serve the flight with a menu that describes each ingredient within the juice shot and align the health benefits with each concoction.    My Top 4 Favorites :   Local Hottie:  Pineapple, Coconut water, Lemon, Local Honey and Cayenne (for a kick)| Improves Circulation, Reduces Allergies and is a Metabolism Booster   The Kitchen Sink:  Kale, Orange, Spinach, Cilantro, Carrot, Parsley, Cucumber, Lemon, Celery, Lime, Apple, Mint, Pineapple and a touch of Lava Salt | Nutritional Powerhouse, Antioxidant Rich and Detoxifying   O-M-Ginger:  Apple, Lemon and Extra Ginger (it's got a kick) | Strengthens Immune System, Aids in Digestion and is a Metabolism Booster   Coco Crack:  Coconut Water and Coconut Meat | Hydration, Blood Pressure Management and Anti-Aging   During my visit, I learned that they source their organic ingredients from local farms in Las Vegas, Nevada and in Southern California. Their 'juice baristas' were very knowledgeable, perky and willing to answer my gazillion questions.   My visit here was a treat from a friend for my birthday - my clever friends know me well and suggested this spot over booze filled drinks. This was one unique gift idea and I loved it. I even took a bottle of their Kitchen Sink and O-M-Ginger home for the following days to come. I certainly plan to swing by here and pick up a few bottles again!   PS:  They have more than juice here. Stop by for a fruit bowl or a cleanse kit!  They also have happy hour --- see my tip for their discounted hours.  Yelp Review # 9 - 2016"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and my new favorite spot to order for my customers!!! The service was great and they let us taste the different juices while explaining the health benefits of each ingredient as well. I tried all 20 combinations and I liked every single one!"}
{"text":"In the rawest form by far earthy enough for me.   So much variety! What I appreciated the most: the friendly staff whom with ease encouraged me and a friend to sample/ taste the raw juice menu before deciding which green tree to climb. I ended up ordering #2 (sorry can't recall the name) for rejuvenation after last nights drinks. It was a perfect balance of all things green and a burst of ginger.  Lastly, the design is absolutely the cutest - bright white subway tile, slight accents in gold, finished with metals in grey."}
{"text":"If you are too lazy or do not have the 30-60 minutes to make your own juice with a high quality juice extractor this is your new haven. The coco crack, Gin &Juice and Clay mate are personal favorites. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable and its worth the price if your in a bind or just value good healthy food!"}
{"text":"I can't believe they just kept letting me try every juice flavor I wanted. I've been back now a couple times and I love all the juice but the acai bowl was my favorite."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best juice place I've ever been to, and not just because of the great sample shot tray they sell, but also because each of their juice blends has a deeper, more intense and complicated flavor than I've ever had anywhere before. Maybe it's the lava salt?  One week later, I'm still craving that last shot of green milk I had. I'm so pumped to come back to the area soon and get a bottle. We coincidentally bought a house that's being built in the neighborhood, so I'm psyched to not have to travel very far to get here when we make our final move in a few months."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been to many juice places across the USA but this one is the top on my list. They even let you try the juices before you buy them. The nut mills are fantastic and the price is right"}
{"text":"Juices are great, customer service is a whole other thing. I bought 6 juices Sunday 9/6 I used the company's cold bag to put my juices in, I ran them into my house leaving them in the bag on my counter from about noon to 9 in the evening. I asked the girl working on Tuesday 9/8 around noon if juices should last in the bag that long she said yes. When I told her that 5 of my juices were rotten she back pedaled asking if they gave me ice for my bag ( which the number of times I've been there no one ever has) I said no so she went into a spiel about non pasteurization. Then I said so basically I poured $50 down the drain, and she said to me \" so are you going to buy something\" which I felt was extremely rude ( it's not like there were other customers waiting). Every time I go into this store I spend at least $60 if not more, needless to say that today will be my last trip into pressed for juice and I tried to privately send a message via the website but the messaging does not work properly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome !! Finally I found good pressed juice ! Price is around $9 , $10 !!  This Sunday I tried #6 which is kale spinach carrot cucumber Apple pineapple orange cilantro parsley lemon mint and lava salt ! Every thing is inside :) and yummy yummy. They give 1 free when you bought 10 juice ."}
{"text":"Pressed for Juice is a great place to pick up REAL ORGANIC cold pressed juice... Ive tried many others and this is the real mccoy....im always impressed with their friendly service and ease of access to the store and like that they recycle not reuse the juice bottles.  Ive tried all of their juices and all are very tasty and satisfying.  I highly recommend Pressed for Juice."}
{"text":"I love this place, my staff loves this place, my patients love this place, and the list goes on and on! My favorites are the Beet Junkie, all the nutmilks, PB Split Smoothie, and the PB&A with spirulina added. It's a great place for a quick snack or a meeting. The last 2 hours are Happy Hour and everything is 10% off."}
{"text":"The ambience is very cool. It has a industrialize vibe to it. I absolutely love their cold brew drinks. It's very strong! You can also mix the cold brew with one of their almond drinks. I'm a huge fan of the Green Milk. The drink consists of almond, hazelnuts, spinach, kale, romaine, parsley, date, vanilla bean, maple syrup, and lava salt! I definitely want to come back and try a cleanse! I was told they are going to start having hot coffee soon."}
{"text":"My gym is in the same shopping center, my go-to juices are #2 Gin & Juice and #8 Beet Junkie, I love how much I can feel the difference in my recovery when I drink these compared to days I don't. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The taste, freshness, and loyalty program is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service ever!! as soon as you come in the staff makes you feel very comfortable.. As you sit down at the juice bar the staff gives you different varieties of cold pressed juice that are so delicious. Just let the staff know what you are into rather if it's greens or something a little more sweet, they will find you a juice that fits your needs.   My favorite juice here is Sweet Green!"}
{"text":"Amazing juices and Acai bowls.  I originally had my review for 4 starts because of the hours but the owner contacted me immediately!  I work at the hospital across the street and start work at 7am. I can never get something before I head to work I wish they opened at six!  Jeremy said they are working on expanding their hours! ...great customer service! :) 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The drinks are pretty good! The Acai bowl was great. I tried the several juices but chose \"Coco crack\" juice and the \"Brazilian\" acai bowl. The gentleman that served me was nice and the place very clean to the naked eye. I was able to try a few juices before making my ultimate decision. Next time I'm in the area I'll try another. My one downside is the juices are a lil more pricier than some other places but the upside they happen to be very tasty. Overall a cool experience."}
{"text":"I love this joint! All desserts are amazing and vegan. My favorites are the chocolate chip cookies and carrot cake. The juice also never disappoints, but sometimes I just go for dessert. All items are reasonably priced and close to home, which makes it easy to satisfy my cookie cravings .  I'm so grateful for this cafe. The staff is always friendly and professional. They were even closing up shop on my last visit, but were kind enough to allow me to place a last minute order   I wish I would have taken a beautiful picture, but I inhaled my dessert. You'll have to go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I am in love with the full Brazilian.  The perfect amount of açaí, granola and fruit. Right amount of sweetness and I'm so addicted! I haven't tried any of their juices yet, since I just buy them from vons (suja is my favorite at the moment). The portion from medium to large is a big difference and I usually share the medium still.  They also provide a rewards service so after so many items bought you receive something discounted or free (no quite sure since my husband is my delivery guy lol). If you're in this area it's a must try!"}
{"text":"While their juice is very good, I think the pricing is still a little crazy. I myself have only tried a few of their juices.l but wish you could purchase a flight to try. Yes they do let you sample them, but I feel like it might be easier that way. When I asked the cashier if they had something like that, she just looked at me like I was crazy and said the best way to try more juices is to buy a whole set.. so pretty much spend 70$ for 7 juices. Which hey if they are great why not, but if I don't know what they taste like that doesn't make much sense. Coco crack though... pretty sure it's just that. I could drink about 20 gallons of that stuff. And seems to have the least amount of sugar than the rest of the juices. I did purchase one juice that was expiring the next day, and the company sent me an offer for a free one, so that was pretty amazing of them to do. Great company for sure. I'll be back regardless of pricing because they're addicting."}
{"text":"I would give more stars if I could!! I am in my car writing this because I can't risk forgetting to say how YUMMY there stuff is!!! I ordered a #20 green milk thing and got it as a shake with added protein and it's awesome! It was pricy but this is the only place you'll truly get your $ worth  as far as REAL nutrition AND great taste! I'm in love!!! The gave me a sample of another blend that was creamy coconut and other nuts....I don't remember but it was bomb too!!! Anyways I was at the gym and needed protein. Usually I get smoothies at other places and they're always just your typical smoothie. Sometimes added protein makes drinks mealy and less yummy....too \"heathy\" tasting, which I'm fine with. But today I'm having something even healthier than usual yet it tastes SOOOO good!!! Customer service is great too!!!"}
{"text":"First time ever trying a juice place and I was not disappointed. I love that they have the bar set up and let you sample each juice to find out which flavor you want. They have a great variety of choices."}
{"text":"This place is the best in town. Everything from the acai bowls to the juice is perfect. I come here daily for a nitro coffee with a \"dos leches\" creamer. It is the best! I've stopped my daily stop to Starbucks and cancelled my coffee club. But the juices..... Amazing. The cleanses are perfect for a total restart. And if you need a quick boost they also have shots of juicy yumminess to help get your day started."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a very fun experience to go in and try all the different juices. Great service & the juice is great & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Everything is so good here! The staff is always very friendly and willing to help you decide on a juice to take home with you. Their açaí bowls are out of this world as well. Kind of pricey, but worth it. Great place! I'd recommend it to my friends and family."}
{"text":"As another reviewer said, this is a true hidden gem.   VEGANS: if you are looking for treats, look no further! Their fudges and superfood balls are amazing. And, FINALLY, a place that has perfected the vegan Caesar salad! It's made with Brazil nut sprinkles and cashew dressing. So good.   Their drink offerings are original and made to order. Espresso/coffee can be added to just about anything for that extra pick me up. Not into drinks? Not to worry, they have plenty of bowls to crave your hunger as well.   But me, I'm a fan of the salads. They are a must try! Super original flavors and amazing homemade dressings.  Sit at the counter long enough, and you'll get a few free samples."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here.  Clean establishment & very friendly service. You can try every single juice on the menu....sort of like going to the bar and taking shots of every kind of liquor but you won't get sloppy and drunk.  Extensive selection of juices with an ingredient list on the bottles. Love the glass bottles that give it a vintage feel. Juices start at about $9 a bottle (16.9 oz - 2 servings).    Juice cleanse options that take the work out of it. You can buy a day's worth of juice cleanses (6 bottles) for around $59 and they range from beginner to pro.  I sampled the following:  - #4 Local Hottie: liked the light sweet juice with a spicy kick from Cayenne. - #14 Bloody Beetroots : I'm not a fan of beets because it tastes like dirt to me. This was all beet tasting with a spicy jalapeño finish. - #20 Green Milk : this was my favorite. Smooth milky with prominent vanilla bean taste. But read warning below. - #15 Coco Crack : imagine cracking open a fresh coconut and drinking the contents.  I left the store with my Green Milk and Coco Crack. I wanted my family to try the Coco Crack so I drank my Green Milk. I drank about 3/4 of a bottle on the 25 minute drive home. Thank God it wasn't a minute longer because I couldn't get to the bathroom sooner! The Green Milk went right through me. I don't know if I wasn't supposed to drink nearly the entire bottle but it was so good, I couldn't help myself. I still have 1/4 left in the fridge and a little nervous to finish it. I probably will but will make sure I'm home."}
{"text":"This juice is amazing!! It's a little expensive, but the ingredients and taste is well worth it."}
{"text":"My Favorite fresh pressed juice place and they have awesome acai bowls as well! Place is always super clean and staff is super nice and well educated about the products. Keep it up guys!  Tip: If you feel a cold coming on have the OMginger it will make you feel better quick!"}
{"text":"5 stars because the service was excellent! I came in one morning and I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted. The owner happened to be there and she went through and let me try almost every juice they serve (excluding the spicy ones because I'm not into those). She explained everything and how the ingredients would benefit my body. I spent almost an hour going over the juices with her. She was not only informative but the juices and experience was wonder."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on the southwest side.  We love juice places and in Las Vegas, a good juice place is hard to find.  Yes, there are a few places which have cold pressed juice in bottles, but a lot of the juices over lap ingredients.    We have found a few great places in California and many times wished someone would open a place in Vegas that will make some GREAT fresh Organic juice at a decent price.  HERE IS IT FINALLY!!!!  We walk in the door and the ambiance of the place is AWESOME unlike any other place in town.   They have seats at the bar and a few other seats around.  Matt greeted us, he is friendly and very knowledgeable.  They have 17 different juices and 3 milks and my favorite part of this place compared to all the others in town, you have a HUGE selection of juices without ginger.  The point is the juices here are unique in their own way and taste great.  It's like someone from California finally came to Vegas and brought an AMAZING juice place with them.  You can sit at the bar, if your first time here, they give you a very cute little wooden board and a real mini cup, not plastic, and you can sample all 20 if you desire.  There are HUGE signs as well as a small card which lists all the ingredients and prices in clear view, there are no hidden costs here.  This juices are AWESOME, the price of most juices are a little cheaper then the others in town and they have a loyalty program, you give them your phone number and work your way to a free juice.    This place is worth the drive until they open another one closer to the Green Valley area.  Needless to say we left with 8 bottles and will be back.  Did I mention the juice choices and tastes are unique and AMAZING???  They even have a Happy Hour..   Rush on over to this place, oh wait no don't, I like that it was easy in and not crowded."}
{"text":"Nice enough. People were friendly. One gripe I have is the same for all the juice places I've been to lately. The juice is made and bottled. It's not in a cup. Not made to order. Feels strange walking out with a bottle of juice for $12. Would rather see someone grab fruit and blend it in front of me. Juice was good and fresh though."}
{"text":"For a juicery, they have the best customer service! I really recommend their Coco Crack and Nutslide.  Those are my two favorite juices from there when I have a sweet tooth. But don't take my word for it! You can sit at their bar and sample every juice.  The staff is super helpful and you are never looked at as a nuisance for asking. My barista was Iris!  She was so nice and helpful in recommending what juices match my taste and my health goals.  I went in to buy one bottle and ended up buying a 1 day package cleanse. It was kind of pricey ($56) but it really help reset my system after a weekend of binge drinking. Lol. They also have a cool loyalty program where you buy 10 and you get one free-- also counts per bottle when you buy the package cleanse too. By far my favorite juicery."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the customer service and the juices are delicious. My favorite juice is the Green Milk and La Leche. I wish Pressed For Juice could open up a 2nd location in Northwest Las Vegas. They are currently located in the Southwest. The drive is worth it. I've been juicing there for three months. This is by far, the best juice bar in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and I do love this place, cool concept, clean and industrialized. My favorite drinks are the kitchen sink, threesome, cream me, green milk and dos leches. I'm telling you can't go wrong on those drinks!! Lol and the acai bowls YUM! My only dilemma is sometimes I'm missing one bottle in my cooler bag and it happened to me 3x already Which the owner helped me and gave me the missing bottle, the prices are kinda high so please inspect and count the bag before giving it to the customer. $11 a drink is no joke lol"}
{"text":"We are probably a little too obsessed with this place! Buying açai bowls from here is becoming a weekly habit, because they're that good! My husband gets the green bowl and I get that PB bowl. I think my favorite part about this place is that they use high-quality local and organic ingredients. My body honestly feels the difference whenever I get juice or açai bowls from here. Not to mention the staff is very friendly and helpful. I came in feeling sick and then you just to just to help me feel better and actually helps me a lot! The vibe is also quiet and calm during the day, which is great for doing some work on the computer or even enjoying a quiet morning drinking their iced raw lattes! That green milk and the nitrobrew coffee is soooo good."}
{"text":"My favorite juice in Vegas!  Everything about this juice bar is extremely well thought out. You can tell that they put effort into the design of the store with their modern decor, clever emoji inspired graphics and silly names. Their cold pressed juice blends are comprised of a huge variety of ingredients and are unique and perfectly balanced. They carry a large selection and come up with new interesting juices periodically. There are definitely flavors here that you can't find elsewhere in Vegas and they're never watered down or bland.   I'm a green juice girl so I rotate regularly between Green Party which has a noticeable green pepper flavor, Sweet Greens which is more acidic with the addition of pineapple, The Kitchen Sink with every ingredient imaginable, and Gin n Juice which has a stronger but not overpowering ginger flavor. I especially like that they don't go too heavy on the turmeric in any of their juices.  The glass bottles are a generous portion and they even do buy 10 juices get 1 free!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They allow you to sample the juices before you buy and are good at helping you pick based on your goals nutritionally. The sweet greens and gin and juice are my favorite green options. Go for Green Valley if you want less sugar. The Acai bowls are also a must have- topped with banana, strawberries and shaved coconut, granola and blueberries.. It's enough to fill you for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to both this location and the Green Valley location. Everything I've ordered has been top notch! Their smoothies, juices AND açaí bowls are all delicious- seriously can't go wrong with anything you order here. It is a little pricey but they have a rewards program. Their modern decor makes for an inviting entrance to come in and take a seat. The staff is always friendly and helpful AND patient- I do have a tough time making a decision here!! #mybodyisatemple  P.S. they also offer juice cleanses- I will be back to give that a go!"}
{"text":"Best juice bar in town...maybe best anywhere. Their cold pressed juices are ridiculously good. They include and mix ingredients that I haven't seen anywhere else. They also have the best Acai Bowl in town- the Full Brazilian. They have kambucha on tap as well as nitro coffee."}
{"text":"They need more cashiers, besides that the juices are addicting. I was standing in line for about 20 minutes and there was only 3 people in front of me. But again the juices are sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Pressed for Juice in my opinion has the best tasting combos for their juices. They just know how to combine the ingredients so they don't taste weird. Plus I love that they come in glass, the taste is so much crisper in the glass as with any drink. The store is very clean and well kept on the daily.  The prices are a little on the higher side, but I don't mind paying a little more for good quality cold pressed juice. If you go 2 hours before closing they have a happy hour deal for 10% off which is when I go to grab my juices and açaí bowls. Ohh and what can I say about the açaí bowls, they taste so darn good and I'm going to go and say that this is the best açaí bowl I have ever tasted. They got the mix and ingredients down to a T. Lots of other places can do it how they do, sometimes it is to watery or too icy. My favorite bowl is the PBandA and during the summer I find myself getting the full Brazilian just because it's a little more refreshing since peanut butter is thick."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I was at work and my co-worker and I stopped in to check it out.  The staff was super friendly and answered all our crazy questions.  They described the different juices and explained how you could make it into a smoothie as well.  I finally settled on a banana and peanut butter shake with a mocha juice base.  I was pleasantly surprised with the shake.  I would describe it as banana bread in a cup.  The place was super clean and the decor made the atmosphere fun and inviting.  I will definitely be going back to try another concoction."}
{"text":"I absolute LOVE this little gem & the gals the run the front! Every time we come in, we are greeted by Sam's beautiful smile & warm welcome! She is like the perfect person to work here and always so quick with her work. I'm a big time fan of the Brazilian acai bowl and she created this every time perfectly!   Today, I tried the nitro cold brew & it was really delicious. She also gave me a little sample of the edamame hummus and it was the best hummus I've ever tasted! Apparently, they used to sell the tubs of the hummus but not many customers would purchase them, so they got pulled from the shelf. On the bright side, you can order them in the little veggie boxes that they sell!   They have some pretty neat juice cleanses, for when you really need that pick me up! Also, make sure to come between 6-8 for 10% off.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is soo cool! Chirs was soo nice and sweet! he let me try a lot of different numbers, now I have many favorites."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great tasting products and a large selection - Pressed for Juice is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood! I was delighted to find this gem given that I will soon be living in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Acai bowl breakfast places in the whole valley!!!  Da Products: 5/5 this place must use the best ingredients that money can buy because every time we get anything from here it is always so ONO. Getting an Acai bowl is always a gamble everywhere else; sometimes it is still too frozen, sometimes it is too watery, and sometimes it is just clumpy. For as long as I have been going here the consistency is always excellent. The juices here are also super bomb! I like the different combos they have to offer, great selection.  Da Customer Service: 5/5 every time I have gone in I am always greeted with smiles and hellos. The workers here genuinely take time to say hi to everybody and make you feel like they are happy to see you. When I first started coming here I use to ask a thousand and one questions and I never felt like I was a bother to them, and that to me is super cool.  Da Price: 4/5 Some of the items and drinks are little on the higher end compared to the rest of similar shops around the Valley, They also do not offer a military discount, they do have a stamp card option that is hooked up to your phone number, that is a plus.  Da Location: 4/5 Not really central and kinda out of the way, they make up for it with the quality of food they offer here and their customer service, it is always worth the trek.   Da Good: Excellent food that is always consistent on their taste and quality. The staff here love working here and it shows.  Da Bad: No Military discount and prices are kinda steep...  Da Ugly: Location is kinda far, I'm kinda reaching here!!!  Overall: I love this place and everything their is to offer. Please keep up the good work and the quality of the food and I'll keep on coming back."}
{"text":"Everyone here is super nice & very helpful when figuring out what to order. We come here probably every other day, their açaí bowls are okay, but their smoothies are where it's at."}
{"text":"I came in here because Starbucks was full, and I needed to get some work done on my slaptop. It was a little intimidating at first, but the employees were very friendly and welcoming. I wasn't familiar with the juice bar cleanse concept, the way they do it here, it's pretty cool. I got the Karrot Cake smoothie and it was very good. One of the employees even gave me the leftovers of a Green Milk juice she made too much of for another customer, which I really liked. I love the decor of this shop, it's very bright and energizing. Only issue was that the stools at the bar top were too low, so I had to sit on my leg to boost myself up to type. And the only outlets around me were behind the counter, but the employee offered to plug me in before I even had to ask. I'll definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Freaking love this place!! Kyle helped us and gave us samples of whatever we wanted to try. I ended up buying 3 bottles, Local Hottie, The Kitchen Sink, and Sweet Greens and also got a Green Milk shake. We also checked in on Facebook and got a free shot which was really nice, but the shot was super intense! It opened up my sinuses and cleared me right up. I can't remember the name but it had ginger, lemon, and cayenne pepper in it. It burned real good on the way down. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Acai Bowls in Las Vegas! So hard to find a good Acai Bowl outside of California. I love their juices too. The Kitchen Sink is my go to green drink."}
{"text":"I work in the same plaza and I love the dos leches drink and #11   I came by feeling sick and my co worker recommends the holy shot it tasted weird but it made me feel better after I took a shot   the staff are really friendly !! Would def come back whenever .."}
{"text":"I love treating myself to cold pressed juice whenever possible. And I love doing that here.  All of the staff members are friendly, helpful and patient...especially when I want to sample various juices and can't decide what I want.  So far everything I've had has been amazing and tasty especially the O-M-Ginger!!! Sure it's a little pricey, but that's the price you pay for the quality of this juice and I don't mind at all.  Do yourself a favor and try this place out. The decor is awesome and I love the bar stools, where I sit and drink my juice! Thanks for being awesome Pressed for Juice!!"}
{"text":"Best juice in town! Love all the variety that you can chose from. The beet junkie is my fave"}
{"text":"This place is clean and bright, with a great menu of organic fresh juices, açaí bowls and smoothies.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The Asian girl that works here is never paying attention to what she does and always off in her own world. Avoid having her do anything other than grab you a juice from the fridge at all costs. Everyone else that works here pays attention and is attentive. I've had numerous bad experiences with this girl after always tipping at least 15%.  (FYI I'm the bald white guy with tattoos that comes in smelling like weed all the time. Stop f**king my orders up please)"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The staff is very help in getting you a smoothie or juice you will enjoy. I have to say I am very impressed with this place.  Its a simple looking place with a great product.  put it on you to do list.  They do have a Happy Hour with 10% off the bill."}
{"text":"The juice I got is so refreshing! I got the #11 sweet greens. One thing I noticed is that they're not organic. They should lower the price a bit for this reason since organic juices are just about the same price."}
{"text":"Finally a juice spot close by.  Nice interior, set up as if it is a bar- a Juice bar!  You can sit and taste prior deciding on which you will purchase.  While you are there, perhaps enjoy a 'shot' suggested by one of the employees. My favorite juice (at the current moment) is the Nojito.  Make sure you download app card!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Customer service was beyond our expectations. If you are looking for a new hang out spot or just to work, this might be for you. This place gives an amazing atmosphere. And the best part is, you can try all 20 juices for free. Tasha is one of the best employees."}
{"text":"This is by far, my favorite juice spot in Las Vegas! If they had one in LA, I'd be there daily.  A wide selection of juices with the best combination of ingredients together making it both healthy and tasty. Very friendly staff that is knowledgeable of all the different products.  The place is always immaculate and clean. I'm a tough critic when it comes to juice places, but this is by far, my favorite. Definitely 5 stars and definitely worth coming in to try if you haven't been.  Extremely reasonable. I know they offer happy hour certain times of the day which I usually miss but the price is still right even without happy hour.  Parking is always available. Great location near the freeway making it very accessible.  I would highly recommend them to anyone trying to expand your tastebuds in trying new juices or great for doing a cleanse if you want to take it very serious.   Don't forget to try their snacks such as the coconut chips, which are out of this world. An absolute must! Enjoy and happy juicing!"}
{"text":"Pressed was probably the last juicery I've tried in Vegas for no real reason but I can't believe I've never been here earlier!!!   Got a juice flight, and tons of their food to sample. The edamame hummus was some of the best hummus I've surprisingly had in a while, and their Caesar salad was massive and super good. Their famous almond butter cups are worth the hype, along with their almond butter protein cookie.  Best juice highlights: Local Hottie (honey, cayenne, cinnamon), Threesome (orange/grape/strawberry), Green Milk (superfood green juice/nut milk blend), Bloody Beetroots (probably the best beet juice I've tried, spicy and tasty). All of their other juices were pretty good but these were the standout. For $11, it's a LOT of juice.  Also had the Roots smoothie.. can't wait to come back again for that. A spicy but creamy smoothie. Very good."}
{"text":"I'm sorry this review has taken a while to update. As soon as I posted the review about what happened the owner reached out to me within 20 mins. He promptly rectified situation and since I go almost everyday I can tell the employees are getting better at what they do. They have good product. I still think they're a little pricey but hey I keep going back so I guess I can't complain too much.  If anyone is looking for recommendations I definitely recommend the \"Cream Me\" shake with protein I usually get a 16oz after my Pilates work out. Thank you Jeremy for reaching out and correcting the situation ASAP!"}
{"text":"Had a little issue yesterday, but the owners are fabulous and go out of their way to make you have a wonderful experience and correct any issues in a very fast manner ! Best juice bar in town :) .. Not feeling well ? Go have a holy shot ;) .. It will help you feel better ! Ask the awesome  staff what else may help you get back to feeling better !"}
{"text":"My fiancé, a single mother of two with a full time job, had an experience here last night that warrants an update. She arrived at the store 10 minutes before 'happy hour' pricing kicks in, which is a 10% discount. Between the two of us we've spent over $400 there in the last month. She asked for the discount and the girl working there said that she couldn't have it. She also said that it wasn't possible to give the discount, that everything was already set up in the system. From previous visits I know that this is not the case. So #1, they wouldn't do a tiny little thing for what I'm certain is one of their best customers. And #2, lie about your ability to do so. I like the product here, but to be honest there is plenty of competition in Summerlin... and the competition's pricing is already more attractive. I would think that a new business would be more service-focused in order to build a strong customer base."}
{"text":"I got Mint Chip and it was delicious! It filled me up which is surprising because of how tiny it looks! Customer service could be better. Nice interior."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I always get amazing service to the point where I tip them before I leave. I know right? Tipping at a juice place sounds odd - but you'll see what I mean when you visit. The juices are all so delicious. My favorites are the Green Juice and the Kitchen Sink. The recipes are just so FRESH and RAW. So delicious. After drinking the juice, I honestly feel healthier, and re-energized. The only thing that I would like to mention is that it's on the pricier side, but if you think about it, juicing at home would cost almost the same amount. 9 to 11 dollars per juice bottle, plus tax. I love this place and I will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They let you sample their healthy pressed juices, so you can pick your favorites & assemble a 6 pack to go (for a nice discount), or 1 bottle perhaps for the road. I actually started with an acai bowl, and ended up buying practically everything and \"the kitchen sink\"!  The place itself is also a really cool vibe, I was a little surprised though that there was no music on? Maybe they just forgot. Totally worth driving over here from the strip to rejuvenate after a night of partying though!"}
{"text":"Gr8 selection of high quality  fruit and veggies juices.  Although I prefer the green and root juice combinations they are all tasty, fresh and nutritious.   Packed w/vitamins, minerals and phyto-chemicals you'll get your daily quota of plant food in our example bottle.  Samples are generous and service is gracious."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious and healthy!!!! Sweet staff! Nutrition in a bottle!  Coco crack and Clay mate! My fav's"}
{"text":"Great place to go to.  When I first came into the place, I saw that their design is solid. Their design is clean, so I knew they were going to have solid products. As a first timer, they offered samples to us, getting a hint of how their juices tasted. You can tell that their juices are 100% fruit and vegetables (not sweet like naked juices). With 20 different juice blends, there will be something you'll want! This place is amazing and it makes me want to come back every single day!"}
{"text":"The Greek goddess Demeter heard my call. ORGANIC fresh pressed juices and smoothies in Las Vegas, NV. Healthy, convenient, on the go food. Thank you for an option for my family. Great for taking to a park playdate, road trip, in the refrigerator at home."}
{"text":"Juice is excellent. 3 star is based upon deceptive pricing of their \"shake.\"   Beware the shake is not $3.50 it's going to be over $14 by the time you add the juice that is not mentioned in the price of the shake :)"}
{"text":"My go to place when I just want something light and refreshing. The taste of their pressed juices as well as the smoothies are outstanding. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star is the value. 10 dollars for 1 16oz juice.  I guess you can go here if you're tired and just want a quick sip. But if you have time and press your own juice, definitely do so."}
{"text":"Quality product and excellent service. I enjoyed the Green milk in a smoothie. The smoothie makes it thicker and adds banana flavor.  After being sick for over a week this was just what I needed. Excellent"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place, but overall, I can only give them an OK rating. I walked in on a Friday at 7:45 PM, service was very lacking, but I understand since they close at 8 and it was a Friday.   Now for the juice, I got #1, #2, #6, #10, #16 and #20. Price isn't bad, around $10 per juice, though it was the first juice place that charged sales taxes (for me at least). I have been to many pressed juice places and this place's juices are definitely sweeter than what I am used to. People might love this place for this exact reason, but I don't. #1 is the only juice I think is ok, but it's really too mild, they really need another mix with more of a kick and all greens. All the other juices I tried are just so so, too much fruit juices in the mix for me, way too sweet overall. I couldn't even finish the kitchen sink and the green milk (I know other people love them, they are just not for me) I will stick with my #1.5 and #4 juices at pressed juicery in the future."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and their juices!  The staff is always smiling and helpful and get you in and out but are happy to let you sit and sample.  One of my favorites is probably the Green Milk but I haven't met a juice from here that I did not like."}
{"text":"Best acai bowls ever!! The staff and owner are all super sweet, and always go above and beyond to take care of us. It's super clean, bright and modern inside, and I always feel energized and refreshed leaving. Would definitely recommend to everybody."}
{"text":"Pressed has always had great customer service and their juice is always fresh and amazing. The good thing about this juice spot also is the fabulous food. I always go for the retaking almonds or the Acai Bowl. The nutmilks or great and the juice cleanses they have are worth the money. Make sure to sign up to track your points. Every ten juices you get one free"}
{"text":"Green milk is the only one I've tried but it's SOOOO good! Literally can't stop thinking about it. The acai bowls are freaking bomb as well, I've tried the Brazilian and the swole bowls and I love them both equally. The only thing I can complain about this the price... It's pretty expensive but I don't even mind, it's that good to me. It's also healthy and good for you so I understand why it might be overpriced!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get juice or an acai bowl! Definitely recommend the Full Brazilian, it's one of my favs! Definitely a plus that you can call it in for pick up too. (:"}
{"text":"Today was my first time in Pressed, I work nearby. And my first experience was AWESOME! When I walked in I was greeted with a huge smile from D'Andre (sorry if your reading this and I spelled your name wrong lol). But he then asked me what I was looking for today, I told him it was my first time and he told me what Pressed offered in a nutshell. I told him I was looking at the açaí bowls and he went over them and suggested the most popular and made me my bowl. (Which tasted so good! And looked just as pretty.) I'm 28 weeks pregnant and I'm pretty skeptical about what I take in and he helped me feel comfortable to trying something new. I can't wait to come back again! Pressed also has an awesome reward program of 10 juices, or bowls= 1 fee juice!"}
