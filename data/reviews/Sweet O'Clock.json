{"text":"Came pretty late after dinner. They do take Credit Card which was good since we had run out of CAD and most places in Chinatown only take Debit or Cash. 

The cute little older woman who was sitting at the cashier informed us we couldn't order any of the \"food\" items since she only knows how to make the desserts and the bubble teas lol.

I got an Herbal Jelly dessert and she literally messed up all my toppings, but I was too lazy and disappointed to correct her. The toppings I did get were good though, albeit very very sparse. In the pictures, it looks like you'll get a ton of boba I probably got like 20 boba balls total.

Disappointing. Don't come here unless you need to go somewhere that takes credit card."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite bubble tea place downtown. Used to be an independent bbt joint and have a back wall of bootleg porno vids (yes, you read that right), but it seems to have rebranded into a chain (Sweet O'Clock). The bbt is still the same, though, although more expensive. Run/owned by an adorable little lady.

Also, they HAVE PEACH MILK TEA!!! So few places carry this flavour!"}
{"text":"First drink I had in Toronto and there were no disappointments! Can't go wrong with bubble tea. One was a kiwi and the other was passionfruit. This place also has smoothies, ice cream and more but considering it was cold I refrained from my cravings but was extremely satisfied with my bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Service is poor and it seemed unclean. Many other better options in Chinatown (that seem more sanitary) that have at least as many dessert options. 
I should have read the other legit review posted on this (I made the mistake of going in without checking reviews). I agree with Carol's review--don't go unless you really need to use a credit card and need a boba fix that bad."}
{"text":"The best bubble tea in Toronto is this place. IT IS THE BEST. Just try it. Trust me. Amazing flavours, great quality waaaay better than laboth√®ry and other places in downtown."}
