{"text":"True value for money...taste definitely worth going bk for..ordered 4 burgers..Salisbury, Masala, poutine and apple butter burger...my favourite...apple butter burger...was a different experience that sweet buttery taste mixing with the sauces... great place for a home cooked  burger..added benefit..halal meet.."}
{"text":"Today was my third visit to On The Bun..I consider myself to be a bit of a burger aficionado and these burgers do not disappoint! My personal favourite is the Apple Butter burger..the meat is cooked perfectly, and the crispy onions and tangy sweet sauce are perfect..and then add the gooey cheese - burger HEAVEN! Great spot, super friendly staff..love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked by all the positive and glowing reviewed on here as it was just simply not the experience we had. I've been dying for a good burger so found this place as a top 5 reccomendation so thought we'd give a call and check for peanut oil as I'm allergic hubby calls and gets put on hold after he asks a question so they can take an order..okay no big deal comes back and answers our other questions not especially friendly.. we figured maybe they are busy so we call back with our order and drive over to pick up. We got there and first thing is they say CASH only.. if you are going to take orders by phone in 2016 make sure you actually tell people that because no sorry I'm not using your sketch ATM and pay $7 in fees to withdrawl money for a freaking burger....by sheer luck we had cash because we NEVER do. Next we find out our order hasn't even been made as they lost it after they took it by phone??WTF?? the paper slipped by the cash or something ridiculous.. clearly can't handle customers in store and call in orders.. yet somehow they deliver? So we ended up waiting a good 20+ minutes for a burger, \"philly cheese steak\" small fries and  grilled cheese. Keep in mind we had called ahead. A guy walked in after us to order and was told it would be 45 minutes for a burger and fries ROFL... how are you in business? It's a freaking burger!!  While waiting the cashier at some point decided he hadn't charged us for the philly cheese steak .. Hubby insisted we had paid for it but buddy said he needed to check the receipt... REALLY? at this point? and yea of course we HAD been charged for it. The experience alone guaranteed I'd never go back. We  finally got the food home.. Philly cheese steak as an FYI goes on a sub bun or other NOTa hamburger bun.. the grilled cheese was made using the end piece of the bread... (really poor  guys! use it for breadcrumbs or discard it is NOT sandwich worthy) burger was mediocre .. certainly not worth the hassle. I'm guessing the saving grace of this store is that it's Halal... if you want a good burger and realiable service go to C &Dubs.. spare yourself the hassle and dissapointment of this joint."}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to try this place. Upon ordering a burger, the gentleman on cash asked if my coworker would be dining in or taking out. My coworker said he was dining in, and restaurant worker indicated 'okay but no outside food or drink'. I had about 2 sips left of a McDonalds iced coffee and my buddy had a...get this...a CONTIGO water bottle, with tap water in it.

I'm 100% certain he pointed at both of our 'beverages', and repeated 'no outside food or drink'. If Customer Service was just nice and indicated, 'Hey you know what guys, we really value your business but since we have limited space, we can only allow those without outside food to sit inside the restaurant', we would have been more accepting, and I'd gladly go outside and finish my drink before coming back in.

But to straight up say it in a very defensive, rude, dismissive tone that resembled something to the effect of 'get rid of your drink or get out because we don't need your business', just gave me a very toxic vibe about this place. The energy is like the restaurant - dark and somewhat out of place. Note to the restaurant owner - if someone brings water in, in a re-usable, environmentally friendly container, just let them drink it. Water/hydration is a human right after all, right?

Needless to say, my coworker asked for a refund and we went to the Roti shop beside, which was nice, friendly, not bitter, and actually quite cheerful for a Tuesday afternoon.

Main take back: it's not what you say - it's how you say it."}
{"text":"Both the apple butter burger and poutine burger are fantastic.

Note that it is cash only."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER!! Hands down the best burger I've ever had. Been coming here every Friday for over 2 years now. Try the AK47 my girlfriend loves the masala burger."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and wife had been bugging me so we went this past weekend. We got the AK47 and Apple butter burger and both were fantastic. I'm personally not a big fan of their fries but my wife and kids loved them. Will try the masala fries next time. And yes, cash only but their is an ATM at the premise"}
{"text":"They take only CASH !!! Aaarrgghhh... the food was.not the greatest I've had. The poutine and fries were overly salty. The steak and cheese sandwich was ok. The buns were soft."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY  
I had the Apple butter burger and oh my it was good. The the two girls that served me where really nice. Will go there again."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy and affordable! I highly recommend the Apple Butter Burger and the poutine. Need to improve their ambience and decor to attract more clientele for sit-downs, however."}
{"text":"Ambience =1| Cafeteria style seating-  with blue and yellow colours. Space lacks character.
Service= 3 | No table service, although owner is friendly and welcoming.
Product= 2 | Apple Butter burger came highly recommended. The burger patty was dry / not juicy, although the toppings had some taste. The burger looked flat and not worth the $5.89 price. Bun was mediocre. Fries were a little oily. The combo with drink came out to $10.48 in total. Price not worth the total experience. It could have been better- as this burger joint consistently receives good reviews. 
Place has potential as long as food quality stays consistent. That's why it gets 3 stars!Cash is only mode of payment, credit and debit not accepted."}
{"text":"Very good burgers! Most likely one of the best I've had. I would suggest trying the apple butter burger. The prices are very decent. 

However, my friend insists that burger factory is better. I guess that's next on the list!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cash only, homemade food, tasty masala burger. Happy customer will return to try something else out."}
{"text":"It was amazing, the staff was friendly, great service. The burger, was just amazing, the Masala burger was out of this world. The meat was real tender, the fries were great. Just great, I don't remember eating a burger as good as that in a long time"}
{"text":"I have had burgers from all over the world and On The Bun has the best Burgers I have ever had.  I am from New Jersey and whenever I have crossed the border since the summer of 2014 I have a found a way to make it to On the Bun.  The AK47 and the masala burger are my personal favorites.  From the super tasty patty to the perfect bun to go along with the right amount toppings is what one can expect at On the Bun.  The owner is also a really nice guy who always takes great care of his customers and makes sure you have a great experience at On the Bun.  If you haven't tried it out, its a must try so find a way to make it to the best burger spot around."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now. If I'm looking for halal burger options in sauga, Id pick this over burger factory or hero. My last visit i got the Salsbury Burger - burger patty, mushrooms and gravy I choose to add mozzarella cheese on top. Love their fresh cut fries with malt ....ahhh! Over all open space, fresh meat(saw them pressing the meat while I was waiting for my order) Ps its cash only!! They have an ATM in the store but I recommend coming in with cash, because those charges on the independent ATMs are killer!!"}
{"text":"Just came in, very pleasant, I think (owner) gave me a choice of saving 25% off discount until later time when I mention \"Yelp\" brought me here, tasted sauce Apple BBQ YUMMY Hopping burger is just as good. Reserved judgment for taste-5 star"}
{"text":"Good flavourings, but very low grade meat.  I would rather pay a bit more to eat real meat."}
{"text":"On the Bun is seriously one of the best burger places in the Gta. Not only do they have the juiciest patties but their customer service and staff and beyond amazing. The owner is super hands on and always ready to talk to anyone that walks in. The girls behind the counter are just as friendly. The burgers... the masala fries.... the apple butter, oh the apple butter. This place needs to be on your hit list if youre looking for satisfying burger craving. Not to mention its Halal!!! Theres nothing like it!  This place is Legit!!!!"}
{"text":"*They only take cash*

The bun was stale it was breaking apart like no tomorrow.... They need to add an option of whole wheat, ciabatta, or gluten free buns.. Its called \"On the Bun\" and they gave me a stale bun.. not cool...

The taste of the apple burger was good, regardless.
VERY casual and run down place.."}
{"text":"I'm normally a big supporter of start up restaurants with new ideas and have to admire small restaurants that attempt to start in areas with so many options like this one. Having said that, first time I was at On-the-bun Burgers  I had a fairly good experience with the food they served. Was on point with different things on the menu. However, after going there for the second and third time, I started noticing things that really turn me down. For one, this place is on the pricy side... If you really want to try a good meal, you're in to spend at least a good $15-20 on one meal. This is not bad if you consider that you are about to have a gourmet burger, but then here's the biggest issue... This place takes no credit OR debit. They do have a shady ATM machine in the back, but I am not too comfortable getting anything out of it unless it was my very last resource... Would rather drive around and get money at a known ATM. Also another issue is the cleanliness of this place... It's very dated and not clean at all. The garbage disposal stations are just really bad. They have tiny little slots that are filthy and requires you to really push your left overs and papers inside... Not a good experience at all. Lastly, on our most recent visit, my friend had to take some meds before having his food, and asked the owner to have some water.... Was told that they don't serve water because they don't have cups and that he had to buy a bottle instead..... Seriously?? At a restaurant??"}
{"text":"Quality has deteriorated significantly. First time I visited this place (year ago) , the burger was very juicy and fries were crispy and spicy!  Last weekend, I took my friends to this place saying all nice things about this burger joint. We ordered couple of burgers and fries and just after first bite, everyone looked at each other silently signalling that it was cold, bland tasteless and patty was burnt. 
Felt embarrassed."}
{"text":"I got the Apple Butter Burger combo with Masala fries, and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had (I can't remember a better one)!!! The value is great too.

Definitely at the top of my burger list. I wish they had a branch downtown Toronto.

Only lost a star because the place is not well maintained and it's cash only."}
{"text":"Delicious. I went three times within a month, and got an extra patty two of those times. The owner served me the first two times, I found him to be very kind and hospitable. The burgers are made fresh once you order, and have been juicy each time. The seating is spacious and very casual."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger and fries i had here was so good. Service and the ambiance of the place was ok. They only accept cash here but there's an atm machine available there. Definitely going back for the burgers here."}
{"text":"Wait times.......  
..... Wait times..... 
Are you guys still waiting for my review? Well get used to waiting if you go to this place. Simple burger combo will be 20 minutes. Also the portion is kind of small and the extra charges are high. If you want ketchup you have to use a no name packet on the side. Also to upgrade to a Fanta bottle the size of a can you pay 1.50 on top of the combo price. As for the burger it's whatever nothing special."}
{"text":"This stuff is really good. You must try all burgers, it is great.
If you are into Halal Burgers, this is the best.

Also, staff and management are super friendly. And prices are good"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The business owner was extremely friendly and the environment was pretty good as well. More importantly, the food was delicious! I loved the portion sizes and especially the taste. I had the apple butter burger and it's definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"The burgers are good!  I tried the apple butter because it was heir specialty and it was good, though I don't think I'd order it again because I'm not a fan of sweet burgers.  Also had the masala burger which was good.  Had the dish with the fries on the bottom topped with a patty and some our cream, green peppers and tomatoes and it was good.  The poutine was decent but again it's not something I'd typically try but did.

I will definitely be back!

They have prayer mats if you need to do your prayers.

The place was clean.

Total bill for all of the above was under $30, great deal!

Note: Cash only"}
{"text":"Best Zabiha Halal burger I've ever had.  I'm from Chicago and we don't have many places that have 100% Zabiha Halal burgers, and the places that do are mediocre.  I'm very strict about my requirements for Zabiha Halal, basically I don't eat Creekstone meat.  So no I haven't tried Epic or any of those other places.  So based upon that I thought these burgers at On the Bun Burgers were amazing.  The burger basically melts in your mouth.  You can do double burgers and mix and match.  Charm is the lady's name that is usually there and she's a sweetheart.  I legit felt like I was talking to my mother when I was ordering.  Very friendly place and honestly I wasn't expecting to like this place at all.  I highly recommend this place for their burgers!!!!  Only downside I can think of is that they only accept cash, and honestly it was only an issue because I was from Chicago and only had American Dollars."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was on the lookout for a halal burger place for my friend since I promised him I would \"make\" him one but I have no clue how to, lol! So driving around the city, I stumbled across \"On The Bun\" 
We checked in late and we weren't sure what to expect. WOW! these burgers are amazing! we ended up ordering two. The second burger was spiced with curry - What an amazing combination! 
And the beef is ground fresh everyday! Chef Mo has got talent! Make the effort and check it out."}
{"text":"A-mazing halal burgers! Customer service is very good and the owner is very kind. Very filling for the price. I love the Apple butter burger with the masala fries. Cash only though."}
{"text":"I was craving a poutine today. I'm so glad I found this place.  Mo prepared a fesh poutine for me consisting of fresh cut Yukon gold potatoes,  mushroom gravy and layered stringy mozzarella cheese.  Gravy was perfect (not salty like most others) and cheese not squeaky but good spin on the traditional curds.  Very satisfying and reminiscent of my youth in Quebec city."}
{"text":"Good enough -- though it wasn't great.
With a place like BP coming into Mississauga, it moves the expectations up. They fell a bit short -- however, if its right in your area -- its great."}
{"text":"Doesn't take cards. Had to walk out just before ordering. It is also in a sketchy strip mall and it's menu covers it's other menu that tells you what is on the burgers. I was really excited about eating here but who doesn't take cards."}
{"text":"I have been going here for months. I LOVE their masala burger, whenever I go, I want to try new burgers but then I see the masala burger and end up ordering it  
Masala burger is the result of when east meets west, if you like spicy food, you'll like it!

My family has also tried the grilled chicken burger and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"On the bun 
I wrote the wrong  location  will visit soon to update its review"}
{"text":"Giving three stars for the service!
If it was for just overall quality of burger I would give a 1 star. I found the burger tasteless. Fries were not that good either. At $12 for a combo with poutine , I can assure you they will not be seeing me again."}
{"text":"I went there one day during lunch (tbh i wanted to go to the pita place but they moved) I ordered the Poutine burger, my life changed. the food is absolutely amazing. Everything on the menu is amazing and delicious. WOULD RECOMEND."}
{"text":"The apple butter burgs are excellent."}
{"text":"AMAZING burgers! definitely no fast food burger ..these are freshly made and have that homemade feeling to them. The veggie burger made with curry and cauliflower it delicious and the size is quite large. The masala burger is phenomenal as well seeing as there is nothing else like it. The pricing was super reasonable, i'm used to paying $10+ for a good quality burger but these were all under $10"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I have been looking forward to trying this place for ages based on the incredibly positive reviews. This place lives up to the hype and more. Oh my golly. I wish I worked or lived closer to this place and I would be here all the time.

I tried the apple butter burger (no cheese) combo which came with hand-cut fries and a drink. The burger is a somewhat thin patty (but wide in circumference), but get this, it wasn't overcooked! Mine was a perfectly cooked medium. Slightly pink and so incredibly juicy and flavourful. Why can't all burger joints cook a patty like that. Why? I get so sad when burgers are cooked to a dried out well done. 

The burger came topped with finely shredded lettuce, apple butter barbecue sauce, and a bit of mayo. When I first unwrapped the burger, my heart sunk a little at the bun. It looked large. I feared it would be substantial. My fears were unfounded! This baby is a squishable pillow that perfectly held the juicy patty and saucy toppings together. This burger is very saucy and the finely shredded lettuce does get coated in the sauce and may sneak out of your bun on occassion, so you should be aware of that if you're wearing a light-coloured outfit. 

The hand-cut fries are crazy good. Any burger joint that uses frozen fries should be ashamed of themselves and should attempt to become more like On the Bun. They are doing things right. I ordered a side of their secret weapon sauce, which is apple butter barbecue, a bit of mayo, and a squirt of sriracha. They don't blend the sauce for you, so you can blend it yourself or dip your fries into various parts of the sauce to your heart's desire. It was so yummy. Get this with your fries! 

The parking lot got a bit congested on my way out, but aside from that, this was a stellar burger experience. Absolute perfection."}
{"text":"Had eaten here couple of times...food is good but not the place...boring looking dull interiors...had a good experience the first time but later found the burgers lacking the flavours and tasted blant....i think its worth a try n dats it ...nothing super exciting about it..."}
{"text":"Hands down my go to burger place!!

If anyone were to ask me, \"Hey, where's a really good place to get a really good burger?\" I would say here.

On the Bun has really good reviews, but everytime I stop by, it's always dead empty, it kinda worries me.

When I go, I only get the Salisbury and Poutine burger, anything really with gravy, so I can't speak on behalf of their other burgers. It's juicy, fresh patties made by hand (if you're lucky you can see them making the patties). Everything from the super soft burger bun to the fresh toppings is top notch!

The fries are to die for, as they proudly display bags upon bags of fresh potatoes that they cut on the daily! My favourite is getting the cajun or if you're feeling bold enough, the marsala fries!! Full of flavour! My only wish is that they give you a bigger portion of fries.

On my most recent visit, I had seen they added two additional things on the menu, and that was poutines! (finally) They have a regular poutine, and a supreme poutine I think it was called, I don't remember. But here's the kicker ...  They put a burger patty on both. Their meat patties are already deliciously seasoned and juicy as it is, I couldn't even imagine it on top of a poutine! I didn't try it, because well ... I don't think I'd be able to finish both a poutine and a burger, that'd be quite a lot. But on my next visit I totally will! The poutine looks like a meal in it self!

I highly recommend On the Bun burgers for everyone to try! It's hidden in this little run down looking plaza, and you just can't miss them, as they just got a newly renovated VERY eye popping new sign!"}
{"text":"I'm a big burger person and wanted to try something new so my fiancee and I came across this place. The reviews seemed good enough for us to want to try it soooo we did! There were two people working (one on cash and one prepping the food) so it took about 15-20 mins for our food to be ready. I ordered just the regular burger and honestly, the burgers are ok but I guess everyone has their preference. The patties were tasty and fresh but kinda thin and the buns were ordinary (I like mine a little warm and toasted). But the cajun fries were really good, I could tell they had just been made! I wouldn't go out of my way to come back if I were craving burgers but I would come back to try their poutine and other flavours."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had. I had the Apple butter burger today. It was amazing. This will be your favourite burger joint hands down."}
{"text":"Great diversity of burgers.. Ones you wont find in many places. Masala burger mondays are prime.. 9/10"}
{"text":"My Hubby and I decided to try burgers here after reading other Yelp reviews.  Hubs got the Poutine Burger combo (no veggies or sauce) and I got the Apple Butter burger (no cheese--I'm lactose-intolerant).  The cashier/owner was friendly and catered to our preferred tastes.  We were blown away by the taste and quality of the food!  The burgers tasted moist and were definitely homemade.  The sauce on the Apple Butter burger was tasty, and had a bit of a kick to it.  The Poutine burger looked exactly like what you think it should.  Washrooms, for those wondering, are single rooms for both men and women, but are clean.

If I were to change anything, I would suggest that they increase the portion of the fries that were received with the combos.  They were cut fresh and tasted excellent, but weren't enough to share.  

Overall, very tasty food.  We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to get so I got the Loaded AK-47 combo!! It came to about $11 expensive but delicious! Their burgers are all made with halal meat. Next time I'll order something a bit less expensive."}
{"text":"Quantity is really good. A burger and fries combo WILL leave you feeling full. I ordered the Salisbury burger which comes with sautéed mushrooms and lettuce as toppings. It was pretty good. Although not that thick, the party is juicy and flavourful. I added mozerella cheese to my burger which I think really helped. I'm not sure I would've liked it without the cheese. The Cajun fries are really good! Very close to the fries at five guys so you know it's good. Portion sizes for the fries are normal though - not overload like five guys but not stingy like hero burger. 

I also tried the masala burger and masala fries which I thought were too spicy/salty for my taste. The masala flavour was too south Asian tasting but my dad enjoyed it. I personally don't like that flavour for my burgers. 

Apple butter burger is a hit! Slightly sweet taste to it and definitely a cheesier burger than the other two burgers I tried. 

Overall it's a decent halal burger place. I don't think any of the burgers were packed with flavour and the buns were a little big and flaky. Despite that, I would come here again if I were in the area :)"}
{"text":"Loved the gourmet burger and fries. The chicken sandwich was perfectly done. Great poutine as well as soft drink selection. Service was fast and friendly. Straws available."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Ordered the Apple Butter burger combo and it was definetley one of the best burgers I've ever had, it had the perfect amount of kick. The burger was made fresh, right in front of our eyes. I also upgraded my fries to a poutine, which was also very tasty. The portions were the right amount, enough to be full but not to a point where you start feeling sick. 

The staff was very friendly, and even though we came not too long before closing time, they allowed us to stay there to finish our meals. Overall, I had a great experience and will be going back there everytime I have a craving for a juicy burger. 

Tip: They ONLY accept cash so be ready for that, they do have an ATM in the restaurant which charges $1.50 to withdraw."}
{"text":"I will have to downgrade my review after my last visit. I cant get over the fact its cash only, its 2016. The food is good, but prices are on the steep side for a proper combo. I refuse to use an ATM that is from a unknown company. Please serve guests water if requested!"}
{"text":"To be honest I am very picky when it comes to any food. So I am just going to say that the place was good, the ambiance was Ok, & the service was good.

The only thing that I am still wondering, are the burger patties, it seemed like those frozen patties that you could buy at any grocery store, and I have a huge beef with that, if burger a joint does not make their own patties, for me it is not worth it, but hey was it better than McDonalds and Burger King? For sure!


P.S It is Halal!"}
{"text":"Really good place. Quality burger and the meat is fresh. The owner over charged me and without even asking came up and refunded the money. Now that is an honest way to run business."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a meeting after seeing some positive reviews and I must say the people are right!   Had the Salisbury burger and upgraded my fries to a poutine and it was delicious!  The patty itself and grilled to order and the bun is moist, not dry or chalky at all which is common problem with burger joints.  The poutine tasted great and was seasoned well,  the double fried fries were done properly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  On top of that the workers there were very friendly and accommodating when helping me make my selection since it was my first time, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday and ordered the special which happened to be a \"Masala\" burger which comes with fries and a drink.  The burger is prepared on a flat top and taste was unique (good) due to the masala seasoning I guess.  It came well done and was a bit on the thinner side compared to other burgers I've had recently.  The bun was fluffy and moist and slightly larger proportion to meat.  Toppings are scarce.  The fries are really good!  The guy working seemed very nice and place is spacious with plenty of seating.   3 Stars."}
{"text":"The place needs to look better. Very low quality feel of the restaurant. Burgers are great. Only accepts cash. It's 2016, where's Debit and Credit. 

Service is very slow as well. They need more staff. Clearly have to stop saving on labour and give better customer service."}
{"text":"I had the Masala burger.  The burger itself was fresh and toppings also fresh.   But the bilun was huge compared to the burger.  Do you remember the old Wendy's commercial?   \"Where's the beef?\"   If they are going to keep the burger size then they need to reduce the bun size.   $10.50 for the burger, fries and a can of pop is a pretty solid value.  Fries were very fresh and home cut."}
{"text":"The interesting thing about eating in Toronto is good food is found in odd industrial places. This burger restaurant was closed when I pulled up. I asked the chef if he would take my order. He accepted. I just ordered a cheeseburger cause I could tell the Chef was exhausted. This is probably the best burger I have ever had. I travel globally and love Burgers. The bun is soft, the meat is tender and the onions have a fresh sting to them.
The only gripe is the form of payment is cash. The furniture looks like it was purchased from a bankrupt restaurant. But who cares! I am not moving in."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and chicken burgers. Masala fries are amazing. The pricing is okay, even good if you get the daily special. It is cash only which limits how often I end up here(thankfully). Yes the fries portion is \"small\" compared to some other places, but the fries are high quality and fill me up perfectly - not too much. Overall, this place has good fresh food, and the owner is always friendly."}
{"text":"Over the weekend my friend and I had intense cravings for burgers and fries. Did a little search on Yelp and BAM - this place shows up!

This place is situated at a random plaza right by Eglinton and Maingate. It's always good to find a hidden gem so close to home. *YAY*

Their burgers are I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E. Not only were their patties unbelievably moist, their burgers were loaded and definitely unique. I would say their burgers were a hybrid of Five Guys and Burgers Priest. Five guys because of the moist handmade patties and Burgers Priest because of it's uniqueness!

I ordered the Apple Butter Burger with Masala Fries. While my friend ordered the Loaded AK-47 with stacked supreme. Everything was delicious! Safe to say I devoured everything in less than 10 minutes.

This is definitely my new favourite burger joint! The only reason I'm giving it a 4 stars is because for one, they only accept cash (which sucks btw!) and two, I asked for a side of mayo and they charge $1 for a little container of mayo. What? Really? McDonald's doesn't even charge for mayo or any of the other local burger joints either...
Hmph!

**Oh update - the mayo on the website says it's 50 cents not $1.Yea, yea, I know I'm pouting over 50 cents lol. But still...I could've gotten two containers of mayo instead of one!"}
{"text":"I saw all of the great reviews so I decided to venture out to Mississauga and give this place a shot and I'm really glad I did. Honestly for the price you pay here you're getting an extremely good deal. They have a variety of interesting burgers to choose from.

I ordered the Gourmet burger which came with melted mozzarella cheese and garlic seasoning on top along with a variety of sauces. The burger was amazing from the get go even the buns here are great, nice and soft. The meat was juicy and cooked to perfection and the seasonings added a great kick.

I would definitely go here more often if it were closer for me, only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 stars is because they're cash only which is a bit inconvenient."}
{"text":"Cash only - and when this is the criteria, I expect awesome food.  

Well, On the Bun was On the Money for me today.  Arrived at 3:30 for a late lunch and the spcials only go from 11 to 3, so I asked if I could still get the special combo (Gourmet burger combo) for $8 and the owner said \"sure, no problem\".  Props to him for not being a stickler.

So as for the food itself, the gourmet burger was amazing as the beef patty was fresh, and it had mozza cheese on it that was nice and melted.  I upgraded to the Masa fries and those were so freakin good!  It was like the old NY Fries when they had trans-fat in them (I miss trans-fat lol) and then you added a bunch of Cajun spice...mmm...so good.  So, yeah it was good. 

Only some slight negatives here:
-You have to wait about 10-15 minutes for your burger, which isn't bad and is kind of standard these days, but I hate waiting. 

-They put the food receipt underneath your fries when you order the combo.  That's kind of weird considering the receipt comes out of the cash register and inside the register may not be the cleanest.  

However, I guess that's the price of eating at a \"greasy spoon\" burger joint.  Still something that's pretty good once in a while, but if you have it every week, I think you'd definitely have heart issues (AK 47 burger looks fully loaded and ready to take aim at your arteries)."}
{"text":"Had the apple butter burger combo which was tasty but the burger size was small and the size of the bun overpowered the burger....too much bread.

Toppings were ok but nothing special. 
Increase the burger size and change the bun so there isn't as much bread and it would be closer to a 4+"}
{"text":"Good bite.
Slow staff.
Don't take credit cards.
But there's a ATM machine which will charge you a ridiculous fee to get cash out. Please be sure to have cash on you as they don't accept cards.

Will not come again."}
{"text":"mmmmm-mmmm, tastes gooooood!

I enjoyed  the apple butter and barbecue sauce burger from bun-to-patty. My sidekick enjoyed the masala burger. The sauce added just the right amount of extra special flavour without masking out the meat.

I've had a hard time finding this place, not sure why, but finally located it. It does front on Eglinton Ave between a handful of storefront businesses."}
{"text":"Blend Taste.I am so surprised to see the comments as ppl seem to like it.I guess they don't seem to know how the burger should taste like it.Buns were old and meat was not so fresh.Dear ownerPlease use AAA meat and stop forcing customer to use ATM"}
{"text":"Super sweet service, big space and not that many tables. Comfy booths and cafeteria type set up. 

The pictures on the menu boards make you salivate before you have a change to order!

Dinner under $8? HELL YEA 

Got the veggie burger loaded with the free toppings ^_^ 

Their home made hot sauce was bomb. Burger had a weird texture so I couldn't tell what the ingredients were but good. The bun was light and delicious as well. 

My friend asked for no bun and they made it a great salad. 

Will be back for their fries!"}
{"text":"*NOTE: CASH ONLY*

Came here this week for lunch and had to question why I don't come by more often! Juicy burgers and awesome fries. I had the Salisbury burger (mushrooms, sautéed onions + gravy) this visit - probably my favourite from the menu. 

Customer service is great - I think I've seen the owner every time I've visited and he's very friendly. 

25% off a combo with your first Yelp check-in is a pretty sweet deal!

Would love to see a couple more speciality toppings (e.g. goat cheese, jalapeños)."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!
Burgers were huge!
Portions were huge!
Could barely finish!

Long lineups so order everything at once or you will be stuck waiting for 15 mins until your turn again. 

Get the AK47 burger!! 

Will return! Last visited in spring 2014"}
{"text":"First time here, had the apple butter burger with fries. Both were very tasty and freshly made. Owner was super friendly and will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"I tried the apple butter burger which was recommended by the cashier. I was a bit hesitant but it was absolutely delicious! Everything tasted really fresh and the bread was super soft as well. I had the regular fries which were fine nothing particularly special but they are fresh cut which was nice. My friend ordered the masala fries- I'm not a huge fan of masala seasonings and it was a little spicy for me so I wasn't a huge fan but I think someone who enjoys that sort of flavor and spice would really enjoy them. The service was super quick and the cashier was really friendly as well. I can't wait to go back and try the Salisbury burger!"}
{"text":"Great quality at first I was a little skeptical because of how it looked it's not the fanciest place but everything is made of fresh to order

 I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with an upgrade to cajun fries and it was a decent portion sized grill chicken breast that was sliced to make sure it was cooked the full way through it was so juicy I had zero complaints the cajun fries I wasn't impressed but they want awful they were okay overall I was happy with my meal and I was full"}
{"text":"Most burgers were bland, except Loaded AK47. For the burgers alone, the place is probably a 3.5/5.

However, CASH ONLY is such a turn off, yes they have an ATM literally by the counter, but I don't see any reason for a place to be of this size having cash only unless they are into some shady business. If it was a low scale mom/pop shop, then cash would have made a little more sense.
They can afford to have an ATM machine in the shop but can't have an interac/credit machine?

I can't bring myself to support such businesses. For halal burgers, there are much better options in downtown."}
{"text":"Love that marsala burger! I really like how soft their buns are. Haven't really had a bun like that anywhere else. I've been here a few times and always walk away full and happy. 

One thing I don't like as much is that they plate up the fries/poutine before their burgers are ready. I just watch them sitting on the counter getting cold for a minute or two before that tasty burger is wrapped up and put in the basket. The fries are still warm but they're not piping hot like I know they could be. I've been there several times and love that the fries are made fresh each time, but watching them sit negates all that special-ness."}
{"text":"Gotta say this place is surprisingly a gem. I used to frequent the previous joint Pita Grill but when these guys opened I didn't think they'd last. 

Boy was I wrong. Quality ingredients made the old school way. My brother had a burger and said it tasted home made. This is what it's all about! And the prices can't be beat. 

I'd only say there is one thing to improve on... Their delivery I've ordered for family twice from here and each time had items I've paid for forgotten. First time was fries second time was the soft drink and the side order of gravy. They really need to either get a new delivery service or to speak to their existing one! That's not acceptable to me. 
Since that is the only reason I docked them for 1 star otherwise, it would have been a five star review! 

Oh one last thing they really need a proper website! Not just a Facebook page. Since it doesn't really explain their menu items at all!"}
{"text":"Tried the Masala Burger and Poutine fries. For the first time, Yelp led me wrong. I was quite disappointed. The bun was dry and the burger was just confusing. The fries... Meh. 

Also as an FYI: it's cash only."}
{"text":"Went back with the family and must say we really enjoy this place. 
Great customer service, great food, clean establishment. 
Burgers are great and the fries are kick ass.

One thing would be nice. Having bottled Ketchup for those dinning in. I like my ketchup and most definitely takes a while to get the fries ready with those little packets!"}
{"text":"Halal Meat is served here per signs on Restaurant. Went here recently and made a large order to go. Staff was kind enough to give us a discounted price. We ordered the Salisbury Burger, Grilled Chicken Burger, Stacked Supreme Fries, Masala Burger, Masala Fries and Regular Fries. The Salisbury had gravy and mushrooms and tasted good. The Grilled Chicken Burger also tasted pretty good. The Stacked Supreme Fries has chopped up burger, cheese and sour cream on top and was pretty good. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Thought I would check this place out, especially since it offers a halal burger. I ordered the Masala Burger combo. The burger is a smallish burger on a big bun, which perhaps is healthier than a big burger on a small bun, but then I wonder why it costs $13 for a combo. The Masala Burger does have a spicy Indian masala taste (if you like that), so perhaps that makes it worth the price. It's a pretty good halal burger place with some interesting variety on the menu, but it's not up there with, say, Hero Burger."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!! The place is small and seems hidden. It is not located in a food plaza so not many people know about it. Burgers are fresh and delicious. Service is excellent. I tried the apple butter BBQ burger and it was delicious. It is a must go place if you are looking for halal burgers. I would recommend this more than burger factory or hero burger."}
{"text":"Excellent quality gourmet burgers and fries. Downside, no credit cards or even debit cards accepted, so come with cash."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious. We stopped by for a quick lunch and enjoyed the small cozy diner."}
{"text":"For utter fast-food satisfaction, look no further. Seriously, the burger patties are plump, generously sized and well-prepared, regardless of what type you order- though the apple butter type is a personal favourite. While On The Bun suffers from a few drawbacks such as a rather deviated location, ordinary decor, mundane food presentation and an altogether boring appearance; it boasts an incredible array of craving-inducing food to wipe the superficialities from your mind as soon as you take a bite. 

I've tried all the variations of the burgers, and all are truly some of the best burgers I've had in the Greater Toronto area. The options are cleverly designed and quite independent from one another so there's something for different moods. Spicy, savoury, sweet, cheesy- it's all there. The sides are also just as good, I highly recommend the poutine. Even though there's no cheese curds on the poutine it's bloody undeniable. A poutine/burger combo can be very filling however, so don't hesitate to opt for the perfectly fried and salted fries. Really, I wouldn't give any of the menu items I've had here anything lower than a 7/10.

Prices are easily justifiable, on-par or lower than sit-down burger joints like Hero Burger, Lick's or South St. While On The Bun doesn't have the brand, fit and finish or fame like the others, they most certainly have the taste and that coveted non-commercial almost home cooked feel to the food. You can walk away with a combo for around $11 which will definitely conquer that fast-food desire."}
{"text":"Learned about this place from Yelp, go Yelp!

Easy spot to miss, but worth checking out.
Fries are crispy and the gravy delicious.  Burger was fresh, handmade, nicely seasoned and juicy without being messy.
I am a fan."}
{"text":"Are you people that deprived of good halal joints that you can't even tell what's good? Apple butter burger was full of fat and tasted so gamey! Bun was way too big. Sauce was a regular BBQ. Go check out Hero Burger or Mushkaki instead. You're even better off going to burger factory. If you can make the trek, Kensington market has 2 halal burger joints that top this place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my absolute favorite burger places!

I ordered the apple butter burger with masala fries and my husband got the stacked supreme. The apple butter burger was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of sweetness in between a savory patty and lightly toasted bun. They have some amazing flavors that are definitely not your typical burger. 

The only negative thing I can possibly say is the stacked supreme which was disappointing. The idea of fries mixed with beef patty sounds delicious, but when we ordered it but both my husband and I were disappointed at the portion size and the taste was just alright. 

Aside from the stacked supreme fries, the burgers here are absolutely sublime and I can't wait to try out the other flavors soon!"}
{"text":"Fries were large size, juicy and just good. Marsala burger is where India meets America .  Tasty moist Marsala meat on a white soft bun. They deliver too. One of the best reasons to come to Canada."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I'm not from the area but was up in Toronto for a trade show for 3 days and we didn't like any of the food offered at the show so we decided to take a shot with getting some burgers delivered.   We loved the food so much we had it 2 times in 3 days.  The staff was beyond helpful as I had some tricky orders, he was patient and nice.

I got a cheeseburger with everything on it both times and it exceeded all expectations.  The cajun fries were good also.

The secret weapon sauce was interesting also, I couldnt figure it out."}
{"text":"I tried the apple butter burger with masala fries just like the reviews suggested. It was just ok. The burger itself tastes homemade but was a bit dry. I thought that there was too much bun for the burger. The fries were really greasy. There are better burger joints out there."}
{"text":"Great place, with great food. Try the AK 47 burger, top notch. Only thing I didn't like is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"Excellent burger joint. Not the CRAZIEST of choices, but a lot of delicious ones. Might instantly be my second favorite place to get burgers."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fancy place inside and particularly outside. One would never notice it on that industrial strip mall, and that would be a bad thing because they make a very tasty burger."}
{"text":"Five Guys...MOVE OVER because Mississauga has a new burger king in town!  

This place opened up a few months ago and up 'til now, it remains one of Mississauga's best kept secrets.  While this place serves up poutine burgers, masala burgers and apple butter (smoked BBQ) burgers, what sets them apart from their competition is the quality of the ingredients they use.  The owner prides himself on only using very high quality meats and once you bite into their burgers, you'll know why.  While they may not have all of the gourmet toppings that some of the premium burger joints downtown offer, the burgers here are the juiciest in town and cooked to perfection.

My recommendation would be to go for the Poutine Burger with a side of masala fries and you will not be dissappointed...  

In terms of ambience, it is a very spacious restaurant with plenty of booth seating.  The prices are great...particularly for the quality of food you are getting.  Most importantly, the management is really friendly and truly puts love into each meal.  I've been a regular here since they've opened and I've had nothing but great experiences thus far.  I'm happy to have finally found a real burger joint to hit the spot after a hard day's work...thank you On the Bun!

ps. all menu items are halal."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from these guys and it was a lovely day. They have some of the best burger patties that have ever graced my tastebuds. And the unique combinations they have are perfect for me! Will definitely come again as much as my wallet allows!"}
{"text":"So my friend and I had a craving for burgers and instead of going to Five Guys, Harvey's, etc... we did some research on Yelp and found this place! Not going to lie, it's kind of in a random location, but it's definitely a hidden gem in Mississauga! 

To start off, the place was decent in size, but the booths were outdated. They could definitely add more seating with the amount of empty space they had, but eh. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. 

Here comes the best part.... THE FOOD! So the have quite a unique menu. They had a lot of speciality burgers and fries. I ordered the Loaded AK 47 and the Stacked Supreme and my friend ordered the Apple Butter Burger with Masala fries. Everything was absolutely amazing!! 

The Loaded AK 47 had three mozzarella sticks in between two patties! It tasted incredible! If you're like me and you don't hold back on your cheat days, this is definitely the winner! The cheese oozes out of the mozzarella sticks with every bite and the patties were very juicy. The only thing I could complain is the buns. I thought the buns would be nice and toasted, but it wasn't. Seemed like they just grabbed the buns out of the bag and just threw it on there. So the bun was fluffy and broke apart easily, which I didn't like. Other than that, I would totally recommend this Burger! 

The Stacked Supreme consisted of fries, tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream and one cheese burger (without the buns) cut up! It was so good! There was so much cheese and I loved it! The fries were nice and crispy and the cut up cheese burger was juicy! 

Overall, I would totally recommend this place to all the burger lovers out there! I'm definitely planning to go back! My favourite burger spot in Mississauga!

P.S. It was cash only!"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem in Mississauga. Been here a handful of times. I've tried the Masala burger, Masala fries, Cajun fries, and Apple Butter burger. 

You can tell this place knows what they're doing. The beef patties are made fresh and it's made obvious by how the beef crumbles, the way ground beef should. The bun is nice, warm, and fluffy. The Masala burger is my favourite as the seasoning gives the burger so much depth of flavour. Could have been spicier, but it tastes great nonetheless. The Apple butter burger for me was decent, couldn't quite taste the apple and to me it tasted very much like plain ol' BBQ sauce. It is still very good and I would order that if I'm craving for something saucey.

The fries are good because of the seasoning, although they could be crispier. I prefer the Masala, but Cajun is very good too. This is my favourite burger joint in Mississauga with Golden Star in North York a close second."}
{"text":"I got apple  butter burger and boyfriend got Salisbury burger with staked supreme. Oh my god. It is better than five guys and any other burger stores. If you are looking for a cheap and good burger, You should try it! So fresh, clean, friendly. I am gonna go back to eat burgers again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and stumbled on this place.

I was intrigued by the four star rating and 30 odd reviews given that I've never heard of this place and as a true burger lover I could not in good conscience not try it out. 

Then I saw the 25% off with any combo if you check in and that made the decision that much easier.

Walked in to find a fairly generic and reasonably sized burger joint with a friendly guy at cashier and some interesting menu options. They have a daily deal ranging between $8-9 and today it was the Masala burger which I went with. This gets you the burger, fries, and a can of pop.

The meal is fast food style with you picking up your own drink and condiments from the front. 

What I found interesting is that this place has an interesting take on the burger concept - they focus on their Apple Butter burger (best seller according to the guy at cashier) and the Masala burger is also popular. They also seem to have a decent selection of loaded poutines which I may try next go round.

The burger: bun was nice and soft but not especially memorable. The burger patty was juicy, flavourful, and done just on the rarer side of medium which was perfect. Dressed with lettuce and some sauces it's a perfectly enjoyable tasty burger that's an alternative to your usual fast food level burger. The fries were OK (no complaints about them)

Unless I'm mistaken I view this as a fast food alternative and I believe it's Halal as well which is a selling point where it's located. This is by no means a gourmet burger experience. Rather think of it as an opportunity to try a tasty variation of a tried and true go to meal (the proverbial burger and fries). Viewed through that lens it's a nice meal for less than 10 dollars. I'm not quite sure it's 4 stars but then again it's better than average giving it a solid 3.5 stars in my book. (Not sure how to do half stars on the rating hence the 4 stars)

Would go back. 3.5 stars out of 5.
Final point - the 25% check in discount does not apply to the daily combo."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try since we were tourists. It is really good and really clean! Husband cheese burger and I ordered poutine fries. Both were really good and filling.
My husband and I loved it :) would definitely come again when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Had the Philly Chicken, it was really good. I definitely will be going back. However, they do need more than 2 chicken options."}
{"text":"The workers are really nice and it is a big, open restaurant with lotz of different burger flavours.

I did not enjoy the food. 

The Apple butter BBQ sauce hamburger didn't have any flavour and the fries tasted kind of bitter and earthy.

Plus he gave the girls next to me a bigger portion of fries than I got *grrrrrr.

I will not be returning.

P.s. cash only"}
{"text":"Horrible place for a burger. The patty looked so rare and undercooked it looked like the cow was still alive. The bun, which the restaurant is known for, was nasty, soggy and looked like someone peed on it. And, the price was outrageous. They only accepted cash, which was fine, but didn't tell us until after we ordered that there was an 8 dollar fee to use US dollars. This restaurant sucks...Never coming back"}
{"text":"This burger place is definitively a hidden gem. 
Great service and friendly staff. 

Their number one seller (according to their employee) 'Apple Butter Burger' has made to top of my favourite burger list. It is one of the best burger I've ever had. The patty is cooked to perfection, it's juicy and thick,  the apple butter sauce goes well with everything, and the big buns soaks up all the sauces and extra juices so no messiness.

The 'Masala Burger' is not as heavy as ABB in terms of sauces, and has a curry taste to it. It's a bit spicy, and you also have an option of adding extra spicy sauce. 

The 'Salisbury Burger' is another one of my favorites! Lots of gravy and meaty! Yum!

The poutine was also great but I'm gonna stick to regular fries next time as it was a bit too heavy for me and their regular fries are pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great burger made from fresh ground beef and hand-formed patties - this is the place! Oh, and by the way, the fresh-cut fries are awesome. We have been looking for a go-to burger place and this is it."}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few of the popular halal burger joints in the city but this is my favorite.  Their Apple butter bbq sauce burger is amazing.  And their lunch specials can't be beat... approximately $8+tax will get you a burger fries and drink.  Please don't get rid of this special ever.  The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is that they only accept cash.. Please start accepting debit and/or credit."}
{"text":"Came here with friends after getting disappointed in a mexican restaurant. A friend had tried this place and was raving about the food so thought of trying it out. We ordered veggie and chicken burgers along with masala fries. When the orders arrived, the patty was overcooked to the point of being burnt. The buns were cold and were not at all toasted. The masala fries were good and thats why the one star. I really wanted to like the place but was utterly disappointed."}
