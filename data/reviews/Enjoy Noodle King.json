{"text":"The noodles was not that good after all, they are dry and hard to chew. The fried fish skin was cooked with some herbs that are not suitable for every body, if you like lamb chop, then that was for you.  The hot sauce sweet, sour and hot minced meat noodles was not cooked traditional way, they are cooked using some kind of Japanese style sauce, maybe not suitable for every one.   The place was pretty compact, services were good, however the food qualities have room to improve.  If they can do it more traditional way, they might be able to retent more customers and maybe  return customers."}
{"text":"came here after reading some reviews on Yelp.  was fairly disappointed after the meal.  the noodles had a funny taste to it and the soup was pretty salty (and i love salt).    i ordered dry noodles with beef tendon, shrimp wonton and shrimp/pork dumpling.  they gave me about 4 pieces of tendon and 2 pieces each of the dumplings.  also had a side of veggies and crispy fish skin.   can't say too much positive things about this place.  tables were pretty small and tight.  the hot chilly oil was not even hot at all.  hot sauce you get at Taco Bell were hotter tasting than the oil there.  if you are looking for wonton noodle places, there are plenty of other ones that are better in my opinion.    will i come back... can't say I will.  place was nothing special and the noodles tasted funny to me."}
{"text":"Easily wins the award for Worst Service.   I never write reviews, but this place was absolutely ridiculous I feel the need to share my family's experience.   Our relatives were here visiting Toronto. Since we heard of this place on the radio, we thought we would take them here!  There were 8 of us in total. When we arrived, there were 2 other tables already eating. We took a look at the menu, but a few of my relatives couldn't decide what they wanted. So we wanted to go ahead and order a few orders first, and the rest later.  The waitress took our orders, went over to the kitchen and then we can hear the man in the kitchen (we think he may even be the owner) say: \"Well, I'm not starting the stove until all of them have ordered. Wait until all of them order\".   At this point, we should have just gotten up and left. Save you the hassle from starting your precious stove! But we didn't want to embarrass our relatives, so we just ordered whatever.  It's one this thing receive horrible service but get GOod food.... It's another thing to get horrible service AND still get horrible food!  The noodles were definitely not worth all the hype. And the wontons were a joke. What kind of wontons don't have shrimp in them? They were hard and tasteless. Frozen wontons in the supermarkets taste better.  Whether it's the food or the service, there are plenty of better noodle joints in the area.  Horrible service + horrible attitude + horrible food.  Needless to say, we would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"We came to this small little noodle joint on a Saturday around 1pm, the restaurant had just filled up so we waited about 10 minutes for a table.    I ordered the beef tendon noodles. The beef tendon was hard and crunchy,  they weren't cooked long enough as it should've been soft and gelatinous.   My parents each had the shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup. They said the wontons were only okay.   We all liked the noodles which were cooked perfectly and handmade in house.   The soup was lacking seasoning ( nothing a little soy sauce didn't fix).  Overall didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"The Hong Kong style bamboo noodles are delicious!   Noodle - it's made in store! It's great that it's  not too alkaline otherwise it leaves a weird after taste. The texture is perfect, not too soft and even after its soaked in noodles, it doesn't become soggy.  Soup base - made from scratch!  Toppings - so far my favourite topping is the pork dumplings... kind of like wontons. It has a very good floral-like flavour unlike most dumplings that seem salty and just heavy with meat. If you like beef brisket or tendon, it's a must try.  Tendon is a little on the soft side for my personal liking, but tasty indeed.  One of their specialty is the shrimp egg on \"lo mein\" (egg noodles with soup on the side with hoisin sauce). It's unique but personally I find it a bit dry in texture.  Price ~$6+ and up for a bowl of noodles and you can top it with extra noodles for only $1.50! It almost doubles in size. Other side dishes include vegetables, dumplings,and  fried fish skin (tastes like chips) just to name a few.  Location - I drove in circles around the mall the first time around since I can't read Chinese and the English name of the store is on the glass, quite hard to read. It's to the right of Cha Time.   I've been back 3 times so far. It's the best bamboo noodle place that I've tried so far in Toronto."}
{"text":"Three stars at best. Kept hearing about this from friends and family members so had to try it out. Went with my mom. She had the beef brisket and I had the shrimp and pork wanton noodles. Mom found the brisket to be very salty.  The wanton are comparable to   most mediocre chinese restaurants. I personally think chim jai Kee is way better. At least their wanton are huge."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Interesting place for sure. I got attracted to this restaurant from a newspaper ad my grandaunt brought to me, so we decided to try this place out for lunch.  When we arrived at around 12:30 it wasn't too busy. However by the time it got to 1 there was a lineup out the door! Considering the wealth of food options in this plaza, it was a good sign.  I ordered the squid, beef and fish ball noodle. My grandma ordered the beef  tendon noodle, and my grandaunt ordered the pork wonton noodle. We also added a side of fried fish skin and choy mue vegetables.  The portions for me were just right; if you're a big eater you can also ask for double portions for an extra $1.50. The noodles themselves were very unique, and the fact it's not yellow means that the noodles are naturally made with no artificial add-ins...so it's actually better white than yellow. I personally liked the noodles a bit more than Jim Chai Kee. The toppings were about average, though I noticed there was some extra pepper added to the beef balls.  Both the females were satisfied with their bowls of noodles as well, however the beef tendon was a little bit on the hard side. The veggies were even harder, to the point I wouldn't even think of ordering them next time. Also of note, the vinegar in the restaurant is not the strong kind...you might need to put a lot of it down to get that flavour.  We liked the noodles so much that we bought the raw kind for us to take home, which comes in a pack of 4 noodles.  Service was also great considering how busy the restaurant was eventually. There was always someone we can wave down, and nobody unnecessarily raised their voices, which was pretty much what you expect from Asian treatment.  I personally liked this place and would come back, but I'm not a huge wonton noodle person. Still, I'd recommend this place to my friends as an alternative to Jim Chai Kee (only for the noodles though)."}
{"text":"Enjoy King Noodle, the star is the noodle that made in house using a bamboo to pound on the noodle to give it the nice chewy texture.  It is as good as promised?!  Pork and Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup ($5.50)   The noodle was cooked perfectly and has this amazing texture. So bouncy, so chewy. Maybe one of the best noodle I ate in GTA.   The wonton though was so boring in comparison. But the wonton wrappings supposed to be handmade using the same method.   The line was crazy for my first attempt here during lunch time, but there was no wait at all when I was there around 3 pm weekday afternoon.  Go try the noodle and find out for yourself if it is really that good.   Cash Only."}
{"text":"totally not feeling the noodles.. i thought it was going to be wonton noodles like many of the wonton joints..   the noodles here did not have bite... does not have that satisfying slight crunch kind of factor.. it just wasnt impressive.. its not yellow. its was more on the white side in color....  the hot chilli oil was not that fragrant and spicy as i would like.. and the vinegar seemed very concentrated..(not necessarily a bad thing) but did not taste as good as other wonton noodle houses...   i dont think i would return here.. as there are way better places like jim chai kee which has amazing hot chilli oil and big wontons...   ps. they only have pork wonton"}
