{"text":"This location with the Freshii collaboration is more of a family hangout then a coffee bar like my the downtown location. A lot of seating so that's nice. Much less hectic. A nice place to spend some time with my daughter. Coffee and baked goods are one point as always. Chocolate cookies are worth the trip alone. Always super friendly and authentic service."}
{"text":"Another Strange Love opened up kitty corner to Starbucks on Yonge/Roxborough St West. Unlike its downtown location the interior is rather sterile & plain and they also share the space with Freshii.  The espresso drinks aren't necessarily better tasting but they are better trained to make your drinks than Starbucks' baristas. Definitely the new kid on the block, this place I'm sure will be a big rival to the giant corporate coffee chain once people discover this new location."}
{"text":"First it started closing on the weekend.  Then the lovers latte was removed from the menu. It's appalling how this once charming coffee shop has disintegrated over time."}
{"text":"Better coffee than the nearby places plus more seating. You can combine lunch from Freshii with your coffee. There aren't many choices for good coffee in Rosedale so Strange Love is a welcome addition. Easy walk from Rosedale subway station."}
