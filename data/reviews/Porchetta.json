{"text":"Absolutely delicious well-done porchetta. A must-try. (I have not tried the sandwich)I don't live near and I won't even mind traveling back just to get some more! And try some zepolla for dessert! OMG delicious as well."}
{"text":"I'm working near this joint, so finally decide to go and taste their meals. It was a good experience. Definitely like it!"}
{"text":"Spotted this petite sandwich shop after a long day of sightseeing. Walked by it twice, actually, before going in. We ordered a classic porchetta sandwich with hot peppers & broccoli rabe (raipini) to go. Thought we'd share it over a bottle of wine in our nearby hotel before our late night dinner reservations since we skipped lunch. By 6:30, we canceled our dinner reservations, walked back to Porchetta & ordered another sandwich the same way. It was excellent. Place was clean, employees were genuine & knowledgeable. What a find?!"}
{"text":"Best porchetta I've had in Montreal.  Just the right amount of crunchy crust in the panini."}
{"text":"Just grabbed some meals to go with a few friends. Two of us got the porchetta plate and two had the sandwich. Consensus is that the sandwich plus a side is a better deal than the plate (which comes with meat and a side). The porchetta is flavourful; definitely the highlight (which explains the name of the restaurant).   The side of potatoes was a bit disappointing; taste-wise nice but the texture felt like they were under the heat lamp too long. The zappole were a nice, zesty end to the meal.  Overall, a tad oily and on the pricier side for me, but worth a visit if you're craving tasty pork  (A friendly observation would be to revisit the takeaway packaging. The containers are huge for the portion size.)"}
{"text":"Would of given 5 stars but my experiences were mixed. First time I found the porchetta to be delicious. The hunk of meat they cut off of just looks spectacular. Fat is rendered down beautifully. Second time I went though was about 20 minutes before closing time and the pork was alot dryer and not as great. Im hoping it was just because it was the end of the night but should of still been delicious. I do wish they included a bit more crispy skin in the sandwich though."}
{"text":"As a big porchetta fan, this place did not meet my expectations.  First off, the porchetta panino consisted of a lot of mayo and meat on a bun. No lettuce, no tomato, no cheese, nada. After roaming around Italy and trying a variety of sandwiches topped with fresh ingredients and condiments, this was very underwhelming. Not to mention, the guy making them seemed to have no interest whatsoever in making and serving paninis. Needless to say, the lack of love was apparent.   The meat itself was dry, while the sandwich extremely oily. We also tried the mortadella, which  unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed.   After spending $25 on 2 sandwiches and potatoes, we felt a little disappointed all around."}
{"text":"Got the porchetta sandwich dressed with spicy oily traditional Italian peppers and peso. The pork was juicy, fatty and crispy as I like it. Got the fried chicken with a hint of honey which made my meal. Considering I'm Italian, This is the type of food and to the right accuracy of what I would eat at my nonna's place."}
{"text":"Delicious and special as the real Italian porchetta. Try also their zeppole: you'll love them."}
{"text":"It's weird how i will delay trying something that's right under my nose for so long.  Not this time, i finally grabbed a porchetta sandwich and half-chicken for work.  This is about as upscale as a take-out counter can be, beautiful floor, decor and presentation.  There are 3 types of porchetta ($8), i tried the one with marinated onions and french mustard. The sandwich is not gigantic but it is loaded with meat, a few items like tomato and raw onions would have helped for me. The closest thing i can compare it to is the Portuguese bifana sandwich but the quality and the cut of meat is much superior.   I brought the chicken for guys at work but tasted some of it and it is exquisite rotisserie style with the most heavenly potatoes ($12 and they threw in a bread when i asked). The only thing missing is some type of hot sauce for the chicken, but I always have my own on standby.  There are more locations now and there's also Porco in NDG, so maybe our fair city is falling in love with another delicacy."}
{"text":"I was soooo excited that they opened a location closer to me. When I finally made it in for lunch, I ordered the classic porchetta sandwich and both arancini balls. The sandwich bread was extra crispy, like hard to chew crispy and the porchetta was dry despite being dredged in an oily herb sauce. After the first few bites, I did not feel like I was on the streets of Italy, so they claim - all I felt was heavy grease dripping down my hands oozing from the other end of my sandwich.  The arancini tasted like it was sitting out for a while and was not crispy at all, like arancini should be. The filling was worse, mostly all rice, barely any cheese, very bland and they didn't even have a sauce to help it along. What a disappointment. Overpriced imo, especially since there are more competitive, student friendly sandwich spots in that area. All that sadness plus a drink costed $25.  It's a cool concept, I wanted to love this place, can't say I did; still, lots of potential contingent upon improvements."}
{"text":"I can't write too long of a review for this place because my experience was fast. I was in little Italy one night, hanging at a friend's house when I got a crazy hunger attack. I believe it was almost 11:00pm and thankfully La Porchetta was still open. I order the pork sandwich which was really good. The meat was juicy, tender, succulent and full of flavour. They use good quality fresh panini bread. The only thing negative I could think of was that it was a tad too oily. Other than that the sandwich was great and it settled my late night hunger."}
{"text":"Went to Porchetta on a Saturday aftenoon to try out their famous porchetta sandwich which I had heard so much about and let me tell you it defintaely lived up to expectations! Their porchetta sandwich was delicious and would recommend to head out to one of their locations to try it.  The st-laurent location is small but perfect for grabbing a bite to eat. The seating is counter style. Their classic porchetta sandwich comes with chuck hughes giardinera and each bite is packed with amazing flavors. What makes this sandwich also stand out is the salsa verde which is an herb sauce composed of a mixture of basil and mint. Will defintaely be back!"}
{"text":"A simple unassuming sandwich place. The porchetta sandwich is really good and at a good price. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came back a second time and found it more fat and too much mayo... Not enough meat, and very greasy..."}
{"text":"This was ok. We got the broccoli rabe side and arancini and they were pretty good.  As someone from a very big Italian family, we were excited to have lunch in Little Italy on our way home from the city, but this wasn't necessarily the 'mom and pop' type of Italian place we were looking for, but it was one of the few places open so we gave it a whirl.  The food was pretty similar to what we're used to in Italian restaurants at home, it was all good but nothing necessarily remarkable.  Definitely stop in for lunch if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Perfectly roasted pork belly, tender and tasty. Tried the arancini, it was also good, crunchy on the ouside."}
{"text":"Phenomenal little place, rustic at home feel to it as well. Their home made add-ons as well as their homemade mortadella is another reason to go there all together. Have yourself a porchetta sandwich on those chilly days, it'll warm you right up and fill you up nonetheless."}
{"text":"It's an Italian sandwich with porcetta. It's amazing. There's not much more to say. If you'v been a lot, you get hooked to this greasy porchetta sandwich. It's salty, greasy and taste amazing.  As a side I take the Aranchini (The deep fried Risotto with meat inside) which is very crispy, creamy deliciousness  It's about 12$-14$ - totally worth it"}
{"text":"Parfait pour un bon \"Pick me up\"! Le menu est délicieux! J'adore la localisation en plein dans la Petite Italie et surtout très conviviale comme ambiance. Bonne sélection de soda italien pour ceux et celles qui aiment découvrir des goût particulier!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about having porchetta near campus and work, but the one time I went for a sandwich, the pork was a bit hard to chew, and it is kind of expensive. The clerk was super friendly, even though it was a quick interaction. I hope it was just an exception, because the reviews seem to be really positive. I might give it another chance!"}
{"text":"It was good, but not as good as it could have been. Had the classico porchetta sandwich, which was good but far from mind-blowing. Would have been nice to have some toppings on there, like cheese or lettuce or tomato. It feels more like a take-out place; chairs are small and high."}
{"text":"Delicious!! You can't go wrong with a Classica! It's sooo juicy and flavorful. Even the bread was amazing. We also had a side of rapini and Brussel sprouts. Both of them were cooked perfectly and still had crunch :) I'm sure everything is great on the menu!"}
