{"text":"I'll agree with the reviewer who said that Food for Thought has good sandwiches, but I'm not going to ding them for having prices that aren't cheap, but not unreasonable. If you want dirt cheap food in a cramped, questionably clean storefront on Craig, you can go right next door to Pizza Prima.   Food for thought on the other hand has plenty of seating and is very clean and comfortable. The people behind the counter were friendly and accommodating as I was fumbling through what I wanted. I still prefer Smallman's when I'm in Squirrel Hill, but Food for Thought is my new favorite deli near Pitt's campus."}
{"text":"Since this is right down the street from my apartment, I mainly go here for deli meat or a quick sammich and matzo ball soup for lunch when I am in the mood. Although their deli prices are a little more than Giant Eagle, the quality is much better. The customer service I've had so far is excellent and everyone is very friendly. If you haven't tried this place, I would highly recommend making a stop here."}
{"text":"Your options here are not limited to just deli meats and a few side salads. Stop by for breakfast/lunch and try the classics like pancakes, corn beef n hash, and the Rueben. Sit in the window or at one of the few tables, and take in the liveliness of the place and N Craig St. You won't be disappointed... Basic deli meats are a 2-3$ dollars more expensive (likely higher quality)  than Giant Eagle but their specialty homemade items are worth trying. Also have a few pastries, nontraditional sodas (boylan, Mash), and other snacks that you can't necessarily find at 7-eleven."}
{"text":"The catering service is great. In each box lunch, there are little compartmentalized fresh fruit, potato salad, and brownie sides, and your choice of a sandwich. The person who delivers also helps to set up the food.   These service beats Jimmy John's any day!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably helpful.  I am in Texas and ordered food for a funeral over the phone.  Bob was so helpful.  He found the right funeral home, called them, and organized what a good time and where to deliver the food to the mourner's house.  He called me back with all the arrangements and organized a deli tray and dessert tray in my budget.  Thank you Bob and Food For Thought!"}
{"text":"Awhile ago I had corn beef hash for breakfast there, and it was very good. Today I went back for it, and it was totally disaster.   The girl at the counter kept talking with other people about her new car for 5 minutes before she took my order, and then she went back to talking for another 5 minutes before she actually took my order to the kitchen.   I ordered corn beef hash for here, and she brought me back a to-go. No big deal. Maybe she just does not want to see my face.  However, when I went to my office and opened the box, I felt more than disappointed. There was barely any meat in the dish and it is very very very greasy. Everything was burned, green pepper, bread and the meat. Luckily, the scrambled egg still looked like scrambled egg. I felt disgusted afterwards."}
{"text":"Great deli in Oakland just down the street from Oakland Catholic - their breakfast HotCakes are fantastic, and their Reuben sliders came with a huge side of crispy fries. Matzos ball soup was on point. Friendly staff and a seriously good location, comfortable seating and large portions. I'll be heading there every single time I find myself in the neighborhood at breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This place is only a block from where we live and my husband and I love it. The food is always fresh and delicious. Everyone is always very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday, even though I've been working only a block away for almost a year. I had the ultimate Reuben and it was just as epic as it sounds. It had corned beef, turkey, AND pastrami. It came with a dill pickle, pretzels and I also got a Boylan's soda. I ended up spending way more for lunch than I usually do, but it was so worth and it. I also couldn't finish the whole sandwich, so I saved the other half for lunch the next day. The thing was huge. So, it actually wasn't that expensive since it was two portions. The person behind the counter was super friendly and helpful after I told her it was my first time there. I ate inside and there was plenty of seating since I beat the lunch crowd by going at 11:45 a.m. The space is pretty small, but it's cozy and feels sort of like a diner. Lots of regulars came in and were chatting with the woman behind the counter. I love that they have two of my favorite things: Utz chips/pretzels and Boylan's soda (practically every flavor!). They also advertise on their website that they use Breadworks bread, a local Pittsburgh breadmaker. I'm all about it. Everything seems really fresh and high quality. I'll definitely come back here. The only con: I didn't see a recycling bin for all the empty drink bottles."}
{"text":"The experience here started out as the worst service I ever had!!! I got a roast beef sub and I asked for spicy mustard and they put on this disgusting Horse radish mustard. I took 3 bites till I finally realized what the vinegary taste was that was giving me flashbacks of my partying days in college. I told the guy over the counter and he told me to talk to the owner who was sitting down and I did and he started out being very disrespectful and he even walked away form me. He was an older guy or his face would've been introduced to my fist. I ended giving him a piece of my mind and not even accepting the other sandwich he offered to make for me because I was so upset. My cousin ordered The Ruben, and truth be told, it was delicious lol. Overall it was a misunderstanding I know I can come off as a d*** sometimes. I would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow this place is expensive! I got a veggie sandwich and small salad... for $12!!! WHAAAA.  It wasn't bad tho... too much hummus, but not bad."}
{"text":"This is a nice local deli with tasty and good quality sandwiches. A large variety of  protein to select from. Friendly staff. Only caveat the place is a little small so if you want to dine in you might want to avoid rush hour."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a time and a half ago after seeing it outside my apartment window, wondered why I never gave it a try, and figured that it wouldn't hurt. In general, this deli serves up a rather impressive number of meats sold by the pound. They also sell snacks, pastries, a bunch of salad sides/appetizers, drinks, and a number of different sandwiches to complement the deli scene nicely. I ended up trying the Grilled Rachel thinking it would be just an ordinary sandwich, but I'm glad I was wrong. The corned beef here is quite the highlight ... never knew there could be such good corned beef. It's fresh, filling, and gets the job of stuffing you full well done. The coleslaw that was piled in the sandwich, although a small redeeming factor health-wise, complemented the meat and the thousand island dressing really smoothed out the rest of the kinks. In general, it's a wonderful sandwich place often overlooked as Pittsburgh does have a reputation for being a sandwich city (often overshadowed by Peppi's and Primanti's). Oh and they run specials daily ... go on Friday to get a side of fries along with a sandwich for a discounted price."}
{"text":"A deli that's always a good choice.  Egg salad sandwich w/ a Stewart's Cream Soda is a delicious winner.  Pick up some Boar's Head to go.  Burton Morris's pop art tastefully adorns a wall.  Any choice is a good choice here!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see all the hating on this deli.  I like it.  They have really good sandwiches.  Nothing fancy, just traditional deli food.  They pile it on, the meat is good quality, the potato salad is delicious, and I have had only friendly service.  It is not cheap nor do I think it is a rip off.  It is in a convenient location for me and a solid standby when I'm hungry and looking for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I am really picky when it comes to eating out, but I absolutely adore this place.  Best corned beef sandwiches EVER!  I always get the triple decker #4 without the chopped liver with a side order of latkas with apple sauce and sour cream.  Delicious!  However, I wished that they would have kept their old latka recipe.  I have been away from Pittsburgh for years now and I truly miss their food!"}
{"text":"The ONLY truly good deli in Pittsburgh. That's no exaggeration. Breakfast: fabulous. Lunch: flawless. Service: top notch. It's really the only place to go for a good sandwich and fries. Bobby the owner is a great guy and he makes everyone feel at home.   Any of the omlettes are worth getting, the breakfast potatoes are just perfect. Not too greasy- clearly fresh cut. The breakfast sandwiches are really good too.   The mini Reuben sliders: look out! This is a big lunch and totally splittable if you aren't too hungry. It's four mini sandwiches surrounded by fresh cut fries. The meats they use on their sandwiches are all boars head or better. The corned beef is the best in Pittsburgh.  Tables are set with Heinz ketchup, salt, pepper, and deli style horseradish mustard."}
{"text":"Food for Thought is a New York style deli, a little out of the way in Oakland on North Craig. It is close to my doctors office and I enjoy stopping when I have an appointment. I order the Corned Beef sandwich with a fruit salad every time. Great deli sandwich. I like eating in and having a change to sit and relax and catch up on the news on the TV or talk with the friendly staff.  I have never been disappointed. The homemade soups are great, especially the chicken noodle or chicken rice. Boars head is a great meat product, I like that you can order it from the deli as take home and avoid a trip to the grocery store. Food for Thought offers discount coupons in the entertainment books in the area if you can find them. Highly Recommend !!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich selections.  I had the Rachel (corned beef with coleslaw) along with a side of potato salad.  The Russian sauce they put on the sandwich is a little on the sweet, but I think it worked well.  The potato salad is also very eggy and a little sweeter than normal, but I didn't mind.  The staff was friendly and my food came in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Secret Best Sandwich Shop Ever. I have eaten sandwiches all over the country. Hands down Pittsburgh has the best Sandwiches. This place has the best Rubens I have ever eaten.  Instead of sauerkraut they can use coleslaw. I highly recommend because their coleslaw gives the sandwich a light sweetness. When I was a poor broke college student it was difficult to splurge on food all the time but I would go all out here :D  If I ever go back to Pittsburgh I will visit again."}
{"text":"Embarrassed for this restaurant......if you like lousy corned beef than this is the restaurant for you!"}
{"text":"I love this place?Sandwiches and soups are cooked in a home-style cooking with heart. And the taste definitely worth this price, without mentioning their prices are inexpensive already."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch meeting today.  Had the special, a BLT wrap, which came with some chips and a coke.  The staff was friendly, the food came quick and the prices were a bit high, but not unreasonable.  They have a seating area, which is nice for a deli/bodega.  The wrap was very good and just right portion wise."}
{"text":"Humble staff with decent prices and great food. Boars head is a great product and it is not overpriced here. My wife and I come every Sunday after church."}
{"text":"This is a nice deli to drop by for a sandwich during lunch. The Deli is located further away than many other delis/sandwich shops in Oakland, so the Deli is not packed with college students during lunch hour; rather, it has a mixture of older professionals and some students.  There is a television located in the dine-in section, so you can catch up on the day's news."}
{"text":"The thing that makes this place is the people. While eating my sandwich, I heard the owners ask two or three customers \"How's your wife doing?\" or \"Is so-and-so back from wherever?\". They care about their customers, and they care about the food they serve them. The food itself is of good quality (straightforward deli-style), but nothing to call home about. Please give these people your business!"}
{"text":"Great lunch and breakfast sandwiches, and they have an interesting (in a good way) selection of bottled and canned drinks.   Really clean, and service is great. Seems family owned."}
{"text":"My daughters and I went there yesterday after visiting the Carnegie Museum. Food For Thought carries Boars head meats which are definitely my favorite. They have a full line of soups and salads and sandwiches too choose from. I had a matzo ball soup and a pastrami on rye with mustard. The matzo ball soup was really good and would definitely get again. The pastrami sandwich was among the best I have had. The service was fantastic the staff where fast and friendly. Only two complaints I have are #1 prices where a bit higher than most deli's and #2 the portion of pastrami on the sandwich was way too little. I have been too many deli's and generally you get 3x the amount of meat on the sandwich. Food for thought was good and I would go there again. I do recommend them, But go into it knowing you will pay more price wise and get less. Even know they are more expensive they are worth a visit as the food is really good and service as well really good."}
{"text":"We came in for the breakfast, but we were too slow so we went for lunch, and we were blown away by the quality of the food. Husband made all sorts of noises as he devoured the Reuben sampler.  My grilled chicken salad was amazing, and loved the frieS!"}
{"text":"Just what you want in a classic deli. If you like a good sandwich in a low key atmosphere, you gotta try it"}
{"text":"Efficient and delicious with a great menu. We tried their pastrami Rueben, turkey sandwich and vegetarian delight. All were good. Size OD sandwiches: not too big, not too small, just right. Reasonable prices, great service. And again, very efficient - I didn't have to wait long at all."}
