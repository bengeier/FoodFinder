{"text":"Quick turn around time. Quality ingredients. Great pizza with amazing toppings. You have to try the meatball and peppers pizza, phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The cheese bread is my absolute favorite. Just wish the white pizza didn't have tomatoes on it. I should of looked at the toppings more but I've never had a white pizza with tomatoes. The wings are pretty good too. Just wish they had boneless wings. Will definitely be going back to try other types of pizza. Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Top of the line pizza and wings. I eat here about once a week. The atmosphere of the place is also cool, nice design and awesome people that work there. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best wings in town. Awesome pizza and the crust is delicious. Owner made me feel like home, customer service was great."}
{"text":"A1 Pizza, hands down has the best wings you'll ever have. I always ask for honey hot wings and they cook them just right, and so delicious. The staff is always so kind and welcoming, although I did meet the owner once and he's not as friendly, but he's literally never there so that's not a big deal. Other than that, I'd highly recommend this place for a family night out or to stop by for lunch- their lunch specials are excellent."}
{"text":"The owner personally contacted me and offered an explanation to their error. Also offered a free pie. I would rate higher but I haven't tried it yet so will wait until I know...standby :)"}
{"text":"I ordered catfish meal with fries & 10pc wings.  Short wait time Takes 7 mins to get home  Got home sauce all over the bag-i drive stable so soneone didnt close the sauce Properly. Wings are small, but average. Not crispy or soggy just inbetween but yummy.  Catfish looks n smells good but tasted rubbery.  Fries were ok. Some where nice and full but most fries were skinny and had close to no potato in it so its kinda crispy fries to hard. I tried to doctor it up with hotsauce but it tastes just as squishy (the fries).   I shouldnt went elsewhere for catfish. Maybe next time ill only get wings."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY love their zucchini. Their wings are delishhhh too! I'm not a pizza person, but my husband likes their pizza. My brother said their cannolis are really good too. Their french fries are decent."}
{"text":"Love this place it's adorable and the service is fantastic! Pizza & wings all day!!!!!"}
{"text":"Only deliver within a 3 mile radius, would not deliver 3.5 miles to my house.........NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!     LAME!"}
{"text":"Updating my review due to them offering to make good on my bad experience. I might go back or I might not, but I do appreciate the effort on the restaurants part!"}
{"text":"Freaking Awesome. people here are really friendly, family owned great food.  overall experience phenomenal will return soon"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there today. Got to say it was the worse calzone I've ever had. Had the calzone special and it was just gross and very burnt. Must be known strictly for their pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Their pizza and wings suck. The pizza is way Greecey & thin crustwhich isn't crispy but soggy.  The wings are soggy not to mention only a couple of flavors. The order taker sucked had to repeat myself.  Took over 40min for orderto arrive. Wings are great from Palanos on tbird must try Chipotle raspberry bbq, however didn't like their pizza either."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious  Forget Little Caesars, for $7 you get a large one topping pizza and it's the real deal Holyfield!!! Personally I get jalape√±os and add an extra topping of mushrooms The liquor store next-door is a little sketchy but the food makes up for it. They also have cannolis which are made fresh, no pre-frozen cannolis over here! I give the place"}
{"text":"We got a few pizza's and wings tonight. The pizza was the best pizza we have had in a long time. The crust was perfect and had good flavor. The hot honey wings were amazing my wife said we should have got 20. They have such great flavor and were nice and crisp cooked perfectly. Our kids said the pizza was the best pizza ever. We now have a new favorite place. The workers were also very friendly."}
{"text":"I was over at my girlfriends the other night and she had some. All I can say is wow! The cheese and the sauce were great. The crust was fluffy with a slight crispiness around it. I don't know how much it cost but I will be going back there!"}
{"text":"Decided to order from this place on a whim...glad that I did.  The pizza was awesome and so were the fried mushrooms. I heard the wings are pretty good too so I'm sure that will be next on the list to try. The only downfall and the reasons they don't get 5 stars...when I called in my order a girl who answered said she was the ONLY one working so she had 2 orders in front of mine that she also had to deliver and they lived really far away so she quoted me a time of an hour to an hour and a half wait for my food. She eventually got there about an hour or so after I had ordered me food. But, hey, she warned me so it's not like I didn't expect it!"}
{"text":"I placed a pick up order today and it was our first time trying this place. Definitely going to be our go to for pizza from now on. We got an XL pepperoni pizza (perfectly cooked), garlic bread(literally the best I've ever had what is under the cheese?!?), 2 liter coke(cold from sitting in their fridge, as should be!), 10 medium hot wings and 10 honey hot(their wings are perfect and don't bother asking for extra sauce cause they are not greedy!) and a good size side of carrots/celery for only a dollar extra! We got all of this for $31  This was a great Tuesday night find and the best pizza I've had in awhile! THANKS!!"}
{"text":"So good!! If you live in the neighborhood, this is your pizza place! Fresh mushrooms (unlike that other place nearby) and delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered wings, fries & a soda via Uber eats. Separately, I am sure the companies are great but combined it was a horrible experience. The food arrived 20 minutes later than estimated. Upon arrival, the driver did not know to bring it to my room. When it did arrive, she seem flustered and unsure. The food was in pretty bad shape. The wings were in a bowl of sauce. No, I cannot make this up... literally in a bowl of buffalo sauce. The fries were OK. I had to wipe off the wings in order to eat them. Unfortunately, 30 minutes after eating, I had the worst stomachache that lasted two hours. Needless to stay I stayed in the bathroom most of the time. The only request I asked for were extra napkins and did not even get those. This transaction was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Tried the Ziti and it was good. Chicken wings had good flavor but could of been bigger. Had to wait longer for my takeout than was told but service was friendly. Would go back again and try a pizza next visit"}
{"text":"The customer service on the phone was terrible, I had ordered a large fry and with 20 pc wings and when it was delivered I never got my fries and the female had repeated the order back. When I received my order delivered to me the fries weren't delivered."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to spend my money at a pizza place I don't know. But this place is now my new go to on this side of town. I got the wings, yes they are in the smaller size, yet they are big on flavor. I was more then pleased. Also the fried zucchini was super nice and crispy. Not a fried mess like some places. And a special calzone. The ricotta could have been spread more evenly, some points I got mouthfuls of it. But it had the best crust and was superb! I will be back ASAP."}
{"text":"Wings and pizza have always been good. Place is clean and prices are fair."}
{"text":"It had everything we were looking for. Easy to read menu, great service,  yummy and cheap food. Everything was fresh, the fries were great. Loved the idea of Make your own slice, definitely returning !"}
{"text":"The wings, pizza and ranch are amazing. I got all my family members hooked on the wings!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza ive had since i moved to the valley 5 yrs ago. Good ingredients an the crust was on point. Fried zucchini was banging!! Wings was awesome an fried perfect! Sauce was just right! An this is my new place for real!!! Customer service is better than most!!"}
{"text":"So I ordered pizza and wings took me saying my address 4xs The delivery was quick. When i opened the pizza box my pizza was squished to one side... The pizza was so soggy!!! The wings looked boiled or maybe baked but the sauce was watery and on the bottom while the wings were sauce less and not crispy at all!! Im currently re baking my pizza hopefully  i can save it!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is by far the best pizza I've had so far. I will definitely be coming back here often! Both female workers were very friendly and helpful to decide on specials and prices, except for the dude that was in charge there, reason why I'm giving it 4 stars. I believe his name was ceaser maybe Omar or oscar lol! Idk but luckily there pizza is freaken bomb otherwise I pie slap him with the pizza just because he had this face and attitude that makes you want to do it. I only went up to the register once to ask for a extra plate and he gives you this face and attitude as if he's bothered by it. Almost felt as if I wasn't welcomed by the way he physically responds.  Other than that,pizza and wings are just uffff!"}
{"text":"Never have I had their pizza. But their wings, shrimp and chips, chicken parm sandwich and salads are amazing. They are also very friendly. I started eating this at work when we all ordered food, I dont wor their anymore - live on the other side of town and I still try to get their when I can. Shrimp and Chips very filling  but I still order other food for later because Its so good and I know I wont be back for a while."}
{"text":"Soggy pizza. Too bad. We like to support local small business owners and thought we'd try this place because of the reviews on Yelp. We were disappointed to have soggy pizza. :("}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had in Arizona!  A1 pizza has been my favorite pizza spot in the valley for a few years. Their pizza is tender and made just right. Try out the BBQ sizilian pizza. The sauce is just right on. The wings and salad are just delicious. I'm really glad and impressed by their service and food. I don't think I want to get pizza from anywhere else from now."}
{"text":"Dude forgot my sprite came back with a 2 liter.  Not only that food was great! Ordered a calzone special and the lunch special fish n chips. I'll be ordering from them soon. Thanks"}
{"text":"Me and a friend tried multiple times to call and place an order during open hours. No one answered so we called Luna pizza"}
