{"text":"This is the first time I have ever tried Korean cuisine and I was not disappointed! The food was amazing. I don't know what I ordered, I think it was some kind of beef pot. I did however give it a 4 star because the side dishes weren't the best."}
{"text":"We visited this place last night and were very excited to have discovered it!  * The banchan were great. I especially liked the sweet and sour radish. * We started the fried beef dumplings, which were okay to me, even though I don't love deep-fried dumplings.  * After we had the marinated meat that grilled at our table which we were instructed to eat wrapped up in a bit of lettuce with a bit of sauce. This came with two bowls of small bowls of rice. I thought the meat was tasty, and loved the enoki mushrooms and sweet potato noodles that came on the side. * Finally we had the seafood soup with noodles which was delicious! Asian seafood soups are one of my favourite things to eat, and this one really hit the spot!  The service was consistent and helpful and it was never hard to get anyone's attention.  Next time we'd love to try the bibimbap and to sit in tatami section (sitting on cushions on elevated floor with low tables).  It was three of us and we could hardly finish our food, and yet walked away feeling full but not heavy and uncomfortable. Our total came to about 18$ a person, including tip. Overall the food was delicious, healthy, and with great prices. It was a pleasure to find this little gem in Mississauga, and we can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"This place is really decent Korean restaurant in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Tip top noodle soup and homemade dumplings. Pork bone soup rocks.  One of best out there."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food at an affordable price. Very similar to restaurants in Korea (So if you want some sort of flashy dining experience, don't bother!) Felt like I was back in Seoul :)"}
{"text":"Authentic (at least how I felt it is) food, very reasonably priced food. Spacious environment and seating. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The meal was okay, but its very traditional Korean style, if you're not Korean, its not for you. There was no water served, just some tea that was given to us and they gave us chopsticks instead of forks. Not much customer service other than the owners."}
{"text":"Great selection on the menu. Practice your Korean though as most items are in Korean with pictures. Very friendly. Visited on a Saturday afternoon. Not very busy but steady stream of customers. Started with the steamed dumplings. Very plump, Hot fresh and tasty. They are a 3 bite size and there had to be at least 6 or 7 of them in the order. Had 3 of us for lunch so ordered the Korean Beef for 2 and a dumpling in beef broth soup. More than enough. Beef came with 2 bowls of rice and the usual sides (kimchi, radish and something else). Served with hot tea and cold water. Prices were OK."}
{"text":"I heard that is place has amazing dumplings and korean dishes from korean people so I was expecting something really good. I ordered the hot broth dishes and I was disappointed with the taste and amount/quality of the meat. There signature dish the dumplings weren't even that good and were lacking taste and size. I would avoid going here and save your money for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hot pot was ok, sea food was nothing special, just basic staff. Soup taste like instant noodle which like always. side dish is too little compare to other korean restaurant, only kimchi and radish."}
{"text":"I'm inclined to agree with Wayne regarding this place.  The choices are great and the place (at least to my untrained, non-Korean eyes) looks authentic.  My last visit was a while ago, but I just recommended it to a co-worker because the experiences were that memorable.  Key to a good dining experience are the little details that make the meal enjoyable.  The service was friendly despite an obvious language barrier.  Also, the little morsel appetizers were delectable - not too much to lose your appetite, but definitely enough to entice and hint at a forthcoming delicious meal.  I had been referred to the place as THE place for massive dumplings, and they did not disappoint.  Those things are literally a handful and our group was hard-pressed to finish the plate of dumplings + the dumplings that were part of our meals.    Overall I recall the prices were decent, not quite on the low-end but more than acceptable given how full I felt.  The menus could use some updating, as some choices were scratched out or taped over, but the plethora of realistic pictures really helped the decision process.  I would definitely return"}
{"text":"My family comes here regularly for the mandu and handmade noodles as well as the hot stone bibimbap. Since the new owners took over recently we find the food is slightly better and the restaurant is cleaner too. It's a good spot for a hearty Korean meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"When I'm in the Mississauga area and have a craving for jjajangmyun, this place is a must. If I'm not in the area but craving a mean jjajangmyun, I'll sometimes make the trek out anyway.   I've had other dishes at this location (madooguk, bibinnaengmyun) but my all-time faves here are the Family Jjajangmyun ($14.99) and the steamed traditional mandoo (dumplings; $5.99 for seven pieces that are each about the size of a small child's fist), which is what we ordered. The difference between the Family noodles and the solo-serving is that it's a jumbo platter (serves up to four people if you share a couple of/few other items) and contains bamboo shoots, shrimp, and squid, while the other one contains the standard bits of meat, potatoes, etc. Their traditional mandoo has changed over the years in that it's got kimchi in it, which it didn't way back when. I don't know how the Yonge Street location does things these days as I'd only been once when they first opened and theirs didn't have kimchi in them at the time either. It's not a bad thing since I eat my steamed mandoo with kimchi anyway, they're just not exactly \"traditional\". The only banchans we got were three different kinds of kimchi: napa, radish (ggakdugi), and another radish one in strips, not spicy--more sweet than anything. Maybe they ran out of other banchan or maybe because we were having jjajangmyun as you don't usually get a wide range of side dishes when you order jjajangmyun.  In the past, I have also had their mandoo-guk and that was also pretty good. One time I ordered their bibinnaengmyun and it was served swimming in red pepper paste! I sat there staring at it, incredulous that the waitress actually brought it to my table for me to eat! I called her back and asked how am I supposed to eat it as it was inedible. I don't know if she thought I wasn't Korean and I might not know the difference but it wasn't OK! She didn't even offer me a new one! I was starving and couldn't wait around for a new one at that point so I asked her to bring me some broth to dilute the red peppery-ness and just ate it, FUMING. The other thing about this place is that some of their wait staff can be totally clueless, but it's not always the case.  I've brought a few people here including my mom who complains about all restaurants (she didn't mind it, which translates into \"not bad\"), and quite a few friends, Korean and non, and everyone's liked it so far. It would seem the specialties here are the jjajangmyun and mandoo and they do both pretty well. Last night I could smell samgyupsal being cooked at someone's table and it made my nostrils flutter with longing and my mouth water--I'll have to try that next time as we were a bit rushed last night.   There is quite a mixed crowd most of the time, so don't be shy, especially if you're wanting some good jjajangmyun!"}
{"text":"So after coming here my friends and i received horrible service (had to flag down our waiter after waiting b for 20 minutes to order). When we went to pay the cashier asked me to tip. So here it is, this is the tip you've earned.  Not exactly sure when tipping became mandatory, in the states waiters have to actually shoot for the stars to get a tip. You can expect a tip if your service was expected (you're expected to take my order and bring out food in a timely manner)."}
{"text":"Not great.  Asked for the cheque like five times, got a blank stare in response while the waiter just carried on his work and ignored us.  Side dishes were mediocre/limited compared to every. single. other. Korean eatery I've been to, and consisted of merely radishes, another dish of what looked like potatoes but were more radishes, and overly salty kimchi.    Overly salty/spicy Gam Ja Tang, and yes I know it's supposed to be spicy, but in a good way. I've had loads of gajatang that burnt my tongue but was still delicious to eat.  This one just made my stomach feel uncomfortable and tasted cheaply done, and I struggled/failed to even finish half of it.   Overly expensive for what we were served as well, which is typical for Korean restaurants, but appalling for the food and lack of service we got.  I'd've given it 1 or 1.5 stars if possible, but rounded up to 2 since at least the establishment seemed clean.."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the past few years and I think it's gotten worse.   Service is not very good here. Waited so long for everything. Waited for tea and water, waited for them to take our order, waited for them to bring out our food while others (perhaps regulars?) got everything so quickly. As I am writing this, I've been here for over an hour and still eating. The table beside us got here after us, order before us and got their meals before us. They left the restaurant 10 minutes ago.  It's also really difficult to flag anyone down. We just gave up.   The food is good but I noticed that they don't include as much complimentary ban chan like they did in the past and the quality has gone down - they don't include as much meat in the dishes as before.  I feel like they're charging more and offering less.   Too bad there aren't a lot of options for Korean food in the west end."}
{"text":"Solid Korean food here - it was pretty good had the Bimbimbap and some sides"}
{"text":"I agree with my fellow Yelpers that this is definitely a hidden gem for authentic Korean food in Mississauga. Every time I go, it is pretty busy and it seems that most of the customers who go are Korean - which is always a good sign. This is a franchise based off the one in Toronto.   While I agree that the food is consistently good, the service can be terrible at times. It was nearly impossible to flag down a waiter to refill tea, take orders, etc. during busy hours, especially if you sit far away from main area. I also felt like they had a preference for customers who spoke Korean. The waiter forgot one of our orders, insisted that we take our appetizer even though since they were already \"making it\" after we finished our meal, and even had a busboy ignore our requests for tea. Sadly, the bad service had me dock a star from this place.  Despite this, there is no denying the food. Here are some things that I would recommend: - Handmade Noodles with Dumplings in Beef Broth (great for a cold day and for $7.99 fills you up and good choice for something non-greasy and fried) - 'Jajjangmyun' Handmade Noodles in Black Bean Sauce (again cheap and comes in huge portions, really tasty meat-like sauce with their perfectly done noodles) - 'Gamjatang' Pork Bone Soup (I haven't tried this but I hear it's very delicious and endless pork bones to nom on) - Stone Pot Bibimbap (classic but they do it right here and not expensive at $9.99) - Fried Calamari with Pork & Vegetables (addictive & tasty but on the greasy side, like bacon, but also quite expensive at $14.99 - good plate to share though)  What I don't recommend: - If you order anything with their any dumplings in soup, don't order their dumpling appetizers, they are the EXACT same thing but pricier - Some of their grilled/sizzling plates seem to be on the more expensive side, and they have a lot of cheaper meal options that will just as likely fill you up"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and I was impressed.  My friend and I ordered the bulgogi ($14) and seafood pancake ($16) and noticed that the prices were a bit higher than other places in the area, but as soon as the food came, we realized that was because the food portions were considerably larger than other areas. Both of us really liked the seafood pancake; unlike other places I've had it in, there was a lot of shrimp and squid and they didn't skimp on the seafood. The pancake itself was really big and tbh, we could have shared it between us instead of ordering another dish. The bulgogi likewise was quite large, but because there were so many vegetables, there wasn't as much meat and it wasn't as filling as in the bulgogi from Downtown Toronto. Both dishes tasted great though.  There wasn't as much variety in the banchan (3 types only), but I felt that the flavours were different enough so that the 3 were sufficient. Their banchan is spicier than other places and overall very good.  Service was good too. I like that I didn't really notice the waiter/waitresses walking around too often and that made the restaurant quiet; a good place to chat with friends. Maybe that was because I didn't go during the lunch/dinner rush hours. When I was about to leave, I asked for a takeout box, then I asked for more kimchi. Other places usually don't give you refills if you're about to leave since they don't want you to take it home. That or they give you very little. But our waitress was very generous and gave us a large refill, allowing us to take some kimchi for the road. I really liked how they weren't stingy on ingredients or kimchi. I've had that in other places and it became an annoyance.  When we were finished, we had to get up and pay at the cash register by the door. Tax is not included in the menu prices, but my friend told me that she didn't see a place where she could leave tips so she didn't. So I guess tips aren't necessary there.  I definitely will be coming back, probably in the winter so I can try their hot pots. I read other reviews and saw there was a traditional on the floor seating area and I'm disappointed that I didn't even see it when I went. Next time I'll try that seating area, the hot pots, and their famous dumplings."}
{"text":"Amazing family run rest.  We always order PORK BONE SOUP and FRIED DUMPLINGS.  So good!!!! The one tiny thing that can make it better is a bit more variety of the side dishes.  The kimchi is awesome!!"}
{"text":"We came for an early dinner on a Saturday. November is the birthday month for my mom and mother in law so they chose to have their birthday dinner here.   There were 7 of us in our group but were able to get seated promptly. Unfortunately for us, our table was by the glass windows and the people seating in front of them, could feel a cold draft on their backs. The restaurant tried covering the windows up with bubble wrap but it wasn't working.   The service was prompt even as more people were coming in. They refilled our banchan a few times and they were attentive.   The food was a little above average overall. The Dumplings Soup was good according to the birthday ladies but I was disappointed with my Pork Bone Soup. Meat was a little tougher and the only vegetables they added was bean sprouts. No cabbage or potatoes like in the other restaurants. The broth was good though as it wasn't salty. The tangsuyuk was good.   This place is not bad but I think you can find better Korean food in Mississauga like Song Cooks, Owl or Nuri. I have been here before as this place has gone through a few owners. At least their food hasn't gotten worse.   Recommended somewhat."}
{"text":"Their homemade rice wine is so good!  It doesnt taste strong so I tend to get tipsy fast. lol  I also love getting their big pot of pork bone soup to share with friends."}
{"text":"The only place that I have come across in Mississauga that serves Soondaeguk aka blood sausage soup. The restaurant was very spacious in comparison to a lot of the other Korean restaurants, lots of comfortable space in between tables and standard traditional decor. I love that they offered the floor seating as it made eating there feel so much more authentic. The blood sausage soup is a nice change from your standard pork bone soup. It was not oily nor salty, but savory and at only $7.99 with rice it was defitely worth it. The grilled pork belly was a little bland for my liking, but good if you grill until its crispy, and eat with Kimchi. Overall, Im excited to return and try the rest of the menu. Their brown rice was really good as it had quinoa and kidney beans, yum!"}
{"text":"place was packed with people...staff is great but was disappointed with food..there were fruit flies all over the place..."}
{"text":"My friend got me here with the promise of fist-sized dumplings, and I wasn't let down.  The dumplings here are gigantic, as are their portions. Taste-wise, it's okay. Nothing really blew my mind here and I likely won't be in a rush to return. The fried dumplings were tastier than the soup dumplings.  Service was good, and the place is very casual. There's parking out front, which is nice."}
{"text":"For those who don't know, mandoo's are Korean dumplings. I used to come to this particular restaurant a lot when I lived in Mississauga. It's like comfort food. Noodles and hot broth just makes things just right for some reason. Great for colds - makes you feel good, not a cure for cold.  I've tried everything on the menu and everything is very good. The fried dumplings are a meal itself and always a must when I come here. They are big and freshly made. You definitely want to try the mandoo and noodle soup. This is a classic Korean dish that my grandmother used to make from scratch. It will never be as good as my grandmother's but it's close enough. They also have floor seating, which surprisingly gets occupied or that authentic feeling of Korean dining. I prefer to sit on a chair but there are some that love the novelty.  This place wouldn't be my first choice for Korean food but it's pretty good. This miss here is the service, which can be a pain. They always seem like they're understaffed. Can be a little frustrating."}
{"text":"This is a nice little family atmosphere Korean restaurant. Man Doo means dumplings in Korean. As the name suggests, their specialty is dumplings. These are not the Chinese type (which I really like as well). These are massive dumplings filled with your choice of kimchi or pork. The great thing about these little bundles of joy is that there's virtually no oil in these, unlike the Chinese kind of dumplings. But it still tastes great.   Anyways, if having a dark or fancy atmosphere is a must for you, this is not the restaurant for you. This is the restaurant you go to if you want decent food at decent prices, which is perfect for me.   I've been here maybe 4-5 times. One special thing about this place is that they serve you mini dumplings as a side dish (non-refillable). This is a nice perk. They serve 3 other side dishes: radish (white), kimchi, and another kind of radish (seasoned with that Korean red sauce).  You can't go wrong with the Man Doo Hyang Jeonggol. This is a kind of table cooking dumpling mix in a pot cooked to boiling temperature at your table. There's mushrooms, vegetables, 6 dumplings, rice cakes, handmade noodles and some pork. They also have plenty of more traditional dishes like cold noodles, bibimbap etc. But if you come here and it's your first time, I recommend getting something with dumplings.   This is a place that I frequent because it's close to my house, their food is healthy (and so are a lot of Korean dishes), and you get decent value from them. Their main customers are Korean so no reviewer should be critical of their English. But that's how you know you're getting real Korean food."}
{"text":"went to this restaurant on March 25th.  The dumplings were very good, different from what I've had in OH and NC.  The hot beef soup was very good.  The waitress was very nice.  I noticed they make rice wine, fermenters in the dining area.  I look forward to going to this restaurant when I return to Mississauga in the future."}
{"text":"This hidden gem in Mississauga gets you authentic Korean food at downtown prices.  It's not your typical Chinese owned, with Japanese fusion type place, and you'll get more than just Japchae, Bimbimbap and Bulgolgi.   One of their specialities is their homemade dumplings and handmade noodles. I don't know what they put in the dumplings, but they are huge and filled with some sort of beefy goodness. I could totally come back for more dumplings.  They also have Pork Bone Soup and a beef Bone soup I would love to try.   I guess the one thing to mention is that we only got one refill of tea, not that we asked, but I'm just saying.   They also had Kalbi but at $14.99 for minimum two dishes didn't seem worth it. Someone tell me otherwise!   Note: not sure what the place used to be, but it says on the door \"dress code in effect\""}
{"text":"So after passing this Korean/Afghan stripmall almost everyday, I said to my friend, hey, let's see if there's anything good in here to eat.  To my surprise, there are quite  a few places including this one, K-Pocha (korean Fried Chicken), a bakery and an Afghan take-out place.    My friend was like \"this place looks ghetto, let's go somewhere else\" and I said \"let's go in and see first\" and he reluctantly agreed. I knew all along it couldn't be that bad because there were some good Yelp reviews ;-).    After we walked in, we decided to stay since it was quite pleasant and cavernous inside.  Our food: pork bone soup, Korean Kimchi and beef stew, and Korean Fried Dumplings.    First the banchan came out and it included kimchi, sweet radish, sour radish and rice.  Nothing special, all decent.  Love the fact that they served rice though.    Then, the Korean fried dumplings came out and they were massive.  and as most people said, these were the size of a toddlers first and packed with meat, with a crispy shell on the outside.  AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!.    As for the entrees, my friend said his PBS was okay, However, my Korean Kimchi and beef stew was really good.  It had a perfect spice level for clearing your sinuses (which I appreciate in Korean soup) but with good flavour.  The only thing that could have improved was to have more beef.  I felt it was mostly kimchi and tofu.  Still though, very enjoyable.   So if you are thinking of going to Owl for Korean, think again.  For PBS, Owl is great, but if you want something other than PBS, this place is great to visit, despite the sketch mall."}
{"text":"A prior luncheon engagement cancelled, I came to visit this place as I read from c---hound recommendations about this place for their Noodle and Dumplings. All I have to say to the person missing out in my bad soup Nazi interpretation is \"No Soy Milk Soup Noodle for YOU!\"   Looks pretty crappy from the outside, It actually looks like a rundown pub from the outside. Inside is a totally different story, it has that perfect setting that I love as they have normal seating as well as TATAMI area. Korean TV is on the LCD and there are some whimsical white boards with various notes and scribbles displayed on the side walls.   I came in for lunch being greeted by \"An nyoung ha seh yo\" as most of the other few tables of patrons where either a couple of mid-age Korean ladies or single elderly Korean gentleman, I'm the EXCEPTION of course.   Looking through the Menu I stuck with the first 2 pages which was the reason I came. Page 1 was Specials such as Cold Noodle, SOY MILK SOUP NOODLE, Fried Dumplings, Boiled Dumplings, etc... While Page 2 was where my meal was decided because they had a HANDMADE Noodles with Dumplings in Beef Broth($7.99).   Best of both worlds and 2 birds with 1 stones DEAL. The lady serving didn't really react much when I ASKED if I can take a photo as if she didn't understand my English, but she was friendly and didn't seem to mind. As she served 3 banchans(Kimchi, Sour Radish, Spicy Radish) and SURPRISE a small delicious! dish of tiny dumplings.   The Noodle came and it was a BIG portion but what made this meal was the Dumplings which looked so PLUMP and the skin was handmade and perfect chew to it. It was so plump and round that I was waiting for it to explode but somehow the seams never gave way.   The Handmade Noodles were just as amazing as the Dumplings, cooked to exact doneness and great consistency and texture. The broth was OKAY as well and its unfortunate that us Non-Sauga Yelpers cannot get this day in day out.   I saw other patrons got various other items as well so it's not that everyone preferred one dish over the other. There was a SERVICE BELL right on my table at the corner spot but the cashier was sitting right behind my back because that was where the cash register was.   Does someone know what this says:  http://www.koreatimes.net/kt_weekly_korea/63706"}
{"text":"3.5 *Stars*  After visiting the Man Doo Hyang in Mississauga, I had HIGH expectations for this one which is closer to society.  After a few prior meals it was good that I can walk from Centrepoint Mall at Yonge/Steeles to this location as when I passed it a few times it had limited parking opportunties.  As I walked in I was greeted and directed to a table which was ANY table because it was a Wednesday afternoon.  The decor is not anything close to what they had in the Mississauga branch.  For casual dining then do this North York but for formal then 'Sauga is the one to go.  The restaurant size was also limited as you have to realize it is located on Yonge street.  Same menu so I got the EXACT same thing, HANDMADE Noodles with Dumplings in Beef Broth($7.99).  It came out the same way in a huge bowl where the Soup was covering all the Noodles and Dumplings.  The Noodles is still AMAZING but the Dumpling this time didn't go as well.  While the Handmade Noodles is one of my fav all time in Toronto, the Dumplings this time which I got 1 Kimchi and 2 Cucumber had overpowering GARLIC and raw garlic at that which I love to eat but the combination within the Dumpling made it weird even for me.  What I loved about this place is that it's so SMALL that I could hear the cook behind the door do all the chopping for my meal.  That's when you know it's freshly made."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in Mississauga! The food and ambience is top notch with authentic Korean dishes that always deliver in terms of quality and taste. If possible, try to eat at the heated floor area if you want to change things up a bit.  You must try the pork bone soup (no brainer), bulgogi, or if you're with a group, their hot pots which are all delicious (especially during the winter). A must visit if you're ever in Mississauga."}
{"text":"ahahahhaha annyeonghaseyo dawgs u knowe wassup im back. i never left. expect more.  let's see... this place is like i walk into korea, i walk back out im in canada . the taste just gives u that feel of like WASSUP I TRAVELED TO DUH KOREA. close your eyes and eat the food. i guarantee  that you will feel like u just went a trip fam. save u airplane ticket thank me later  so if u didnt catch the hint by know prettyy much it tastes like korea. like if you could eat korea, that's what it would taste like. ofc theres the free side dishes (their kimchi is either made with like unicorn tears or something bruh like i can get full straight up from eating just kimchi) but mainly i like to dive into the ethnic korean stuff which i think this place really brings out. the korean power. YA!! kamsahamnida for reading my crappy ass review. thats korean for thank u get schooled. ok bye"}
{"text":"I had my ever first Korean hot pot experience here and it was a mostly pleasant one.  My girlfriend and I shared one hot pot and for around $30 it's a pretty good deal considering the portions for two. The main thing here was the mandoo dumplings which were very different from what I am used to: it's not mainly meat based. You don't see meat in there, it's a mixture of a whole bunch of things with meat and veggies including cabbage. Also Korean dumplings are pretty large in size! These things take a couple of bites and just fall apart on you. The noodles were udon based and were the nice and chewy. There was also crispy watercress and enoki mushrooms and the broth was of a mildly spicy variety. The broth was excellent and flavorful. Just try to eat the hotpot somewhat quickly as the items do get soft and mushy by the end of it.   The restaurant was so chilly you could just feel it! When most of your customers are wearing jackets inside your restaurant that probably means it's too cold (even with warm hot pot). Service was almost non-existent but I suppose that's what is expected from a place like this."}
{"text":"This authentic Korean restaurant has spicy kimchi and good table service which included a waiter cooking our BBQ Pork Belly.  The deep fried dumplings are very large but light on flavour."}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place!    We come specifically for their homemade rice wine.  We are always debating who will be the designated driver for the night lol.  There are two kinds, regular and premium.  The premium goes down more smooth, and the regular is more cloudy (from the rice) and tastes a bit more salty... If that makes sense.  Their dumplings are also very good.  But my go to favourite is their Korean style spicy sausages in hot pot.  Its a big dish that you use on the cook table.  It comes with instant noodles, hot dogs, spam, tofu, pork and veggies in the spicy Korean soup.  Its all my favourite things in one!!!  I'm drooling thinking about it."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their home made rice wine!  There are two types (regular and premium).  Both are amazing but the premium goes down smoother.  I love it because it doesn't taste strong but I find I get tipsy fast!  Their food is good as well.  I like to order their large pork bone soup which is in a large wok that is on the stove in the middle of the table.  This is good to share with 3 people as the portion is quite large.  Service is friendly as well :)"}
{"text":"I am glad I found another authentic Korean restaurant in GTA!  We came here on Saturday for lunch, and the place was packed with Koreans which is a good sign. We already knew what we were getting: the shareable dumpling hotpot.  It came in a huge pot with six big dumplings, rice cakes, noodles, kimchis and veggies inside just for two people! Dumplings were very delicious, packed with the filling and a thin skin.  It could be a bit spicy for people who don't have a high tolerance to spicy food. If that's the case, ask the server to make it milder.   Overall, a very tasty, authentic Korean dish that I would order anytime. I loved their freshly made kimchi too! Friendly service and reasonable price. I would definitely come back to check out other dishes."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with my friend and her family, they said it's the restaurant they always go to when they crave Korean. I ordered the kimchi bibimbap, which was good, but nothing special compared to other bibimbaps that I've had. When coming to Korean restaurants, I find that half of the reason for my rating is the side dishes that they give to you alongside your meal. The side dishes here were lacklustre, and all four side dishes had the same taste -- spicy, sour, sweet. It's this reason that I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars; if you're going to get a typical bibimbap, might as well go to a restaurant that serves better side dishes!  Although it was not busy at all on the day we came in, we still had difficulty getting our waiter's attention. However, this type of service is to be expected in an Asian restaurant setting.   Verdict: Do not think I will be coming back, as I feel like there are better Korean restaurants in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Love their massive fried dumplings with pork bone soup!!! It's rare these days to find pork bone soup at $9.99 and great tasting!"}
{"text":"Bibimbap is to die for if you like hot and spicy Korean food. Very popular among foreigners and expatriates in Seoul. Man Doo Hyang reminded me of having it in Seoul. It's as good as it gets. Their homemade Jajangmyeon is also amazing and the sauce is so yummy."}
{"text":"It has been a year since I last visited. Side dishes were just meh. We ordered BBQ pork belly you must order min two exactly the same item for table cooking. Each order came with two pork belly and it was around $10/ pork belly ( please see my picture) which was expensive.   We also ordered family share seafood ja jang noodle, the portion was small for a family. We had 6 of us. We each got one small plate of noodles thats it. The noodle was very bland, noodles were soggy- not impressed.   Our third dish was rice cake with cheese- portion wise it was small again. This dish actually tasted not so bad.   We were not impressed with the services. The waiter was clumsy.   Overall, the experience was not good. We will still visit Song Cook which it is about 10 mins away."}
{"text":"I used to love come here often. The little dishes used to have variety, but not anymore. The seafood noodle soup are extremely spicy and we told the owner it tastes different but he said it's always like this. I would not recommend it anymore."}
{"text":"As Jennifer K notes, it's very homey. A bit divey. a bit loud if you get seated next to some seriously old school ajusshis (one ajusshi... two ajusshis? ajusshen? ajussha?) debating the merits of Roh Tae-woo over Park Chung-hee.   As the name implies, this is a dumpling house although I was looking forward to a bigger range of dumpling choices. I'd love if they had some wang mandoo (king dumplings).   Don't be fooled by the small dumplings that come out between the banchan (the free appetizers) and the main order. Me and Slinky Woman were first confused, thinking these were the dumplings we ordered. They, errr, didn't really look like the ones on the menu. Fortunately, they brought out the real dumplings.  Service is as good as it can be although there was a bit of a language barrier. This is definitely a place for Koreans and by Koreans. Still, you won't feel unwelcome.  The small lot makes parking tight depending on day/time you go.  Nothing really wrong but nothing about the dumplings thrilled me. Can't say I'd be back."}
{"text":"The pork bone stew here is great but so large!!!can feed four ppl. It was my husband and I so we had so much leftovers.  The pork ribs were tender, broth super spicy, and they give you two huge dumplings in the soup.  I would recommend for authentic Korean food that's fresh and hot!  And I agree with another reviewer they only give you kimchi as an app...but the kimchi is soooooo good!"}
{"text":"The food quality is tarnishing in the past 8 years and the taste rely on additives heavily. Some great dishes eliminated from the menu now. This restaurant seems in sort of trouble."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean restaurants in Mississauga! If you come here, be sure to order the Budae Jjigae (Korean army base stew)! It's 25 bucks for two people and 34 for three but you can seriously feed more than suggested (if you're not ravenous). I would suggest splitting the smaller one between three and the larger one between 4-5.   Being able to feed three people for  $10 on quality Budae Jjigae is amaaaaaazing. It's a kimchi based soup with ramen, rice cake, pork, ham, sausages, enoki mushrooms, tofu, green onions, onions, and so much more. It even comes with rice! Get friendly with who you're with and just eat straight from the pot: super Korean thing to do and it just makes everything taste better for some reason haha   Each pot only comes with the amount of rice for the suggested amount of people, so be sure to order an extra bowl of you plan on sharing it between more!   I also love their dolsot bibimbap and I heard crazy good things about their Korean barbecue. Things I don't recommend: jjajangmyun (it's alright but honestly nothing special... I would go to that place across the street instead) or their fried dumplings (crispy, but tasteless).   Pro tip: there's a Korean bakery in the same complex with awesome cream filled pastries. Don't miss out and grab some dessert afterwards!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to eat some noodles yesterday evening in the North York area.  So off to Yelp I go!  We ended up at Man Doo Hyang - swayed by the fact that they had handmade noodles.  We both ordered the handmade noodles with traditional Korean dumplings -- I got myself the kimchi one, which was absolutely delicious.  Noodles were okay.  The broth wasn't that impressive and it didn't have much taste to it.  Banchans were good for the two of us - including daikon, kimchi daikon and kimchi (which they refill if you run out).  They also give you complimentary dumplings as well!  Not too bad considering for a small little restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 4 on a Sunday night. I ordered the ox tail soup with the knee (balls of collagen).. Sounds weird but tasted delicious and my skin loved it too. We sat at the heated floor area. Perfect in the winter.   Half their menu is \"Not Available\" including the fried dumplings that everyone is talking about. The rice is just plain white so I ordered the purple rice for $3. The side dishes are different kinds of kimchi. Pretty bad selection for non-spicy eaters."}
{"text":"Located in a nondescript plaza off Dundas, Man Doo Hyang is a popular Korean restaurant and a great way to experience Korean food beyond AYCE BBQ.  The name of this restaurant translates to Dumpling House, and these dumplings certainly don't disappoint. You can order them fried or steamed; I prefer the latter as I find it lets you taste more of the dumpling. Note: the soy sauce/chili for the dumplings is contained in a tiny squarish porcelain jar with a lid to the side of your table.  We rotate through a lot of options when we come here, so I'm entering list mode:  1) For groups of two or more, the Kam Ja Tang is popular here. Unlike other restaurants, the pork bone soup is brought out on a burner and cooked at the table. Koreans seem to possess the inherent ability to consume liquids while on the boil...I prefer to preserve my taste buds. If you want to sound like a snob, make a comment to your table on the potatoes, as they're specific to these Korean dishes.  2) Typically bulgogi at restaurants is horrible, and one of the cheaper meat options. Not here, where (again, cooked at the table), the bulgogi is thicker, flavourful and delicious.  3) If you're not looking for group items, try the Handmade Noodles with Dumplings in Beef Broth. This soup has a deep, rich flavour to it and is very satisfying. Add the ddok (rice cake medallions) if you want more starch.  4) For something different, you could try the Jajang Myeon. Derived from a Chinese dish, these noodles are smothered in a thick (really thick) black soybean paste, minced pork and veggies. I typically can't finish a whole order myself (it's thick stuff), but Koreans can wolf this down like school girls at a Big Bang concert. Ask for scissors to save your wrists from chopstick-related strain.  The service can be hit or miss (I find there's a revolving contingent of young Korean males with varying degrees of competence), but don't be afraid to wave down anyone. Older Korean men typically don't give a damn and just shout out what they want. You could use the service bell glued to each table, but these are only responded to half the time."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I am Korean.  Having grown up in Korea, I am extremely picky about going out to Korean restaurants in Toronto as I find most of them offer disappointing experiences to Koreans and non-Koreans alike.  I love Man Doo Hyang because this restaurant specializes in a few things and they do them well.  There is nothing worse than a restaurant (not just Korean) that offers a long menu and can't do any of them right.    Word of caution for those coming to this restaurant.  Korean dumplings are very different from Chinese style dumplings.  Traditionally, Korean dumplings are filled with mixtures of tofu, shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, pork, shredded kimchi and so on... so their fillings are less firm than Chinese dumpling fillings.  They are usually much larger than what you will get in Chinese dumpling restaurants.  So if you're looking for mostly meat packed dumplings, Korean dumplings may not do it for you.    Man Doo Hyang does excel at making their hand cut noodles.  Their \"not so brothy\" beef broth for Kal Gook Soo is due to the fact that they do not use MSG (unlike Buk-Chang-Dong Soon Tu Fu where all you can taste is MSG in their broth, yet people RAVE about their broth) and does not overload it with salt.  This is why there are small stainless steel containers filled with soy sauce + hot chili flakes + chopped green onion on each table so you can add more flavour to your soup.  I personally prefer under-seasoned broth so I can actually have most of the soup without ingesting ridiculous amount of sodium.    I'm also a big fan of their Bo-Ssam (boiled pork) served with cabbage and oyster kimchi.  Their Soon Dae (Korean style blood sausage) platter is served with good quality soon dae which are made on site with couple of pieces of sliced liver and lungs."}
{"text":"I got the man doo soup or the traditional beef broth with korean dumplings - it was overall good and decent but the dumplings had a little bit of a sour taste to it - also you ONLY get 3 side dishes, not a lot of selection for the side dishes - service was alright , not the best , we had to call the waiter a lor of times to order or to get water"}
{"text":"NOT SO COOL: maybe our server was new, but the service was off. service in asian restaurants are known to be bad, but then there's common sense: i asked for a tea refill, but she just thinks about refilling one cup, instead of everyone's cup at the table (group of 6). I had to literally bring the cups to her, so that she doesn't leave my guests with unfilled cups. the server didn't clear the table until after the dessert was served. am i silly for expecting good service at asian restaurants? ah. i can dream.  THE GOOD: celebrated my birthday here. authentic korean food. delicious. great portions. wish i could tell you what i ordered, but i don't know the names!   COOL: two areas of seating. you could do the traditional sit-on-floor. or you could sit on a table with a stove in the centre of the table.  OVERALL: i'll come back :) the food was good."}
{"text":"If I want Korean food, I usually come to this place or the Korean fast food nearby. Their food were alright but they have this self made Korean rice wine that makes them special in the area. Also, I like how they have the \"calling bell\" for each table. I would say the food in this restaurant are pretty authentic.  We were greeted by the waitress when we walked in, and while waiting to be seated. The owner greeted us happily with Korean and followed up if we got our table yet or not.  One thing I might not like about this restaurant is the complimentary dishes (Korean side dishes). They only give you couple dishes not like some other restaurants outside in the Scarborough area. However, I like their kimchi. I think the kimchi tasted a lot better than other places I tried so far."}
{"text":"Overall a good Korean Food experience. Make sure you stick to their main focus of dishes -- ie Dumplings (Aka Man doo) and such.    The only dish I've had there which was an utter fail is their Dak Tori Tang (spicy chicken stew).  It just didn't taste great and the chicken wasn't very 'stewed'.  I'm going to have to learn how to cook my own."}
{"text":"Cute, authentic decor. It's a comfortable place to eat. The menu has plenty of choices, from fair price to very expensive. I accidentally chose a fish dish (I don't like fish)...but I could tell that they make all their dishes exploding with flavor. But VERY spicy. All the apps they include with the meal are also very spicy. I'm curious how spicy their dishes are that are actually labelled as spicy."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just awh-ight.  Sides aren't very good or varied.  Kim chi isn't very aged, quite salty, and is heavy on the fish paste.  And I just don't like that garlic/radish side.  Man Doo in Beef Broth is a bit spicy which isn't stated in the menu.  It has kim chi in it, so not an ideal choice for people who are intolerant to spicy foods.  Pork Bone Soup, which I use as a gauge to test Korean restos, wasn't as complex in flavour as other restaurants.  It tasted fresh, but slabs of pork with bone was a bit on the fatty side, and I could tell it wasn't cooked for that long.  Slightly watered down in taste, but on the upside, it wasn't laden in sodium!  :)  And for some reason, the rice that came with my pbs arrived WITH the banchans which I thought was a bit weird.  Is it just me, but rice should come out the same time as the soup, non?  Both food & service was efficient, no fuss.  Would go back if I were in a pinch, but def not my first choice for Korean!"}
{"text":"**YELP ALERT**  Man Doo Hyang is under new ownership/management.  Still a good place.  Menu has changed somewhat, but still the same delicious (huge) kimchi mandu, chapsal sundae, bae-kimchi (white kimchi) and regular baechu kimchi and kkagdugi for panchan.  The broth in the mandu soup was definitely more tasty than before and less salty.  I'll update on Yelp when I figure out the (new) name of the restaurant.  Very generous with the panchan but after one refill of the baechu kimchi as well as the HUGE dumplings, we could barely move we were so full!  Definitely worth returning to."}
{"text":"Best  I've had in GTA so far. Lacking in variety of side dishes, however the food and service is very good."}
{"text":"Turns out this is the same place that I have been to after finding in it in CheapEats book few year back, the name did not register in my brain and after reading a few Korean lists I decided to give it a go, as it turned out a second go. Needless to say that I wasn't wowed the first time around, hence is the lack of name recognition. This time I will definitely remember it but not for the food it serves as much as for the contingent of its customers. There was a large group of youngsters who were already beyond their drinking capacities when we walked in(I immediately remembered Karl R with his Irish-Korean comparison),  who were later joined by an old white man in even better condition getting another beer as if he had not had enough already. He was so drunk that the amplitude of his swinging was easily 180 degrees from side to side. So, among the yelling and cheering of the young group and inconsistent swivels of a drunken whitey we tried to enjoy the hand made noodle and dumpling soup as well as a beef hot pot. Neither of which was impressive enough to compensate for the atmosphere, the noddles are indeed tasty and have nice slurpiness factor, but the broth of both soups was lacking in flavor or better say brothiness, that's right, it felt more like hot water than a beef broth. The dumplings were so insanely huge, that eating them directly from the pot meant burning your mouth as they could not cool fast enough. Also the stuffing was not that fantastic at all. The banchan was ok and the petite dumpling on the house were nice. Both soups were around 7-8$ which is a steal for a huge portion they serve. IMHO, use only  for lunch at your own discretion."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was pretty impressed with my meal! Not only that, the ladies working were super sweet which made my whole experience a lot better.   For appetizers, they gave us three kinds of Kim chi. The Kim chi was super spicy though... the spiciest Kim chi I've ever eaten ahah but the other two dishes were great.  We ordered the fried dumplings, spicy pork and kimchi stir fry and spicy seafood noodle soup.   The fries dumplings was my favourite out of everything. I got 6 dumplings for $7.99... it seems a lot but trust me the dumplings were huge! The right amount of crunchiness and filling. It was totally worth it because there was so much filling in each dumpling. Seriously each dumpling is the size of two ping pong balls LOLL. Couldn't even finish this so I ended up packing it.   I had the spicy pork and Kim chi stir fry. This was my least favourite but it was still okay. I didn't enjoy it as much because it was way too sweet for me... I killed the rice really quick to balance out the sweetness Lol! However there was a really good amount of meat, but for $15.99... not sure if this is worth the price :P   My boyfriend got the spicy seafood noodle soup and he really enjoyed it! He really loved the hand made noodles and broth. I also had a taste of the broth and it was fantastic. It looked so delicious even these two old ladies walking by had to ask what it was! I believe this dish was $8.99, which i feel is really fair given the portion and quality.   I really enjoyed this place as well because the restaurant is spacious, so you won't be siting right next to strangers like you would at owls haha.   Overall, our bill came up to about $42 after tax for all three meals and a beer.   Definitely recommend if you're looking for a good Korean restaurant in Mississauga :) price and service is on par!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Korean food in Mississauga and you're willing to brave a suicidal left turn into a sketchy strip mall, this place is it.  Most Korean restaurants focus on Japanese entrees and sashimi / sushi with bimbimbap as an add on.  Here, large jugs of fermenting rice wine are prominently centre stage in the dining area and the staff only speaks Korean.  Tables are fitted for Korean hot pot experience and the soups are filled with seafood or chunks of meat.  My order of the Korean dumplings, man doo, and a spicy seafood tofu soup left me completely full.  The smiling but silent waitress takes our order quickly and returns with two hot cups of tea and 3 ban chan plates of kimchi and pickled vegetables.  The kimchi is young and not fiery but it's flavourful.  The kimchi white radish has a nice crunch while the pickled white carrot has a nice sweet and sour profile.  A plate of steamed dumplings arrived quickly. The 8 dumplings are $5 and they were the size of a medium peach.  They're stuffed full of pork with cabbage and green onion.  The skin is a bit thick but cooked well.    The soup is a giant red broth filled with shrimp with the heads on, clams, mussels, and calamari.  It's light on the heat but I was told to ask for Korean hot next time.  There was a lot of soft silky tofu as well to provide a custardy texture to the soup .  A raw egg is provided as well to add into the broth.  The side of rice is not your plain sticky white bland starch.  It is filled with forbidden rice, sticky white rice, beans, dates, and butternut squash.  Definitely bonus points for this!  They also pour in broth into the crusty rice bowl to create a watery congee.  It's light on flavour but if you're still hungry somehow, you can finish off with that.    For the 2 entrees and dumpling plate,  it just hit the $30 mark.  Good flavours, silent but courteous service, and homey Korean food in Mississauga... For those of us that live away from Yonge Koreatown or Christie Station,  this is a fantastic alternative."}
{"text":"One of the very rare place that offer Gochang (Korean Grilled Intestine) in the menu. Food tastes good enough but not really something that stands out among other Korean restaurants nearby. For the price of $40 for 2 servings of BBQ platter, the portion was quite like a snack size. I hope that they might consider looking into the portion being offered.   Service was okay. A place for quick meal and/or takeout!"}
{"text":"I feel warm and fuzzy when I was eating at Man Doo Hyang!   There are not too many Korean places I visited that give me that homey feeling. You know how you have a sense that the waitstaffs really attentive, really care about you and make sure you have a good meal?  If you come here as a lone eater... and you are not too hungry, just order the noodle with the dumplings($6.95). As they not only have banchans for your dine in pleasures, they also give you extra mini dumplings!!  The noodles are nice and chewy with a lot of bite! And is Fresh!! thick like elastic bands, luckily does not taste like it! The soup based is a little peppery... and it is perfect on a cold winter day!  The Kimchi and Pork dumplings I found it way too garlicky and even have a huge chunks of raw garlic inside. I think I have bad garlicky smell for the rest of the day!   The waitress realized that we were sharing that noodle soup, not only she got us an extra bowl... she have the extra bowl filled with the broth! This is the first time that ever happened to me... ever! She is so friendly and smiley... +1 star!!  My suggestion comes for the noodles in  beef broth and skip the dumplings if you cannot stand the garlic! :P"}
{"text":"We felt uncomfortable the second after our dinner here. The raw crab was yummy but not that clean or sth."}
{"text":"I got the noodle soup with the dumplings.  It wasn't bad! I liked the broth quite a lot. The dumplings were nice and large too. I got to try the jajangmyeon and it wasn't bad either. I didn't like the banchan much though, and the kimchi was much spicier than I'm used to. All in all, this is an A-OK place."}
{"text":"LOVE the big yummy spicy dumplings here!    I always bring some people so that I can order the spicy dumpling noodle hot pot -- they say it serves 2 or 3, but I think it can serve 2-4, depending on your appetite.  You get some of those delicious dumplings, and thick yummy noodles, rice cakes (tip: wait to eat them at the end so that they've soaked up all that flavourful broth), mushrooms, veggies... Unfortunately, the dumplings have shrunk over the years.  They used to be huge!  Still tasty, but less of it...  After the soupy phase of the hot pot, you can pay a couple of bucks to get the fried rice with seaweed, kimchi, other goodies at the end.  It's so much fun to scrape that off the bottom of the pot, and delicious too!  They give you little tiny dumplings at the beginning of the meal too, which is nice.  I don't know if other choices here are so good.  I tried the fried dumplings once and they were kind of tough and dry.  I'd stick to the hot pot."}
{"text":"A great Korean restaurant in Mississauga!  I have been here a few times.  ATMOSPHERE: It's very spacious, so it can accommodate large families/groups. Décor is pretty sparse, but it's clean and bright. There's traditional floor seating, but lots of table-and-chair seating as well.  SERVICE: Average. Service was there when needed, and they weren't pushy. Didn't have trouble ordering in English - which sometimes can be an issue in smaller restaurants.  PRICE: Reasonable for the large portions! They have lots of fair-priced, family-sized grill sets or soup and rice/noodle combos - all great for sharing.    FOOD: Good banchans, including mini mandoo (dumplings) which they are known for. Their fried mandoo appetizer is highly recommended! All the other usual Korean fare - pork bone soup, bibimbap, etc. - are fairly reliable here."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second time having dinner at this Korean restaurant with the same group of friends. On my first visit I had their pork bone soup so I decided to try out their soft bean curd in seafood soup.  Service is almost non-existent here as the server only comes by to take your order and give you your food.   My seafood soup was disappointing because there was barely any seafood in it and mostly soft bean curd (tofu). The shrimps were puny and the one mussel was small. However, the soup was tasty.  It was an alright dining experience. I'm pretty sure there are better Korean restaurants in the city than Man Doo Hyang."}
