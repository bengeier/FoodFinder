{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go here pretty much every weekend on Sunday for breakfast because it's right across the street. This place is old school. It's like it got stuck in the 70s and never updated anything. The service is always great. CHEAP prices. The food comes out really fast and is always good. The only change I would make is to update the building somewhat and clean a little more and thoroughly. Overall though love this place- just don't expect anything fancy or modern."}
{"text":"Your basic greasy spoon breakfast served with heaping helpings of Fox News and conservative rage."}
{"text":"I had a wicked craving for a turkey sandwich with gravy n mashed potatoes.  They had it on special the day I was there. . Food was pretty good. Staff was like a small town crew. They knew many of the customers.  I think I'll be bAck."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Alexi's is like visiting family!  If you want a neighborhood restaurant to go to for a cup of coffee or any of the daily specials, then this is prefect.  Always personable, always ready to share what's happened since your last visit, and just a comfy/welcoming place to take friends to relax and enjoy some grub."}
{"text":"Average diner food for $8-$12, I would recommend and I've returned, service was better than most restaurants."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever. All thr ingreadiants were from a jar, can or frozen. Nothing made fresh"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast.  Standard fare for a normal customer.  Prices are unbelievably low.  Can't cook it at home for this.  Service was consistent and quick.  No complaints at all here.."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, had a chicken club really good. Just a really good diner."}
{"text":"Alexi's is always a great place to go for breakfast, and that's what we normally do at Alexi's.  We haven't been there for lunch or dinner much.  Breakfast is always a good experience.  As long as you know the right server you are going to get good service.  Don't be hesitant to ask to sit in the server's section.  They like that.  Alexi's prices are always reasonable for their meals.  The breakfast specials are usually 3.99 and come with all that you would need. Yesterday I had the biscuits and gravy for the first time.  They were alright, nothing I would rave about, though.  The omelets are good, and the toast is almost always perfectly toasted.  Some of the strawberry jam and I'm set for the morning.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was a nice friendly family restaurant. Their homemade soup was delicious!  Restaurant was clean and staff was VERY friendly.......even the staff not waiting on me.  I had the turkey club sandwich which was exceptional."}
{"text":"The food here at Alexi's is just kind of average. My eggs and home fries were good. The bacon was horribly salty. They do not offer a gluten free bread choice so the waitress, who was new, offered me tomato slices. Then she was told no they don't do that but did it for me but to make a note of it for future reference. My husband had fried chicken that he said was very salty but did have good flavor and was juicy. He said his mashed potatoes tasted like they had been reheated and weren't very good. The dining area is clean. The people are friendly. The waitress was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a great little family diner.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The breakfast food is good - I found it not to be greasy or overly cheesy which is important for me.  The Green Chile and Tomato Omelet is delicious. If you are looking for a homey place with yummy traditional food, this is it!"}
{"text":"This place puts a smile on my face! It's silly because it looks like a granny decorated it, but the food is probably better than most of my grandma's food-so who's to complain?  I got the turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes. I was so surprised when it came out with real carved turkey!! I felt like it was Thanksgiving! The potatoes were super yummy too! My bf got the pork tenderloin sandwich-it was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Today was perfect in every way! The young man who seated us had taken our drink order as we were sitting down.   The Waitress came by to get our order before we were even ready and breakfast arrived, really fast and Hot off the griddle!  Everyone pitches in with Drink re-fills and checking in to see if we needed anything with out being intrusive.  Weekday specials are totally reasonable and only a $1.00 more on weekends Cant wait to go back for dinner and try a house special!."}
{"text":"Service here sucks. The food is good but part of dining out is to have a pleasant experience.  They brought the check WITH our meal, like hurry up and eat and get the funk out. We used to really like the place, they had older staff and it was like going to grandma's for breakfast.  Not the same experience these days. Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual dinning experience. Good food at a good price and close to home. My daughter loves it because sometimes someone makes her a balloon animal. This is family run restaurant, a real testament to the American dream that sometimes the average guy (family) can make good!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sunday morning. Fast service, friendly and attentive staff. Food was good except hash browns were ehh...but all in all good time"}
{"text":"My son and I went to Alexi's for breakfast this morning.  When we sat we heard a kid in another booth say there was a cockroach.  We didn't really think anything of it until about 5 minutes later my son jumped out of his seat because a cockroach had crawled on his leg.  (I should have just got up and left)  I am terrified of any bug so this was very gross.  We asked them to move us to the other side of the restaurant.  When we sat on the other side they brought us our food and the waitress very quietly said she was sorry.  We both ordered Orange juice and when my son went to take a drink noticed things floating in it and the cup was dirty.  We thought we would just ask for a new one but NOONE ever came back to see how we were doing.  When we went to check out the lady gave a horrible look when I asked her to take one OJ off the bill.  I would think that a manager would come and apologize.   Very gross and I don't think I will EVER be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place, visit here occasionally and receive exactly what is expected. No frills, just good food and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food with a good menu, with a friendly experienced wait staff. Family owned busines, makes the difference!"}
{"text":"Just finished our 1st and our last meal here...the food was average like a denny's or  IHOP. I won't say I won't eat there again just because the whites of my husbands eggs weren't cooked it could happen to anyone. The reasons we won't eat there again are because we watched the cook go into & out of the restroom with his apron on GROSS! The staff was not rude but I have no idea what our servers name was because she didn't say more than 10 words to us the entire meal. The restaurant is very outdated the walls and floors could use a good scrubbing and it is very poorly lit...my 1st thought was they need Robert from Food Networks Restaurant Impossible!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a high rating, because it is great at what it is.  The decor is 1970s, and the clientele are in their 70s :).  It's an old fashioned family style restaurant with comfort food your Mom made you as a child.  It reminds me of the Midwest, which I do have good memories of.  Everything I've had has been delicious, from a chorizo skillet to meatloaf-mashed potatoes-green peas.  Kicking it old school!"}
{"text":"Great place for an inexpensive breakfast...that still tastes great!"}
{"text":"I dropped in on a fluke, starving and looking for breakfast that was not sitting in a food warmer. Great family restaurant. Warm and inviting, friendly service. They offer a Mid-west daily special menu with staples like pork tenderloin, fish fry, pot roast, and liver & onions. Great daily breakfast specials with hearty servings at reasonable prices. Food was good and filling. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 13 years and have never had a problem. Service is great. Quality food for a decent price."}
{"text":"I love finding small business restaurant and this was near my job. I came with hubby and kids since we work together and this place is nearby the food was good and decent. Nothing out of the ordinary just a diner but it does have a good flow of customers and I love the old time feel and how they have plenty of regulars will come back again"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a neighborhood, family style, home cooking restaurant?  Then Alexis' is the place to go.  There is nothing fancy about the place mostly booths, a couple of tables and a counter with stools, but it is clean and there is no loud music or crowds.  We love their daily specials...the cod and ground sirloin steak are both excellent and the price is hard to beat!  We have had breakfast, lunch and dinner there, the service has been great and the food is always hot."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Alexi's for a couple of years.  I finally decided to do a review after our visit Saturday.  We come for the chorizo and eggs after a morning of shooting at Ben Avery. Growing up eating Spanish chorizo and Mexican style chorizo Alexi's offers good Mexican style chorizo.  I got the chorizo with potatoes and a couple of tortillas.  This reminded me of my days of growing up.  Homemade chorizo and potatoes Saturday morning after doing all the chores.  Me and my sister split a side of corn beef hash too.  I am not sure about the rest of the menu but their chorizo is great.  Sometimes you might need to press with a napkin to soak up a tad bit of oil."}
{"text":"Favorite place for non-chain breakfasts.  Half moon omelets are excellent as well as made to order Belgium waffles.  Good variety of desserts too with strong coffee."}
{"text":"This restaurant is less than a mile from my house and I've only been here one time and while I was eating my breakfast one of the cooks came out to smash a cock a roach that was crawling up the wall.  I have never been more disgusted in my life I would never ever ever go to this restaurant ever again and it blows my mind this place is even still in business!"}
{"text":"This past sunday my wife and I  went to eat breakfast. She order waffles  and and they were cold ,and i ordered the Mexican skillet breakfast ans was submerged in oil and so was the meat and potoes  It was gross.I hot tge waitress and she told the owner the owner Marged outside and when we left to eat somewhere else and paying the owner came back inside.To me its the worst!!! place!!! in Phoenix. !!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 12 years every winter we moved to the west valley bun continue to drive across town to eat here. The food is good and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I come here twice a week or so Arianna is our favorite server. We are able to eat out more often because their prices are so reasonable. Athena is usually here to take care of any problems, but we've not had any. Come over and see Joni, Nadine Michelle Marline and all the Alexis family there's plenty of booths and they'll treat you right. Be a counter fly if you like. Mike and I will see you there! We've been coming since 2005."}
{"text":"I have lived in Deer Valley for quite a while now and I drive by Alexi's at least twice a day yet, I have never ate there. Well, my wife and I figured what the hell and gave it a shot. Not too bad! We have gone twice now and the food and service has been great. Prices were very fair for what you get. I tried the chix fried streak and the eggs with corned beef hash, my wife had the breakfast burrito - all very good and filling!  Now, the bad news. Old, Old, Old! From the wallpaper, the booths, the servers, & the patrons. It reminded me of an old 70's retirement diner. Think a little like Mel's Diner meets Golden Girls..   Anyway, looking past that - the place has some good food for the right price! You can feed the family here and not break the bank! Plus, it's a local Mom & Pop place that needs support - Better than Denny's or IHOP..."}
{"text":"I came in and it felt like i had five waitresses.  The tip's going to suck if they have to split it five ways.  I came in with a party of 4 for breakfast.  The sausage links were burnt.  My steak had black burn marks where it was charred, but was still too rare at other spots.  Even the english muffins were too black.  The only thing that turned out right was the kids meal, scrambled eggs and toast.    I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've driven by alexis about a hundred times and kept thinking I should stop in but never got the chance. Today was an errand day, so I thought it might be nice to fuel up first and alexis hit the spot. This will certainly be my new weekend breakfast spot.  I opted for the corned beef hash and it was prepared just the way I like it! The hasbrowns are sorta flaky and browned and super yummy. My bf got pancakes and they were fluffy and tasty. One of the best parts was that the little jelly holder had apple butter! Haven't had it ages - yummmm!   The portions were large, I only made it through half of my meal and my bf finished his, but just about had to undo the button on his pants hehe. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.   I'm giving this place 4 stars but its more like 4.5....it smelled funny when we walked in and we almost left, although I'm glad we didnt. It also took a bit to get the check. The decor is also far outdated, but charming in my opinion.  My own little gem in my hood, glad I stopped in and looking forward to my return!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat for down home cooking.  Lot's of food on the plate, nice wait staff, special's daily with very good prices.  Never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Was nearby around lunchtime and decided to stop in. Ended up having a breakfast dish rather than something \"lunchy\".   The place was clean, parking a breeze, fairly busy, and the staff was very friendly.   I had two eggs scrambled, bacon, country fried potatoes, and toast.   Everything was good but...  The eggs were over cooked. The bacon burnt, and the toast was on the burnt side as well.  The country fries were pretty dang good, though!    The burnt bacon was the most disappointing...  Other than that, it's a decent breakfast and a fairly good price.   I probably should have tried a lunch item, given the time of day but...  Next time. For sure."}
{"text":"good food.. good service.. clean.. friendly.. and the selection of food is great for a diner! you gotta give it a try if you want an old fashion family diner."}
{"text":"It's a really nice place, clean, everyone is really nice. It wasn't that busy when I came but it was steady and still got my food pretty quick and nice & hot. My eggs were done how I asked them it was all very good. It's great to come to a place where the locals walk in and the staff knows them by name and chat with them even the newbies, like me, to make everyone feel at home."}
{"text":"Great food and Great service. I have been going here off and on for the last 8 years. I no longer live in the area, but still go there once and a while when I'm near. I went today and had the special: pancakes, eggs and sausage. Everything was hot and delicious. The price is right and the servers are always prompt and pleasant. so glad they are still in business and the place was packed."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day for dinner and have to say this place is pretty nice. It reminds me of an old fashion restaurant, no frills just good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"As a coffee shop, this place easily deserves five stars for overall consistency of excellent service and good food.  Always very prompt seating and the restaurant is very well staffed for efficient service.  The wait staff are always courteous and seem to like working there.  The quality food is above average for this class of restaurant.     Stopped in today for lunch and had really good grilled ham and cheese with fries.  Washed it down with iced tea.  Service was great.  The total bill came to $9.38 without tip.  A very well run restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious home-cooked style food! Friendly service, family oriented and reasonable prices!   I would recommend the Liver dish with sautee onions, hearty mashed potatoes and gravy and the sweet coleslaw!  Comfort food at its best! YUM! Keep up the good work Alexi's!"}
{"text":"we have been here a few times and the food is average. today i found a black curly hair on my plate and when i told the owner/manager about it, she looked annoyed and her response was \"well it's small.\" umm excuse me that is how you respond to me?! i was being very polite about the situation but expected some sort of accountability or apology. she also acted like she was doing me a favor by telling me that she was taking my meal (that i had taken only a few bites of) off my bill! beware if you plan to come here and be looking out for nasty hairs in your food!!! i'm not someone to ever post reviews.. especially negative ones but there is something to be said for customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal visitor for roughly 17 years now. The staff, let me say, they treat me as a member of their family. The crew has seen me while I was pregnant with my son, since he was new born, and everyone greets him and will go out of their way to talk to him. They know our order and our drinks are right there prior to us sitting completely down (at the counter, stop and say hello to us.). That's the atmosphere and feel of Alexi's.  The food, depends on what you're there for ie breakfast, lunch or dinner and who's in the kitchen. The day kitchen is okay as long as it's not meat. The evening, I prefer, because things that are to be crispy are crispy. It's comfort food, that will satisfy your belly and priced reasonably.  The dessert. My son likes the cheese cake, I bake cheese cake, so I tend not to eat it. I had the rice pudding or was it bread pudding, doesn't really matter, I wasn't a fan of it. It's not how grandma made it, if you know what I'm saying."}
{"text":"Want a homemade, fast inexpensive breakfast? Go here! I'm addicted to the pancakes ! The staff is also usually very kind and attentive too. Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"I just love love this place.. ..Was there on Friday and going back tonight!!!! The staff & food is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Wonder food and service from waitress,THresa!!...Family of four enjoyed a variety of dishes!!"}
{"text":"Short version: Great service, great coffee. Food was cold and took forever despite the place being dead.   Long version: Got a late breakfast with my girlfriend here today. This review is for breakfast food only, we didn't try the rest of the menu. The place was absolutely dead when we went in maybe 5 people in the entire place.   Service was quick, coffee stayed full, check came quickly and we never were really in need of anything. Waitress did a great job keeping us happy.   Food was disappointing to say the least. My girlfriend got a \"country breakfast\" which came with eggs (perfectly  cooked over easy), biscuits and gravy and sausage. Gravy was runny and tasteless, biscuits min were TINY. Sausage was burned on outside and barely warm in inside.   I got a \"french toast sandwich\" that wasn't actually a sandwich at all. I expected a breakfast sandwich and was excited only to be let down. I got 3 slices of cold french toast, like not even slightly warm, a piece of burned sausage, and side of eggs (also perfectly cooked). Not sure why its called a sandwich at all.  Food took forever. Thinking maybe it got finished then sat in the window for 20 minutes to get cold? Not sure what took so long. Place was empty and ita breakfast food. I literally could have made the entire meal myself in less time."}
{"text":"I wasn't terribly impressed with the breakfast I had here. I ordered biscuits and gravy, with a scrambled egg and bacon.  The egg was flavorless, the bacon was kind of wimpy, and the biscuit and gravy was subpar.  Seems like a friendly enough place, but I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Nothin special. Nothin to rave about. Typical diner food. Tastes good enough. I had the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. Food is cheap so I'd say its worth it. Orange juice was served warm. I got a small and it was $2.19. And its really small..Service was okay."}
{"text":"Good place to eat breakfast. I go here often. Very fast service. Pedro makes good homemade Salsa."}
{"text":"Quite honestly..I'm surprised this place has as many stars as it does. I will say the only redeeming quality were the waitresses. The food is absolutely NOT 4 stars..ever. I ordered the biscuits and gravy thinking it had sausage in it like normal..my bad and I own that.. but the hash browns tasted very oily and the corn beef hash was extremely salty..beyond the point that it couldn't even be eaten. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. On top of that they charge $.25 for to go boxes and another $.25 for a to go coffee cup and the young kid at the register had the nerve to say it's expensive..actually it's pennies on the dollar for those things and you don't see it bankrupting any other restauraunt. If the food had been worth the price then maybe I wouldn't have complained but it was unedible..there is a reason I've only been here twice in 20 years and I was painfully reminded this morning. Don't nickel and dime your customers for subpar food. Same price food exists at IHOP and Dennys..but better quality and they don't charge for to go..may not seem a lot but it's shady..there is no disclosure prior to coming to the register which is in very poor taste and deceptive."}
{"text":"What a great find!!! We are staying ten days in Phoenix so I began looking for a good breakfast restaurant on our first morning here. Alexi's is a family owned joint serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've eaten breakfast at least five times since arriving.   Their home fries are really good. Nice and crispy on the outside and yet moist inside, retaining their potato flavor. My poached eggs were cooked perfect - nice runny yolks with the white firmly set. My bacon came as ordered - nice and crisp. And the sourdough was tasty, browned nicely and with sufficient butter.   We also came back another day just for dessert. They have assorted home baked fruit pies as well as pecan. We both had a arm pie a la mode. I had peach. Wife had blueberry. Both were excellent with enough fruit and a nice flaky crust.   Prices are commensurate with the quantity and quality of the meal served."}
{"text":"Great meal for the prices, clean, 70's style diner, ornery waitresses with spunk. I felt like I was in Mel's Dinner...was looking for Alice & Flo hahahhaa.   Only thing that was tough is eating in a hot place. It was 100 or more degrees outside and inside the building didn't give much relief. It had to have been higher than 80. Our group was uncomfortable, but we endured.   Served quickly and delicious food."}
{"text":"Down home french toast with whipped butter, yummy!   My boyfriend had the skillet which was cheesey, bacony and hot!  Belly warming goodness everytime.  Breakfast on the weekends, this is my favorite spot.  This ol' diner has no fancy bells and whistles, country decor wall paper with old fashioned sweet customer service.  I love the sweet ladies that work here and the meals are made quick, no long wait.   They have a small TV by the counter bar where I've been able to catch a soccer game once or twice.  I ask nicely to change the channel.  :)"}
{"text":"This small family owned restaurant is exactly what you'd expect. Friendly and personable service at a very reasonable price. The restaurant was clean, the food was hot, fresh, and tasty."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Very nice staff always seating us quickly and getting our order in a timely manner. Food comes out quickly and is always tasting good. It is a nice, clean establishment. There is plenty to choose from the the lengthy menu. Very affordable for a family, and it is great if you like supporting local mom and pop businesses!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast twice in the last week.  They have great breakfast deals - 4 different breakfast deals for $3.99 every week day ($4.99 on weekends).  I had one of their breakfast specials on their first visit and the food was average diner food.  The next time I had the minced ham and scrambled eggs which were swimming in butter and just not good.  I would stick with the breakfast specials going forward."}
{"text":"Time machine to a 70s diner. Good diner food and great service for great prices. I like the liver and onions and you get two sides for under $10. A lot of older folks like me I've seen there because we like good food for fair prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"4.1666666  Alexis is your alomst typical Diner setting. If I remember corectly this was a Country Kitchen  back in its day.   They have a great selection of Breakfast, lunch and dinner. The specials are hard to beat. They also have some greek food too.   I had a grilled bacon (yum) and cheese (yum) on toasted sourdough (yum) with a side salad and homemade rice pudding. $4.32 !  Sandwich = 5 Salad = 3.5 Rice Pudding =4  The decor is bad, pink and countryish. The service was excellent. The food was excellent. The price was more then fair. I actually felt like I ripped them off so I left a nice tip. LOL  PS The Montecristo is a great sandwich too."}
{"text":"They've been in my neighborhood for years,  but I only went once. Terrible food, service, atmosphere. Loud, old looking. They obviously have a lot of senior citizen regulars judging by the chit-chat with servers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I didn't feel like cooking dinner last night, so he thought we should try out Alexi's. It ended up being a great idea! He ordered the steak and shrimp with a side of cole slaw & curly fries. I ordered the Gyro platter with a side salad and curly fries. We both ordered Dr. Pepper's to drink. We felt immediately welcomed as soon as we walked into the diner. We were seated immediately, and within moments our server took our drink order. She answered my questions about the daily specials, and gave us a few more moments to make our selection. She recommended the cole slaw and my boyfriend though it was great. The salad came out with fresh lettuce, cucumber slices, and a couple grape tomatoes. They also included dressing on the side and 2 packages of crackers. The server gave us refills on our beverages when ours were halfway full. That equals awesome service! We appreciated the friendly smiles and homey feel while enjoying our delicious dinners. We plan on returning to try out their breakfast specials."}
{"text":"A good 'ol fashioned place to get really good home-cooked food at a very reasonable price. The service is extremely attentive, personal, and sincerely appreciative. The soup of the day of cream of chicken and rice. It was very obviously homemade and truly delicious. The roast turkey dinner was plentiful and very, very good. The ribeye steak was also quite good, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"Alexi's is not fine dining by any means. It's just good food at a fair price. Simple and clean, the staff is friendly and lots of locals inside. Lots of items on the menu day or night from a place that has been around a long time. Call it a Diner or call it a Dive, it won't cost you much and you should leave full, look for the Specials on the chalkboard when you walk in and save a buck or two and get that extra side."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the ladies here are very sweet and courteous. I ate the #3 with no meat, before I could ask the wonderful server asked if I wanted to substitute for potatoes. Gold star for her!! I will come back with my husband this is a wonderful place. The food is superb French toast was just right tastes like my mother's."}
{"text":"I was really unimpressed.  They get a weak 3 based mainly on the service which was the strong point of the visit this morning.  Arriving about 8 on a Thursday morning the restaurant was about full.  Given the choice between a booth and the counter I chose a booth.  Ordered decaf which there was afresh pot brewing and it came in a few minutes.  Ordered the Country breakfast (normally $5.99 but was the daily special at $4.99) with 2 eggs, a split biscuit with gravy and 2 slices of bacon.  The biscuits were ok.  I prefer a sausage gravy rather than the pepper gravy they make but it was ok.  The bacon was tasty but thin and not lean.  The eggs were runny in the middle.  The building and interior was showing a lot of wear.  There ware a lot of regulars even after the morning rush of folks heading off to work.  The service was really good and friendly.  Overall this place was a reasonable value in that you could get a breakfast at fast food prices with wait service.  Not sure I would make it part of a regular rotation but I may stop again because of where it is in relation to where I travel."}
{"text":"Had breakfast. Nice waitress, so-so food, uncomfortable booth seating if your bigger... No room, pick a table instead. Busser served me my coffee & waters with her fingers around the rims... Yuck!  Anyway..."}
{"text":"Great food if you are looking for homestyle breakfast fare.  The staff were great as well.  The pricing is fair and the portions are big.  It has the feel of a family run business and not a chain store."}
{"text":"Great \"home cooked\" food at very reasonable prices and service to boot. The owners are a Greek family and always looking to update and improve!! Clean and tasty!! Highly recommend this family owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"I go here if I want simple, home-cooked kind of meals. It's a simple place with simple ideas serving decent food. Love the fried chicken, turkey dinner is okay and the pork chops were pretty good."}
{"text":"Well where do I start.... Do not go here. Bathrooms were all broken waitress was impatient and not courteous at all. They charged me 2.00 for everything I added to my omelet. Then the omelet and toast were over cooked. This was a total waste of time and money. My meal was 8.99 and my hubbys meal was 6.99 somehow our bill was 30.00???? Not worth it at all"}
{"text":"First time here. Lets see Well it was down home simple food. They carter to us seniors, which is nice. I did go back for a second time and did the salad and sandwich. Simple, but tasty. Yes I'm going back. Service was great, food in the good price range."}
{"text":"Food was very good!! Definitely a family run business,  they were here helping and eatting.  I had the turkey dinner plate and hubby had the Reuben  sandwich  plate. Prices were very reasonable.   We will be back for sure! !"}
{"text":"Just went for breakfast for the first time with my family. I have to say everyone was absolutely wonderful! I love the  atmosphere. Even the people who were dining there were just pleasant. Normally when I bring my 2 year old into places I feel embarrassed when he starts screaming but everyone there was so nice and tried helping us. Definitely will become a regular place for our family for sure !"}
{"text":"Served very quick. Had bacon and sausage omelet with hash browns. Delicious. Would come back if I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Great home style meals. Good food and good service. Breakfast all day and senior specials."}
{"text":"Second time here and the food still good just not as good as it used to be. I gave it 4 stars for the customer service our waitress provided not so much for the food. Not sure if it's a new cook or not but just different. It's pricier than I remember as well and for the quality of food we received, not worth the price.  Still good for a quick meal and a lot better than fast food."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Service.  We ordered the Club Sandwich the sandwich was just thrown together there was no meat at all we told our server who was sweet and she took sandwich back to add meat and we added cheese she brought back and the turkey was on top of bread outside of sandwich completely smashed, she said I am sorry that the owner/cook was mad at her.  We sent back and asked to speak with him we waited five minutes and she came out and said that he wouldn't come out, I was shocked never in my life have I experienced that before.  When we were leaving I saw the owner through the cook window yelling at the servers.  I advise anybody who is thinking about trying this place do not spend your money there these people are horrible to employees our server was there 6 years.  That was the first and last time there:("}
{"text":"I would not refer anyone here! Food was decent. Servers were not knowledge about menu. So many little extra charges they do not tell you about! I.e. refills, cheese, egg beaters. Even after speaking with them about the extra fees, the did not waive the extra charges. Hash browns were disgusting, mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant from a box."}
{"text":"tried to apply here when I was first starting to get into the work world and the lady had no idea what to do when I walked in and asked for an application. instead, she gave me a napkin and a pen and told me to write down my name and number. that was it. of course I never got a call back, but it was a pretty horrible feeling because it probably just got tossed out since it was a NAPKIN. if you're looking to apply, I hope you have better luck than I did. that was the worst service any restaurant could've done for a person."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, super relaxed atmosphere with good comfort food. I have never had a bad meal here or poor service, the epitome of the classic mom and pop diner. You can bring the entire family and not break the bank, instead of eating at a chain try eating local and start here, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went there for the first to meet a friend around 1 PM.  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the waitress was very efficient almost too much so.  I had no idea what was on the menu and the waitress was already there ready to take the order.  That would have been great if I had a clue as to what I wanted.  I wound up with an open faced sandwich and some canned peaches (she did mention they were caned but the gravy was heaped on and it turned me off (over the top on the gravy)  So I had beef, bread, gravy and canned peaches.  Usually you get 3 items not 2 but the gravy was too much.  I just think they should lighten up on the gravy aside from that it was not bad.  I would return but not order the same item."}
{"text":"It is what it is - a little slice of small town America on a street corner in a big city.  It was clean.  The service was great.  It was interesting ease-dropping on an old guy sharing his military memories with a young sgt. back from Iraq.  Now for the food...Robert Irvin of Restaurant Impossible would have said - frozen chicken fried steak, powdered mashed potatoes, canned brown gravy and bitter lettuce in the salad.  Disappointing.  I'll try breakfast some time because that has to be cooked from scratch ( I hope!)."}
{"text":"If you like small town diners and gravy covered food then you will feel right at home at Alexi's.  There is nothing inherently wrong with it but having celiac and needing gluten free food makes this a difficult to impossible place to eat.   My Mom (also GF) ordered the sliced gravy with mashed potatoes with NO gravy.  We told the server that we could eat no bread products or anything which would have gluten, including gravy....she seemed to understand and said she'd tell the cook.    When the plate arrived my Mom went to cut the turkey, we found stuffing under the turkey!  Um, stuffing IS bread!  I have never eaten there again.  But other family members love it.  The ones who eat beef and \"old school\" products.....I just won't ever trust them for food sensitive issues.  If you want diner food then you will be happy."}
{"text":"My fiance and I discovered Alexis while moving into the area. Covered in moving filth, hungry, and not wanting to talk to anyone (including each other) after a long day of hauling boxes up and down stairs we stumbled into the diner. Decor is drab and out dated, but who cares. We went 3 times that week until I un packed our pans, perfect spot for a club sandwich and a cup of way too salty chili (which I really like). All brought to your table my a surly older lady that is vaguely reminiscent of Flo, I always expect her to tell someone to kiss her gits. Its nothing amazing, but its not horrible, and you can find at least five members of the family that owns it in the corner booth near the kitchen at any given time."}
{"text":"The best local family owned Restaurant for over 18 years.  Food is out of this world,specials everyday."}
{"text":"*BEWARE* soda refills are not free!!  Service was good, very attentive. Food was ok except for home fries which were a little odd. Chicken fried steak could have used a little seasoning. Overall not a bad experience, but I don't think we will come back  Breakfast for 2 was 21$"}
{"text":"Sunday, 8:30pm, am starving! Tried Yelp for places with home-cooked food, NOT fast food yick, that were still open!  Alexis was recommended. It was very clean, booths with pleasant lighting. Had fried chicken.  It's unusual to find a family- owned restaurant with tasty home-cooked food at very reasonable prices. Am going back on the morning for their $3.99 breakfast!"}
{"text":"Alexi's is my kind of breakfast spot. Stuck in the 70's. No misguided efforts to cater to Millennials. Basic menu. Traditional coffee. Cheap specials. But I've been disappointed by the service.  There is always a risk when you infrequently visit a spot that is regularly frequented by so many others. You might not understand the rhythm of the establishment. I know up front Alexi's won't give me all the breakfast syrup I need and I'll have to beg for more. A pet peeve of mine, but no big deal. On this day, however, I felt totally neglected. Odd, because friendly service is key for the survival of an independent restaurant like this. No coffee refills until I was ready to leave. The water I requested upon ordering never arrived. Just an empty coffee cup with breakfast for me, I guess. My pancakes were cold by the time I received the extra syrup I needed. I noted some other patrons receiving much better treatment. At one point I felt like a kindergartener repeatedly waiving for the attention of my teacher, only to be ignored in favor of more popular classmates.   You shouldn't have to work so hard to be served breakfast. I just wanted to relax and sip some coffee and do some reading.  The food was fine. Be warned. Some of the Yelp photos of breakfast specials are quite old. The going rate is now $4.99 (weekdays before 11:00 a.m.) for most specials. Still a good deal. Coffee is $1.99. I will return if I'm in the area, but Alexi's is not a restaurant for which I would go out of my way."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of it's reviews and was sadly disappointed.  If you like frozen food and stuff out of a can than its your place.  I prefer to pay a little more and have  my stuff prepared fresh from scratch.  I had the corned beef hash and eggs.  The hash was out of a can (geez I can do that myself), the country potatoes were a bit under done and the over easy eggs looked more like poached eggs.  The coffee was ok but I guess they cap it at one refill because my cup was at the edge for a refill but was never noticed.  The service was ok but once the food was served that was the last I seen of my server.  IHOP and Bill Johnson's are just down the road and would be a better choice, maybe even the Waffle House!"}
{"text":"Small family friendly restaurant. Good home cooked comfort food and very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at a local Family Restaurant probably best describes it. Have been here many times for breakfast. Always good food and friendly service. They have daily specials M-F that are reasonably priced. Two large pancakes with eggs and bacon for $5.99. Place has a steady flow of regulars and working folks. They also serve lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Depressing beyond words. The service wasn't bad but again, depressing. The food was fair and that's being kind. The over all feel had me rushing to escape."}
{"text":"We visited there for breakfast.  Were  greeted at the door, immediately seated. and were immediately waited on.  coffee was good, the breakfast was also very good.  Pricing is equal to other places we  have go to.   Well worth a try."}
{"text":"This is my home away from home.  I am a regular and know most of the staff very well.  Great value and incredibly low prices for old fashioned comfort food.  I can't fix breakfast at home any cheaper than it is here.  Very good coffee.  I feel like I'm with family when I am here because I am treated that way."}
{"text":"Retro place with wallpaper that is decades old, literally.  This place has an old school diner feel, with some odd similarities to other places - the plates are similar to those Denny's uses, and the brown brick floor is just like the ones you see at McDonalds.  Food is very mediocre though, and regular prices are steep for what you get (hit the weekday specials if you come here).  Staff was alright.  Lot of obese patrons here for some reason."}
{"text":"Needing a breakfast joint for Father's Day that wasn't going to be packed. Alexi's it was. Arrived about 8:30 with a party of 10. Was greeted by several wait staff and seated right away. At glance restaurant was clean.  I ordered from the breakfast special menu. #1 for me. Half a waffle, 2 eggs, choice of breakfast meat. A bargain at $6.99 on a Sunday morning. Food arrived quickly. Hot and fresh! My waffle crispy with a big scoop of butter, eggs perfectly over easy, bacon cooked nicely. Other specials include pancakes, French toast or home fries and toast.   Our service was fantastic even though we were a large party coffee and iced beverages always full.   Alexi's is going to be our new go to breakfast joint. Home cooking with a hometown feel and for a party of 10 our bill was only $100 bucks. We all had beverages and not everyone ordered off the special menu."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Seriously who puts processed yellow cheese slices on pastrami sandwiches."}
