{"text":"This is the worst food I ever had. The chicken was burnt and greased. One pickle and a butt biscuit. Its like they scraped the leftovers and gave it as free food."}
{"text":"I will never order from here again. I live less than a mile away, it took over an hour and a half to get to me. I call twice to see where my order was and was hung up on both times. By the time the food arrived, it was cold and gross. I will never order from here and would suggest you stay away."}
{"text":"Pathetic. Frozen GFS product. Nothing fresh about anything. Giant eagle buns. Food is not at all like pictured. Not only did I pay $30 for this nonsense I had to sit and watch them make it for 40 mins after I phoned my order in for pickup."}
