{"text":"I was in the area and hungry so I decided to let yelp decide where to dine. Kabuki (authentic Japanese cuisine and sushi) had outstanding reviews.  It's a small place located in the Sun Valley Commons center in Union County.   With such an extensive menu I went simple:  1) A House Salad: Crispy Iceberg lettuce, cucumber and green pepper with Kabuki ginger dressing and 2)  Chicken Teriyaki Entree (steamed rice and sauteed vegetables).  There was plenty of food for sure and it was fresh.  Two things:  The Kabuki ginger dressing didn't have the typical punch that I personally like and the chicken wasn't Teriyaki'd (is that a word?) enough for me.  Really nice folks though.  Go give it a try."}
{"text":"This is a new Japanese restaurant located in Sun Valley Commons shopping center in Indian Trail, near the intersection of Old Monroe/Old Charlotte Hwy and Wesley Chapel Stouts Rd. I've ordered take-out twice and both times was very impressed with the food and service. The sushi is excellent ... the best I've had in the area (Charlotte included). I've also had Gyudon (Beef Bowl) for lunch today that was excellent. My wife and kids are also very impressed with the food. The portions are generous and the service is very good. The place is not fancy, but it is clean and welcoming.   My only complaint (and this is very minor) is that the menu is too large. Too many choices, leading to family members taking WAY too long to make up their minds!  I'm a big supporter of locally owned and operated businesses ... please support this new business! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This placed closed down .There should be a way of noting that so people dont keep calling the poor old lady who now has the phone. I called and drove by. No longer in business."}
{"text":"I must say the service at Kabuki was excellent!  The EU Roll, #94, with tempura shrimp, grilled eel, red pepper, and cucumber was Delicious (yes, with a capital D).  However, the order @ $7.95 only came with 4 pieces, though they were large.  You can't go wrong with this item.  I also ordered the cucumber roll, ebiten roll (shrimp tempura), and the Philadelphia roll with an order of fried rice.  The fried rice was average, I've had much better.  The sweet tea impressed me, perhaps because it was pretty sweet!"}
