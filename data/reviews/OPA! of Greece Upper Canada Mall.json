{"text":"I ordered chicken souvlaki. The food doesn't have a Greek taste.  very little value for the money. Photos are nice and they show good looking food, but taste of food is what people are looking for."}
{"text":"Food is awful.   Ordered a Greek salad that didn't even come with one black olive. The dressing had been put on the salad several hours before so the vegetables were in the process of decaying. The dressing was tasteless.   Stay away...."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken souvlaki. Tender meat with plenty of tzatziki sauce, onions, tomatoes and lettuce. A great snack that provides good energy to shop the mall. Coupled with a cold drink and a slab of baklava. Heaven!"}
