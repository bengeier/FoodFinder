{"text":"As a southerner, I believe barbeque belongs to me. Personally. So my opinions are strong about how it should or shouldn't be. If you've never been south of the Mason-Dixie line, this could be the best barbeque you've ever eaten. If you are a southerner, your home made probably tastes better. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Union and will probably be back, especially if it doesn't stay so crowded. But more than anything it made me miss the real deal. 

-Brisket I tried was pretty good.
-Ribs were good.
-Greens were almost certainly canned - they added some ham but not much flavor. Mine are better.
-Baked beans were sweeter than cake. That's how we like iced tea, not beans. It seemed to have a caramelized crust of sugar on top like Creme Brulee. 
-Coleslaw is fine.
-Mac and cheese good.
-Corn bread pretty good. Perfect texture, but too sweet.
-Fried chicken got rave reviews from my friend, but I didn't try it. I'm even picker about that than barbeque!
-Cocktails were extra good.

Barbeque sauce is such a regional preference you can't make everyone happy. So I'll just stay quiet on that subject.

Last note - its a barbeque place, which isn't a mecca for vegetarians. Don't try taking any here, they only have 3 things on the menu for them. Mac and cheese, corn bread, and coleslaw."}
{"text":"I have been to the bar upstairs (Harvard and Highland) many times, but I tried the food for the first time last night. Overall, it was ok but I wouldn't make the trip for just the food again. A friend and I sampled the brisket, pork and ribs. The brisket had the texture of a wet sponge - far too tender and if you didn't order brisket, you wouldn't even know that it was beef to when the cooking process began. The pork had some unique flavor, but wasn't the best I've ever had (had better off a friends smoker). Overall, I liked the ribs the most - good flavor and just about the right amount of tenderness. The cornbread was crappy - you could make better with a box of mix off a shelf. A couple of friends ordered the fried chicken and mac & cheese - I got a small sample of both - I would say both were the best two items I sampled. 

Also - I think the prices of the food are a bit steep - usually BBQ give you so much food that you feel like a glutton - now I'm not looking to eat that much at any time, but I feel like you are paying for the name (and name of the chef - that being said I have been to some of his other places and I do enjoy them) rather than for high quality BBQ. The atmosphere is cool, but honestly I would rather eat BBQ at a small shack with crappy plastic chairs - just seems to fit the foot better. 

Overall, its it good - not really - its it ok - sure - but for my BBQ desires, I'll grab food from Pittsburgh BBQ company and eat on a picnic table instead."}
{"text":"We ended up here with a crazy meat itch after realizing (again for the third time) that Yinzburgh BBQ is closed on Mondays. As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is a communal-style open concept restaurant with rustic wooden walls. Unfortunately, their rustic ideals extend to the lighting, which are extremely dim orange bulbs; if it weren't for the natural light from their glass storefront, I doubt that I would have been able to see my food. Also, the place is loud. The sparse walls and wooden floors makes any sound echo like crazy.

Decor aside, they have some very excellent drink choices. They have an extensive whiskey menu for enthusiasts, a corresponding spirits cocktail menu, and a small but excellent selection of craft beers. Best of all, their draft craft beers are half off at $2 during happy hour, which runs to 6:30. The beer servings are I would say closer to a half pint than a full, but I'm not going to complain about a $2 glass of 60 minute IPA from Dogfish Head. 

The food was also quite good. I ordered the ribs and brisket with mac & cheese and cornbread sides. The ribs were excellently smoked and tender; the smoke flavour was so deep and good that I actually preferred it without any sauce. The brisket was deliciously tender and fatty and went excellently with their BBQ sauce (my personal favourite of the meal). I can see how some people might find the fat levels excessive; but the fat kept the meat very moist. I'm also a big fan of their cornbread, although the mac & cheese was rather meh. FYI, I thought their sauces were inferior to Yinzburgh BBQ; it's hard to beat them on their delicious sauces. 

The whoopie cake dessert was actually quite good as well; our marshmellow cream was coloured green in celebration of St. Patrick's day.

TL;DR unfortunate lighting/seating/noise level, great drink selection, good BBQ. I'd say it's worth a visit (while it's light out)."}
{"text":"Awesome decor, and awesome food! I really enjoyed the different sauces on the table that you could add to your food.  I did the pork shulder, which was so tender and tasty! We went for lunch and were really pleased with our experience!"}
{"text":"I was raised on fried chicken and BBQ in the south and take this food very seriously. So much so that I feel a tear form when I hear someone mention BBQ chicken (get real people, its grilled chicken with BBQ sauce on it and has nothing to do with the slow cooked delicacy other than a dip in some spicy ketchup) or a chicken nugget (one of the greatest scams ever orchestrated: no bones, no dark meat, no grease, no taste; can you say fried waste product). I am thus highly skeptical when confronted with an establishment located north of the Mason-Dixon purporting to specialize in the cuisine of my homeland. Union Pig & Chicken demands respect for absolutely amazing fried chicken and a pork BBQ that provides a moment of sweet southern comfort in a world gone mad.

The fried chicken is served in whole or 1/2 chickens, as the lord intended, and for the uninitiated this can be a bit daunting. To clarify: There are eight pieces of fried chicken in a bird. This means that  more health conscious consumer may wish to split a 1/2 chicken with another person. The fried chicken is perfect by all metrics of the southern palate and deserves to be eaten with your hands.

The pork BBQ sandwich is a very respectable rendition of the classic. The BBQ is true to form having been cooked for an obscene amount of time under low heat and smoke to produce a melt-in-your-mouth wonder. Although I found the sauce on the table a bit weak, the pork stood on its own (the hallmark of good BBQ) and required no such amendment. I haven't tried the beef BBQ offerings or the ribs but will do so on my next visit. If the rest of their fare is any indication, I will not be disappointed.

Sides were enjoyable standards with no surprises. The draft beer list provides a rotating selection of a half-dozen great beers in differing style rather than seeking to overwhelm, something I appreciate. The cocktail menu piqued my interest in the lounge upstairs, Harvard & Highland, and I was impressed to find a whiskey list that lends as much respect to a good bourbon or rye as to a good scotch. Cheerwine, the sickly sweet soda pop from the Carolinas, makes an appearance on the menu and pairs perfectly with fried chicken and BBQ for the nostalgic. The decor is interesting but not remarkable or unique in terms of a BBQ joint as most of those I patronized in my youth had similar communal seating arrangements.

Union Pig & Chicken is an asset to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. Unlike one of Sousa's more refined intentions (Salt of the Earth) which tend to underwhelm-efforts to create something new misguided by following the trends of America's culinary capitals- the Union focuses on perfecting well-worn territory. These are dishes that many make and very few make well. The Union is firmly in the latter camp; well worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food was incredible! The brisket was so tender it was hard to tell you were still eating meat, and the pork shoulder was absolutely awesome.  Both were a little fatty, but nothing you can't work around.

The meaty mac definitely took the cake for the evening! So delicious.  Our other side was the greens, which were good.  The cornbread was a little bit lacking (too dry).

Their drinks were also excellent.  The coffee & fig infused whiskey was just awesome, and the Yellow Jam-Jar was really tasty combination of curry, Chartreuse, and honey.

We split a two-meat plate & two sides, and it we were both full.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lunch portions are decent because they come with fries and a drink for around $10. Order brisket at dinner and you're getting three thin slices of brisket on a plate for around $20.   Order your sides separate. F that. Leave this place for the metro hipsters. If you think this is decent BBQ, you've never had BBQ. It's the norm; prob get similar at Golden Corral!   The comedy club upstairs is really cool!"}
{"text":"Take-out review only.

Short answer: yes, if you like bbq then you really should get here as fast as you can.

Most important, the food: very, very good.

Sides: *****
I started with the sides and had the best greens with little chunks of smoked meat, slightly vinegary, not too greasy. The beans were not mushy - actually a little crisp but that is better than mushy - and a fabulous molasses and spice flavor - allspice? The cole slaw was just perfect - shredded and slightly pickled but still fresh. I reheated the mac and cheese and it looked so creamy - how do you get that without using velveeta? - and my mac and cheese expert taster reported that it was very good but very spicy (not! at! all! she's only 7 and has super young tastebuds) though she kept eating until her bowl was empty. I must admit I'm more of a sides person but I would come here just for the sides. Honest.

Meat: *****
The meat was so good you didn't even need sauce! And that is something I have never, ever said before - not in Texas, not in North Carolina, no where. The flavor! The smoke! We did not try the bbq chicken. The fried chicken was tasty, salty with a seasoned crust. Not sure why some people say it is not thin and crispy crust? I thought it was. I'm normally not a fried chicken person but I could eat this. The oil/fat flavor was good and fresh, no hint of stale. The ribs were my least favorite though they were good too. The brisket and pork were the best I can think of in any restaurant.

The Ugly - I mean, The Sauce: *
Ouch. Maybe I don't get the concept but there needs to be some more work here. The vinegar sauce was just that with a bit of spice and a bit of smoke. I guess if you want more vinegar-y style bbq you could add this and you'd be there. The red sauce had - to me - a really off almost-banana flavor that I could not abide on any of the meats. The habanero sauce was labeled \"hot\". Well. It should have been labeled \"fire\". I could see this used as an addition to a red bbq sauce to make it hotter. But. This was the hottest food I've ever been served in a restaurant. Don't get me wrong - my fridge has several hot sauces in it and my family thinks I put hot sauce on ice cream. But. Darn, this was hot. I actually had to get out the milk. I will not fault them too much though as I think these can be tweaked. I do appreciate that they aren't too sweet as are most bbq sauces.

Cost: *****
Lastly the cost was $50 (take-out) and the food (2 dinners, 4 sides) could have fed 4 average-sized people easily. Fresh, good food for under $15/person? Union Pig and Chicken rocks it. Up and coming area (in large part due to restaurant owners and investors taking a chance) small space, communal tables - thank you.

Background:
Called on a weekday at 2:15 and ordered 2 dinners that were ready when I arrived in 15 minutes. The two people I spoke to - on the phone and in person - were business-like. Parking was readily available at this time. The room - yes one room - on a corner near Penn Circle has a mostly glass front, 2 walls of what look like reclaimed barn wood, a painted wall with varied red checks that remind me of a picnic bandanna tablecloth and maybe 4 wooden tables picnic style with benches which means community seating."}
{"text":"I was really really torn on whether to give H&H 3 or 4 stars!!  

The cocktails are standard quality craft cocktails, but without any frills and nothing particularly spectacular about it.

The atmosphere/decor is just ok.  It's very bare and, due to the lack of crowd, empty feeling.  I suppose we did go out for drinks at around 8 on a Sunday evening, but I mean, who doesn't do that? right? :p 

Service was pretty average as well.  There was only one bartender/staff, but it was sufficient for the small number of people.  He also didn't seem too interested in telling us more about the cocktails and basically told us all the cocktails were great.

In the end, we choose the Agnatha & Anni and the August 21st, 1959.  I really liked my Agnatha.  Crisp, tart, strong.  I didn't like all the tiny ice bits in it though, but that's easily remedied as the ice melts.  The August 21st was ok.  I'm not a fan of smoky flavored drinks, but if you are, this one would be a good choice.

Overall, I would come back again because it's just too convenient.  Plenty of street parking, closely located, solid cocktails, and no worries about finding a table."}
{"text":"Went in to an empty place on a Monday night. The service was excellent. Very attentive without being overbearing. She was ready to give suggestions when we stalled on our order, which was very nice. I had the banh mi sandwich, baked beans, and cornbread. It was good, except for the baked beans which I found very mediocre. The sandwich bread didn't really \"fit\" a banh mi, but I enjoyed my sandwich. The food was a 3 star for me, but service was 5 which is how I came to my rating. It seems a bit overpriced for something I considered run-of-the-mill barbecue. My rate is more of a 3.5 star."}
{"text":"First of all, the sever had zero patience. She was awful and I am in the industry and usually too heavily! The whole place overrated. Expensive and filled with pretentious hipsters. Don't waste your money the food wasn't great. It's a complete rip off. 60 bucks for a chicken and a slab of ribs? Do yourself a favor and find a BBQ pit outside a baptist church down the street on a Sunday, it's a fraction of the price, and better service, and you won't be burping it up 6 hours later."}
{"text":"I am not a food critic.

I desire quality food efficiently presented to me, the consumer at what I consider a fair price. I don't really care if it was locally sourced as I want to eat strawberries in the winter months. I don't care about the snout to tail movement or molecular gastronomy or what ever the current buzz word is. I am not a fan of food gluttony as displayed on the food network nor am I in to drinking coffee that was passed through some rodent.

Let's talk about Union Pig & Chicken, the new restaurant from Kevin Sousa.
I believe he is a truly talented chef/cook or whatever you choose to classify him as.
The space is attractive, lots of wood some what reminiscent of Cleveland's B-Spot.

The smoked meats that we ordered were done to perfection, but in reality that is what restaurant quality equipment should provide. The goal I imagine is consistency.
The smoked chicken was quite moist and tender. The flavor of the spare ribs was outstanding. I the consumer would have preferred baby back ribs; to me they would have been wonderful. Same flavor, more meat, less gristle and fat. Just my opinion as the consumer.  
The Mac & cheese, totally forgettable. Same consistency as Stouffers, in fact I wonder if it is some kind of social experiment. I can visualize the thesis now, \"How Much Are 2012's Versions of Yuppies Willing to Spend on Stouffer's Mac & Cheese in an Urban Redevelopment Project\". My advice, visit Smoke in Homestead for their version.

I was quite excited to try the Fried Chicken. Totally disappointing. Just go to Kaya on Thursday evenings. Nothing further needs to be discussed about this topic.

The Greens were awesome. My wife ordered them. I do not love greens, but I would order them again in a heartbeat. When a restaurant can truly serve such a game changer it must be noted.

They were out of Pork Shoulder, (odd as it was a Saturday afternoon around 2:00 pm).
I would like to return and try the Shoulder, corn bread and beans.

The prices are according to what I would consider an upscale BBQ joint.
This is an independent restaurant, he is not bulk purchasing.
I did think the serving of delicious East End Big Hop was a bit skimpy; I would have preferred being charged an extra $1 and gotten a pint like The Big Burrito Group serves.

We didn't order any, but they do charge $1 for a bun. I would hope that it is homemade brioche and not something lame from a supplier.

I did like his BBQ sauce, but I would have preferred 3 types of sauce. I think it would be really cool to check out his spin on different regional favorites.

The staff was okay; they remind me of the product if Kurt Kobain, Deiter Sprocket and a BMX stunt cyclist had a tribe of love children.

I had hoped the Union Tweets would announce specials rather than the existential Hallmark Card prose of the chef.

He is truly talented, maybe I have set the bar too high.

I will return but I will not race back."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place and was really looking forward to trying it. Boy, was I disappointed! We walked in just before noon. The first floor seats were less than half full and it took several minutes for us to be seated. Once seated, it took the waiter 10 more minutes to take our order. We didn't get our bottled beers for more than 35 minutes after we walked in the door. Once we got our meals, they were only mediocre at best. I have made better BBQ in my backyard.

I am actually sorry we spent our money here..."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today. Had the special of your choice of sandwich & a side or a piece of chicken & side including a soft drink for 10.95. Just delicious. I had the chicken BarBQ sandwich with Mac & cheese and my spouse had the chicken breast with the brussels sprouts done with a maple type glaze. Really tasty.  The portion side was generous can't see why others aren't pleased with them."}
{"text":"Service was awful.  It was one of the worst. The waitress said nothing and just plunked down our menus.  It almost felt like she didn't want us there.  Maybe she just didn't want to be there...but I've had better service at diners where you pay just as much for three times the amount of food.  Say hi and smile a bit, ya?

The food was disappointing and ridiculously small for a BBQ focused restaurant.  I wasn't expecting it to be a fancy presentation since it's more a comfort food type of place, but it looked like the meager leftovers got slapped on the plate and microwaved. The pork and cole slaw was literally just undressed pork and cole slaw.  My friend's sandwich didn't look any better.  The mac 'n' cheese was just as good as Trader Joe's microwaveable mac 'n' cheese.  Sad.  Why would anyone pay that much?

The interior is really nicely done, but it's the only lively thing about this restaurant.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"I went here earlier today with my boss - both ordered the pork lunch sandwich. Best lunch I've had in the 'Burgh in a while. The smoke flavor was incredible. Can't wait to go back for lunch. Dinner seems a little steep before the late night menu. Try the brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"I planned a surprise dinner for college boys, and assumed BBQ would be the best idea - I was not wrong.

Everyone enjoyed the food, which was FABULOUS. We also came on a Thursday, which was 1/2 price wings (6 grilled BBQ or habenero wings for $3). My favorite things would be the ribs (which has dry-rub - once you try dry rub, you won't go back to sticky fingers from heavy BBQ sauce) and the mac&cheese (absolute perfection when mixed with BBQ sauce). The drinks were also decently priced and had a great selection. 

The service was great as well, and I am excited at the fact that there is a take-out option.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and the place was very empty. We were very excited to try it for the first time as we've heard good things! 

We went with a big group and decided to start off with the poutine and meaty Mac. Both were very good. Very nice smokey flavor!

Unfortunately, the main course was quite the let down for all of us. Every single one of us complained that it was the most salty thing we've ever eaten. Almost to the point of where we would get a tummy ache if we ate the whole portion. We all tried the beef brisket, ribs, brisket sandwich and bahn mi sandwhich. All of which too salty!

I'm not sure if it was just that batch of meats that we had and their rub had too much salt or what... But I don't believe any of the 6 of us in the group will be going back and risking serious dehydration after all that salt...

Service  was great though. I'll give them that."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about this place. 

When we walked in, we stood around for around five minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. While there is a stand by the front door, there was no one who seemed to be stationed there.

Once we were seated, we were able to order our beers - which were very tasty! I had the Erie Railbender and my boyfriend had the East End Big Hop. Those beers came fairly quickly.

The food took a very long time. We probably waited around half an hour for our food. The food was pretty good. I liked it, but it was definitely very salty. All the food is a la carte, so even though the individual prices are low, you need to get a few items to put together an entire meal.

I was planning to order another beer, but our waitress never came back to talk to us until we were finished with the food.

It sort of felt like there were not enough employees working. We saw multiple people standing around waiting for someone to help them. It didn't seem like anyone was assigned to seat customers, because each waitress would ask if someone had helped whoever was standing there yet.

Overall, I liked the food and would go back if someone else *really* wanted to, but I don't think I would go on my own."}
{"text":"Great addition to the growing scene in East Liberty. My boyfriend and I ordered the BBQ chicken and brisket with the choose 2 option. The chicken was good but the brisket was excellent. 

As I am originally from South Carolina, I am most familiar with Carolina pulled pork BBQ. The only issue I had with the meal is the \"Carolina\" style BBQ sauce is so far off-base! They either need to do a little more research or take it off the table (its not very good!)

The failed Carolina BBQ sauce will not keep me away though. I will definitely be making a return visit."}
{"text":"I don't really get how people can think this is somewhere amazing, it's really only alright. The food is good, yeah, but not for the price. It's way too expensive.

It's be ok for treating yourself once in a while or for going to lunch with friends but it's not somewhere I'd make a habit of frequenting. The beer-hall style seating is a bit weird as well, I know a lot of people are into it but it's not really my sort of thing."}
{"text":"The ribs were ok but $20 for 8 pieces of baby back ribs seemed a bit too expensive. May try again just something different. The vinyl selection was great upstairs."}
{"text":"Union Pig and Chicken is pretty good. Not a place I'd rave about but good. We came in on a Monday night for dinner. Their restaurant has four long tables with benches. Each table could sit about 16 people. It wasn't very busy on the night we went but I imagine that setup could be a little awkward when it gets really busy. I like the idea though. 

They no longer have combos on their dinner menu. They serve all their items a la carte. Chicken, ribs, brisket, pork, and tofu are all available in different sizes with a wide selection of southern sides. For a place called Pig & Chicken they have a surprising amount of vegetarian options. We tried their brisket, bbq chicken, and ribs, as well as their mac and cheese, greens, and cornbread. Overall their meats are wonderfully cooked and tasty but their bbq sauce has something to be desired. They should either work on the recipe or provide more than one sauce. Their mac and cheese was very good but could have used some additional spice. The greens were okay but had too much vinegar. The cornbread was very good despite being overly buttery and crumbly. I'd give the food a B. Pretty good but room for improvement.

Overall it was a good experience and I would go again. They had wonderful service and all the food came quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered some ribs and mac and cheese for takeout. When I got home with the food I discovered to my dismay that I didn't get any sauce. Now I know that it's partially my fault, because I didn't ask for some, but every other time that I've gotten BBQ I've been asked what kind of sauce I want. I guess I was just assuming that there would be their sauces in the bag. Anyway, the ribs themselves had a good texture and the meat was sufficiently falling off the bone. But the flavor was bad. Way too much smoke, and not the right smoke. The black skin on the ribs tasted like lighter fluid, and it had an acrid flavor that permeated throughout the meat. And I don't even think that's me being a wimp. I like smoked meats and cheeses of all kinds. This tasted like flat out wrong; my brain was telling me not to eat it. It literally tasted like the charcoal that I use in my grill. I put down the ribs with a sigh and sampled the mac and cheese. This dish was much better. Good texture and consistency and was sufficiently cheesy. I probably won't be getting Union Pig again, based on the flavor of their meat. Plus, at least when I order from Yinzburgh or Pittsburgh BBQ Company or South Side barbecue I know they'll offer me some sauce, because my dumb ass is too forgetful to ask for it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Worse than horrible. It took an hour and a half to get our food and it was a joke on the plate. A huge slab a fat they called brisket and burnt cornbread. No really I'm not joking, a big greasy piece of smoked fat they call brisket. I honestly can't believe I gave these people my money. Go to McDonalds and save your money"}
{"text":"Had the brisket and the ribs with a side of poutine. Everything was well prepared and tasted great especially the poutine. Only complaint I have is the price. The food was good and I'm OK with small portions but at that price point the food should knock me off my feet. Had a quarter pound of each meat plus the side and a soda and it came to $24 and I was just barely satisfied. Overall good experience might go back with friends I think the prices lower in higher quantities."}
{"text":"Anything you order, it takes 35 minutes...if you really want to waste your time. Stop by"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. First time I went I tonight it was Closed on a Tuesday at 8pm but they were open and I missed out. I've been back twice since. Mac and cheese is good. I recommend sitting upstairs since the acoustics are a bit poor in there with echoes."}
{"text":"*UPDATED REVIEW*
So I took away my 5-star review and now leave Pig &Chicken with only 2. I went back a second time with extremely high expectations (read review below), and was very disappointed this time around. I ordered the sangria ($9) and got only half a glass, whereas the last time I had come, it had been a full glass. $9 for a half glass of sangria is steep, considering it's mostly juice! The waitress did give me $2 off when I spoke up, but stated that's the correct portion moving forward.

This time around, I ordered the brisket, and while the edible pieces were DELICIOUS - 75% of the brisket was fat!! Seriously?! It was $11 for 3 bites of good brisket. Ridiculous...

****

BEST CORNBREAD AROUND! I honestly crave their cornbread on a daily basis. It's perfectly sweet and soft. I loved it.

We went around 7 during the week, and there was plenty of seating. We sat upstairs, and the atmosphere was very cool - huge windows and lots of light. Very pretty. 

I ordered the spiced sangria (tasted like sangria with some cinnamon in it), and it was delicious. I ordered the ribs with the red cabbage on the side. Boyfriend got a macaroni and cheese bowl I believe, and cornbread.

Ribs were very good - not a lot of meat, but it was cooked nicely and tasted good. The cabbage was inedible to me. I hated how vinegar-y yet sweet it was - I gave it to my boyfriend and ordered cornbread instead. Best choice ever! 

Very neat place, reasonable prices, quick service - will definitely be returning again and again!!"}
{"text":"Had barbecue chicken with a side of rice. The chicken was charred black and super salty. The amount of rice was extremely small relative to the amount of meat. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"I was very excited when the stylized Union Pig & Chicken suddenly took the place of an otherwise homely storefront on Highland, but I was even more surprised when one day, seemingly out of nowhere, there was an \"H & H\" coat of arms visible in the unmasked upstairs window. Once I heard that at least one bartender from Salt of the Earth was connected with this new venture, I was sold.

My boyfriend and I probably made a bit of a mistake in being a little hurried during our first visit, since we spontaneously popped in before a show at Shadow Lounge on a Thursday night. Nonetheless, the staff (it appeared that one person was tending bar and the other was serving drinks, which was plenty of service for a room of five low-key parties) was very gracious and accommodated our rush with cheerfulness. Although there were two stools available at the bar, there were a handful of people seated on each wing of the L-shaped hub, and it seemed to make more sense to respect the intimacy of the space and opt for a table.

We both ordered A Common Plot of Land (bourbon, rye, Luxardo, smoked onion Fernet Branca, $10) at the bar before seating ourselves, and kept an eye out so we could intercept our drinks without troubling the staff. (Ultimately, the charming server insisted on bringing them to us when they were ready.) Now that I have looked up \"Fernet Branca,\" I understand what it was that didn't sit quite right with me--while I was expecting to get a lot of flavor from the bourbon, there was some bitterness (which I can probably attribute to the Fernet Branca) that came through quite a bit. This isn't an ingredient criticism so much as an expression of taste, especially since my boyfriend happened to love it. I look forward to spending more time there and indulging in a longer cocktail session; our game plan at Salt of the Earth has generally been to go for two each, swap sips, and get a better sense of what the menu has to offer.

Despite not being in love with what I ordered, I could agree with my boyfriend on one thing: the cocktails were potent. Hardly a bad way to start (or end!) a night."}
{"text":"My wife and our good friend both bought a $40 for $25 groupon some time ago. Our friend's groupon had expired, so we knew going in he was only going to get face value. No problem so far.

We decided to order for take-out for both our families for a Friday night at-home gathering. My wife called on Wednesday to ask about the groupon usage, and was assured that since they were under different names, we could use both for our takeout order. On Friday evening we headed over and phoned in our order from the car. As my wife tried to place the order, she was informed that the combos we had seen online were no longer available, so she asked for advice on what to order for five adults.

Upon arrival, we received our bag of food, but when the bill came, the manager came out to explain that they would not honor both groupons. My wife explained that she had called on Wednesday and was assured by the employee who answered that what we wanted to do was OK. The manager proceeded to explain that the employee was misinformed. My wife, now angry, explained to him that had we known that, we wouldn't have ordered what we did. We weren't looking for free food. We had already paid through groupon. The manager then offered to remove food from our order until we were satisfied with the price! What was he going to do with the food he took back? Re-serve it? Who does this? If they were willing to take a loss on the food to bring the bill down, why not just take a loss on the food and honor what their own employee had committed to over the phone and make a customer happy? 

What I don't understand is if we had made two phone calls and placed two orders, each paid with a different groupon at the same time, it probably would have been fine. We only tried to use two with one order because we were originally told we could by their staff. 

So we get back to our friends' house and break open the food. Based on the order-taker's recommendation for food for five adults, we had barely enough for three adults, and what we did have was lacking.

My best guess is Kevin Sousa, the owner is spread thin between Union Pig and Chicken, Salt of the Earth, and his upcoming venture in Braddock. Kevin, we've never met, but you need to send in some undercover diners. You'll be shocked and disappointed. Oh, I haven't been to Salt yet, and was looking forward to going to Braddock to check out the new places there, but that is now on hold. I'll spend my money elsewhere. 

We will not be back, and do not recommend this at all. If I want bbq, I'll blow the gas money and drive to Clem's in Blairsville."}
{"text":"Delicious food and huge portions! But they overcharge for booze and the atmosphere was u comfortable. The restaurant feels half finished-like they ran out of money and threw the rest of it together."}
{"text":"Weirdest dining experience ever. I thought it was just me until we left and my husband said that he was really uncomfortable the entire time we were there. 

Food: I'm from the south and can tell you honestly that this is not southern food. It's okay for what it is, but it isn't southern. The brisket was amazing. Hands down absolutely delish. The sides were lacking somewhat. The \"cornbread\" was soaked in oil and tasted like fried carrot cake. Cole slaw was decent as were the greens.

Service: So weird. The low star count is 100% because of the service. We felt like we were bothering the servers somehow. We had two servers so we never knew who was doing what. Part of our order was missing, and when I asked for it, the server acted annoyed. Our drink order was never taken either so we had to ask for those too. The servers didn't seem to care, or even be listening, to us.  When we asked the male server for our check, he honestly huffed and just said, \"Sure\" with a sigh. A few seconds later he plopped it down on front in us without a word and walked off. It wasn't a busy night either. There were only 4 tables between the two servers.

In the future, we will probably order the brisket for take-out (and make our own sides at home), but because of the Twilight Zone service, we will never dine-in again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good drinks. Extremely slow service and staff attitude sucked-both server and manager.

Started off with cocktails which came timely and were made well. About 10 minutes after getting our drinks we placed our order-appetizers and main dishes. An hour later we still hadn't gotten any food and our waters and cocktails had been sitting empty for at least 20-25 minutes. Flagged the server to see what the hold up was and we got a very generic \"your food is being prepared in the order it was put in\". 

An hour and 15 minutes into dinner or meal came. It was nothing to rave about. Two orders of brisket and both were more than 50% fat. They plated the tofu app on top of the chicken wing app- literally laid on top of the wings. For a vegetarian, this is unacceptable. The Mac and cheese was ok, but personally it's not as good as homemade. The tofu was seasoned nicely. 

The manager ended up giving us our drinks for free but would not apologize for the extremely slow service. His excuse was that there was a large party upstairs. 

Wanted to like this place but unfortunately we will not back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"i was hoping for more from this place based on how it was touted in the city paper. when my uncle and i arrived, the place was packed and based on that i assumed the food was at the least....good. what cant i say? the server was gods second gift to all mankind who was spreading the good news  through his skinny jeans, piercings and smug demeanor  was a shining beacon that reflected all that is wrong with the \"new\" east liberty. and now the food: if you read this review after eating there dont say i didnt tell you so. it literally is all smoked salt and sugar for 75 dollars. it was so salty that veins popped out of my forehead and i thought i was gonna have a seizure as my 57 year old uncle experienced the same side effects. i informed our server that i couldnt eat the food due to the high sodium content and as opposed to being apologetic and trying to offer something else on the menu, he looked at me as if i had told him about the nude photos of his mother that i have that give me much joy. he walked and came back with the check without as much a thank you. gentrification.....tastes like chicken."}
{"text":"I actually just created a yelp account to post about Union Pig & Chicken. This food is hands-down the best bbq I've ever had.  The brisket was fantastic, and the chicken was so moist it'd make you wanna slap yo mama!  Service was great...thanks Jess!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pound of Brisket for $22. The brisket it's self was wonderful...I mean the half of the pound that wasn't fat. Fat can be very tasty depending on how you cook it. However, this fat wasn't that way. So for the price, I would say I would try another BBQ place in the Pittsburgh area. The service wasn't great either. We had a party of 8 on a Tuesday night. The restaurant it's self wasn't busy at all. So, service shouldn't have been any issue.
Would I go back? I would if a friend really, really wanted to go. I emailed the restaurant with my displeasure and heard nothing back. That's disappointing."}
{"text":"Do you like flies (Not just fruit flies but house flies, a lot of them)? Do you like big oppressively noisy rooms (seriously guys, get some acoustic treatment)? Do you like flavorless meat, sandy cornbread and watered down barbecue sauce?
Then this is the place for you, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Well let's just start off by saying it's restaurant week so I expected them to be busy. 

Service was not up to my standard for this casual type of place. But it was also the servers 2nd day. 

Well food took about an hour but was wellllllllll worth the wait. 

Ribs were fall of the bone and the sauce went well with it. 

Brisket was my fav! Sliced thick and had nice smoke ring. 

BBQ chic was good but my family loved ther fries chick. 

We had all the sides too. Potato salad is mustard based. Loved it! Coleslaw is standard. Best was the cornbread. 

I didn't get a chance to venture to the upstairs bar and lounge due to a college reunion. But I heard they serve a full menu. 

The room is really loud and has a terrible echo and now that I'm back home writing this review I didn't realize how my ears hurt. Haha. 

The seating is not my fav but does create a different mood. We also felt that something was just missing from the decor. It needs some artwork. 

I'll end on this.... Loved the BBQ. Probably gonna be a great place to do takeout!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I guess the haters are gonna hate, but I couldn't find anything that  I didn't like about this place.  We made a reservation because I was nervous after seeing some of the long wait times in previous reviews.  

We breezed right in and got a table for four upstairs (rather than the communal seating downstairs.)  Water came instantly.  I ordered a Pera Mula, the bar's spin on a Moscow Mule.  Really tasty, smoky from the mescal and tart from the lime.  Nice pour and great color in a tin cup.  Nice. 

Had a Groupon to burn through and went back and forth with my eating partner about what to order so that we could take full advantage of our Groupon.  Ended up with a TON of food for $40.  A pound of ribs (perfection under a dry rub), a 1/2 pound of brisket (melt in your mouth perfection), a 1/2 pound of pork (OMG perfection) plus two sides of mac and cheese and a slab of cornbread as big as a slice of pie.  I can't figure out why others are complaining about portion sizes.  The mac and cheese was a full cup baked in a ramekin and was very good, with a nice crust on top.  The cornbread was good too, and got better( and more buttery!) the closer you got to the crust. 

Two different sauces were on the table, a sweet barbecue and a vinegar.  The BBQ was good (didn't try the vinegar, just kept using the BBQ).  Borrowed a hot (HOT!) sauce form the table next to us and it was so tasty we kept it!  (They got another.)  

I will go back.  I'd like to go back now."}
{"text":"Test the sauce on the table before you order anything banking on it, because unless they fix it, it is awful. 
Ok . I don't like St louis style ribs....but these were the best I've had even though the smokey flavor was a tad strong and the ribs a hair dry. I still really liked them. But the BBQ sauce will ruin anything it is on. I hope they fix it. It is a BBQ joint after all.

What else we had I didn't eat so I would only go for the ribs, and I know a place I like better..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Soul food done the way it should be. They also host a monthly comedy show called Unplanned Comedy Live. It's a monologue based improv show that has local celebrities as guest monologists. Great venue, great food/drinks, great service!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. All was clean we ate on the first level. The hosts seemed bothered by us coming in although there were only two other people in the place. She never mentioned the upstairs.
The waitress, while sort of pleasant, was disinterested at best. I do not like that they have the nerve to \"round\" the check; in my case up.

To make it a better experience I would respectfully suggest they re-train the hostess and waitress. They should make five people feel welcome not intrusive. Train the waitress to actually explain the menu options as if they care that you understand the options. Let me know you \"round\" don't surprise me.

Yes I will return they deserve a second and maybe third look. Let's get East Liberty back on track to a growth area like it once was...pre developer (destroyer) Bob Pease."}
{"text":"Crafted Cocktails! Pittsburgh's latest addition to a craft cocktail bar is spot on. The ambiance was upscale casual, nice early jazz playing in the background, and the lighting was perfect. 
Now on to cocktails. We tried several on the list and were very impressed with overall tastes and the creativity. They also had a distinctively Fall flavor profile which I really enjoyed. At $8-$12 I believe that is also a great bargain. These are not typical mixed drinks! These are cocktails crafted with 4,5, sometimes 6 ingredients, with top shelf spirits, and unique house-made shrubs, bitters, and infusions. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"We were excited to eat here, but left feeling unsatisfied with the experience. We arrived in time for the happy hour special, which included half-priced wings and $1 off beers. We got buffalo wings and they were okay - some were pretty fatty and hard to get through. As one would expect in Pittsburgh, the Yuengling was delicious (but no draft beer here).

We ordered a pound of St. Louis Ribs, because we were at a place called Pig and Chicken, and well, ribs seemed like they should be a signature item. Incidentally, a pound of ribs is about a half-rack, and at $19, that was pretty disappointing. The ribs were fine - but probably not all that much better than what you can get at Costco and cook on your own grill. 

We were also going to order a pulled pork sandwich, and when we did, the waiter kindly pointed out that the pork sandwich was not pulled, but rather included cubes of pork. We opted for the pulled chicken sandwich instead, which was pretty unique and tasty (included onion, pickles and dijon mustard). But again, we thought the price was a bit high - it was $12, and probably should have been more like $9 or $10.

We ordered three sides. The mac and cheese was delicious, and so were the yams and 'mallows. We also ordered the brisket chili and that was pretty good.

One of our biggest gripes is that nothing comes on the side with the meals. We ordered a pound of ribs and that's literally what you get - a slab o' meat. It would seem reasonable to get a piece of cornbread or a side for your $19.

The food was pretty good - nothing terribly special, but definitely solid. The value is questionable - there are just better places to eat."}
{"text":"The location is easy to find however the food leaves a lot to be desired. Mac and cheese although very appealing to the eye and cheesy, taste is quite bland. The greens taste like canned Glory greens with a hint of vinegar. And most importantly  the prices charged differ from those listed on their website. Although the price discrepancy was brought to the attention of the owners, we were still charged $6 more than the advertised prices. Not good business practice, kinda gave me the feeling of the old bait and switch. Overall will most likely not return."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the shoulder pork, Mac-n-cheese and Cole slaw which were delicious! However, I'm giving a 3-star because not only our server forgot to order the ribs, which she was very apologetic about it since plus our order took forever to be served, but the ribs were over cooked, dry and very salty! Also pretty pricey for BBQ food (?). 
I guess we're pretty spoiled by the delicious BBQ food we used to eat in Nashville TN."}
{"text":"I called to place a to go order for 1 and was told they are too busy and wouldn't accept a to go order. I'm guessing their food is good but I believe it shows a lack of work ethic to turn away a customer during normal business hours. 

I prefer to support local restaurants but I ended going to Smokey Bones. The food was delicious and they had no problem taking my to go order."}
{"text":"Good food but it's hard to eat there on a budget.  The mac and cheese is great, but I'm not a huge fan of the collards."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant from the Salt of the Earth crew. Different style of food, but still communal seating. Fantastic brisket, cornbread, and whiskey drinks from Harvard/Highland upstairs."}
{"text":"Ate here about a year ago while I was doing work for an apartment complex near by. The meaty Mac N' Cheese is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Meaty Mac is off the charts good.  Smoked Habanero Wings are great if you are willing to try a little spice and a different texture to your chicken wings than your regular deep fried hard or baked wings.

Not your conventional barbecue spot.  If you're used to Ribs and chicken Slathered in BBQ sauce, this will seem crazy to you, because they serve everything without sauce and you put the sauce on yourself.  You can mix and match the sauces to your liking.  They've got a regular BBQ sauce, a vinegar sauce and a spicy pepper sauce.  So if you like regular sauce, go for that...if you like it carolina style mix the vinegar in with it....if you like it spicy...add the pepper.  You can add as little or a lot of the sauce as you like.  It's not rocket science people...the BBQ is serviceable and not really expensive.  For $15-$20 a head you will probably take some food home."}
{"text":"We ordered the platter with shoulder, brisket and ribs, half fried chicken, mac n cheese, por belly?, chicken heart, and chicken liver. I love the brisket! Though it's really fatty, the flavor is so great that I almost finished it. The ribs and shoulder are good. The fried chicken is too dry for me and I don't enjoy it at all. Not a big fan of mac n cheese either.

We waited about 20 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of BBQ. I lived in Texas for a few years and seek out top spots, both popular and under the radar. I would frequently visit world renown places like Franklin's and Salt Lick. Union Pig and Chicken was hands down the best BBQ that I have ever had.

Let me start with the food. It was absolutely incredible and I had a little bit of everything. The fried chicken was prepared perfectly. The brisket was flat-out delicious. The ribs were the best I have ever had and had a dry rub on them that needs to have the recipe locked in a Las Vegas vault. The meaty mac and cheese was to die for. The sides were amazing. 

The atmosphere was wonderful. We sat upstairs at the whiskey bar that had awesome selection and hilarious Simpsons drink references. Our bartender made an excellent cocktail and was so friendly. He was extremely knowledgeable and had great suggestions for drinks to pair with different foods. I will be camped out at Union everytime I am near Pittsburgh, this place blew me away."}
{"text":"After hearing about chicken and waffles Sunday I had to see it for myself. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The waffle was alright but what made the meal was the Mac and cheese. It had a browned top and when you broke into it and felt the cheesiness. Delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday evening for my Dad's birthday party.  First of all there is a $1.50 per person \"cake cutting fee\" to be able to bring in the cake for his birthday which I think is ridiculous with a ten person party that they know they will make money on.  And it's a birthday, not like we are just bringing our own dessert for the heck of it.  We decided not to do it.

We order probably $200 worth of food and drinks and asked if we could have 3 rolls to come with our dinner.  No big deal right?  WRONG!  Our server came back and says they have 5 left for someone that may come in for a sandwich and will not accommodate us with any rolls and did not offer for us to purchase a couple.  Basically, you get what you get and you don't get upset.

Food was nothing more than okay especially after them not making any reasonable accommodations for us.

So 10 people and a $200 bill absolutely not worth the trip.  Try Two Brothers BBQ in the South Hills."}
{"text":"The pork was melt-in-your mouth tender. We also had the brisket and chicken and these were perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend the baked beans. They were unusual and delicious!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best drinks of my life here last night, thanks to our patient and talented bartender. It was pretty quiet, probably because it's a new place, and we were there fairly early. My friend and I agreed that it would be a great space for a private event. We also agreed that it was a good thing it's close to my house because we definitely were better off walking home...

As for the price, I had the slightest bit of sticker shock until I remembered how much I paid for a terrible cocktail with no discernable alcohol content at TGIFriday's the other night. (Don't judge, I had a gift card.) 

Anyway, I'll definitely be back to H&H!"}
{"text":"Excellent food (fried chicken, pork, beefy mac, and banh mi are delicious), good cocktails/beers, and the service is always good too. It's definitely refreshing to see more BBQ places in the area with sauce on the side, and their sauces are very good.

I also highly recommend them for catering - very easy to work with, reasonably priced, and they make A+ handmade lemonade with whatever fruit, herb, etc added."}
{"text":"My friend and I checked this place out last night.  The highlight of the night was definitely the wings.  I have had better corn bread at places like juniper grill.  The brisket was good but I wish I tried the sandwich.  The Mac and cheese was good.  The best thing we had was probably the fried chicken. 

The environment was different...the downstairs dinning was set up like a traditional BBQ joint while the upstairs was much more modern.  It was very dark and no music was playing and the big screen was turned off, which led to a dull experience.  

Our server was definitely knowledgable when it came to the menus and beer/drinks but she seemed stretched out and very busy. 

The place wasn't full and we still had to wait 30+ minutes for a table...we ended up asking the bar tender if we could snag an open one and never heard from the hostess  again. Always frustrating when you see empty tables and have to wait . 

Overall this place is worth checking out if you are in the mood for BBQ but that being said, I don't think we will be rushing right back for more."}
{"text":"If you don't go upstairs to the bar, you are doing it all wrong.  Cool bartenders, great whiskey and draft lists, and some pretty good bbq.  The atmosphere upstairs - and only upstairs - is fantastic."}
{"text":"The lady that greeted me at the door has been the best part of my experience.  I've been waiting here for about 30 or 40 minutes for a 1/2 pound of brisket. Isn't this meat that has already been cooked!? The only reason why I'm still here is because the brisket is for my mother. The person who I believe is the manager or owner has yet to apologize. On top of that he has been in the back laughing, joking and drinking beer I believe. He should be lending a hand to his overwhelmed employees.  I will not be back I don't care how good the brisket maybe!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ in the 'burgh!  Pork and brisket were great, fried chicken was ok.  Mac and cheese and greens were also good!  Pretty big lunch portions..."}
{"text":"Not sure what they are serving here but being from Texas I wouldn't call this barbecue.  The pulled pork is very light on smoke flavor and our pork had no bark at all.  A sure sign of short cut smoking procedures.  The \"brisket\" was a cut I have never seen before.  More of a roast cut.  The brisket got its flavor from a brine that the meat was swimming in.  

Service was slooooow.  We waited almost an hour on a Tuesday for our meals.  Why?  This stuff is already cooked!   Come on.  Throw it on a plate and roll it out.  

Our waitress seemed bothered to have to wait on us on a TUESDAY.  There might have been 15 people in the place tops. 

This was my one and only trip to this \"BBQ\" establishment."}
{"text":"What the hell happened????

We used to LOVE Union. It wasn't great BBQ, but it was pretty good BBQ. The pork shoulder was always well prepared with some outer crunchiness, tender meaty parts, and melty fat. 

The pork I had this week was NOT that pork. It was a pale beige with chewy fat and rubbery muscle. Nothing delicious dripped from that pork except for the minimal sauce I applied (not because I'm a minimalist, but because they were stingy in the amount of sauce in my takeout bag). 

If this had been the first time I was burned by Union, I'd keep my trap shut, but honestly, it's been declining steadily for a while now. This last time though... I'm afraid it was the LAST time. 

Sorry Union, I'm done."}
{"text":"I stopped by Union Pig and Chicken to grab some takeout for lunch. The server was sweet as pie and I liked that she alerted me of the lunch specials as it saved me some money. You get a side and drink complimentary with a sandwich or quarter chicken. Nice deal. Now to the food. I got a pulled chicken sandwich, sprite, and mac n cheese for the special and added an additional side of yams and mallows. The portions were very generous. The sides could have easily had servings for two each and the sandwich was a nice size. The yams were not overly sweet, even with the mallows, which was a plus. The mac was creamy and cheesy which is how I like it. The sandwich was smokey with good sauce. The chicken was a bit over cooked, but I appreciate the additional sauce container which allow me to marinate it. It wasn't quite down south cooking, but definitely worth a lunch stop for sure. I will go back and try some of the other offerings. Great service and I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Harvard & Highland is located above Union Pig & Chicken.  Right now Harvard & Highland is just offer cocktails - made with love by some of the best bartenders in the city."}
{"text":"Went last night--wanted to go for about a year, so really looking forward to it.  We were not disappointed!  It started with the smoked meat smell outside, ahh!  Hubby and son had the brisket and meaty mac and cheese. Brisket cooked perfectly and Mac and cheese was heavenly, you could really taste the wasabi and Gorgonzola.  I had the chicken--it was cooked perfectly, greens and potato salad.  All I can say is delish!  Prices are really on par with a trendy city restaurant, I don't think it was outrageously priced.  Atmosphere upstairs was a bit noisy--lots of talking and loud music--but nothing to cushion the sound. That would be my only complaint. Abigail, our waitress was knowledgable, attentive and friendly'!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hipster bbq joint. Anyone who knows and loves true barbeque....this is not your place."}
{"text":"For BBQ in Pittsburgh this is the best I've had, and stands up against some of the best around.
I read through some reviews complaining about servers or service, and have no complaints whatsoever there- hostess and servers were all pleasant, the vibe seemed busy but amiable with all the staff I saw.
Specifically, ordered the brisket, BBQ chicken, ribs, cornbread and regular Mac and cheese for two adults and two young children. Everything was very good; a bit pricey but we had leftovers and I wasn't expecting it to be cheap, so naysayers in that regard need to adjust their dining budget expectations, I think.  Two beers, a cocktail, two juices and two whoopie pie orders for dessert brought the total to $71."}
{"text":"Everything is ala Carte and pricey, but very tasty. Service was slow, but personable and friendly. Yam and Mac & cheese were great. Pork shoulder bbq came in cubes and was moist and flavorful. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"I've had several meals here and I'm never disappointed.  From the meaty mac to the friend chicken, they do it right at UPC.  The side dishes are great, try the magical fruit(beans).  It's picnic style seating so you might even make a new friend or two.  It's a little off the beaten path in East Lib but it's worth a trip."}
{"text":"We have been customers of Union Pig & Chicken since they opened several years ago and we have used them for catering. SO disappointed with our experience last evening. Will never return. Rude service. Kitchen was busy, food was subpar; we're understanding that you can have an off night, but nasty employees is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"This is a great bar! Very nice whiskey selection, cocktails are unique and made well.  Service is really good.  The food you can order from Union Pig & Chicken is a must.  I'm happy that they at least have 1 big screen in there, but it's not overwhelmed with televisions. The decor is modern and simple.  The backroom is huge, so it's nice for events.  Definitely a go-to spot!"}
{"text":"A very small menu, which I was slightly uncomfortable with. The service was decent and the food was very tasty. 
I came in a group as a double date. I ordered a dozen BBQ wings and cornbread. I could have eaten that cornbread for the rest of my life - it was that good and buttery. The wings were fresh, juicy, and smoked. They lacked in BBQ sauce, but luckily there were squeeze jars of sauce on the table.
I really want to go back here again."}
{"text":"Decent food. We were greeted by a very nice hostess, but our waitress seemed bothered to by our presence. We were seated next to patrons who gushed over how good the food was. When our waitress came we had some questions and she was very curt. She never asked if wanted anything to drink and we ordered wings as an appetizer and she put the wings on the plate with our entree. We would probably come back for the food but wanted this establishment to know that service is part of the eating experience."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:15 - shortly after it opened, and the tables were almost full, although we were lucky to get seated right away. I'm not sure why this trend of 'no reservations' is taking off in Pittsburgh, but I hate it - how can you ever plan a night out with friends, if you don't know whether the wait will be 15 minutes or 2 hours?? But anyway, if you go to UP&C be ready for a wait. We watched as dozens of folks who arrived after 5:30 sit  in the window sills and stared longingly at our food. 

We literally ordered one of EVERYTHING on the menu. The ribs, slow cooked pork and briskets were the favorite of the night. Though the chicken was done perfectly (both BBQ and fried) nice and juicy and not overcooked in the slightest. The vinegary greens cooked with bacon and creamy and rich mac and cheese were the favorite side dishes, though I can make mac and cheese at home just as well. The baked beans were good, but they were nothing out of the ordinary. As people have mentioned the corn bread was bland and SOAKED in butter. It was sort of unnecessary to add that much butter to an already heavy meal.

The whiskey and cocktail selection was impressive, and they have Mexican Coke which is a fun novelty. Service was good, our waiter was attentive. No complaints there.

One note: This is not a place for a baby or toddler. No high chairs or booster seats were apparent, and the communal seating would be difficult to accomodate them. And, if you don't go super early, you may be stuck waiting a long time. This is also not a place for large groups, since they don't take reservations, it may take a long time for a continuous set of seats to become available. Go with 4 people max to cut down on wait times."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I bought a Groupon and thought the place looked fun. I was most disappointed that the food was as greasy as it was. Although I loved the carrot salad the rest of the relied on fat and grease to get to flavor. Maybe I was expecting something a little different but if the food would have a good flavor BUT I couldn't get the taste of smoke and grease out of my mouth. It was an experience and I'm glad I did it on a Groupon."}
{"text":"It's critical at a barbecue joint to order the specialty--you don't go to a central Texas institution and order pork ribs. So I asked the server what Union Pig & Chicken does best, and despite their name, it's allegedly the beef brisket. Who'd a thunk? 

The brisket wasn't trimmed properly, so a significant portion of my meal was unrendered and inedible fat. Judging from the appearance of each piece (a smallish square of meat with a mild crust on each side) versus the shape of a brisket, I'd have to imagine it was cut and then broiled afterward. 

To the brisket cook, I strongly suggest you watch the following videos and I think the quality of the brisket could be improved by leaps and bounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTzdMHu5KU, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGZ39yYxeBk, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMIlyzRFUjU

On another visit, I tried the the fried chicken. The crust was greasy and the texture of the crust seemed off--it was not crispy or flakey in the least. In making fried chicken, forming a gluten network is typically hugely detrimental to the crust, and there's a few ways of avoiding this. I strongly suggest that Union Pig and Chicken move to a system where the chicken is dipped in a wet mix (milk, egg, buttermilk, some combination thereof, whatever you prefer), and then, almost immediately before frying, is dredged in flour. This will significantly improve the overall quality of the crust.  

The macaroni and cheese isn't too bad."}
{"text":"I use to eat a lot of meat and this place got some good pig.  Even though I've only been there once I remember the pork belly and my mac and cheese.  It's def comfort food.  If I could just eat non stop and not worry about my health as much I would easily take trips to the new East Liberty more often and maybe stop at that cool bar/lounge in town too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  We made a stop for lunch and I couldn't be more pleased. St Louis ribs had a perfectly caramelized crust and fall off the bone yummy. My wife had the Bahn Me sandwich which was out of sight! Can't wait to come back and eat my way thru the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile I should have waited longer. Ordered a sangria which was horrid.  We then had to wait over 45 minutes for our meals. My wife and I both had the 1/4 chicken dark meat, we also had the pork and brisket. Everything was so dry it was inedible. They offered to take it back but after already waiting so long we were late for our show. The Mac and cheese tasted like over cooked noodles in paste. To top it all off our waitress was very  aloof about everything."}
{"text":"My fiance and I chose to have Union Pig & Chicken cater our wedding and both their product and service was fantastic. From the beginning, the management staff was informative, available, and interested in ensuring that we had enough food to serve our guests. Throughout the evening, family and friends routinely asked who our caterer was because everything had tasted so great. With all of the other issues we experienced that evening, in terms of the venue space and parking obstacles, it was such a relief to hear that the food aspect was running very smoothly. Their team of servers were professional, helpful, and very nice to interact with. They made our guests feel comfortable and worked to accommodate in a swift manner. Hats off to you, Matt, Mario, & Jade.

Best,

Drew & Greg"}
{"text":"The last time I visited Pittsburgh for a weekend, we came here 3 times. 

This restaurant is on point. It actually gets better with every new item we try. Fabulously prepared pork products of all kind. Today we had the bahn mi sandwich- pork liver mousse, roasted pork, pickles cilantro and jalapeño. Outrageous! We also shared a quarter BBQ chicken and collards. The classic pork sandwich with grainy mustard & onion plus this sandwich might be the best two sandwiches you could have, anywhere. A really well made sangria topped off this perfect meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Union Pig and Chicken recently for dinner.  After being thrilled by Salt of the Earth and Station Street Hot Dogs (both owned by the owners of UP&C) we were expecting another similar experience.

When walking into UP&C, I was immediately struck by its size.  There are two long benches in UP&C and each seat about 24 people.  Things brings about an interesting dining experience, you are literally sandwiched between other parties.  Unfortunately this causes the tables to be quite loud and limits your ability to hear the person across from you.

On to the menu/food... 

The menu itself is rather small.  There are roughly 6 or so entree's to choose from.  Most of the entrees are your standard BBQ fare (brisket, bbq chicken, fried chicken, ribs...).  The entrees run somewhere between $12-18.  The problem that you run into is that everything is a la carte.  None of the single serving sides are included with the entrees.  The next problem is that these single serving sides are on the expensive side ($5 for a mac and cheese side, $3 for cornbread, etc).  This leads to a rather expensive dining experience, which in itself isn't really a problem if the food lives up to the price...

However, in my experience the food did not live up to the hype.  I tried both the ribs and the brisket and found them both to be a little on the dry side, and surprisingly to be tougher than I expected them to be.  To make up for this, I tried to add a little of the bbq sauce that they provide on the tables.  Rookie mistake.  The sauce really didn't add anything to the meats and instead was at the same time too vinegary and too watery.  On the bright side, they clearly know what they are doing when smoking the meats.  The brisket had a nice char layer and was smoked wonderfully.  Hours later, my hands still smelled like smoke.

The sides we ordered we both acceptable, but really failed to make me feel like I was getting a good value.  The cornbread was a little denser than I like and seemed to be vaguely sweet, but otherwise rather bland.  The mac and cheese was pretty OK, but nothing that you couldn't get at a number of restaurants around the area.

The one area that UP&C shined was service.  Our server was funny, attentive and very knowledgeable about the food.  Without a doubt the best part of our meal.

Overall, I thought that UP&C was OK, but really made me think that I overpaid for what was a just a \"pretty ok\" meal.  There wasn't anything that was particularly off putting, but there also wasn't anything particularly delightful either.  It just kinda... was."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today - great atmosphere in a shitty part of town.  Yes, it's up and coming and neat (East Lib), but it's still the ghetto.  Regardless, I'd eat at this joint all day every day.  I love the barn feel and the shared benches...feels like I'm eating legit baroque.  Yes...they really smoke food out back.  The beer selection is decent...could be bigger...I get why it's not.  They're a local company...if you're a Pittsburgher it's worth a bite"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  The BBQ is delicious.  I have tried all of the items on the menu and I was most impressed with the ribs as they weren't at all fatty, but very tender and not over-sauced.  The brisket is great, but when I was there I thought that the pork shoulder was excessively fatty.  Like I said, great vibe, upscale BBQ joint with some great local drinks available.  The servers were very friendly and helpful with suggestions as it was my first time at the restaurant.  Its not cheap, but in my opinion worth it."}
{"text":"We had seven people for dinner so our server suggested family style. The food was excellent and server was attentive about refilling drinks etc. only complaint is that they were out of cornbread and the rice and beans which seemed odd. Otherwise it was a great meal and an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Hoping last night's dinner was not the new normal. Haven't been for a year or so and was craving their once delicious brisket. So disappointing. 1/2 of the serving was total fat. Please, if you are going to charge by the pound at least trim the fat to an acceptable amount. 1/2 lb of brisket shouldn't include 1/4 lb of total fat. When mentioning the amount of fat to waitress I was told \"brisket is a fatty cut of meat and that's to be expected.\"  I've cooked many brisket. I know to trim at least some of the fat. I actually enjoy eating the fat on a brisket but do not enjoy complete mouthfuls of the stuff. 
Not as tender or flavorful as it used to be either. Will no longer crave at least."}
{"text":"We ate at Union Pig & Chicken on a Tuesday night, fairly late (for Pittsburgh ~ 9:30pm). The place was not packed but there were plenty of people there enjoying the delicious offerings from Kevin Sousa and team. This is a 4 star from me at the moment but I wouldn't be surprised if I edit this to a 5 star in the not-too-distant future. I'm sure they are still experimenting, tweaking, and improving.

I'm a big BBQ fan. When I moved to Pittsburgh and realized that BBQ was pretty hard to fine here I was disappointed. Though I'm not from a historically well known BBQ city, my years in NYC meant that I had easy access to fine places like Dinosaur, Hill Country, Wildwood, Blue Smoke, etc. I figured Union would be a Pittsburgh take on \"fancy\" BBQ restaurants in NYC. This is certainly more on the upscale side (not in a bad way), but the food is legitimately good and authentic. 

So, the food. We had a half rack of ribs, half a fried chicken, mac and cheese, and greens. The ribs were just right but I'd probably get brisket next time. The fried chicken was incredibly moist and delicious. I'm not a fried chicken fan most of the time, but this was excellent. The sides were good. Mac and cheese was tasty. The greens were nice too but they could kick up the pork in them a bit more. All in all, a very satisfying and tasty meal.

There are two things missing from the menu in my opinion. First, the sides menu seemed a bit limited. Maybe more are in the works, but I can see myself getting bored with some of these. Second, sausage. Again, maybe Kevin is conjuring up some kind of BBQ sausage tribute to Pittsburgh (BBQ kielbasa?). Will be interesting to see how the menu evolves, the tweaks they make, and any specials they add from time to time.

The service was great. The servers all seemed to be infinitely cool/hipster types (I'm not saying that's a bad thing). Importantly, they knew what they were talking about. They were also great with anticipating the need for more napkins (which means they must be watching people devour chicken in uncivilized, messy ways...). Nice touch. I did like how they approached things with an understanding that folks in Pittsburgh are not necessarily all that savvy on the BBQ front. They clearly want to inform and help you put together a delicious meal. 

The space is a bit smaller than I thought. Definitely can see this getting packed on busy Fri/Sat nights once the weather gets a bit nicer. If only there was an outdoor section (the parking lot behind?). It would be a perfect place to hang out on a warm Saturday afternoon for some beers and BBQ.

All in all, Union Pig & Chicken is a great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene. This is legit, delicious BBQ prepared and server by a clearly passionate team. I hope things go well."}
{"text":"First, a brief rant: Three and a half stars?! What is wrong with you people?!? This place is glorious. Seriously. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? Gah! A brief skimming of the bad reviews leaves me gasping like a guppy out of water - I don't understand the level of expectation that goes into sticking some sustenance down your gullet sometimes. 

Expensive? Compared to McDonalds, but then I wouldn't have the awesome brisket and pork shoulder omelette the next morning, either. Greasy? Compared to a tossed salad with no dressing, but then I wouldn't have the awesome brisket and pork shoulder omelette the next morning, either, again. Ugly decor? Try \"simple\" and \"fun.\" Not everything is cloth napkins and candlelight. Loosen up! Not \"real BBQ\"?!? I'm not going into my \"authenticity is an arbitrary measuring-stick\" spiel here - I was just there in my review of C. Staples in Youngstown (find it if you really care but the gist: I don't care if it's what you think is \"real\" BBQ, I only care how it tastes). /end rant

Begin review: Came here for a late lunch with some local friends (we were passing through and thus, only temporarily local). The space is made up of two long rows of picnic table-type sittage so, family style. 

One of us was vegetarian but a good friend, and she survived on the sides offerings and the booze with no complaint. The rest of us feasted on some of the finest smoked meats I've had on either side of the Mississippi: 

the best smoked chicken I've had outside of my honey's smoker (which isn't a fair comparison I know so: better than High Hat in New Orleans), flavorful ribs (a little dry and not my favorite, but someone else in our party would argue I'm wrong about that), amazing fork-tender pork shoulder, and a good, simple brisket (despite not making the head credits, cow still has a cameo). 

There are three sauces on the table, but the table could stand a few more for variety and I see no use for the North Carolina-style vinegar sauce but maybe it works for the sandwich options. I have no intention of sullying the pork shoulder with it, though. Actually, none of the meats needed any of the sauces but the other two sauce options were at least thick enough to hang in and add something to the meal. 

Gluten-free beer, cheerwine, and in-house infused whiskeys (smoked onion, black pepper, and tupelo honey was our vegetarian's choice, I think) are examples of the extensive beverage selection and the sides - asian-style slaw and the baked beans being the standouts - compliment the meats just fine and like I said, our vegetarian had no complaints. And everyone knows that vegetarians are whiners. 

The locals gave me some backstory about the chef, too, and now I'm eager for our next visit so I can add to my collection of Sousa meals."}
{"text":"it's nice to have a BBQ place that serves beer in our area. and it's open late which is awesome. Mac and cheese is awesome and so is the cornbread. fast friendly service. the BBQ sauce was a bit salty but very good all-around."}
{"text":"Loved the drinks here. The food somewhat overpriced and way too greasy. It's good, but not worth the premium prices. 

Overall, there is just something that rubs me the wrong way about the gentrified working class food concept that I have seen popping up in urban centers across the US in recent years. It goes something like this--take barbecue, soul food, Cajun or whatever downscale kind of food, serve it in a upscale, hipster-fied setting, and charge high-end prices. Since I am already skeptical of this move, I often feel that a restaurant really has to work hard on improving the food--and not just the setting--to really justify the premium prices. 

The food doesn't live up to the hype, and the fact that they seat you on a picnic table just adds to the sense of preciousness and contrived authenticity. 

Next time I'll skip this one. Or just have drinks."}
{"text":"I've been eagerly hunting for a good wings/BBQ spot in Pittsburgh. This place was thoroughly satisfying. The food was phenomenal, along with the service. Perfect for a casual dinner with indulgent barbecue meat and a hearty beer. The only reason I knocked a star off was because of the location (a bit off the beaten path of Shadyside) and limited selection of beers on tap, granted the few they had were good. 

Ambience:
The owners definitely chose the right decor to set the unassuming barbecue mood. Plenty of high tables with no frills- just slats of rather unfinished wood. Kind of what I would hope for from an authentic barbecue spot. On the other hand, the location really seems to kill the business here. Being a bit off of Shadyside proper and given the seedy neighborhood, it seems that people are deterred from visiting, which (at least on a Wednesday evening) resulted in an oddly quiet and empty restaurant. At least we didn't have to wait for seating!

Food:
Wow. We went for happy hour which included half off for wings, which made it quite reasonably priced. I had the habanero wings and my buddy had the BBQ ones. I preferred the habanero ones- just enough kick and well seasoned. I could of used a more generous slather of the sauce but the selling point was really in the meat. The wings were grilled and smoked. The slow cooking process really locked in the juices to make the meat fall apart. And these weren't mini sized wings... We also had the brisket and, not to be repetitive, but...wow. Moist, falls apart in your mouth and flavorful. All in all, I was rather content with the food. 

Drinks:
I can't comment on the cocktails but the liquor selection was reasonable. The beers on draft were limited but interesting enough. Definitely was hoping for more beers on tap given this is a barbecue joint."}
{"text":"I have a feeling the young people in the area who would most appreciate the simple sophistication of Harvard & Highland probably can't afford to be regulars and/or post up here for the night. That said, it is absolutely worth the cost for the quality ingredients and creativity in these craft cocktails.  

A lovely place to come for a sunset drink, as the completely windowed room faces west and gets a great glow around happy hour.  I wish there had been more people to mingle with, and maybe with time or happy hour enticements, there will be, but for now, it's a nice quiet place for a \"get to know you\" drink with a friend or a date.  Would also be a great space to reserve for an intimate cocktail event, I think they can seat 50?"}
{"text":"My friend and I are frequent customers at Union Pig & Chicken and after last night's experience, I regret to say I will not be returning. When we arrived last night, we went upstairs and sat at the bar as we normally do. We first ordered drinks, and all I could taste in my cocktail was soda water- no grapefruit whatsoever. I had ordered the wings and pickle plate, and the wings were completely undercooked. They were cool on the inside, slightly pink, and slimy, and I could absolutely not eat them. Even worse, my friend ordered the half chicken, brisket and sides and when he took a bite of the chicken I could immediately tell by his facial expression that something wasn't right. I would consider my friend a risk taker when it comes to eating some questionable leftovers and I have never seen him eat something he hasn't liked- and he immediately stated the chicken tasted and smelled rotten and guzzled down his beer and an entire glass of water in attempts to mute the taste. When he had me smell it, it smelled what I imagined would be similar to the stinky chicken alligator bait used in the show Swamp People. When the spoiled chicken was brought to the bartenders attention, he took a long, deep whiff (closed his eyes and all), made a face, and stated \"I don't like smoked meats so I wouldn't even know what it is supposed to smell like. I won't even eat, like, half the stuff we have here\". He asked what we wanted him to do, and we suggested that perhaps he could take it off the bill. The bartender was completely unapologetic and unprofessional. At that point, I felt so awkward by his reaction I didn't even mention that my chicken wings were undercooked. We both left dinner sick to our stomachs over our separate, awful chicken. We will stick to BBQ elsewhere from here on out."}
{"text":"To be succinct: the service was pretentious, the drinks were confusing and overpriced. 

I couldn't quite figure out what Harvard & Highland was trying to do -- and to be honest, I don't think they know what they are going for. Frankly, I found it to be a hipster bar that was trying to class it up a notch, but has since gotten resentful now that the classy crowd has started showing up.

For $10-12 a glass, I expect my drink to top-shelf, unique, made with love, strong, and/or any reasonable combination of the above. They may have been from high-grade scratch ingredients, but unfortunately the bartenders lacked enthusiasm for making them and lacked the creativity to make anything not on the menu. The drinks lacked the wow-factor to make up for the poor service and high price. I'll take a bottom shelf drink from a top-shelf bartender (mixed with some love) any day over what H&H is serving up.

After having enough of the overpriced craft drinks that came paired with an attitude, I asked for a simple whiskey-ginger. I was countered with: \"We don't have soda drinks here.\" Not a \"Well we don't have ginger-ale, but I can make you a ginger drink with whiskey in it.\" It is this sort of pretentious attitude that is keeping me from coming back.
 
The seating area is unique, and I loved the large windows overlooking East Liberty. Unfortunately there wasn't a lot of it, and I found it difficult to engage in conversation with my friends because of the seating/standing situation. 

I'm not one to write bad reviews, or any reviews for that matter, but I left H&H grossly disappointed. I had high, if not reasonable, expectations. I've eaten at Union Pig & Chicken numerous times, and will be back to eat. But the service, culture, and attitude that H&H gave off was enough to keep me from coming back. Not to mention the drinks are overpriced and under-made."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. New and expanded menu it seems. Had the lunch special of meatball sandwich, side and drink. Plenty of food! Excellent and unusual smoky meatball sandwich. Side of baked beans were also very good. I like this place!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue place I've found in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great menu and very friendly fast service 
I would definitely come back here 
The Cobb salad was awesome and the meatballs are as good as advertised on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had an event upstairs in the bar area, and was very impressed with the service and food.  I had the $6 punch and some brisket with mac and cheese, and everything was great."}
{"text":"Today I experienced a true travesty. On the quest for the fabled chicken and waffles, we woke up early on a Sunday, dressed in haste, and shot down Highland Avenue to Union to be there by opening at 10. No strangers to brunch crowds and with a busy day ahead, we wanted to be seated before the hordes poured in. 

An hour later, so full and happy I could hardly roll out of there, we were the only people in the place. What?! All the reviews for the barbecue were stellar, but one extremely important element has been woefully neglected: the chicken and waffles. 

People. CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. And not from anywhere, from Union Chicken- the fried chicken is so good it's in the name. I used to live in Nashville and this chicken can stand beside my favorite southern style. And the waffle- OH. With real maple syrup? I can't even. 

But that's not all. It's served with oven-baked mac and cheese, with the crispy cheese topping and gooey inside, and a hefty serving of greens- lots of kale and vinegar, perfect to re-awaken the palate before the next bite of crispy chicken and crispy outside, soft inside waffles. 

Side all that with a Bloody Mary that's more solid than liquid (kalmata olives??) and Zeke's coffee, both with a hint of smokiness necessary in a barbecue restaurant and I simply can't think of how to make the experience any better. And of course, our service was perfect with no competing tables. 

There should be a line out the door on Sunday mornings. Maybe that's just more for us."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, but Sunday brunch was being served until 2:30. So we got the best of both worlds and ordered brunch  AND lunch!  Service was great, everyone was super friendly. Food was amazing, great drink selection (I recommend the bloody mary).  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I knew I hadn't been here in a long time for a reason, and I'll preface this by saying I'm not a huge BBQ person. From last visits the main thing I've enjoyed here has been the fried chicken and Mac n cheese. Not earth shattering, but enjoyable.

We came here for dinner with a large group on a Saturday night and the service was more than fine. Since I wasn't very hungry I decided on the Banh Mi sandwich with no sides. I knew I would regret it as soon as I ordered it.

The pork was a big chunk and 90% fat and I couldn't even bite into it. The pickled vegetables and jalapeño/cilantro packed zero punch and all you could really taste was the liver mousse. It was also on a soft roll as opposed to a crisp French roll that I'm accustomed to.

Most of the group seemed to enjoy their food so I didn't say anything but I'm sure the waitress should've noticed I didn't eat any of my meal, but oh well.

Given my distaste for BBQ (especially) when it's expensive, and my lack of a memorable meal here on all occasions I doubt I'll be back.

They do mix up a good cocktail and beer is reasonably priced though if you want to come here to drink."}
{"text":"The food is marvelous and the atmosphere is very comfortable! 
Very clean establishment, great service and parking is a breeze.. 

Harvard and Highland which is just upstairs.. very trendy and don't expect Miller Lite on tap..  this bar is something completely different..  countless specialty drinks..  makes the trip very worth while.. 

I recommend the \"Moscow mule\" cocktail..

two thumbs up"}
{"text":"if you are a meat lover, this is the place for you. I have been there twice recently and loved almost everything. Ribs and brisket are awesome. However the chicken is not that impressive. My favorite was an appetizer though! Chicken hearts on a skewer, tender and juicy, with the right amount of flavor, reminded me of the street food in China. 
Definitely a place to go for a casual eat."}
{"text":"After reading about UPNC and viewing all the yummy pictures on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try this place. I opted for carryout hot fried chicken, mac, greens & bacon and cornbread. The service was topnotch, with a friendly greeting and a not so long wait. They packaged my food in a nice big brown bag with handles. They're a bit pricey, but it wasn't bad at all for the portions you get. The chicken had a nice season and crust. It was very tasty, tender and cooked very well to the bone. I sampled it with a bit of their specialty Carolina Chili-Vinegar that was provided. It added an nice extra punch of heat. The mac also had a nice seasoned flavor and the greens were also very good. Surprisely they add vinegar to their greens just the way I like to eat them. The cornbread was also good, if you have room to eat it all. Overall, I was very pleased and satisfied with my meal, as was my Mom and we would eat it again. I want to try some of their other offerings, like their brisket, so I'll definitely return. :)))"}
{"text":"We ate here on New Year's Day with limited hours and menu, so we decided to give it a try for the whole menu. The hostess asked if we minded dowstairs; I had not known that the restaurant had two floors. If it is at all cold outside, ask to go upstairs. Even curtains around the door do not stop the blasts of cold air each time the door opens. The downstairs was not busy, yet the service was slow as waiters passed by us several times to climb the stairs. Finally we ordered BBQ wings, cornbread, fried chicken, pickled pineapple, and an order of poutine. We were brought our meals without the poutine. As the server walked away, we told him we had an order of poutine: he did not respond. After a while, the waiter came by and apologized for the poutine. The poutine came at last after we were finished. To their credit. they offered to take them back and remove from the bill. The corned bread was dry; my daughter asked for butter to give it moisture. The fried chicken and wings were just average.  The pickled pineapple tasted like plain pineapple if just slightly sour. This is probably not a place we will give a third try."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Pittsburgh and was super excited to see a BBQ place to come to that looked clean and updated. Went in and was greeted right away and offered a high chair for my nephew. We were the only guests at this time and thought that it was due to it being a late lunch time(around 3) and it was a seat yourself style picnic bench tables. Our waiter was super awesome and can't complain at all on our service, the low rating is for the disappointing food. Me and my sister ordered Brisket, Ribs, their Mighty Mac, sweet potatoes and cornbread all to share. The cornbread was so dry butter couldn't even save it. Most BBQ places have a variety of different bbq's to try, they only had one bbq, which was vinegar based and not very good, and a white vinegar based sauce with red pepper flakes. Neither made the meat taste any better. The brisket was very fatty and tough but had a good smoky flavor at least, the ribs had wayyyy to much pepper and not enough meat making it mostly not good skin and inedible. The mighty Mac was pretty good, it was Mac and cheese, tomatoes and mozzarella. The sweet potatoes were mashed with marshmallows on top and very yummy. Overall I would not recommend or suggest this place to anyone until they up their meat game."}
{"text":"This looks like a \"Hipster\" place-which puts me on the defensive almost immediately. The barren room, communal tables, and minimalist menu are all flags that ring the alarm bells in my noggin-shouting \"you'd better either show me somethin' I ain't seen before, or you better be DAMNED good at what you do\".
As much as I mistrust Hipster places, there is usually one point of solace for these jernts, and that's the fact there will always be esoteric booze/brew choices on the Carte.  Pig and Chicken did not disappoint.
I drink Rye Whiskey, and in my short time in Pittsburgh I had noticed a local something called \"Wigle White Rye\", which was my pre-prandial quaff. It was an un-aged Rye-in other words, legal moonshine. I dig Grappa, Marc and such; so the high-octane whallop of a white booze was not a shock. The flavors were unique and provoking. OK Pig and Chicken, You have my attention.
I ordered a combo plate of Ribs, Pork Shoulder and Fried Chicken. The dish came with no sides, and I let the meat be the star.
The platter came, and it was a bare metal rectangle on a wood base. There was a red and white checked paper highlight, matching the decor on the far wall. Visual appeal: very good. 
The Chicken was yummy with a crunchy, tasty crust. I was out to have a good time, not to analyze, so I don't have a clue how to describe what the Chix tasted like, beyond \"very very good\". Round one, so far, so good.
The Ribs were meaty with a great great dry rub. Spicy but not too hot. Stripped right off the bone, and not too fatty. Mouth happy.
The Pork was really fine. NOT overtly fatty  as BBQ pork can be. A fine flavorful meat.
Three out of three. Not bad, not bad at all.
There were two sauces on the table-a \"trad\" sauce and a Vinegar-pepper \"mop\" sauce.. Both quite good, although truth be told, the meat didn't NEED either.
There was a BUNCH of food, and I left most of the Chicken Breast, and the dregs of the Pork on the plate. (Didn't take it with me, 'cos I had an early morning call). I made sure to tell the waitress the food left on my plate was there 'cos I was full and not dissatsified. 
Sometimes You can't judge a book by its cover. I think the interior designer was a hipster. The Chef de Cuisine truly had some talent. I never thought that I'd find great Q in Pittsburgh (of all places). As I was a guest, I had no input to where we dined. I might have passed this place by, due to my hipster aversion-but I was pleasantly, pleasantly surprised.
A great feed, by all counts..."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the mac and cheese is heavenly. It's creamy, has excellent flavor, and is not too salty or greasy. 
My boyfriend and I sampled the ribs, brisket, meatloaf, and pork. The ribs were a little over done, but everything else was incredible. Easily the best bbq and mac and cheese I've had in Pittsburgh. We had bourbon chocolate chip cookies and milk for desert, which were a tasty and refreshingly simple desert. The service was very friendly, and the food came out in a timely fashion. Definitely 5 star worthy"}
{"text":"I got takeout. Full rack of ribs, full order of fried chicken.  Greens, and mac n' cheese. None of it was great. Ribs were pretty average. Fried chicken was pretty average. Mac and Cheese was definitely pretty average to below average if you know anything about good mac in cheese. Greens were not very good. The St. Louis style sauce is the only thing unique about what they do, and that's not exceptional for what it is either. The place was meh at best.

The service people were nice. I'll give them that."}
{"text":"This wasn't our first time at Union Pig, but it was the most disappointing.  It was an early Sunday evening, the place was empty, but that shouldn't explain how when the hostess seated us at a dirty table she swiped it with her hand (and smeared the food) instead of sending a server over to actually clean it, or clean it herself.  Since the place was empty and the servers were shooting the breeze at the bar, why not clean tables?  Anyhow we ordered brisket and ribs.  The brisket was tough and fatty -- I had to cut and dice it to get just the meat.  My husband's ribs were ridiculously fatty, so sort of inedible that he polished off his side dishes and some of mine because he was still hungry. Side dishes of cole slaw (excellent) and corn broad (usually good but sort of dry on our visit) were the highlight. This isn't the first time we've had less than great meat, but I guess we kept thinking maybe it was just an off night, but that doesn't seem to be the case, and this visit will definitely be our last.  If only you could eat the great bbq/smoky smell of the place, that was best part."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because I went to eat lunch with mom, cousin, sister and moms bf and she brought 4 groupons and asked to talk to a manager when the waitress said she couldn't that many groupons at one table. 
And then they did \"just this one time bc my mom didn't know\". (She did. Oh she knew.) 
And then my mom waited until the food came and ordered more food. And. Then. Made. Her. Get. More. Food. 
Besides that, the servers put up with us, hopefully didn't spit in our food, and the food was baaaalller. Best Bahn Mi I've had in the city so far. 
(And the waiter was super muscle tan hot, like Zac Efron shit)"}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq in Pgh. Only place my southern husband will eat bbq. Even the in-laws agree."}
{"text":"Ive never posted to Yelp, but there was no way that I couldn't submit a review for UP&C.

We tried a little bit of nearly everything on the menu and no one in our party was let down by a single flavor on the plates. Both the meaty mac and regular mac and cheese were easily the best Ive had. And I wouldn't be able to actually describe how incredible the meats were. The whiskey bar upstairs has a huge selection and the staff and owner are great. I was blown away by this place, and I think that if you don't go there you're doing yourself a disservice. I'm fairly certain that Ive doubled my quality of life just by having tasted the food here."}
{"text":"Wow. This one was a treat. Not the best Q I have had in my life (I have family living in Texas), but definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh. A few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I were going to meet some friends out for dinner and couldn't decide on a place. Our friends suggested Union Pig and Chicken but my wonderful girlfriend, who has the culinary horizon of a picky seven year old, hates BBQ (I know, I know, it's a struggle every day guys). Well now she is gone for the summer on an internship, so our friends and myself tried again tonight. Union has three new fans.

When you first walk into Union, the first thing you notice is the family-style seating. The dining room is a relatively small space consisting of four picnic tables with seating for eight at each. I don't mind the seating sitiuation; it lends to the comfortable feel that good Q is supposed to inspire. The walls were a mix of paint (red, pink, and white criss-cross pattern) and reclaimed railroad ties. I love the look of the restaurant. It has that \"oooh look! reclaimed wood\" effect but because they are largely unfinished railroad ties, they maintain that rough, dirty look and feel of a good Southern Q joint. The decor is kind of a double edged sword however. As cool as the restaurant looks, the hard walls and hard floors creat one hell of an echo, adding to the overall volume of the service.

The at Union was what I would best describe as adequate. Our server was nice, attentive enough, and always kept our waters full. Other than that the service was rather unremarkable. She didn't wow me, but she didn't disappoint me either.The only fault I could find with her was that it seemed to take a while for us to get our bill, but to be fair, the restaurant looked a little understaffed and they were busy, so she gets a pass on that. 

Af far as the food goes, all I can say is \"GOOD LAWD DAT\"S SOME GOOD FOOD!\" to paraphrase my Aunt Mary. We started off with lettuce wraps made of smoked pork belly with peas, cilantro, onions and rare, which I gathered was the highly spicy rust colored dust over the wraps. From bite one I knew I was in  for a good experience. The Pork belly was that succulent melt in your mouth fatty that good pork belly should be. The cilantro, peas, and lettuce worked well with the spicy elements to provide a sweet, herby, spicy, porky bite that I could have eaten all night. 

For the main course I got the Three Meat Combo, brisket, ribs, and pork shoulder. The three of us also split sides of mac and cheese, greens, coleslaw, corn bread, and potato salad. We couldn't stop ourselves. We fell on it like a pack of ravenous wolves on , well, a dead swine. The perfect porcine goodnesss at Union is unrivaled in Pittsburgh. The pork shoulder was tender and fatty and succulent and basted in a perfectly vinegary saude with hints of mustard in it. Kind of a Carolina Sauce with a little twist.  The ribs were fall apart tender. I pulled the bones out clean and even was able to bend one almost in half. They were rubbed with a wonderfully sweet, smokey and salty crust that mixed so well with the natural fat in the ribs. The final player was the brisket. Sadly, I was introduced to brisket in Texas. The brisket at Union is unrivaled in Pittsburgh, and reminiscent of Texas BBQ, but not quite the same thing.

The sides were excellent themselves. The corn bread was a little dry, but it had wonderful flavor and was not so dry that a little butter could't remedy the situation. The greens were maybe my least favorite. The were tasty, vinegary, and had bacon, which makes everything better of course, but they just didn't stack up to the rest of the meal. The coleslaw was great. It was vinegar based, but still sweet with a hint of cherry to it. The potato salad was also fantastic, though a little thin for my tastes. The mac and cheese was my favorite side, it has been since I was a kid. It was cheesey and chreamy with a melty crust on top. So good. 

If you are like me and you like whiskey, you will not be disappointed with Union's bar menu. They offer a wide selection of whiskeys from around the US as well as a pair of spirits from a local distillery. For those of you who are not into straight rye or bourbon whiskey, Union makes infused whiskeys that are well ballanced between sweet, sour and boozey. For those of you who like no taste of alcohol, the one lady in my group got one of their mason jar concoctions. I tried a sip an I must say were I not such a macho, manly, man with a chisled jawline and a strict diet of red meat, beer and whiskey, I may have ordered one it was that good.

The only things that kept me from giving a 5 were the wait for our check and the sauce. The sauce was a little tomatoey and not sweet enough for me."}
{"text":"Yikes. I spoke too soon. My last review praised the tenderness and smokiness of the ribs. I returned last week, ordered a half rack, and was presented with a hard, charred, clump of inedible carbon and bones."}
{"text":"4 stars is a bit generous, but i really would like the place to thrive! You go through pig and chicken (door on the right), even late at night. 

The space is really nice with large windows on highland. Lot of space between tables. The style fits more a beer place than a cocktail place (we came for cocktails), but it is reasonably confi. The music is loud, and the place may not be good if you want to talk to someone. 

You can order food from P&C, which we did (at nearly midnight - cool). The cocktail list is quite small, which was a bit of a disappointment. But the cocktails are good. The beer list is large. So I guess it's not really a cocktail place. 

Sadly, the place was nearly empty. We stopped by on Sat late in the evening. I was hoping to see some life there, but I guess it had already gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Leave your coronas, heinekens, and vodka/cranberries at the door- Harvard and Highland is here to entertain your tastebuds. Harvard and Highland is a bright star in my East Liberty world and is a great bar with wonderful craft cocktails that will match your mood. The menu is diverse and each carry unique tastes. They also get plus points for their creative cocktail names (my fave is S.S. Awesomepants!)

I love the space, though it can get pretty loud when the bar's bustling with action (I suspect it's because there are few textile pieces to absorb the sound). The bartenders are attentive and while they have a demanding job description, they have an uncanny talent with keeping tabs on who doesn't need a drink, who is new, and who needs a little patter to decide on a drink.

When I walked in for the first time, I had no idea what I wanted to ask for, since the cocktails are deconstructed with ingredients and leave a lot of imagination as to what the final result may look like. Don't be afraid to have a conversation with your bartender to decide on your next drink! I trusted my bartender and let her know what kind of drinks I liked (I usually drink blah blah blah and I'm in the mood for something refreshing/spicy/with a kick please!) She was able to make recommendations based on that  and gave me the High Line (I think that's what it was..but it was on the chalkboard) which I must say was pretty refreshing.

I can't wait to come back and taste what else Harvard and Highland has in store for us!"}
{"text":"Service was good, Mac and cheese was excellent, ribs were very dry, 1/3rd were inedible but 2/3rd of it very tasty, greens were good, way too much horse radish on the chicken sandwich. I would of gave 3 stars but that Mac was delicious!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon. Not busy at all. 3 of us.  Food was OK, not outstanding. Service was slow. Food was WAAAY overpriced for the small portions we got. Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket and yams, and they were delicious! The meat was full of flavor and super tender. The yams were super tasty. And the overall price was not bad at all for the food we got. We tried this place because we had purchased a Groupon, but we will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"After hearing the news from my Yelp buddy Rochelle H. that they would soon be closing we all had to visit Union Pig & Chicken one last time.

When we pulled up I noticed a \"Cash Only\" sign so I had to run to a ATM first. Once inside we were greeted and seated. Kelley our waitress came over and took our drink orders and informed us that they were working with a limited menu as they where closing.

Rochelle H got her food to go but, my wife and I decided to dine in one last time. I chose the sweet tea and went with the whole fried chicken, I/2 lb of brisket, mac & cheese and rice and black beans. Rochelle was so impressed with our food that she had to take a picture of it. 

The fried chicken was as good as ever. Crispy skin and hot and juicy chicken meat on the inside. The brisket was equally amazing, melting in my mouth just like I remembered. The mac & cheese was superb as well.

After we couldn't eat anymore we got the rest of our food boxed to go. I then asked Kelley for a menu to keep as a souvenir. Not only did she give me a menu to keep but, she even gave me a Union Pig & Chicken t shirt and a sweet tea to go as well! She was great the entire time we were there and even talked with us as we waited for our food to come out.

Union Pig decided to close as their lease was up and the building owners got greedy and decided to raise their rent. It is a real shame that East Liberty lost a true gem in the closing of Union Pig as they were one of the pioneering new restaurants five years before the regentrification of East Liberty even really took off.  I wish Kelley and everyone at Union Pig & Chicken the best of luck and hope they find a new and better space. 

Union Pig & Chicken will be truly missed."}
{"text":"My partner and I shared the pulled pork sandwich. It was huge and enough for two people. I was expecting it to be shredded, but it was more like chunks of pork. The sandwich was really good. I liked the bread and the pork was really tender. I wasn't a fan of the peppery BBQ sauce but the vinaigrette was good. We also got a side of yams and mallows. They weren't that sweet and could use a little extra sugar, but I still enjoyed them. It smells amazing in this place. When we got home we smelled like smoke in the best possible way. I would go here again if I was hungry and happened to be in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Union Pig & Chicken.  I think that I *could* love Union Pig & Chicken.  It's just not quite there yet.  I have been twice: once for dinner on a slow weeknight and once for lunch on a Saturday.  Both experience were good, just not great.

The Great:

Service - Both visits, our servers were fun and knowledgeable and the food arrived promptly and hot.  No complaints whatsoever here.

The ribs - Oh dear, where do I begin?  These racks of shear beauty were tender, juicy, and just fell right of the bone.  No excessive sauce or grease, just pure, meaty heaven.  I especially enjoyed them with a little added vinegary Carolina BBQ sauce

The pork shoulder - A close second to the ribs.  The beautifully seasoned cubes of pig nearly melt in your mouth.

The collard greens - Perfectly cooked vinegary, bacony goodness.

The drinks - For this lover of savory cocktails, the smoked onion, black pepper, and local maple infused rye on the rocks either alone or with a splash of soda was perfectly executed libational genius.  They also mix up some mean cocktails with Wigle whiskey.

The Meh:

The fried chicken - Moist meat and good flavor, but the breading came out rather soggy on our first visit.  On the second, there was a bit more crisp going on, but it still was just average.

The brisket - Tough and dry with little flavor.  My least favorite thing I tried.  

The ambiance - Aesthetically, I love the place.  The picnic tablecloth wall, the rustic, exposed wood walls and beams, the picnic-like long tables.  Because it is so bare, though, it gets really loud.  I am generally not sensitive to noise in restaurants or bars at all, but Union Pig is pretty darn loud when packed.

The cornbread - Decent flavor, but quite dense and dry.  

The mac and cheese - It had a nice cheese crust on the side, but I found it a bit bland and mushy.  

Conclusion:

A good start, but there is absolutely room for improvement.  Given the varying reviews for the same dishes (e.g., the brisket being described as very moist by some and tough and dry by others and my experience with very different levels of crispyness with the chicken) makes me think that there is a consistency problem.  It's a new restaurant, though, so I'm hopeful they can work that out.  Overall, a fun place to go with some standouts.  I look forward to my next visit and hope to see it work out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"Union Pig & Chicken hurt my feelings.  I, like so many others, was thrilled about the little brother to Salt opening and as we all figured out, the food just wasn't that good.  I didn't want to go back.

A month or so a go, a friend who had never been insisted we return.  Meh, I think.

And then there's some new menu items:
Pork Shoulder (which really looks like potatoes but tastes like juicy meat).

And, then, you have to order sides... and what's this?
Meaty Mac and Cheese (and there is a perfect hint of mustard in there!)

And now the ribs are tender and fall off the bone.  All the beers on the list are actually in stock!

Proud to update this to a five star spot.  I can't stay away."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good Fried chicken. Not a huge fan of their sides. Not a fan of the seating situation either."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time here. The space itself is hip and minimal. There isnt a lot of flair or shiny objects to distract you. The food and other fare are the main points and they make good on their promise. 

The space has communal seating downstairs, im unsure about upstairs as we didnt sit there. The bar is also upstairs. We stopped in a couple of times during our 3 day trip. 1st visit we had the poutine, the chicken wings and the half fried chicken. The second trip we had biscuits, half fried chicken and mac and cheese. The names of the drinks on the menu are funny and eye catching. You dont have to order what they have on the menu they can whip you up whatever you like. Oh yea the food and drinks came out the kitchen hot and didnt take long at all. 

The fried chicken was great and surprisingly, it was seasoned really well. The cream biscuit wasnt that good in my opinion, but that mac and cheese tho! It was good and cheesy with a good sized portion. The smoked wings were also great. The poutine was a huge size and all of the potatoey cheesey goodness that you could imagine. 

The prices were reasonable and the staff were super friendly and helpful. They were willing to talk about the city and give suggestions, this is just what us out of towners needed. I would come back as a out of towner this means quite a bit."}
{"text":"**Update** I went back again... I should know better. It was a sunday and I was really craving that mac n cheese.  I ordered that and we split half a chicken (my sister and her daughter and I).  The chicken was just bordering on raw/undercooked. There was blood in the chicken, i'm not just talking like a vein I mean pink meat bloody blood. I just feel like this place has gone progressively down the shitter since the first time I was there. The menu changed, the food changed,the prices changed. What a bummer"}
{"text":"Harvard and Highland has excellent cocktails and a good bourbon collection. The space is a little stark, but it's a great place to go with a big group. You can order up BBQ from UPG late and play pool for free on a new slate table in the back room."}
{"text":"I realized a few weeks ago that I hadn't been here in nearly a year and a half. So I had to get there immediately.

I ordered the pork sandwich from the lunch menu. It came on soft, delicious bread with equally delicious whole grain mustard and red onions. The pork wasn't pulled, like I expected, but the chunks of pork that came on it melted right apart in my mouth. The barbecue sauce is self serve from bottles on the communal tables, so there's no problem with mess (unless that's your style, of course). So the sandwich was fantastic, basically. I just wish the cornbread I got as a side had lived up to the sandwich. It could have used just a little more sweetness.

I also had some of their house made rock and rye to drink. I had the Wild Turkey infused with pineapple and black pepper. Its sweetness and spiciness were a great counterpart to the barbecue, and it was a great finish to the meal.

The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly. The price point isn't bad either. Get here."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices. Everything is pretty much a la carte. We found this place on groupon and are happy we did. I had the Chili Mac which was pretty spicy, but good. The cornbread was also delicious. Good portion sizes too"}
{"text":"I'm reading some of the other reviews and thinking \"Was I at the same place as these people?\"  (Note to some of the other reviewers:  If you think this is real - or good - BBQ, you need to travel more.  Much more.)

I wanted to try a few things so I ordered the 1/4 pound of brisket and 1/4 pound of pork with greens for my side.  Greens were ok.  nothing special at all.  The meat selections were disgusting.  

First, the two very small slices of brisket   I know what brisket is supposed to look and taste like - what they served looked like meatloaf and were the greasiest pieces of meat I have EVER HAD, which cancelled out any hint of smokiness.  Second, the pork cubes - again a very small portion - were also greasy and not really seasoned much.

Also it was Sunday evening and not crowded but still it took 40 minutes to get our food. 

For the amount of food they serve for the price, I was expecting something WAY better.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Probably 3 1/2 stars...  We had the habanero wings as an appetizer.  Nice heat to them, but what we couldn't get over was the moistness of the meat!  They must be brining their wings, but whatever they're doing, they should continue!

We ordered prudently, sticking with 1/4 lb. portions, but next time it will gave to be upped to 1/2!  We tried the ribs (fell off the bone--I saw other reviews here stating otherwise, but on this visit, the ribs were perfect).  Also tried the pork and the brisket, which were both pretty awesome.  The greens were nice and vinegary.  I want to go back and try some more of their sides.

On the downside:  dessert.  Neither of us are big on desserts, but we thought we'd give it a try here.  Funnel cake topped with local peach slices was good, but on the small side.  Whoopie pie was...meh.  Didn't like that cream filling at all!  A little grainy, a little too sweet.

Also:  we ate upstairs.  Nice room, nice big windows, but little to no air conditioning on a very hot evening!  We were both schvitzing, even before having the habanero wings!  And yes, numerous house flies, which were distracting and of course, kind of gross.

Our server was a sweetie, nice, knowledgeable and attentive.  Food did seem to take a little longer than if should have to arrive, but my impression in observing the room was that it was a kitchen thing, not a server thing.

All that said, we will definitely go back for more :-)"}
{"text":"I'm from down south and recently moved to the frigid, bbq-less north. I've had North Carolina style, Memphis dry rub, and St. Louis style ribs. Union Pig and Chicken simply has great bbq. The brisket is flavorful and tender. I was hesitant getting any pork that wasn't pulled pork, but they actually won me over. It is wonderful to have a great bbq joint in my neighborhood. Good homesick food.

The atmosphere is also a lot of fun. Long community tables make a unique community dining experience. The staff is friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this Pittsburgh gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Bench seating,  young friendly staff. Will review food once I get it

OK, the food was delicious, but vastly overpriced for the amount you got. With tip I spent $50 on what some BBQ fans would consider a light lunch for 2 ! Don't go unless it's to impress a date or a customer and you can expense it !

Because of cost and the size of portions alone, I'll never return !"}
{"text":"My family decided to check out Union Pig & Chicken for fathers day since my Dad loves BBQ. My fiance and I are also BBQ foodies - we probably eat more BBQ than anything else, so we were excited to try a new place. 

When we arrived I immediately fell in love with the interior decor. Although it is a bit dark, which is usually a crime to me, the beautiful \"reclaimed\" look of the walls really did it for me. The smells were wonderful and the food at everyones tables looked amazingly appetizing. That is about where I stopped enjoying the place though. 

I ordered the 2 meat combo with Ribs and Brisket. My fiance ordered the Pork shoulder sandwich. We added an order of half fried chicken. Our sides were coleslaw, potato salad, and we each had a piece of cornbread. We figured that would be a good \"tour\" of the menu. 

When the food arrived it looked wonderful. I'm not a fan of the metal lunch tray that it was served on (it felt too \"fast-food\" like to me), but the appearance of the food itself was quite appetizing. 

I tried to brisket first and was shocked at how dry and salty it was. I ended up only eating a few bites because it was so salty and the dry rub on it had burnt to a crisp during the cooking process leaving a flavor and what had the texture of charred season salt behind. 

My plan was to hide this with the BBQ sauce so I then tasted it. It was \"mheh\".  It had a strong flavor of alcohol in it which I initially mistook for beer but found out later that it was whiskey. I'm not a fan of whiskey or bourbon BBQ sauce, and that was the ONLY option. Call me spoiled, but I think BBQ joints should offer more than one sauce. Throw a little Carolina in there, or a smoky sweet sauce, or something!  But this sauce tasted like (in order), Alcohol (whiskey), vinegar, paprika, salt, then had a sweet BBQ finish. I ended up not using any. 

My ribs were dry rubbed and charred. They were a little dry. BBQ sauce would have made up for it, but I didn't have any. The amount of meat on the bones was average. 

The fried chicken was the highlight of the meal. It was cooked properly and moist. The breading was crispy and tasty. It wasn't as salty as everything else. I am glad we decided to order the chicken because it was really the only thing that I enjoyed. 

The potato salad was just okay. It had a lot of herbs in it but was somehow almost bland. It was a mustard/vinegar based dressing with dill and maybe parsley in it. It was also served luke warm, which probably didn't help. I ended up taking it home and eating the left overs the next day and it was much better - which means it probably hadn't sat long enough to let the flavors meld and really compliment each other. It was also colder coming out of my fridge. 

The corn bread was a hot mess. It was overdone, dry, and hard. It tasted like they used an entire stick of butter to make one piece... which made me wonder if we had a bad batch and rather than toss it they just basted it with butter to try to salvage it and served it anyhow. I would never have served that in my restaurant.

My Fiance said his pork shoulder sandwich was just okay. It was served on half of a sub (hoagie) bun - nothing fancy there. The pork shoulder was \"too fatty\" according to him. He doesn't like fatty pieces left on his meat, so any fat would have bothered him. 

I also tried my sisters greens. They, again, were just okay. Very vinegary - and not much of a ham or bacon taste. Maybe they're vegetarian. 

I also tried the mac and cheese and that was THE best dish of everything. Possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever had (although I don't eat mac and cheese very often - maybe once a year). 

The coleslaw was really good as well - but it was just your standard cole slaw. Kind of reminded me of Kentucky Fried Chicken's slaw.

Service was pretty good - timely and polite. The prices were a little extreme - but that is only because the food was sub par. I'd gladly pay those prices for BBQ that was a little better. 

We likely won't be returning to Union Pig and Chicken. Archie's BBQ in McHenry, Maryland (Deep Creek) reigns supreme as our favorite BBQ joint."}
{"text":"We were super excited that real barbecue was making it's way into the Burgh.

We ordered and assortment of meats and sides.  The cornbread was average, the mac and cheese tasty.  The brisket was almost entirely composed of wiggly white fat so for 14.00 there was little more than a few mouthfuls of meat.

The decor is hipster in style but honestly the tables and benches are very similar to what you see in the more rustic attractions at Disney world and other touristy sites. 


Everyone in the place was frozen since there's no entryway and every time the door opened, the whole place was blasted with icy air.  The room was so chilly that the food didn't stay warm for more than a minute or two after it came out.  There were about 12 other people there when we went and every single one of them kept their coat on the whole time, some kept winter hats and scarves on.

Overall, we were super disappointed.  If you're going to serve real BBQ in a stark environment, then the prices and portions should match.  There's nothing authentic about decent barbecue served in tiny portions at double the price of a real down home barbecue joint. No one wants to pay a premium for a dollhouse portion because it's trendy.  We left hungry after paying over 60.00 after tip (2 adults, 2 kids) for a pretty sparse tray of food."}
{"text":"The ribs were a bit overcooked for my taste. But the brisket was amazing. I could eat that all day. Corn bread was a bit dry and didn't offer honey or butter for it."}
{"text":"Bbq was ok, I've had better in Pittsburgh. Drinks and meals were way over-priced.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a chill place to be in. I tried the chicken and the wings. Chicken was way too smokey. Wings were delicious. Wings were smokey too but was a good amount of it. The cornbread here convinced me to give it a 4 instead of a 3. My friend didn't like the cornbread, but I LOVED it. Servers were friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but my experience was really bad. The meat was, no exaggeration, at least 40% fat (brisket). Expensive entrees that come with no sides. My boyfriend got the 3 meat entree. He is a total carnivore, and even he agreed that the brisket was a fatty mess and the ribs were inedible. Whatever rub they put on the ribs tasted like chemicals, and the meat was really tough. Both my boyfriend and I were queasy for the rest of the evening. We shared the mac'n'cheese side - easily the best part of the meal, which is sad for a barbecue place. I don't often post reviews, but I post this one as a caution: over-priced and yucky. Save your stomach and your cash."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of smoked food, but decided to give this place a try since they were featured on Groupon. As a smoked skeptic, I was surprisingly satisfied with the flavors. Foodwise, I would only give this place 3 stars, but the service was phenomenal and that bumped it up an extra star. Shout out to the waiter who gave us extra habanero sauce to go, you're an angel! 

Ordered a pound of St. Louis ribs, 12 buffalo wings, a brisket sandwich and a side of classic mac and cheese. All that was shared with my food partner, and we had tons of leftover to take home. The wings were moist inside, but I could taste the bitterness from the overly smoked exterior. The brisket sandwich was a little bland, but tasted great with the vinaigrette on the table. The ribs were amazing! It was so well cooked that the meat slid off the bones. I usually don't like cheese, but this mac and cheese was quite tasty.

The amount of food we received was probably enough to easily serve 3 people. The biggest shocker of the night was how charcoaled all the meat was, as you can see from the picture. Smoked food is not my specialty so I'm not quite sure if that's normal. I was a little turned off though because it looked straight up burnt!

In conclusion, I had a great dinning experience here. The service was top notch and the food decent, although kind of overly smoked. I highly recommend the St. Louis ribs and mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Wow. There's lots of stuff to like about this place. The only drawback is that you'll probably leave here on a stretcher as the EMTs try to revive you from a heart attack.

The ambiance here is not so different from Salt and Cure - it's got that whole rustic industrial thing going on. Again, you have the communal tables from Salt, which isn't a bad thing. However, the acoustics need some work; it can get really loud in here.

But who cares, right? Because you came here for the food. First, this is not a cheap BBQ place, so you'd best get over that real quick. That being said, it's totally possible to walk out of here having spent about $20 pp and still have a ton of food leftover for the next night. So, considering that you're really getting two meals out of one, it's not quite as crazy expensive as you might be thinking. However, if you're going to booze it up, which I highly recommend, because their drinks are deelish, you're going to be paying a bit more.

No normal human being can eat the three option meal. If you can, well, I hope that you also have an Urban Active or Shadyside X membership. But, it is definitely worth trying; everything here is absolutely delicious. Our group had pretty much every single option: the fried chicken (very good, but I will take Meat and Potatoes fried chicken and waffles over this one), ribs, brisket, pork shoulder. The brisket is by far the best, and is probably just pork belly. The mac and cheese is also a winner, as is the corn bread. We also had the tartare and the pork belly appetizers, and both were delicious (I'd take the tartare over the pork belly). 

But, it's all almost too much. When I walked out of here, I felt... pretty disgusting. So, I'd recommend that Union Pig and Chicken get something on the menu that is a palate cleanser of some sort. In Chinese cuisine, the tea cuts down on the grease somewhat; you guys are good at drinks, so I'm sure you can figure something out."}
{"text":"I had to give 3 stars. Now this isn't because the food wasn't good but because of the prices. I got ribs , mac and cheese, and one slice of corn bread. The ribs by far were one of the best i've had in a while. Mac and Cheese was home made and very good. The corn bread I would pass on next time it was very dry. My issue with the prices it was like $4 for a side, the ribs were $10 for about 4 or 5 bones. Just feel for what you get it was way over priced."}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday, there were 13 of us, we made reservations 1.5 weeks in advance.  The hostess and bartender (prior to being seated) were polite and helpful.  My pleasant experience ended there.  Our server, new and obviously inexperienced was slow, didn't know the menu and all around unable to get a drink order correct.  The food came out in a timely manner, but it was just not good. The ribs were dry and tough, the macaroni and cheese dry, the fried chicken dark and tasted like old frying oil.  Most of our table was deeply unhappy with our overall experience.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"BRISKET SANDWHICH! Very large portion- come hungry. Their mac and cheese is baked to golden brown on top and gooey with cheese underneath. Definitely try their cole slaw and poutine as well if you can fit in all in your stomach. The decor is simple and clean. They even have craft beer :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  If you come here, be prepared to get into a food coma.

First, you don't come here to order for yourself.  You come here to order tons of food and have everyone grab what they want.  I had four people at my table and they brought out three trays of food all at once.  We barely ate half of it.  It...was..awesome.  We had pork shoulder, beef brisket, ribs, plain mac and cheese, meaty mac and cheese, chicken, and cornbread.

I love everything.  The meaty mac and cheese stood out.  The beef brisket was good.  I just loved it all.  I love the idea of their two store long tables.  if you want privacy, you can eat upstairs where there are smaller tables.  It is weird because upstairs is suppose to be a separate restaurant but I guess they're slowly combining together.

I am surprise that there is a restaurant like this in the area.  I live nearby but would have never come to this area.  Some may feel the area is a little sketchy but it is not too bad. I've never seen so many white people gathered in one location in East Liberty.

Enjoy.  Eat up."}
{"text":"What can I say that has not been said?
I will start by saying my girlfriend got a groupon and that made it totally worth it.
The food was very good. We got fried chicken, brisket, ribs, Mac n cheese, cornbread and collard greens with bacon. All good. The fried chicken was the best with the corn bread coming 2nd. Our server was great and helped us pick out the fried chicken as an item when we would of picked something else any other day. Also both sauces on the table where good nothing crazy.

That being said. With out the groupon it would of been over priced. Not a rip off or even close to one but still a little pricy. 

I also have to add I'm a snob when it comes to BBQ since I love to cook it so it takes some amazing BBQ to get me going."}
{"text":"Just got back from Union Pig and Chicken - one day too early for their lunch menu, but let me tell you, the brisket was fantastic - and I lived in Austin

We also sampled fried chicken. it was amazing, delicious, moist. It should be a case study for fried chicken preparation

FInally the red cabbage slaw, a vinegar based slaw, complemented everything nicely.

When they get a lunch menu I'll be sure to be back at lunchtime, otherwise, looking forward to returning for dinner with the whole clan."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches around. The pork bowl, chicken and waffles, and steak and eggs are all INSANELY good. Smokey, tender, and delicious. We've been twice and it's consistent. Also, our server Kelly was about as excellent as it gets. Great service, great food, and the best mimosa I can find in the city. Thanks Union!"}
{"text":"Great brisket (also in steak and eggs for brunch), and pretty delicious ribs (though they tend to be hit or miss). I also like their brussels sprouts! Plus, you can order any drink from Harvard & Highland."}
{"text":"Pretty sure that the only research behind this place was 1.) watching season one of The Dukes of Hazzard and 2.) reading the label of a bottle of KC Masterpiece.  

I've been craving a good barbecue place since I moved to Pittsburgh, and I'm still searching.  Granted, I think my standards are high: I grew up in SC and lived in eastern NC, south Ga., and Kansas City, and my dining partner grew up in eastern NC.  Not easy to please, but I was open.  

We both had pork shoulder.  (Go figure - pork shoulder = barbecue in the Carolinas.)  I also had some brisket just to try something else.  The pork comes out in chunks - very good flavor, but the cubes are weird - don't allow it to pick up any grease or sauce.  It's much better if you mash it up into pulled pork and douse it with the vinegar - four stars after you do something that should've been done in the kitchen.  The brisket was, meh.  Both meats were obviously hit with a blowtorch.  Barbecue is about slow cooking - any charring is a side effect - acceptable, but not a key, and too much is, well, too much.  This was too much - some bites tasted like charcoal.  Way too much fat, too.  The fat definitely adds to the flavor, but only when it's rendered and soaked into the rest of the meat - big chunks should be cut away and not served.  (Only the crappy 'cue places down South serve up as much whole fat as this place.)  This seems to be sous-vide, so much of the fat stays whole - not awful, but it gets to be a bit much after 3-4 mouthfuls of straight charred fat.  The sauces need a lot of work, too.  The vinegar needed more spice, more flavor.  The red stuff was pretty flavorless.  The other stuff was just a Caribbean pepper sauce.  Not bad, but the heat overpowered the meat, and it was a bit too fruity.

My friend had baked beans on the side.  Bleh - way too sweet and too spicy.  Had a weird flavor that I think I figured out: sweet potatoes.  These tasted like someone mixed beans into a decent sweet potato pie.  (Which wasn't bad until you hit a chunk of hot dog.  Salty meat and sweet potato pie don't mix well.)

The high point was the collards - perfectly done.  Most Southern places overcook the hell out of them, and most Yankees leave them leathery.  These were perfect.

Sweet tea was about half as strong as it should be.  (A nice mahogany color is close to ideal - this stuff is lighter than cream soda.)  Sweetness was about right for me, but not as sweet as authentic, syrupy sweet tea.  ...And it would be nice to keep a pitcher of unsweetened - every place down South keeps both.  (My friend wanted unsweetened - no dice for her.)

The communal seating is just weird.  I only know one barbecue place that does that, and they only do it in one of their several dining rooms.  It's annoying to be dropping $20 on a casual meal and still feel rushed to clear out. 

For $50 for two, just have some pulled pork FedExed to your door.  (There are a few places in the Carolinas that will happily do that.)

*No form of meat stew?  Really?  I mean, if I was a chef, I'd think that would be the area where I could really have some fun.  Giant swathes of Barbecueland have a \"barbecue stew\": hash in SC, Brunswick stew in Ga., burgoo in KY.  Kinda disappointed that UP&C missed that opportunity - kinda hard to miss if you actually spent any time in barbecue country.

**Cornbread was the worst I've ever had, and my partner agreed.  I thought the worst you could do was Jiffy (which isn't bad - the good folks at Jiffy set the floor pretty high).  If you can't get the real stuff right, you pick up a bunch of boxes of Jiffy, at, like $1/box, and follow the recipe - can't go wrong.  Unfortunately, UP&C thinks they know better - tastes like they mixed a bag of cornmeal with some vanilla brownie mix.  I've eaten plenty of cake that wasn't as sweet, but this stuff had a messed-up texture.  The top inch was as dense as a hush puppy, and the bottom inch had the texture of a slab of beef jerky.  The chef should spank his own bare behind for serving this to paying customers.  ...And do it again for charging $3 per clod as a side."}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars because I liked the macaroni and cheese and because the others in my group sort of liked their meals. I went with about a dozen people and got the brisket sandwich and macaroni and cheese. Let me start by saying that I am Jewish - I know brisket. I know how to serve it on a plate with potatoes and I know how to serve it in a sandwich. Imagine my surprise when I bit into the brisket only to discover that my mouth was filled with fat. No meat. Just fat. So I opened the sandwich only to find that the brisket in my sandwich was 25% meat and 75% charred fat. Tasty. Another in my group had the fried chicken and guessed that they left it in the kitchen for awhile before serving it because the fried crust was soggy."}
{"text":"This is a really cool spot in East Liberty and I'll give them that. The servers are friendly too but that is pretty much where the \"good\" ends. 

We walked in the place and most of the tables were occupied. We were immediately greeted and taken upstairs which was nicely dimmed and offered up a great view of the street below. 

The menu had a selection of meats ranging from ribs, chicken, brisket, wings, etc. We opted to sample a small order of ribs and 12 buffalo wings with mac/cheese and greens to go with. When the food arrived, it looked good. The only thing that was odd was the buffalo sauce didn't seem to stick to the wings but that's an easy fix...just dip em, right? Wing flavor and sauce= did not taste good. I've had many smoked wings and these just did not taste good. My daughter who is a chicken wing lover wouldn't eat more than 2. A couple of the wings were dried out.  Rib flavor, tenderness and sauce= whatever the yellow stuff on there is...they need to get rid of it. Only half of my rib was edible and the other was tough...see pic. The greens were decent but a tad on the salty side. The mac/cheese was a no. There was cheese and it was moist but lacking any good flavor. I sampled that bbq sauce on my ribs.  It has a few different notes but not something I would choose to lick off of anything. I tasted some ketchup, sweetness and maybe a bit of vinegar but they didn't go together at all...not good. 

The bar area looked nice and folks appeared to be having fun. Whatever was going on in the next room really took away from our meal.  It was soooooooo loud!  I was dining with my daughter and heard a guy with a microphone drop some curse words. Don't get me wrong, I realize my daughter has heard all of those words before. I am a little old school and just believe I should be able to choose, as a parent, if I want to sit in the midst of all that with my child when it's on my dime. After a long day at work...I just wanted a peaceful meal with my mini me.

In my opinion, good bbq is not that hard to pull off. I REALLY wanted to like this place but it fell far from the mark for me. Again, I'll say the service was good. I was too tired to complain and after reading some of the reviews, not sure if it would make a difference or not. I did leave info on their comment card. Hopefully it will be taken as constructive versus bashing because it's truly not my intention.

I wish them luck but my search for the best bbq in town continues."}
{"text":"My husband and I consider ourselves BBQ connoisseurs after sampling the best of what Texas has to offer last year, so we were very excited to visit Union Pig and Chicken.  

I've read that other reviewers were disappointed in the prices and the portion sizes.  I could not have had a more opposite reaction.  Our friendly waitress suggested the two of us get the choose 2 with a side and cornbread and assured us that it would be enough.  At $20 I have to say this is a steal and DEFINITELY the way to go if you are a party of 2.  We picked the pork shoulder and brisket with a side of greens.  We also ordered an appetizer of pork belly lettuce wraps.  

First off, the pork belly lettuce wraps were awesome.  I'll be disappointed if they are not on the menu when we go back.  Our meat came and our waitress explained that the sauces on the table were a spicy habanero sauce, a more traditional BBQ sauce, and a vinegary sauce (she described them MUCH better and gave specific ingredients in each.)  Right off the bat my husband was disappointed that you do not get bread to go with your meat.  That was pretty standard in every BBQ place we've been.  Our brisket was juicy and tender but the fat was very overwhelming.  I understand keeping fat on for flavor and absolutely do not mind a bit of it, but this was A LOT of fat.  The pork shoulder was amazing and my favorite part of the meal.  

The sauces were good, but none were \"i can't get enough... can I drink this?\" good.  My favorite was the spicy habanero which was the perfect level of spice for me but WAY too spicy for my husband (wimp).  It had an awesome burn to it that crept up on me and warmed my whole body up.  A true gem for a heat lover.  

The greens were good, but not memorable.  I thought the cornbread was very good but was too sweet for my husband.  

I can't wait to go back to try the fried chicken.  The couple next to us got it and it looked delicious.  Also I'd love to try their mac n cheese... well... because I'd like to eat all of the mac n cheese on the planet.  

You can definitely find best BBQ in Pittsburgh at Union Pig and Chicken.  We had a high quality meal for a very reasonable price, but it just fell short in a few areas where we had high expectations."}
{"text":"The real deal. 
Hands down best barbecue I've ever had and I'm from the south.  Mouth-melting brisket, cornbread and heirloom tomato salad.  Casual and laid-back, yet clean and eclectic venue.  Friendly staff, reasonable prices and portions.  Just a real swell place.  WHEN WILL I BE BACK?"}
{"text":"Happened to drive by and decided to eat there and needless to say it was amazing. The brisket was melt in your mouth deliciousness and the mac and cheese was gone shortly after I got it! I was a little upset with my cornbread, it was a bit to dry, but other than that it was great!

It was also very nice having a server that didn't have to constantly ask the chefs questions. He knew the menu very well and he was quite friendly!  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst service I had in a restaurant. Food was good but we had to call the waiter's attention several times and we checked on our food not once, but three times. Then my food came on the same plate as my boyfriend's. I understand being new at the job, which this kid was, but he shouldn't be bartending and waiting on people. He then told us, even though it was obvious our group was of several people, that you could only split the check into two and how groupon wouldn't work (which we told him we had at the beginning) because of the drinks we had. Luckily they were taken off the check but he just ended up confusing us further. I got this groupon as a nice surprise for my boyfriend as a home away from home gift. It ended up being the home you'd leave and never go back too gift."}
{"text":"People need to know what to order here in order to get the 4 star experience! I am giving it a 4 star to help increase its reviews just so hopefully at least more people will give it a chance.

Here's a few tips based on my experience there:
1) PORK SHOULDERS - It's totallly delicious, a MUST order! However, it can become too much after a while, but regardless, ORDER IT!
2) Corn bread - Probably the most unhealthy cornbread I've ever had, but after eating a few bites, I couldn't stop!!! It's so buttery and delicious, tasted almost like a shortbread cookie, but it's cornbread!
3) Mac n' Cheese - Good for a side. Nothing too special, but it's still pretty decent mac n' cheese. Especially if you pair it with the pork shoulder. 
4) DO NOT Order Ribs - Totally dry and hard to chew. I can see why people give this place a 3 star.
5) BECAREFUL with Fried Chicken - I would think it through before I order Fried chicken....some parts were tasty, but other parts (especially center of the chicken breast) are just like eating rubber.

Another thing I really like about this place is the upstairs level. It's got a bar and a few tables which gave a more cozy feel. Downstairs is very open with long benches. If you are going with a few friends, I would suggest upstairs. But anything more than 4, just stay down. 

Would I come back again? Yes, when I am craving for some good Pork Shoulder with Mac n' Cheese or wanting a really yummie cornbread!!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I came here really excited to try the cocktails. I was quite disappointed though. The ambiance is a little strange- it is a small bar and it can feel cramped. There was also a strange crowd when I was there. The service can be a little slow, although when our waitress did interact with us she was very friendly and helpful. The cocktails looked really great on the menu but were a let down when ordered."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to satisfy the BBQ gods in my stomach.  The atmosphere was a little intimidating - open floor plan, community tables, and no service staff in sight.  The menu is pretty sparse and unconventional for your average BBQ joint. I went with the pork sandwich (thinking it would be pulled pork) and had an awkward moment when the waitress asked if I wanted mustard, mayo, and onions (huh?). She explained it was cubed pork, but very soft.

By this time I'm nervous.

This BBQ sandwich was well-seasoned, good smoke flavor, and such a succulent texture.  In fact, the balance between flavor and texture was so outrageous that it was a shame to put sauce on such incredible meat.  But I did anyway because the BBQ gods needed a sacrifice.  And it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I had the brisket and Mac n cheese. Both were great. This is the best Mac n cheese that I've ever had. It was baked and had a crispy burnt layer of cheese on top which I loved. Was a little sad that there was not an option for baked beans as a side. Also I ordered the Jack's hard cider - I would highly advise against it because it tastes like dog food and the after taste is even worse."}
{"text":"I took my pops here for his birthday.  I got a half of ribs, a half of chicken (dark meat), greens, and baked beans.  The ribs were real tasty.  I was somewhat surprised given the reviews seemed to favor the chicken.  One negative was that I only got three bones.  The fried chicken was tender and juicy, but was not extraordinary.  I've had far worse, but I have had better.  The greens were delicious....top notch.  The baked beans were also solid.  I was still hungry so I decided to get some wings.  They were chewy and not crispy the way I like it.  These were definitely the worst part of the meal. I topped the meal off with a peanut butter pudding type dish that burst with peanut butter flavor (good thing).   The portions are tiny, but tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and sadly each time had been worse than the last. I went last night, for the last time, because I had a groupon. We ordered BBQ chicken, ribs, greens, cornbread and wings. The BBQ chicken and ribs were both burned and very dry. I left more than half of the ribs. The greens were soggy, salty, very vinegary, and went largely uneaten, as well. The cornbread seems to be made with oil, so much that when I cut a bite off with my fork oil seeped out at the bottom and sides. 

However, our server was nice and attentive and my drink was good (pera mula). Alas, three strikes is enough. I'm going to look
Elsewhere for BBQ."}
{"text":"I thought the meat was outstanding. my rib meat was falling off the bone. the only issue I had was that there was only one veggie side offered, greens. it would have been nice if something like a salad, green beans, or corn was offered."}
{"text":"We visited Union Pig & Chicken during our trip to visit home (from the south).  We decided to check out some of the new BBQ places in Pittsburgh.  The four of us split several dishes to see what this place has to offer - including 2 brisket sandwiches as we are all brisket enthusiasts. Unfortunately the food was a mixed bag of disappointments.  The cubed pork sandwich was mediocre, awkwardly arranged, and without much flavor.  The fried chicken and mac and cheese were adequate, but not amazing.
The thing that made this a regrettable experience was that their brisket has a preposterous meat to fat ratio.  While we all understand that fat on brisket certainly enhances the flavor, and is regularly served as slabs of meat with a layer of fat attached; one of our sandwiches was literally slabs of squishy, translucent, yellow fat with one thin string of meat.  We're talking a 90:10 fat to meat ratio. I regret not taking a picture to show that this is not an exaggeration. The other brisket sandwich was also fairly fatty, but was reasonable and what meat was on it was very tasty. Someone in the kitchen was obviously careless when plating the food that day. When it was brought to the attention of the staff that we had received an inedible sandwich, it was explained in a condescending manner that this is how brisket is supposed to be prepared and served.  This interaction was made even worse by being cut off mid sentence by the server when one of us tried to explain that we understand that fat is part of brisket, but that we were talking about a pile of 2x3\" slabs of fat with no meat on them.  He actually snapped \"Let me finish\". It was obviously a canned response to a common complaint there. We didn't bother to get his name, but you might recognize him by his obvious self-disdain for being a waiter. The staff made no attempts to rectify the situation of having served an inedible sandwich, but they were at least horrible about it when it was brought to their attention.  If you are looking for good BBQ in the burgh, we'd encourage you to try Smoke or Yinzburgh.  The food, presentation, and service were all better at these places.  
Although we could not recommend Union Pig & Chicken to anyone, they did at least have clean bathrooms and the coleslaw was well done. They do apparently have a 50% brisket sandwich success rating, so you might even get lucky when you order. We did not."}
{"text":"Delicious food, brought to the table extremely quickly. Seating is family-style (as is the food), so it may be awkward and uncomfortable to eat in if it's a busy night. Atmosphere is overall pleasing. Good place for a group of people or a date."}
{"text":"Probably he beat fried chicken I've had in Pittsburgh thus far. It was so crispy and juicy and I don't even like chicken usually. The ribs were okay, definitely tasty but not as fall off the bone as I would have liked. Also wish there were more sauces but it was good. The collards were so good especially with the chili vinegar, and the Mac and cheese was rich and yummy. Only thing that was disappointing was the cornbread, it was too dense, not fluffy and the sweet taste of corn was not apparent to me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the barbeque chicken, it was so salty and over seasoned I could barely eat it.The sides were delicious and the service was good. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"There was nothing I disliked about this place. The sangria was half off, the fried chicken was outstanding, the brisket perfectly tender, the pork squares incredible, coleslaw, Mac and cheese, and heirloom tomato salad. I have not one complaint. Our server was sassy and fabulous and guided us through the menu and never steered us wrong. To top it off the banana infused Jameson (and I'm not a whiskey fan) was outstanding. It was like drinking Bananas foster. Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Each time I've been here I went to play bingo. The bingo is AMAZING. They have cool themes, drink specials, and random prizes when you win. Each win requires you to answer trivia questions correctly in order to receive a prize. Prizes include gift certificates for your next visit OR other valuable prizes like dollar store chip clips :) 
The guy who runs bingo is entertaining and really likable, unless you get offended easily or act like a jerk (don't use your phone during bingo unless you want it taken away). 
I've had the mac and cheese and cornbread and both were REALLY REALLY good. Like, ridiculously good mac and cheese. Mac and cheese that tastes like magic was sprinkled in...
If you like bar trivia combined with bingo combined with good food combined with an entertaining and charming host, head to bingo nights at Union Pig and Chicken."}
{"text":"Harvard & Highland is one of those places that I absolutely love when it's empty, and absolutely hate when it's full.  It's officially a tale of two bars...

1.  Empty:  Expect fantastic service, great conversations with the wait staff and bartenders and a great laid back environment that screams unwind and relax.

2.  Full: Expect spotty service at best,  having to yell over those around you and unless you're there to go all out on booze, an experience with a lot to be desired.

To Harvard's credit, it has a great happy hour, there is literally no distinction between it and its downstairs partner in crime Union Pig and Chicken and it brings a great concept to a part of town that desperately needs it.  Grabbing a despicably good BBQ sandwich and a craft cocktail during better times should be a sin.

I'll by far continue to go, but when I do, I do so with open eyes that  I have no idea what to expect!"}
{"text":"Although barbecue in the northern part of these United States is still hit or miss, I tried Union Pig on the advice of my husband, who went here without me (!) on his first visit. He is knowledgeable on the topic of barbecue, and even pickier than I am, and he deemed it worthy of another visit. Together we write a barbecue blog and spend some of the winter months in the southeastern U.S., always on the hunt for both the latest barbecue and long standing local favorites. So while we're not exactly experts on the subject, we've gnawed our way through many a rack of ribs.  And I have to say, after sampling the offerings here, that it's pretty darn good. The ribs especially were satisfying... tender, meaty and well smoked, with a nice rub and a sauce served on the side that complements the meat very well. We also shared some of the pork, which I hesitate to describe as pulled or chopped, as it's prepared in larger than bite sized cubes. This was a little weird to me, as I've never in my travels seen pork shoulder done this way, but it was good, so I'm not going to complain too much. The collard greens were nicely prepared, if a tad bit spicy...that's another thing I have a hard time getting over; Southerners don't really do spicy when it comes to barbecue, either the meat or the sides, so I find it off putting. But I'm splitting hairs here, as the greens were good. All in all, Union Pig is good eats, and I think we have another visit planned for later in the week. I will agree with the other folks here who were a bit shocked at the prices. This is the most I've ever spent on barbecue. Maybe if they had a little more competition for smoked meats of this quality in the area...who knows?"}
{"text":"I decided to use a classmate happy hour as an excuse to try this place out. The space is very cool, with the hardwood, large windows, and red chairs. Totally Modern. The cocktail list looked really great, and the ingredients were all of the highest quality. He drinks a whiskey drink, and a cider drink (oh wait, thats a terrible chumbawamba song). I had a whiskey drink (with my new mistress, Rye) \"A common plot of land\".  It was decent, somewhat reminiscent of a Manhattan. Feel there could have been more of a bouquet of flavors. The gin special was nice. Good times had by all.

I love the environment and I am eager to try out all the libations on the menu. I would say its best to stop by for a few cocktails for happy hour or before dinner."}
{"text":"Not worth my TIME! Just sat there waited for our order for 45 mins. Then the waiter come and informs us it will take at least another 20 mins for our order to be made. He said it was because of a big party upstairs, but there wasn't a big party upstairs and the first floor had two other tables. Guess we are not worth their time to serve. Asked to speak to the manager. The manager looked at us from the kitchen and didn't even bother to come out. They need to get their act together. We entered the restaurant at 2pm. Ended up being informed at 3pm. All the said was \"sorry\". Who in their right minds would come here........"}
{"text":"See Rachel C's review which kind of hits the nail on the head.  

I came with friends on a Friday night around 7.  Was told 30-45 minutes for a table, which turned out to be more like 15 minutes.  Meanwhile a waitress stopped by and took drink orders while we waited -- nice touch!

One thing struck me upon entry:  Why are we in the middle of East Liberty and there are only two...umm....non-White people in the whole establishment?  I'm just sayin, the clientele doesn't at all match the neighborhood.  And this is my neighborhood.  I was skeptical.

The potential answer?  The price.  All sides are a la carte at around $3-$5....and that includes a slice of cornbread.   You're gonna pay for your entree ($10-$22) plus a side or two ($5) plus a drink ($9 for a whiskey lemonade).  Not exactly a cheap meal for Pittsburgh.

THAT SAID....I wanted to bad mouth this place.  But the food made up for it.  The ribs were PERFECT.  The fried chicken?  The best we've ever had in Pittsburgh.  The brisket was amazing.

Bottom line:  We'll be back.  Hell, maybe tomorrow.  Except we left with enough leftovers that lunch is already taken care of."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with this place.  It's sort of hit and miss.  The first time I was there, I wasn't impressed.   The second time they had changed the menu and I really liked it.  Pork belly lettuce wraps were amazing.   The last time I was there, the menu changed again, but for the worse IMO.  The consistent aspect is that it's expensive.  $6 for 2 rib bones is pretty ridiculous.  And they're not even that great.  Salty, dry, and a mediocre amount of meat.  They come unsauced, but the issue is that they don't provide a good sauce to use.  I can make a better sauce than they have.  Other items include:

Mac and Cheese: Good and packs a kick, but too much wasabi.

Wings: Undercooked!   Grilled wings can be awesome, but these were underdone.  If the fat hasn't rendered out of the skin, they're not done yet!

Brisket: One of the best items on the menu.  But you don't get much.

Pork: Very tasty, and in cubes rather than pulled/shredded/chopped.

Fried chicken: Good, but pretty nondescript.  It's fried chicken.  Nothing more, nothing less.

BBQ chicken: Pretty good, but dry.

Venue-wise, it's a box that amplifies sound.  If it's busy, it'll be loud.  Upstairs at Harvard & Highland is pretty cool, though.   Beer is expensive unless there's a special.  Coctails are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Food is excellent and the service is personable.

They feature meats, as you might expect, but there is a lot more to the menu.  They have some interesting sides, like Rice & Beans (with cilantro/pesto on it), Chili, Mac-n-Cheese, and Carrot Salad with red cabbage - it tastes kind of like cole slaw and is crispy and good.

I had Meaty Mac-n-Cheese (mac/cheese with some brisket and pork mixed in) and it did not disappoint.  This is proper, baked mac & cheese, and the mix of meats was just right.  The vegan version has blue cheese chunks and roasted tomatoes.  I will try that next time.

They have a pulled chicken sandwich and a chopped pork-shoulder sandwich, the latter comprised of really large cubes of pork.  (My colleague had to cut it up more before trying to eat it.)

The setting is minimalist, with community-style tables and two-person benches.  They were playing this great, weird music that sounded like a Doctor Who soundtrack from 1982.  Loved it.

One thing they need to improve is the cold air that rushes in the front door each time a patron enters or leaves.  This is a fairly small space, so everyone sits pretty close to the door.  They have hung some heavy curtains, but they don't help much.  I hope they are planning to build some hard walls there.

This is almost a 5-star spot, but service was pretty slow (well, the food was slow to arrive - the server was great) and one item was incorrectly prepared and had to go back.  Overall, though, the food is so good, you have to try it!  Let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this isn't really my style of food. I'm not a big meat eater generally, and coleslaw, mashed potatoes, etc. are not my favorite side dishes. 

Given my predisposition against such food, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste. I sampled many of the dishes including chicken prepared in two different ways, brisket, pork, coleslaw, cornbread, potatoes, vegetables, and hot sauces. Everything was good!

I personally won't be running back, but if you're into this style of food, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"It seems the excitement is over when it comes to Union Pig and Chicken.  At least for me.  I went back with a friend, looking forward to a repeat of the meal I enjoyed the first time.  We were underwhelmed.  I think she thought I was kidding when I enthusiastically described the meal I had the first time.  It started when we ended up being the only patrons after I told my friend that it might be crowded and there might be a wait.  Service was attentive at least since we were the only ones there.  But the quality of the food didn't live up to my original hype.  It didn't seem fresh and everything tasted too salty.  For my experience this last time around they lose a couple stars from my original review.  I can't see going back with so many other \"superior\" options around.  Sorry, Kevin, we're going to have to take a break."}
{"text":"This place is divine. Much better than the multiple plates of BBQ I've had in Texas, and that's saying something! The brisket is so tender it falls apart, and the BBQ whole chicken is perfectly juicy and brown on the outside. The cornbread is yummy, and the greens have a nice little tang to them. You can now order cocktails from their upstairs bar in the downstairs restaurant, and I had one with rye whiskey and smoked Earl Grey. It was amazing to say the least. I can't wait to come back here many more times in the future."}
{"text":"We ordered a fried chicken and a half for 4 adults, and it was a good amount. 
They said the sides are single serving sizes so we ordered several, but when the food arrived the sides were large enough to easily split between 2 people. 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing meal here last night.  I've always been a fan of Union Pig since it opened, but I have noticed changes since the new ownership, and I have to reconsider my loyalty here.  

I ordered the 1/2 BBQ Chicken, and it was unpleasantly dry.  In the past, it's been delightfully juicy, but this was difficult to eat.

The kitchen messed up on our order, they brought meatloaf instead of vegetarian tofu.  Not good.  Although they did eventually make it right.  

My greens and mac and cheese were still very good, and our server was excellent, however I'm having a difficult time recommending this place anymore.

The back room was packed for Adventure Bingo, and that's still a cool and unique draw."}
{"text":"The liquid smoke is strong with this one. 

Had to check this place out after hearing people rave about it.

The good:
Friendly host and excellent wait service. Sweet and cordial without being cloying. Matter of fact and unapologetic about the missing menu items which leads to the bad.

The bad:
No ribs at a BBQ joint? Uhhhh ok.
No cornbread? Ouch
No daily pudding? Oh hell no! 
The Mac and cheese was bland and had a slightly gritty texture.
The green beans were just cleverly disguised bowls of vinegar. 
The cookies were okay, but 3 cookies and a tiny cup of milk for $4 just makes you want to say forget it and grab a bag of Oreos and a half gallon of 2% for more satisfaction. 

The ugly:

Ordered wings to go for my spouse, who was sick at home. Poor thing said the wings were awful. I had one and it just tastes like liquid smoke. No meaty flavor or anything, just pure chemical nastiness.  Oh and the bottomless cup of coffee just sat empty for 45 minutes, I didn't receive a single refill. 

Final verdict:
Great restaurant if you don't like eating."}
{"text":"I heard from a friend that this place was the best BBQ joint in the burgh- so of course, I had to try it. When I looked at the menu online I noticed how insanely expensive everything was so I waited it out.. And what do you know? They went on groupon! Woo! 

We came here around 8pm on a Thursday night, the place was not very busy. The have four rather long picnic style tables that fill the dinning area on the first floor- pretty awesome and set the mood for some BBQ. There were also minimal decorations and no tv in sight- which I loved, the boyfriend did not. There was a party going on upstairs and the staff seemed pretty busy running up and down the stairs. 

We were served water and it took about eight minutes before a server came to the table. I ordered the heirloom tomato salad, coleslaw, Mac and cheese and half a rack of ribs. The boyfriend got baked beans, potato salad and their brisket sandwich. We waited 30 minutes for the food. Having said that- they seemed very busy with the upstairs party and short staffed. 

The food was delicious! I loved the coleslaw- slightly vinegary but with just the right amount of sweetness and there were little red onions in it (I love red onions). 

The Mac and cheese wasn't anything spectacular but it was pretty awesome as well- cheesy gooey goodness! 

The heirloom tomato salad was pretty good- cucumbers, fresh herbs, red onions and yellow, green and red heirlooms.. Nothing special but refreshing amongst all of the starches and fatty foods that were in front of me haha. 
The ribs had a crust on them like I have never seen before- which I loved.. But they did not fall apart in the way that I had hoped they would. My boyfriend said they were the best ribs he has ever had- I think they were average (especially after experiencing cowboy BBQ at rib fest this past weekend). 

The baked beans were very different. I honestly can't decide if I love them or not. They had such a unique smoky type flavor that I never had in baked beans before. Again, the boyfriend said they were the best baked beans he has ever had. 

The potato salad was good- mustard based with small scallions and dill. Nothing super crazy. 

The beef brisket sandwich was amazing- mustard, red onions and brisket- but that's all that was necessary. My boyfriend added coleslaw to the sandwich which was super tasty too! 

Overall, minus one star for the overpriced menu ($27 for $40 worth of food- the groupon was the way to go)! And minus one star for the longer wait for food. It was absolutely not the staffs fault - they were running around like crazy (the staff was awesome and very friendly). Despite not receiving 5 stars I would still return- with maybe more people to split the food. We didn't finish any of the sides and definitely  could have split them with more people. Overall- good experience :)."}
{"text":"Food was good, but definitely not the best, and definitely not worth their prices. Atmosphere looked nice, but there was not one single customer in the place. I'm curious why they charge so much."}
{"text":"Was there for a CMU class gift event and my first visit to the restaurant.

The food was served buffet style in the upstairs room; a selection of my favorite of comfort foods. The mac and cheese and by far the Pork was delectable; the wings had a good sauce however the chicken wings actually selected were towards the chewy side. [This is me personally - I prefer crispier]

The atmosphere is great, slightly colder, however it is January. The beer selection I was given was great however the long island afterwards was much more pricey than I had anticipated."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review because I've worked in restaurants before, but this place definitely deserves one.  Maybe we should've seen the red flags when there were only 5 other tables on a Friday night but we gave it a shot.  The place looks great with a southern traditional downstairs and a more modern upstairs.  We sat upstairs since the downstairs was completely empty.  The food was very good for the most part.  We both had pulled pork sandwiches which were very good.  The mac and cheese was above average as well.  Our meal was ruined by the service.  We never interacted with our server after between the time ordered when we paid. No offer of a second round of drinks, no check back after our meals were delivered.  We eventually had to flag her down for the check, which is hard to imagine in such an empty restaurant.  In a town with so many great restaurants, there's no need to waste your time in one that can't wait for you to leave."}
{"text":"Best smoked wings we've ever had. Great service, food, & libations. Well worth the 300 mile drive!!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. I like the atmosphere, the staff, and the food. When I want BBQ, this is usually where I go. It's a nice balance between classy, hip, and yummy. If I had to describe Union in one word it would be \"umami \"."}
{"text":"Downstairs...long communal tables, paper tablecloths...who would guess that upstairs is this gem of a bar, with the same wonderful barbecue, better service, and a nice classy modern vibe?

The food is excellent, I mean...Kevin Souza, barbecue, the best fried chicken in the city....what more could you ask for?  The bar is great...very friendly and VERY knowledgeable bartenders, good beers, and a whiskey list which, while it is far from the longest in the city, might be the most interesting. (High West Campfire...you can thank me later)...I mean, where else will you find French whiskey? Indian whiskey?  English whiskey?

They are now hosting comedy shows certain evenings...find out when the next one is, you won't be sorry.

Give this place a try...you'll like it."}
{"text":"YUM. This place is the best southern bbq spot I've been to in PA. Everything is good, really. But my two favorite meats are the pulled pork, whihch comes in ike rectangles not like shredded, and the brisket is to DIEEE for. So good. Paired with mac n cheese and corn bread and thats a damn good meal. Also deals are often on Groupon which makes this spot even better!"}
{"text":"BBQ and Pittsburgh are usually contradictory words. The brisket here changes that. However, in true Pittsburgh style the BBQ sauce was too much like ketchup, make that cumin flavored ketchup. The \"Carolina Style,\" (North Carolina), vinegar however, was great. 

So, where's the South Carolina mustard sauce?

Having grown-up on BBQ, I thought the price point was a little steep to make you pay extra for the rolls. I didn't mind paying for the sides of mac 'n cheese, and the greens - which are cooked with a lot bacon and vinegar, just the way they should be - but a la carte rolls are something I can't agree to indulge in. Come on, I need something to sop with!

Also, if you are one to imbibe, and I'm guessing you are, a good rye whiskey from their selection makes a fine compliment to the meat and vinegar.  

A great meal and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"An update is in order, since I ordered take out from UP&C yesterday after a Yelp event.  I ordered the following items: Pork shoulder sandwich ($12) and mac and cheese ($4), which I took home and consumed shortly after the event.  In addition to these items, my take out bag included condiment sized containers of both of their BBQ sauces (tomato and vinegar based).  My order took only about 10 min. to prepare. By the time I arrived home, about 30-45 min. after receiving it, the items weren't as warm as I'd like, but a quick stint in the toaster oven/microwave solved this problem in short order.

Consistent with my last visit over a year ago, the flavors were bold and delicious, delivering mouthwatering bliss.  The pork, which comes in chunk form rather than the usual pulled variety, was tender and savory, and both the whole grain mustard that coated the meat and the BBQ sauces, which I added, upped the ante to a whole new level.  The sandwich stayed together well despite the application of all of these sauces, which was no doubt due to the substantial, chewy bread enveloping it.  My one criticism was that I felt that more pork should have been included for the price, given that the going rate for a sandwich in PGH is $7-$8.

As for the mac and cheese, it was just as good as I recalled.  The cheese was incredibly creamy, with the perfect amount of stretchiness (due to the use of mozzarella, I'm guessing) adding some textural interest.  The flavor, like that of the sandwich, was mouthwatering, and the cheese:noodle ratio was perfect.  Because I was at home, I added some bread crumbs, which further enhanced its flavor and texture, taking it to the next level.  Without a doubt, this is still one of the top mac and cheeses in PGH (revised score: 8.5/10).

Although the flavors of these items were excellent, I'm sticking with my former rating of 4 stars due to the cost (total check, w/ tax and tip: $18.10), which I feel is quite pricey for BBQ.  Even so, I stand by my former assessment that UP&C offers great fusion BBQ, despite the departure of their former owner (Kevin Sousa), a local celebrity chef.  Just go in with an open mind knowing that (1) it's not perfectly authentic BBQ; (2) it's more expensive than BBQ usually is, and you'll be in for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Big time. I'm from Kansas City, Missouri, the HOME and BIRTHPLACE of awesome barbecue. So to hear that Pittsburgh would finally field a good barbecue/Southern foods joint was exciting. And this guy generally does good restaurants. Well perhaps he should have went to KC, Memphis, Richmond, Carolina, and really learned how to do good cue, and good comfort foods. 

First my wife ordered the fried chicken so she'd have some for the lunch the next day, I ordered the brisket. We both ordered mac and cheese, and I went with cornbread and the mrs. with greens. And we passed the other tables and saw the presentations, to die for. Really amazing stuff. That's where our great impression ended. 

First the brisket. When it showed up all I could say was \"???????\" Not only am I a barbecue person by birthright, as a chef I consider myself very good at barbecuing meats. I learned in KC, sure, but lived in DC for 10 years and went to all sorts of amazing shacks in Virginia, NC, SC, MD, and WV. Places that you could smell the hickory from a mile away, paper tablecloths, a pig or two outside, mud parking lots. SO I know good cue.

The brisket - cut so thick it wasn't even funny. The brisket was cut almost a half inch thick, I'm not making this up. It was really that thick. Good smoked brisket is very thin, and falling apart from it's tenderness and smokiness. Neither on this one. Not only was it half inch thick, it looked like it had been seared in a skillet. It had been burnt with sauce on it. Sauce was charred to it, and not in a good way. While it was tender enough to eat, that's the only compliment I'll give it. Smokiness was not prevelant. Not at all. 

Cornbread - cut like a piece of pie, which is fine. It was warm but so hard I could not chew it. I handed it to the server and told her, I can TELL this was microwaved. There is no other way the lower half of slice would be warm and soft, and upper half hot and so hard you couldnt chew. Microwaved cornbread, really? Mac and cheese was cheesy, saucy, and overall good mac. The fried chicken was okay. Not great, not bad. The seasoning they were using made it a touch salty, not sure. Definitely on the soggy side. 

Not sure I'll go back. Smoking meat can be challenging, no doubt. But cutting it wrong, searing it wrong, ( searing it at all?? It's barbecue brisket!! ) microwaving cornbread, really? I have cornbread on my menu, I don't microwave it. We throw it in the oven for 60 seconds and let it sit near steamtable to keep it warm. NOT HARD GUYS."}
{"text":"The lack of concept and decor kind of bummed me out as the space felt cavernous and cold.

Drinks were good, but not like \"omg this is so good you have to try this.\"

The adirondack chair area was... interesting."}
{"text":"First thing, the fried chicken is amazing. It is so amazing, it is the only main dish I've ever ordered. The sides are very good, but the fried chicken is where it is at. Just amazing. The sauces they include definitely complement the meal.

I typically go here early or get take out. The place gets busy and loud.

While dining in, I've found the cocktails to be excellent.  I like balanced cocktails and they seem to do a good job. Not too sweet, not too boozy.

The long shared tables are a nice touch. I enjoy the opportunity to potentially meet new people."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a half pound of brisket that looked like a small portion on the plate, but he said it was very filling. We also got the regular mac and cheese and the meat mac n cheese. Both were cheesy, creamy and were served to us nice and hot. I shared some of the fried chicken with a friend and it was probably the best fried chicken I've ever had and the half a bird was a much larger portion than I expected. Another friend ordered the tofu and I got to have a bite. I was kind of surprised to see that it was just plain tofu with seasoning, no fancy prep or cooking. However, the seasoning was very good so its not a bad option if you don't eat meat."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and the food and the service was wonderful.  The place was busy but our server was very attentive.  My only negative comment would be how the portions are presented.  They are presented in pounds.  So 1/2 pound serving of ribs was 2 ribs.  The 1/2 pound serving of brisket was two slices.  So, if you go there hungry look for the larger portions. They also have a good selection of craft beers and very unusual cocktails."}
{"text":"It's been a year since we've last stopped in UP&C, and I vowed last night to not allow so much time to pass before our next visit.

They've added smoked (not fried) wings to the menu, and both types we got (BBQ and Habanero) were smoky crisp and incredibly flavorful.  We also got Beef Brisket, and it seemed better than ever - tender and exploding with flavor. 

Of course their Mac and Cheese is incredible, and we also thought the Greens with Bacon were a great side as well.

We will definitely be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"I know Kevin Sousa doesn't like food critics. I know a few people on staff here. I really adore one of them and she'll probably strangle me next time I walk in for writing this. She should know I'll come back in spite of all these things. And that she's nice. She's super nice.

I think the concept is good. It's all so close to being great. It's great that Pittsburgh is even trying to do this sort of thing. 

I hear the furniture, sparse and minimalist as it is, was crafted by a local guy who's pretty great at what he does. I don't think the layout works. The benches aren't quite comfortable, you can hear everything everybody else is saying, and it just feels too open and empty. I feel exposed, especially in the Adirondack chairs.

I don't feel like I can comfortably chat up the people around me either, my typical tack when sauced or in Pittsburgh and especially when sauced in Pittsburgh. Because the vibe lacks warmth. 

I don't get a sense they were going for warmth, but I still think there could be a little more warmth. Maybe that'd be resolved by a crowd in the joint. I've never seen more than a handful of people in H&H on any given night of the three I've been there.

On the bright side, this openness gives you a stellar bird's-eye view of East Liberty. Above street level, with the Home Depot-facing windows as large as they are, it feels like you're inside a diving bell in the Great Gentrification Sea. You expect to look over and see Jacques Cousteau and Richard Florida toasting artisinal martinis.

The cocktails are decent but not quite masterful. I'm used to living in the epicenter of the Brooklynification of America, Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood, and I've some snooty expectations of what a cocktail should be and do. At H&H they're potent though the balances aren't quite right. I'd recommend sticking to the more simple things like straight whiskey or gin and tonics. 

I'm not a fan of the Wigle whiskey and gin products which seem to be an emphasis on the drinks list. I don't understand why people are going nuts over that stuff. It could be good but tastes like it was rushed to market, sold with the idea of being \"un-aged.\"

No complaints about the service. Our waiter has always been on top of his game."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a pork dinner and a brisket dinner. It was horrible. The pork was 60% fat, the beef was served directly on the metal tray. It was burnt and I did not even know what it was. I hated the flavor of the baked beans and coleslaw. The free water was very good as was the friendly service. It sounds like I am a picky eater but I travel for a living and eat just about anything served but this was beyond awful. 
28.00 for a lunch like this was not fit for a pig. Oh, the corn bread tasted like a box mix."}
{"text":"This was our first time checking this place out, and I'm so glad we finally did!  The brisket and asparagus with smoked sauce were terrific!  Only negative to the evening was being seated at our table without notice given to the server who took care of us (wonderfully once he knew we were there!)  But we did sit for almost a half hour without anyone noticing us.  Will definitely be back for the food!"}
{"text":"Tthis is literally the best food I've ever eaten. Our dinner was spectacular in every way.

We made a reservation for 9pm on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't too crowded but I'm glad we made a reservation regardless. No wait at all. We were seated at the far end of one of their little picnic tables. It was surprisingly intimate for shared tables. Our waitress, Rachel, was fast, lovely, and extremely helpful. She saw how interested we were in the table sauces and brought us a spicy pepper sauce without prompting. 

The food came quickly, and, per Rachel's suggestion, we put the apple vinegar sauce on the Brisket and it melted in my mouth. Not an exaggeration. It was orgasmic. The mac and cheese was creamy with a thick layer of melted cheese on top. The ribs pulled apart with no effort and the habanero sauce gave my mouth a satisfying tingle without burning too intensely. I was left stuffed and happy.

I went here initially because of a groupon, but I will return again and again because the food is soooooo damn good. Plus the friendly staff and cool atmosphere. The best. I wish I could give it 6 out of 5 stars. Or maybe 7. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love brunch after church on Sunday's.  Lucky for us our church is in the East End so we have lots of great choices.  Today we walked past Union Pig and decided to give it a try.  The only downside is the limited menu, but what we ordered was excellent! I had the chicken & waffles and it was the BEST fried chicken I've had ever.  Really crisp and not too greasy.  The waffle was light and crispy at the edges.  It came with a side of Mac n Cheese that could have been the star of the show!  Hubby ordered Steak & Eggs which was brisket and \"dippy eggs\" with a side of potatoes and pickled onions.  It looked great, not that he saved me any!  Brunch for 2 was $29."}
{"text":"I was there because I had a groupon. The service is ok but seriously, the food is not that great and it takes a lot of time to come. I got there for lunch at noon. We ordered two sandwiches with sides. It took 45 minutes to get the sandwiches. Seriously, is it so hard to put some meat over two slices of bread? The sandwich is nothing really fancy or special: just two slices of bread, some mustard and tofu (vegetarian option). Basic, good but nothing to write home about. I would not recommend this place and would rather go in another place around (such as Noodlehead for example, not too far and really good)."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my original review, and thought it was time for an update. The upstairs intimate space at Harvard and Highland is a majorly different ambiance from the downstairs with its communal dining. This is really a matter of preference as to your ideal dining experience.

I went once for brunch, which was tasty. I was a big, big fan of the chicken and waffle, and the brunch crowd was fun. Their coffee is by Zeke's, and comes with free refills which you'll probably need if you're there early enough.

I did also go back with a large group around the holidays. It was a tasty meal, and the smoked chicken was superb, as usual. Pumpkin soup - divine. The menu doesn't change, which is why I am still only giving them 4/5 stars. They do a good thing, and they do it well, but I can't say it's good enough for me to keep returning unless they're able to change it up a bit."}
{"text":"Place looks really nice inside, food wasn't nearly as good. We ordered brisket, half a fried chicken, pork shoulder, and mac&cheese. I got a Mexican Coke for a beverage and it was warm. The brisket was tasty, but was mostly fat. The fried chicken wasn't bad, but was pretty standard. Mac and cheese wasn't my thing either. The pork was the best item we had that night, but it was also pretty fatty. The dry rub and sauce both tasted exactly like McCormick Grill Mates Memphis Dry rub. My girlfriend hated the place, I thought it wasn't bad but we both agreed was definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"To start, second best bbq I've had. Best BBQ goes to Dinosaur.  

Definitely best Mac and Cheese I have had at a restaurant, ever.

Service could be better. Had one water refill, but to be fair, the place was busy. 

I almost want to give a one star for the beer. The beer menu is ok with a couple power hitters on tap; however, its 10 buckaroos for small glass.  Not great for beer enthusiasts.

Charm factor: Adirondack chairs on the second floor next to floor to ceiling windows.  

If only there was a horseshoe pit."}
{"text":"I went last night and the food was good. We had the 3 meat combo: fried chicken, pork shoulder and ribs.  The latter two weren't fatty at all. For sides, we had the warm potato salad and the mac and cheese. I didn't have much of the mac & cheese, but the potato salad was tasty and had bits of bacon in it. While the food was good, the restaurant was cold, a bit dark, and didn't have much of a vibe. We didn't feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Meat, meat, meat!  I haven't had such delicious meat since moving to Pittsburgh in January.   The menu is full of wonderful options, and luckily the waitress was friendly and accommodating to our many questions about portion sizes and flavor.  I ordered the fried chicken, brisket, and pork shoulder.  The shoulder was my favorite, but all had a flavorful dry rub and were cooked to perfection.  

The Meaty Mac and Cheese was as advertised -- meaty -- and cheesy to boot.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.  The waitress offered to alter the recipe (remove the wasabi or blu cheese if I wanted), but i recommend you don't alter a thing!  The other sides I has (cornbread and coleslaw) were only just okay, and could have been from KFC or Costco had I closed my eyes.  i wish I had ordered the red cabbage instead -- next time, since there will definitely be a next time!

Mostly, this restaurant did not receive 5 stars because of the atmosphere.  The downstairs was dark and pretty bland.  The upstairs was a little better with big windows and a bar, but overall just ......"}
{"text":"cool spot.  good bbq.  

went for brunch with a group of friends.  inexpensive bottomless mimosas and excellent food.  simple design of the menu and decor but tastefully done.  The upstairs is big enough that you could easily throw a party."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of southern food, but figured I would give this place a try since I had heard great things about it! I enjoyed the BBQ chicken and the collard greens with bacon, although the greens were a little spicy for me. The chicken was cooked well, very tender and juicy and very very smokey (which I liked). I tried a little bit of my company's food and it was good, but nothing amazing.

The menu was pretty sparse and I didn't really like how everything was ordered separately instead of set meal, save for about 4 items. 

I would recommend this place for bbq family style dining and if you don't mind noise. It was a little too messy and just not my type of food in general."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write.  

I have eaten here twice.  The first time the food was very good.  This second time experience--which has prompted this review--was really not good.

I do not blame the servers in the restaurant, but the kitchen was hopelessly backed up on a Saturday at 2pm.  We arrived at 2 pm, ordered by 2:10, and by 2:55, had not received our food.  This is not an everything made to order multiple courses type place, this is wings, brisket, fried chicken, red beans and rice type of stuff.  They did not start smoking the meats when we ordered.  

We ultimately just took the food to go, not even bothering to get it at the table--not out of pique, but because we had to be somewhere and keeping people waiting is just rude and we were not going to perpetuate the sin.

There is really no excuse for a delay of this type.  I will admit that the place started filling up after we arrived, but that is primarily because all of the other diners had been waiting for so long that everyone just piled up.

At the end of the day, the food once transported home was okay.  Very smoky which was fine, but soggy, cold and frankly its never fun eating BBQ sauce out of little plastic cups.

What a shame."}
{"text":"First, an admission: I'm a vegetarian, and this place is all about food that used to be animals. This means every single entre is - for me - off limits.

But not to fear, my fellow herbivore friends whose spouses eat meat, a pleasing culinary experience awaits. You can eat solely from the sides menu, and leave a full and happy camper.

Check it out: corn bread, potato salad, slaw, mac and cheese. Pick three and enjoy.

Someday, perhaps, maybe they'll offer up some seitan options (like my favorite BBQ, Soul Vegetarian in Chicago). But until then, I can deal with one of the best offerings of Southern-inspired side dishes around."}
{"text":"We had heard so much about this place and how it was a \"must try\" so it was with great expectations that we settled in for a late lunch. The advantage of a \"late\" lunch is that the crowds are gone and you typically have better service! And so it was - good service, table to ourselves, peaceful meal. I love good brisket and was super excited to order theirs - the description with the whole grain mustard and smoked brisket had my mouth watering ahead of time. But first, a beer. The only IPA on tap was Dogfishhead 60 minutes, which I don't like at all. So I made an alternate selection

Brisket sandwich arrived with a side of cole slaw (which was quite good!) and I munched down. Now, while the brisket was incredibly tender (good sign!) I found the portion size to be underwhelming. There should have been more meat on that sandwich. I was looking for that delightful smoky flavor in each bite but, alas, I found none. None. Also looked for those burnt ends or charred pieces hoping to catch a little crunch...Nope, not there either. There was also not a single condiment (like PEPPER!) around. So a bit disappointed I just finished my beer and got my check. My draft beer was $6 which I thought was a bit high. It was a decent lunch and I will probably go back to give it another shot.

The communal bathroom arrangement isn't for everyone and my wife hated it. She had the untimely misfortune to go in after 2 construction workers had been in there. Let's just say they were not the most careful and considerate guys around."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at Union Pig and Chicken after work yesterday evening. We sat upstairs, which in retrospect may have been Union Pig's undoing regarding this review. The noise level was incredibly loud and I'm a recovering metal-head! It's amazing how one cackling patron can affect the meal of everyone having dinner. One suggestion Union Pig... Sound batting. Loud fun atmospheres are great. Obnoxiously loud, that's something entirely different.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fine, a little close perhaps as I thing the air-handlers may have been down. But the view was nice and the dining area pleasant. My wife had some brisket and ribs, while I had ribs. The ribs were seasoned exceptionally and my wife said her dinner was great.  Try the Mac-n-cheese, awesome! Service was pretty good. All in all, I will go back."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with friends...being a bbq joint in Pittsburgh, figure they would have good food.  I ordered the St. Louis 1/2 ribs.  Disappointed the ribs were dry, not enough meat. Drink was on point.  Staff very friendly.  Location not in the best neighborhood, but doable."}
{"text":"My friends and I attended brunch this past Saturday, going in I knew I wanted the chicken and waffles. However, the menu is small, so I would look over it before visiting.
 
The chicken and waffles is bomb. It's served with the best syrup I have ever tasted (it also comes with a smoky gravy, but it was not my cup of tea). The fried chicken is juicy and has the best crispy skin! The waffle is light and the perfect pairing. The Mac and cheese that is served on the side was so cheesy and delicious. They  give you a hefty portion. I took some home. 

If you want something to start skip the fruit cup, it's weak and mostly cantaloupe and honey dew.  

I only gave 4 stars because the service was a bit slow and not actively present. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Union Pig & Chicken has some of the best BBQ that I've found in Pittsburgh. The brisket is soft and falls apart with a fork, although some of the pieces can be overly fatty. Every time I've been the service has been decent, but slow. Union is also a surprsingly good place to go for lunch, The sandwiches they serve are delicious. One last note, definitely get the mac & cheese. It's that good."}
{"text":"Omg! Absolutely love this place! My friend and I tried quite a few things. We had the pulled chicken, ribs, brisket, Mac&cheese, collard greens, yams&mellows! Everything was DELICIOUS! Don't let the picture of the dark ribs fool you! They were REALLY good!!!! I'm super picky with my Mac&cheese and I have to tell you they make THE BEST I've had in a while! Not over cooked and mushy at all!!! 

The only negative is that I wasn't a fan the BBQ sauce on the chicken (I like my sauce a little sweet) but next time I'll definitely get the same thing just minus the sauce. 

They also make a bomb Moscow Mule!! It was a little sweet how I like it! You can definitely taste the spice of the ginger too! 

Our server Kenneth along with Brent were two of the nicest, coolest, (and handsome) guys I've met in Pittsburgh during my visit here!!!  Very attentive and super personable. Amazing servers and genuine people I can tell! I'll definitely come back when I visit Pitts again!!! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I am so confused by the reviews for Union Pig & Chicken.  So so confused.  Maybe when they're crowded this place gets crazy, but my friend and I came in the first time on a Friday for lunch and were the only people by the end of our meal.  We loved it, and we've been back multiple times since!  The bar upstairs' service is soooo slow and practically non-existent.  But the communal tables downstairs usually have great service.

First, our server our first trip made the experience.  I WISH I could remember her name because she was awesome.  She was from Texas, and she had gone to school for art and did some singing.  Girl needs a promotion because she was one of the best servers I've ever had.  We've had one other server who was really cool as well.  Very friendly.

Union Pig & Chicken has a lunch special where you can get one of the sandwiches with a drink and side for the same price as just the sandwich.  Obviously a steal.  I got the Shrimp Po Bo Sandwich ($12), and it was so tasty.  I cannot wait to go have another.  My friend and I split the mac and cheese side ($4) which was fanstastic.  It was super cheesey, and the portion was huge.  I could have eaten just that for a meal and been happy.  We also tried the cornbread ($3) and coleslaw ($4).  My cornbread was crazy buttery and not dry at all, but the piece was really small.  The coleslaw was good but it had onions.  Blergh.  The sweet tea that came with my meal was great too.

The Meaty Mac ($9) is delicious as well.  It was different but delicious.  However, if you take it home, eat it quickly!  The taste keeps getting stronger and stronger as it sits longer.

The atmosphere is weird.  The ground floor is half surrounded by glass windows and half really dark, and there are communal tables.  There is also a bar area upstairs.  The communal tables would be fun with more people around.

My friend and I keep planning to come in and try the drink specials.  The lunch deal is great, and I think it's a steal for the quality of the food.  I think the dinner rates are a bit overpriced, but nowhere is perfect."}
{"text":"A fantastic BBQ destination.  When I first ate here I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the thought which went into the cocktails.  I just went back, about 6 months later I think, and it has grown into one of my favorite spots in PIttsburgh.  Everything we ordered was superb and the new lounge upstairs is really chill.  The brisket is absolutely wild, It's prepared in a big slab fashion I've never eaten before and it was impressive as all get out.  Go to Union Pig & Chicken!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I was slightly disappointed since I had heard such great things and the menu looked so great! They were out of poutine and meatloaf but that didn't really affect what we were going to order (though poutine sounded pretty good). We arrived at 6 PM on a Friday and it was surprisingly not as busy as I expected. Their happy hour was $1 off beer and half off wings (though the wings were so overpriced to begin with). We ordered the mighty Mac, 6 bbq wings and 1 lb of St. Louis pork ribs. It all looked really small when it came out but afterwards, we were so full. Everything they serve is basically comfort food so if you're looking for nice picnic / staple American  food with a slightly urban experience, come here."}
{"text":"Ok, who actually knows the south & barbecue?  I lived in Texas and can tell you honestly that this food is average at best.  Small portions, questionable sauces, high prices and by far, by FAR the slowest service I've had.  This is fried chicken and barbecue... No reason it should take 20+ minutes from your order to getting your food.  Save your TIME and money... Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"To put it bluntly... Overrated.  We decided to finally go here yesterday and get a nice sampling of what they have to offer.  

First of all, I knew it was communal searing, but the fact that it was so tight, and I had a screaming child next to me made it worse.  There were a few other seats available yet for some reason, he put us there.  The decor/design of this place makes this even more difficult as you cannot hear the person that is across from you.  

The food was meh... I will admit, the concept is a good one, but I did not like the bbq sauce at all (I would have been happier with Sweet Baby Rays) and the meats were not anything to write home about.  My husband had gotten the 3 meat combo... the only thing that was worth having was the brisket.  I had gotten the chicken... again, nothing to write home about.  Mac and Cheese was good... Potato salad was not (again, just my opinions).  The fact that we spent $45 on this (that includes a Mexican Coke which was the best part of my meal) made it not worth it even more so.

I understand that people love this place because of the Kevin Sousa affiliation, however, I am basing my review solely on my experience.  Fact is I have had better and I do not need to be at a hip or trendy place to justify my enjoyment of things.  Clem's out in Blairsville puts this place to shame for people who like quality BBQ, good sauce, and a hearty meal at a good price.  It may be a divey looking barn like wood building with a giant pig in a leather jacket on top of it, but I know that I left there satisfied :) 

Next on my list is Pittsburgh BBQ and Yinzburgh BBQ.... hope my experiences there are better!"}
{"text":"Comfortable minimalist decor with mouthwatering food.  I had the mac and cheese and it was wonderful! My only complaint is that it took longer than expected for the food to come out, but overall I loved it here and would be happy to return again. It's possible that this is actually a five star place but it's hard to judge after a single visit. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I will make it a point to return."}
{"text":"A quick disclaimer: I'm not one to favor barbecue joints, but after reading all of the wonderful reviews, I decided that this place definitely deserved a visit.
The decor is modern and clean, but filled with long tables that favor communal seating and give a picnic bench kind of vibe.  We came on a Thursday night, didn't need reservations, and the restaurant was only half full around 8p (more-so a testament to many not having heard of this place, and not because of the food!)
If you are a fan of Rye (and even if you're not), you MUST try their signature \"Rock and Rye\" drinks, they're absolutely delicious.  The flavors are constantly changing, but we tried a berry/vanilla infused rye and a chocolate infused rye  that were both incredibly smooth and had just the right amount of sweetness.
On to the food.  The portions are very generous! I came with 2 hungry guys; we ordered the combo (ribs, pork, and brisket),an additional half rack of ribs, and 3 sides- and we had PLENTY to take home.  For sides, we ordered the meaty mac (cheesy, meaty goodness, but a bit rich for me), baked beans (sweet, smokey deliciousness, and a nice contrast to the spicy meat and salty greens-my #1 favorite side), and greens (vinegary, salty, and my #2 favorite side).    The pork shoulder and brisket were oK, but the real winner was the ribs--they were fall of the bone, melt in your mouth good!!!! This is definitely a place work trying if you are a fan of barbecue!"}
{"text":"Incredible!  Stopped in for lunch. First visit here. Very simplistic inside- long tables, family style seating. No bar, but they serve alcohol. I had their St Louis style ribs and meaty Mac. My lunch guest had their brisket. Everything was great!  Their ribs were really meaty and the brisket was extremely tender. As for the meaty Mac, I will tell you it was some of the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had!  Tons of cheese and the right amount of pork. Mario was our server and he was super friendly and very informative about the food selections. I would highly recommend this place!!! Providing you love pork and great ribs and brisket and Mac!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with my meal here. I've heard some people rave about their meal, but to me, it was extremely overpriced for very small portions of average BBQ. We ordered a ¼ pound of brisket, ¼ pound of ribs, Meaty Mac & a side of greens. With the tip included, we spent about $40 on an amount of food that turned out to be quite small.

The Meaty Mac was the only thing that came with a generous helping, but extremely disappointing in taste. It said on that menu that this included blue cheese, wasabi, brisket meat and rib meat (we got it without the rib meat since I don't eat pork). I could not taste any wasabi or blue cheese and there was barely any rib meat mixed in. The greens were delicious in flavor, but came out in a serving dish that was the size of a small ramekin. 

My boyfriend said the ribs were delicious and I thought the brisket was pretty good too, but the price is ridiculous for ¼ of meat which turned out to be two small pieces of rib and two small pieces of brisket. The BBQ sauce they have on the table was really good. I prefer the sweet sauces, so it was definitely my kind of flavor.

The service was good and I really liked the communal seating. They seem to have a decent drink menu, with rotating drafts and signature cocktails. Overall, I wasn't too impressed and wouldn't go out of my way to try this again."}
{"text":"The food here, once it arrived, was very good. Well worth the wait, even though the wait was somewhat inexcusable. We got there just behind a large take-out order and waited nearly 30 minutes for food to come up. One wonders why you'd prioritize takeout orders ahead of live customers actually seated in your dining room. I'll gladly eat here again, but if this kind of nonsense happens again I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not good for large groups. They asked us to do family style and we denied yet they brought it out that way anyway. They will only charge max 3 credit cards but the website says otherwise. When the food came out we had to ask what was what...and even tell our waiter to stop cocking an attitude because he was straight out rude when we asked.

We're from Chicago and our pittsburgh friends wanted to take us to the best pittsburgh bbq joint. We were disappointed that this was it."}
{"text":"I love BBQ. So I am always eager to try some new q. I was fairly disappointed. This place has the look and feel of a hipster restaurant but unfortunately it tastes like it to. There is no soul.
We split the 2 meet combo (shoulder & brisket). The shoulder was a small portion that came in a cast iron skillet. The meat was tender but lacked texture or bark, and it was diced into large clocks. The brisket was a mess. I still can't figure out how they sliced it. No visible smoke ring but you really couldn't tell because the place is dark like a cave.  Again lacking texture, and it was tender but super fatty.  I will say that my wife enjoyed the mac n cheese but the corn bread was overly sweet and greasy. The app menu was great we had fried chicken hearts. 

My final issue was our service. Our server acted like our table of ten was bothering her although the place was dead that night.  Bottom line is it is Pittsburg, so I should have lower BBQ standards, but this was really lackluster even for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh definitely needs more bars like Harvard & Highland. Sometimes you want to put down the gin and tonic (while delicious) and pick up something with a creative mix of new and interesting flavors.  With the expertise of a REAL bartender (few and far between in the steel city) you can do that here.

The ambiance is nice-- a large, open space with huge windows (excellent for people watching too) and a variety of seating options.  I went with a large group and we were able to easily adjust the seating... and the huge red lounge chairs were a definite plus!  The best part about walking into this bar is that to get there you enter through Union Pig & Chicken and therefore get to smell all of the delicious smoking meat as you pass through.  Way to make my mouth water before I even set eyes on a cocktail list!

I will be honest, I am no cocktail connoisseur.  At one point while enjoying my first drink and browsing the menu thinking about my second, I actually had to get out my phone and google some of the ingredients just to know what type of liquor was in them!  This place does assume that you know something (or at least more than me, which is not hard) about your spirits. But have no fear- the bartender is super friendly and will answer all your questions-- and I am assuming it doesn't really matter what is in the cocktails anyways because everything was delicious.

I started with one of the drinks from the menu (sort of).  A spiced apple cider with option to add liquor = one of my favorite fall drinks.  I asked the bartender what she normally recommends to add other than rum (not a huge fan).  She said they normally do add rum, but instead she could use a butternut squash-infused bourbon. YUM.  For my second drink, I decided to inquire about one of the specials on the board... I honestly do not remember what all was in it but I know it included some kind of brandy and another liquor mixed with earl grey tea and garnished with a sprig of rosemary.  I wish i paid more attention to what was in it because it was AMAZING.  It was a little bit tart and tangy and not too sweet and extremely refreshing.  

Will definitely be coming back to try out some more... seems like a great place to hide out during the cold winter months!"}
{"text":"The epitome of an inner-city restaurant that got an article or two written on them, has become extremely popular, and yet still cannot get it right. Impersonal staff, bland food, unwarranted prices. Four times too many."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in Pittsburgh. We came because we wanted to try some classic barbecue food and good meat, and maybe have a few cocktails. Well, the bar upstairs is apparently a \"craft cocktail\" bar, which means they refuse to serve standard cocktails. The only cocktails are the ones on their menu, and if you don't like those, you're out of luck. 

As for the food, we tried several different meat dishes (BBQ chicken, ribs, and brisket), and they were all underwhelming to the point of being unappetizing. The smoke flavor was overpowering, and everything was very salty. Even the side of mac and cheese was too salty to enjoy--and how do you ruin mac and cheese?! The cornbread was dry and crumbly. 

Finally, the atmosphere is creepily dark, to the point where I could barely see my food--but maybe the food seems more appetizing if you don't look too closely."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and waited for over 1hr plus and never got any food! So we left!!! The waiter that sat us was all stressed out and not friendly! Will not be back"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago. First, this was my first time walking that side of highland and it was looking pretty nice, I'm impressed! The brunch menu was small, my bf and I ordered the first three items and Mac and cheese (steak skillet, sausage and gravy and the veggie frittata). The food was amazing. We devoured everything in twenty minutes. The coffee was from zeke's so that's always a plus anywhere I go. The only major complaint I can give is the service.. The waitress practically ignored us, even with our empty water glasses on the edge of the table. You can't give someone hot sauce (which was bomb in house made) and not check on my water! Anyways, I'd like to come back to try dinner sometime still and probably hit up the whisky bar upstairs! You can hate on whisky"}
{"text":"If you haven't been since they opened, I'd recommend giving Union another try. Things have changed a lot, it seems.

Most notably, they now offer combos: for $20 you can get 2 meats, 1 side, and a piece of cornbread OR all three meats (brisket, pork shoulder, ribs). If you decide to substitute chicken for one of your meats, you can do so for $5. The portion sizes have gotten much bigger (I got an order of brisket just to myself, and it literally would have been enough to feed 3-4 people). And praise Jesus, the Kansas City BBQ sauce no longer tastes like straight ketchup. They also now offer a couple creative appetizer options (things such as pork belly wraps and steak tartare) that are very much in the vein of Salt of the Earth, and the mac & cheese and greens are still insanely good. The cocktail list has been vastly expanded, too. My boozy, peachy Arnold Palmer was pretty delicious.

As far as the meats, my favorite is the brisket. Each time I've gotten it, it has been super tender with lots of melty fat, and I love the flavor of the rub. You don't even really need the sauce. The pork shoulder is my second fav, but I was a little let down by the ribs. They have a nice smoky flavor, but were pretty dry and didn't have that fall-off-the-bone quality that makes ribs so great. The ribs are what keeps me from giving Union 5 stars, but otherwise this is a great place for a refined approach to BBQ."}
{"text":"There are plenty of reviews about Union Pig & Chicken so I wont bore you with more of the same. 

I will reiterate what some have said though that this is some of the best BBQ around.  I will also reiterate what a few have said that the pick 2 or pick 3's are definitely enough food for two people. We each got our own and nearly finished it all, but were SOOOO full afterwards that we wished  we had shared. 

We went on a Wednesday night and the place was not crowded, but it was full enough to have others dining on either side of us. Literally everything I tried was good, if not great. 

My only complaints: the cornbread was a lot drier than I prefer and the beer selection is lacking."}
{"text":"I ordered food to-go this past Saturday night.  Over the phone, I was told my order would be ready in twenty minutes- so I sowed up in exactly twenty minutes only to have to wait another fifteen uncomfortable minutes.  Nearly double the wait time.. Not a terrific start, but OK, I get it, it's Saturday night and they are busy.  I'm still not certain if the hostess was \"all business\" or just \"plain rude\"..  Heck, a little communication and even a fake smile could have helped.

Now the food.  I ordered a whole fried chicken, 1/2 pound of brisket and two orders of macaroni and cheese.  The fried chicken was the star of the show, moist, crispy and full of flavor.  The brisket was also very very good, and they even packed all the different sauces to-go, very nice.  Not all kudos however.  The Mac and Cheese was a major disappointment.  Sadly, contrary to others reviews here of the Mac and cheese, this one was bad.  The macaroni were over cooked, very mushy texture.  And the cheese?  Where is it?  Certainly not in this dish.  Despite being yellow in color, there was not enough cheese in this dish to rightly call it macaroni AND cheese.  It was devoid of flavor and mushy- and embarrassment to this classic.  I had better from a box, and I'm not laying on the snark here, it's the truth.

They lost one star for the mediocre to-go service, and another one for the worst Mac and Cheese I've ever had the misfortune to order out.  With a menu as small/limited as UnionPig and Chicken, every item should be excellent.."}
{"text":"Good BBQ for a good price. Had the pork and it was tender and delicious!

Service was quick and pleasant. Communal seating, so don't go thinking you'll have a private table."}
{"text":"We were quite skeptical walking in here--after all, there are several homely, low-key BBQ places in the city where you can see and smell the meat in the smoker as you walk in, so how much better could this rather more upscale joint be for BBQ? Turns out that everything is fancier and more expensive for a reason--all the meats left us speechless. Everything was perfectly smoked, tender, and flavorful. The wings were juicy, the meat fell off the rib bones, and the beef brisket had the right amount of fat. It was probably impossible to choose a favorite. 

Along with the two sides, the smallest portions of all four meats were enough to fill two people up. Probably also because the macs came with meat in them as well. The meaty mac and cheese was pretty good, but it's a good idea to share, since we found it a bit overwhelming to eat the whole thing. As for the chili mac, we didn't intend to get this but it seems that they mistook our order. It was pretty good as well, though it was hard to enjoy two macs fully.

Service wasn't the best--in addition to getting the side wrong, it was a bit of a wait for the food, and water refills took a while as well. We asked our waiter for a refill, and he probably passed by our table several times, once with cocktails for the neighboring table, before doing so. Maybe better luck when it's less busy."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend dining at Union Pig and Chicken. The atmosphere is unbelievable. There is something to say about the community tables that create a community vibe. The service was wonderful and I can't say anything more about how fall off the bone delicious the brisket and shoulder were. The homemade sauces should be sold in a store.

A highlight. I didn't hate the drink I ordered, but it wasn't my favorite. My boyfriend was going to finish the drink because he liked it, and I decided to order something else. Our waiter gave me half off my second drink because as he said, \"it sucks to get something you don't like.\"

5 stars. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had visited this place over a year ago and it was good...not great as far as BBQ goes, but good and a decent atmosphere and always busy.  It used to be impossible to get a table.  The last two times we went at 7:00 PM on a Saturday night and the place wasn't even half full both times, and this most recent visit solidified why.  I'll preface with we had a Groupon (often, but not always, a sign that a restaurant's business is starting to flounder and they might be gone soon, but what the heck, it was a cheap deal, and they're normally expensive).  The service started fine and we quickly got drinks.  We sat down at 7:15, ordered by 7:30 and then waited...for 45 minutes for chicken and sides (there were only two of us).  Tables that had been seated well after we ordered got their food before us, while we continued to wait with no apologies whatsoever from the waitress.  When the food finally came, we asked about the wait and, rather than a simple apology for the time, we got excuses about how slammed they were (um, if that's slammed, less than half full, I hope your restaurant actually never gets busy) and then said sometimes the cooks accidentally cook the checks out of order.  We said usually a manager would at least stop by to check and apologize.  She sent him over, and he came up to us and said \"Can I get you guys any hot sauce or anything?\"  Really?  Hot sauce?  We had a Groupon so we clearly weren't looking for anything to be taken off of our check as it was already paid for, but just an acknowledgement of the excessive wait time would have done wonders to show we were valued as customers.  This manager clearly couldn't care less if we ever came back or not, so we won't.  

The food gets a 2.5 for me...not awful, but VERY one-note (poutine literally just tastes like smoke, might mac tastes just like wasabi, etc....apparently balance is a foreign concept), but the complete lack of regard for us as customers is something that turns people off to a place.  I won't be surprised if this one doesn't stick around much longer.  I don't know what changed in the past year and a half, but it was for the worse."}
{"text":"Ok , As far as BBQ in Pittsburgh , This has become my number 2 place to get GREAT Ribs.

A few friends and myself stopped in the other night for dinner , and we were impressed.

Great St. Louis 1/2 rack , Greens were fresh and very tasty.

They had an \"artist\" doing some painting and we really enjoyed seeing the wall transformed into ART right before our eyes!

They have a great selection of exotic beers . Even though I like rather mundane brews , I was excited to try some of these new beers. Our waitress was fast and very accommodating , she even brought me small samples of the beers.

The Place is a bit on the LOUD side ( very hard to hear each other ) But I guess that's because they have a good following and as much as most people don't use their \"inside\" voices, It was still very enjoyable.

Parking SUCKS. but I'll be back."}
{"text":"First off, this is probably not authentic bbq or whatever. I don't care. It's just delicious, well-cooked meat that's not badly priced when you consider the huge portion sizes. For 2 people, the 2 meats + cornbread + side combo for $20 is a steal. We had more than enough food to get uncomfortably full and still have leftovers to bring home. The pork shoulder was incredibly tender. The mixed cocktails were fantastic - a little pricey ($10 apiece) but super delicious and and interesting and sufficiently strong. 

I also went here when they first opened and found the fried chicken to be really tasty. Wasn't too keen on the greens, but it's been awhile since I sampled then. 

It's possible to spend a lot of money here if everyone in a group orders separate entrees and sides, but if you do that you'll just get a ridiculous amount of food. I suggest just splitting entrees or the combos. You'll still be able to stuff yourself silly without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"We went their on a Groupon early on a Saturday night. They didn't have any ribs. Isn't that sort of the point of the place?There was a vague explanation.  Beyond that --fine."}
{"text":"This was my first time here had a groupon so went w a friend for a birthday dinner. We got a variety of stuff to try some we both never been here we got the ribs, fried chicken, brisket, pork, Mac and cheese, greens, and corn bread.

First of all the sweet tea was good just the way I like it :) as for the food the brisket was a little dry and the rub they used was a bit salty for my taste but it was ok. The ribs were juicy and tasty but again the rub was a little to salty again. The greens were decent more vinegary then what I'm used too. As for the Pork it was delicious I absolutely loved it esp with there vinegar based sauce (don't even bother with the so called BBQ sauce on the table was glorified ketchup and neither of us liked it at all). The Mac and cheese was awesome nice warm and gooey cheese can't go wrong. The corn bread was perfect. But outlet overall fav was the fried chicken we absolutely loved it!! I would go back for that alone maybe the Sunday brunch from 10 to 3 they have chicken and waffles :)"}
{"text":"Excellent southern food. The pork shoulder was super tender, almost falling apart. The mac and cheese is thick and cheesy. The ribs are dry rub ribs. Though I prefer saucy ribs, these still tasted great and were fairly tender. The fried chicken was also pretty good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Less than impressed...the food was hit or miss. Mac and cheese was decent, BBQ chicken was dry, and the cocktail was delicious. The upstairs bar was really crowded and took a LONG time to be served. I loved the concept, but it just didn't completely deliver."}
{"text":"My first time here I was not a huge fan.  The ribs didn't fall off the bone, and it was a bit pricy for BBQ.  My hands did smell like smoke the rest of the night though.

Tonight we went back - gave it another shot with the fried chicken and O.M.G.  Ok, the chicken is much much better.  It was delicious.  

We got the meaty mac - not recommended.  Stick with just regular mac n' cheese.  Something about smoky mac n cheese doesn't sit well with me, and the cheese was extra sharp.  

Still a little bit pricy, but because I actually enjoyed most of the food, I felt better about this trip."}
{"text":"Good BBQ place in Pittsburgh.

Ribs - Juicy, meaty, flavorful, delicious
Pork Shoulder - Little bit tough and dry, didn't really like this one
Brisket - Tender and juicy
Pork Belly - Fatty, salty, goodness
Cornbread - Nice texture, very buttery
Mac and Cheese - Lots of cheese, can't go wrong with ordering this

Inside is a little bit dark and you come out smelling like BBQ but still worth it."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Union Pig and Chicken.  We came back because 6 months ago the food was great.  This trip was very different.  The meaty mac had so much wusabi  in it that it was all you tasted. The brisket looked as if it had been sliced on a slicer then reheated on a griddle because you couldn't see any smoke ring and the color of the interior meat didn't look like a piece of meat cut off a brisket (I live in Texas and know what brisket should look like). There was a lot of fat on the brisket also which is good for flavor but at their prices I would like meat.  On the positive side the coleslaw was very good, along with the ribs."}
{"text":"Harvard and highland serves the same food and drinks as union pig and chicken but it's a nicer atmosphere. There is a small bar where you can sit and watch the bartenders make the delicious drinks. 

I love the H&H sour which has an egg white that makes it so smooth and delicious. Sounds weird but it's so good. Draft selection is limited but I can usually find one that I like. 

Like I said the food is tag same as union. I love the smoked wings! The blue cheese dressing is delicious too. 

My only gripe? The prices are pretty steep and I've had cocktails that weren't great a few times. It all depends on who is working. That's why it's only a 3 star. 

Worth a visit though!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. Very new and trendy. The bbq wings were a little dry, the mighty mac was delicious and my biscuits were pretty good too. They were out of a signature tea on the menu so that was a bit of a disappointment. 

I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good BBQ place near our house. In terms of the food, here's my experience:

Brisket - Great! I'm usually not a beef BBQ fan, but this is my favorite item on the menu. The spice rub is great and adds a nice crust. Very tender and tasty.

Ribs - Good. Overall pretty tasty although sometimes a little bland. Adding one of their sauces helps. Generally cooked to perfect tenderness.

Pork - Okay. It's not exactly pulled pork, and you often get big chunks of fat. I recommend a pass on this item.

Smoked wings - Surprisingly good! Even plain these wings are tasty! Since I can't have the sauces I haven't tried those.

Chicken - Good. My wife loves the chicken. I've had a bite here or there and it is definitely tasty and generally cooked just right, never dried out.

The sides are nothing to write home about. The cornbread does tend to be a little dry even by cornbread standards. The collard greens are my favorite, thanks to the addition of bacon.

The decor is very simple but I think it is a modern take on a traditional BBQ joint. Definitely not a dive but probably not a great date place.

We definitely keep coming back here for the food. Not the best BBQ I ever had, but it is good to have a decent BBQ place close by."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars, I knocked one down for the price.  But hey I get it, upscale BBQ as my friend called it, and that's exactly what it is.  

I ordered the 1/2 BBQ chicken and my friends and I shared a sampling of all the sides.  I expected the BBQ chicken to be slathered in...well BBQ sauce.  But it wasn't, it didn't have any sauce on it and I was a bit concerned, but after taking one bite, I was sold on this no BBQ sauce, BBQ chicken.

The chicken was really moist and had a smoky flavor.  There was BBQ sauce on the table which I used and I enjoyed.  The BBQ sauce was tangy - just how I like it.  The portions for the 1/2 chicken were huge in my opinion.  I took part of it home.

As for the sides, my top three were the baked beans, greens, and mac & cheese (in that order).  I wasn't so fond of the cole slaw - too vinegary in my opinion.  The potato salad was good but I wasn't a fan of the cornbread.  I've had better, the cornbread was a bit too dry for my taste.

For a drink I wanted to order the Tangerine, Thyme, Sage Honey under \"Rock & Rye\" but they didn't have that particular combo available and had some blueberry version of it.  Whoa - talk about powerful!  After the ice melted and diluted what tasted like straight whiskey it was drinkable and not too bad.  Looking back on it, I should've just ordered a beer.  

As for decor - very simple.  Picnic like tables with benches (the benches are divided so it's not one long bench making it less awkward with the strangers sitting next to you in the community style seating)."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and after hearing about this place on Yelp and in local media, I had to check it out.  Unfortunately, it was disappointing from the beginning to the end.  I made a reservation for a group of 11 about two weeks before the dinner.  The day of, I called several hours before to decrease the reservation from 11 people to 7 people.  The girl on the phone was very confused about what I wanted to do and after a long awkward pause and an uncomfortable phone conversation, I felt like MAYBE we had the reservation I wanted.  Upon arrival, we let the hostess know we were there and after clearing up that we were a party of 7 for a 6pm reservation, NOT a party of 6 for a 7pm reservation, we finally had a seat.

The server that greeted our table was friendly and cheerful, but upon request of splitting the check into 3 parties said they were unable to do 3 checks but could accomodate 2 checks.  We requested two checks.  We ordered our food, and after 45 minutes waiting with no bread or any sort of thing to nibble on, our food finally arrived.  It was mediocre at best.  The best item was the fried chicken.  Very flavorful and not dry or overly greasy.  I had the Brisket Sandwich which was very scant with the meat and very overbearing with the bread.  The piece of brisket was about the size of an extra thick piece of bacon plus a few milimeters served on a huge, bready hoagie roll.  The bread was all you could taste and the meat was totally lost.  Even after taking the sliver of meat off the bun and eating it, with both of the sauces available on the table, I was less than impressed.  The strength of a BBQ place is in its meats and if you slack in the meat department, no matter how good your Mac and Cheese is you're not going to succeed.  The mac and cheese was good, not amazing.  The cornbread was super dry on the edges and bland.  No butter served with the cornbread either which I thought was super weird.  The have two sauces available on the table, one a thick more traditional BBQ sauce and one a chili infused vinegar sauce.  The thicker sauce was no more memorable than the Kraft variety at the grocery store, and the vinegar was nothing remarkable as well.  We ended the meal with whoopie pies, a chocolate one filled with marshmallow icing and a salted caramel one.  I only tried the chocolate one which was decent, a little dry, but the icing was nice and creamy and not overly sweet.

They do have a nice beer selection, and actually had a good special of $3 bottles of Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold the day we were there. I'll get more into that later...

When the check arrived, the two checks were actually just one check.  After attempting to divide the check between the three parties, it was noted that the beers were not charged as $3 but as $5 each.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found, so another waitress was able to correct this.  She said they had been charging that price all day and no one had noticed it.  Good thing to know...  We then had to divide our check up again amongst three parties, now with the correct pricing.  Upon complaining to the waitress that they should be able to split checks since it accounts for tax and the 20% gratuity that had been automatically added, she said it gets too complicated and even if three people walk in, checks are never split amongst those three people.  I'm sorry but in this day and age, restaurants have great computer systems and I've been places where 25 people get 25 checks.  It just leaves a bad taste in the patron's mouth to end the meal with a calculator and a stack of bills or credit cards.

The decor was picnic which was cute for a BBQ place with high ceilings, but the amount of echo was incredible. The place was about half full and was so loud you couldn't talk to someone unless they were right next to you.  Oh and the front window is broken with a piece of wood covering it.  Seems like it's going to be there a while too since they've actually painted a design on the front of it.

Long story short...totally overrated, overpriced BBQ with a difficult setup if you plan on bringing a group of people."}
{"text":"Very very very underwhelmed.  I expected great things from Chef Sousa.   We had the triple meat combo, a whole chicken, mac and cheese, coleslaw and corn bread.  As we did take out, we could not take advantage of the nifty-looking beer and drink menu.  Unfortunately, this is the first of Chef Sousa's food that I tried, and I am not inspired.  We have extensive and varied BBQ tastes, honed from many years of traveling in the South and Southwest.  The stuff I ate here was unlike anything we have had before - on the bad side.  The brisket and pork were beyond fatty.  I had never encountered that before, and I was repulsed.  I adore adore BBQ chicken.  It is one of my favorite foods in the world.  Their chicken was so smoke flavored it did not even resemble chicken any longer.  My dog ended up with all the remainders from the few bites I could choke down.  The sauces did not inspire me at all.  The BBQ sauce tasted like ketchup spiked with whiskey.  All whiskey and sweet.  My teenager identified the whiskey in a hot second.  Not good. The BBQ sauce had no undertones of anything you might expect - fruit, garlic, tang.  The Carolina sauce was OK, nothing to write home about.  I will never go there again.  I had high hopes, as Pittsburgh is seriously lacking in creative, honestly good cuisine that we adore and get in places like Dallas, New York, Austin, Los Angeles.  God help me - we have even traveled to Cleveland and had some truly inspired local fare there.  If Chef Sousa cannot be counted on to help us,  I am getting fearful."}
{"text":"Let's start with the friend chicken and end with the signature drinks (just like my night did). PS - upstairs dining seems cooler than downstairs dining.

Simply put, this is the best fried chicken I've ever had. If there is a better piece of fried chicken out there, it's in an alternate reality that also happens to be identical to this one.

And the drinks? Forget about it. If you're doing it right you probably will.

So glad I went, I want to go every day.

Taste: 9  Creativity: 6 Atmosphere: 7"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh, oh Pittsburgh. Union Pig & Chicken is a great try at Southern Style food, but it just falls short. The cornbread was too dry and really sweet (which I tend to favor, but this was too much) and the mac & cheese could have been better, it was too gritty for my taste. The chicken however was quite good, but not worth what I paid for it considering the mediocre side dishes. 

Another gripe I had was that there was no one there to seat us. We waited for 3-5 minutes, then just decided to seat ourselves, then waited another 6 minutes for a waitress to come over, even after I had caught her eye, she didn't come over. That really annoys me more than anything. You should be on top of seating people at the minimum. 

I'll probably give it a second try, but I honestly wasn't impressed. I would rather drive the 8 hours down to Asheville and eat in a gas station BBQ. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place a lot, with friends and family. A while ago, management changed and there was a noticeable shift in both staff and food quality. Staff is friendly, but not always super attentive. Food is still good, but sometimes a little dry. 

My boyfriend and I had dinner here on Thursday around seven, and by 1:00am Friday morning, I was throwing up. I was sick with food poisoning the entire day Friday. It's now Saturday, and I'm finally holding down food. 

This place has gone downhill, and the food poisoning is the last straw. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Smoky, smoky, smoky.  Most everything here had lots of smoky flavor.  It worked for the brisket and ribs which were decent.  The meatloaf tasted like someone had put it right on an open flame.  I usually prefer somewhat of a sweetness to my bbq, but if you're looking for this, then this is not your place.  The bbq chicken was good though.  The Poutine would probably be the only reason for me to come back here.  It was made with fingerling potatoes smothered in brisket gravy and cheese!  Deliciosio!!!!  The only other side we had were the greens and they were done really well.  Not the best bbq, but if you like a hickory smoke flavor then this would be your place."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to randomly be at Union Pig and Chicken on the night of Harvard and Highland's soft opening, so we've got a special little place in our hearts for it.  Situated above Union, it's a sweet open space with some damn fine views of the East End, which can fill you with wonder, or make you lament the human condition depending on what's going on outside.
  Every drink you order here is (seemingly) lovingly crafted by the bartenders, and usually involves no less than 5 steps, one tool that I have never seen before, some type of herb or fruit that is unfamiliar, and a single novelty sized ice cube.
  We went here for New Years this year, and they had an open bar, so I tried everything twice, then thought I was really good at karate, only to find out in the morning that I had grossly overestimated my skills.  My favorite drink is, by far, the Lew Brown, a delicious smokey blend of a bunch of things that I would never think to put together.
  I'm fairly certain that you now have access to the Union menu, including the Rye and Jelly Jar list, so the sky is the limit as far as drink choices.
  Now that the weather is warming up, I'm itching to head down here in the early evening and watch the sunset with a bunch of people."}
{"text":"Had lunch here as part of a work meeting. We had pretty much everything on the menu. Overall I am very impressed. The pork ribs are awesome. The brisket is awesome. The pork shoulder is ridiculously amazing. The fried chicken is great. The price point is very good too, given how awesome the food is."}
{"text":"I am a big, big fan of H&H! I don't recognize half of the ingredients on their cocktail menu, but anything I've ordered has been fantastic.  I love the vibe here as well...dark, but very modern and minimalist even though the drinks are totally old-fashioned, craft cocktail kind of concoctions.

I like this place enough to go way out of my way to stop here even though there is a similar place in my neighborhood, so 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a few Saturday's ago with my girlfriend for some after dinner drinks.  We had been looking for a reason to come here and so whenever we had dinner in East Liberty, we decided to stop.  After walking up the stairs we arrived to find a really awesome space.  There were large windows on two sides of the building allowing you to look out over North Highland as well as some Adirondack chairs, high tables, regular tables and bar.  Whenever I was looking for the bathroom (only downstairs inside Union Pig & Chicken) I also found out that they have a large second room with a jukebox and pool table that I had not noticed whenever I originally walked in.

For my drink I went with something that resembled a Manhattan while my girlfriend went for one of the fruity rum drinks.  Unfortunately I can not remember the names of them and I am unable to find a list to tell for sure.  My drink was fairly good and cost about the same as I would expect it to at any fancier place.  It was my girlfriends drink that was the real star though.  After getting through some cloying sweetness that most fruity drinks have, there was a strong taste of smokiness on the finish which left me forgetting the sweetness and wanting more.  When all was said and done, we enjoyed our time here.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  As long as you are aware ahead of time that is not going to be a night of cheap drinks, I think that you can really enjoy both the drinks and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. The barbq is out of this world and the atmosphere is also amazing.  I suggest you get a 1/4 pound of a cuple of there meets but make sure one of them is the ribs they are out of thIs world and the best ribs I have ever had."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this spot out for awhile and when I saw the GroupOn I thought, \"how many more signs must the universe present for you to eat here?\"  So with GroupOn in hand (or stored electronically in my phone) off I went with my parents in tow. 

There are two floors to the restaurant with the first floor set up with large tables for group eating. It was early and not crowded so we decided to head upstairs. 

Minimally decorated with large windows that allow the sun to shine through I'd describe it as somewhat rustic. Our table had small wooden blocks for chairs or a bench on the wall side. Ok, not my favorite set up but I get what they're going for. 

Somewhat simplistic menu. Main choices are chicken, pork or brisket. You can also get either spicy or BBQ flavored wings. I shared an order of chicken wings and had a side of Mac and cheese that could have only been made in heaven. Amazing. And oh so filling. We also had a few pieces of cornbread for the table. Slightly oily but also tasty. And not likely very healthy. This establishment is a producer of comfort food. I'll likely come back in the winter to give myself an extra layer of defense for the cold air. And then walk home to burn off some calories. 

I should note that they have a small selection of tasty craft beers, including local brews from East End Brewery."}
{"text":"After the recent Yelp's Clucking Good Time event at Union Pig & Chicken, my husband and I snagged dinner at this restaurant. I couldn't leave after having just had a couple cocktails and small bites. 

I could tell the restaurant was a little overwhelmed by the extra patrons due to the Yelp event, and we were kindly asked to wait a couple extra minutes while our waiter cleaned off a table. Since we were already a little full, we decided to just split a few dishes - 1 lb Pork, Meaty Mac, and Cornbread. I enjoyed everything! We generally like very different BBQ sauces, so I was excited that we both enjoyed the sauce on the table. Though it was a little sweet which I like, it also had a little kick of spice and vinegar that my husband enjoys. The assistant manager also placed a special habanero sauce on our table, which was absurdly spicy. I literally placed one drop on my finger to try the sauce, and it burned my mouth. Yikes! 

Our two sides - Meaty Mac and Cornbread -  were also very enjoyable. I was a little terrified by the bleu cheese and wasabi in the mac and cheese, but these ingredients proved to be only minor components rather than major flavors of a delicious dish. The warm cornbread was a traditional, sweeter kind covered in butter. So yummy...

This is a really low-key place to grab dinner, and I definitely hope to return very soon."}
{"text":"I guess I just don't get it. Overpriced food. Limited beer selection. Why bother having wing flavors when every wing comes out with a layer of charcoal on it? my BBQ wings tasted like a fire place. My hot wings tasted like a fireplace. my ribs tasted like a fireplace. no thanks"}
{"text":"I read about Harvard and Highland in the City Paper and decided to check it out with some friends on a Saturday evening.  We headed up the stairs from Union Pig and Chicken and were greeted by floor to ceiling windows, a bar in the corner, and two eager bartenders.  

The drink list changes often, and there are usually 2 special drinks written on the chalkboard next to the bar.  I liked how there was one specialty non-alcoholic drink on the menu (for the non-boozing friends/DDs).  

The complexity of the drinks justifies their price and how long it takes to make them.  We all enjoyed our drinks.  I think it's a great place for 1-2 pre/post dinner drinks (unless someone else is buying-then stay all night!).  There is plenty of seating, both at the bars and picnic style tables.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"A very very good BBQ place I ordered the brisket which was completely on point ! Tender fresh and full of authentic BBQ flavor!! Also had the Mac and cheese  which was very good as well! I loved
The set up its simple and to the point and gives u a BBQ feel!! Staff if very nice
And for 10$ u get a full meal incl a drink"}
{"text":"My wife, beautiful and intelligent, surprised me with a birthday dinner at Union Pig & Chicken (henceforth the reason she's beautiful and intelligent). I heard a lot of buzz about this place, and it lived up to the hype. 
First off, the drink menu is great. Lots of creative drinks, including alcohol mixed with beer. They also have real cane sodas. 
We went with another couple, so we strategically tried a little bit if everything. The fried chicken was crispy and thick battered, and my breast meat was juicy- mmm.  The brisket was so tender you could cut it with a napkin- well roasted and not too heavy in the spices. We also had the pulled pork which was juicy and tender. For sides we did the Mac and cheese (yum), cheesy grits (yum yum), red cabbage (yum yum yum) Brussels spot ours roasted with bacon (yum yum yum yum), and a big slab of cornbread (yum yum yum yum - wait, how many yums am I up to?- yum).
Frankly, everything I put in my mouth was amazing, including the banana pudding and Irish coffee we had for dessert. So good!
My only complaint is that they only had one kind of BBQ sauce on the table- some if the meat would have been better with different kinds of sauce, or at least something a bit less pedestrian. 
Also, if you go in the winter, make sure you're as far away from the door as possible- there was nothing between us and the 29 degrees outside when people went in and out. 
Don't be chicken- go pig out! (did you like that pun?)"}
{"text":"The drink menu looks quite fresh with exciting cocktails and an ok beer selection. I can't tell you how the drinks are though, as I never received mine. 

 Ordered drinks. The men in our group received theirs right away.  My friend and I never received ours, even after an hour wait ...and we were sitting AT THE BAR. 

Went to pay out our tabs and the bartender was angry that we didn't want to pay for drinks we never got. That makes sense. And while paying,  then they miraculously found the drinks and tried to make us take & pay for them. 

This place had so much potential."}
{"text":"I've never tried their food, but I had to plan an event here for work. What an awful experience that was. It was like I needed to apologize for the huge burden of giving them business. The owner was unprofessional and rude and I won't set foot in the place to spend my own money."}
{"text":"Loved the simplicity of it. No frills, just good people and good food. A nice throwback."}
{"text":"I LOVE barbecue...or maybe I don't? That's the reality that I was left with when I walked out of Union Pig & Chicken, because If this is the direction that barbecue is headed, then I'm out.

First, the atmosphere...awful. Simply awful. The community seating thing might sound somewhat logical...at a picnic...but for a restaurant environment? No thanks. I'll pass on being seated next to strangers and their children while dealing with the difficulty of trying to talk over the people around me. Just because it's a barbecue joint doesn't mean that I don't want at least a little bit of intimacy to enjoy a meal out with my wife. 

While we were there, the guy next to me spilled his soda all over the table. Luckily, he was the only one who ended up with a wet lap, In reality, I was lucky, considering the giant picnic table we were all sitting at. If his drink spills at a slightly different angle, my jeans would've had nice cola hue to them instead.

The industrial interior with nothing but hard surfaces lends to the noise being nearly unbearable. Of course, maybe the noise is meant to distract you from being able to accurately judge the food you're about to eat.

I ordered the pork + ribs + brisket meal, while my wife got the half bbq chicken. She added the potato salad as her side and I decided to try the mac & cheese, as well. 

Now, I love ribs...so much so, that I just couldn't help but dig into them first. Unfortunately, there was so much gristle that no amount of flavor - which there wasn't much of - could distract me from such an obnoxious texture. I ate what I could off of the half rack and moved on to the pork shoulder. 

Admittedly, this was my first time eating pork shoulder...and I'm pretty sure it's going to be my last. Now, some people might enjoy the fattiness, but this wasn't for me. Most of my pieces of pork were nothing but fat. That foul, blubbery texture on your tongue...if that's the appeal of pork shoulder, the trendy foodies of the world can enjoy it. I'll take the rest of the pig instead. Thanks.

The lone highlight of the meal was the brisket. It was the one thing on the tray that had a lot of flavor and actually worked really well with their barbecue sauce on the table, or without. It was tender, juicy, and the only thing that I would recommend

The sides? Well, the dinner bun that comes with your meal looks like it comes from a bag, and I had no interest in it. The mac & cheese was okay, but not good enough to come back for. 

Overall, we both left feeling incredibly disappointed. While Union gives you a decent amount of food, the quality just wasn't good enough to justify the hit on our wallet, and leaving a lot of uneaten food behind was a huge waste. I give it 2 stars, knowing that some people might like that style of barbecue, but for me, Union has earned itself the status of an afterthought for us."}
{"text":"Usually when I think of a great BBQ place, I want it to be a hole in the wall with a big pit in the back that you can smell from blocks away.  Do not go here expecting that.  

Starting off with cocktails, as always, I ordered the smokey white russian, and to be honest I tasted no smoke.  So I ended up just paying more for a white russian, I wonder how much a normal white russian is in comparison to the \"named\" cocktail on the menu?  I still drank it up though.  The worst part about ordering drinks there is that the bar is upstairs, and it took a long time for our drinks to come.  We definitely would've ordered another round of cocktails during dinner if they would've been there quicker.  After my unsmoked white russian I did get a draft beer from their list, and it was tasty.  

I cast a wide net when I ordered here, since you order by the quarter/half/whole pound I wanted to try everything (except tofu).  I ordered the ribs, pork, fried chicken, and brisket.  I thought the pork, fried chicken and brisket were all excellent.  The pork and brisket were so tender that at times you had trouble picking them up, and the fried chicken was moist and the breading was light and crisp.  The ribs were sub-par I thought.  They were a little tough and thoroughly unspectacular.   I also wasn't a huge fan of their BBQ sauce on the table.  I like more of a thick tangy sauce, and theirs was watery and sweet. 

For sides we got the heirloom tomato salad, the mac and cheese and a piece of cornbread.  They were all very good, and we enjoyed them all.  I would recommend splitting pieces of cornbread between two people, as they are pretty large.  

For dessert I had a terrible time choosing between whoopy pies and the funnel cake.  The local peaches with honey on the funnel cake is what sold me, however I think I choose poorly.  It might be because my only real exposure to funnel cake is at Kennywood or the occasional fair, but I was expecting a big plate of funnel cake.  Instead I got just a little bit of funnel cake that looked rather sad in the middle of a big plate.   They did taste good however, I mean it's fried dough, powdered sugar, peaches and honey, tough to mess that up.  

Overall I would go back, I would not order ribs again, but stick with the other 3 items and you should be good to go.  The decor was simple, clean and inviting, and our server was very good."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago for a networking dinner and had a great time. The host had tables for us reserved upstairs in the bar area. Though we didn't eat in the dinning room downstairs I noticed that guests eat family style on long picnic tables and benches which is an interesting and different style than one normally sees.

I was extremely impressed with the bar area. The entire space is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows where you can look out at the up and coming East Liberty neighborhood.  The actual bar is quite small, but there are plenty of tables for diners and drinkers to relax and sit.

First off, Union Pig and Chicken has a great whiskey and specialty drink list. Note that most are in the $10 range, but almost all the choices are of the rare and small batch variety.  The craft beer list is also exceptional.

For the amount of food I thought it was a great deal for the price. My date and I ordered the two meet combo (brisket and pork shoulder) then added on Macaroni and Cheese, baked beans, and cole slaw as sides (all in the $4-6 range) The meat portions were hefty and the side dishes were also large.  When the meat comes out you have your choice of sauces on the table to add. There was a nice variety; spicy, mild, vinegar based, along with some others. I mixed the spicy with the vinegar and it was awesome. Even without the sauces the meat itself was tender and flavorful.

If you plan on having drinks the night can get somewhat expensive, but the food alone is quite a deal for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Still looking for good barbecue around Pittsburgh. This place had looked overpriced, but there was a Groupon for it, so we decided to give it a try.
The ribs were really good and had a great rub on them, but $19 for less than a full rack is a lot to pay. The pork was really good as well but not what I would really consider barbecue. Meaty mac and cheese was interesting, but I wouldn't get it again for $9. 
A big group came end near the end of our meal, so it took a long time to get our check and pay. 
Overall, the meal was good, but I would not want to pay full price. I'll stick with Selma's whenever I'm out by the airport."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my Mum when she came into town to visit. This was her suggestion and she couldn't wait to go. The atmosphere was very laid back. I enjoyed the long family style tables. We both ordered the lunch combo which consisted of two pieces of chicken, a side of pork, one side and some cornbread with homemade jelly. You could either get BBQ or fried chicken so we got one of each and split the chicken. I got yams and they were amazing. Mum got the mac and cheese and she loved it. I was so stuffed, I couldn't even try it. The cornbread was delicious as well. I can't wait to go back with friends!"}
{"text":"I love a good bbq. was here for lunch got the special.. was the right amount. I got the fried chicken and the pork and the mac and cheese.. all very good.. came with a sliver of corn bread and jelly. would go back... a little pricey but the food was good"}
{"text":"oh mah gawd, epic meat time. 

Maybe its because we're slightly BBQ deprived in Holland, but this place was seriously awesome. so much so, that we ordered a second helping of the brisket, (to make it 3 helpings) on top of all the other meat we scarfed down. 

Brisket, chicken, ribs, plus mac n cheese, potato salad and beans. Craft beers. and WHOOPIE PIES?! 

seriously, I would eat here everyday if we lived in Pittsburgh. Great service, great price. Great great great."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointed by the entire experience! Beware. 

We had a party of 7, checking the website in advance, we saw that they take \"limited reservations,\" whatever that means. So, we decided it meant it was worth a shot to just show up. Nope. 

No exaggeration, it took 2 hours and 45 minutes for us to get seated! ALMOST THREE HOURS. What's more, we kept seeing empty seats and dining sections that stayed empty for ages...when asked about them, the host said they were reserved. Isn't there an applicable rule where if your full party isn't present at the time of your reservation, you lose that seating? Where is the logic in denying people who are present and prepared to patronize your establishment  in favor of others who, after 10 minutes late, aren't even guaranteed they'll show?! 

We kept being told \"maybe 15 or 20 more minutes,\" over and over...just enough so that we'd find ourselves dropping more money upstairs for another round. Maybe they do that on purpose so you spend more?! 

When we finally got seated, we enjoyed the food, but to be honest, we would've enjoyed a piece of cardboard at that point."}
{"text":"Great food and service. 
My only gripe is that it's listed as kid friendly, but they don't have a kids menu. Our kid did manage to have fun because luckily the place wasn't crowded and we could check out the bocce area."}
{"text":"Wow! Never have I had such tender meat that wasn't cooked in a crock pot for 24 hours. The brisket and pork shoulder were delicious, not to mention top-notch macaroni and cheese and cornbread. The unique picnic-table setup encourages conversation. I feel sorry for vegans because they're the only people who won't enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"This used to be the best place to get fried chicken in Pittsburgh. It used to have really great ribs, and just-like-homemade mac'n'cheese. Now? They have new owners apparently. They have a new menu. The mac'n'cheese is over salted. It took 90 minutes to get an order of fried chicken. 90 minutes. For fried chicken. And the staff doesn't seem to even care. UP&C, you're dead to me."}
{"text":"I never Order greens , but these greens are so BOMB!! So much flavor ! And the ribs are just as amazing !! Love it ! 20 stars"}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times for the Wednesday evening Bingo nights (kind of a Bingo/trivia combo).  It used to start later in the evenings around 10pm but they've recently moved it up to 8pm which I think is better for a weeknight.  The Bingo is done in a separate room and they do provide table service there, but it can be a bit spotty during Bingo, especially in the beginning of the evening when they are just getting started.  I think it would work more smoothly if they would start table service about 30 min before Bingo starts rather than right after Bingo starts, which can be more disruptive.  People usually prefer to get their food and drink before the game so there are less interruptions.  For some reason both times I went the servers weren't very attentive or friendly.  The last time I went the server seemed annoyed sometimes when I would ask for things or would walk away without fully letting me ask my question (such as when I asked for water and she just waved me over to some water available in the corner, but I didn't get a chance to explain there were no cups and I needed a cup).  The bartenders were quite friendly and helpful though.  The food has always been quite delicious and I've enjoyed both the mac n cheese and the wings.  The wings are particularly smokey and meaty.  They have a decent beer and wine selection as well as some really interesting and creative cocktails that they change up each time.  For Bingo they were offering $5 cocktail specials with a few specific choices which was a nice deal.  The Bingo leader is an interesting character.  I don't recall him being this way the first time I went, but this most recent time when he started the came he seemed rather drunk and/or high or manic and it was certainly and interesting and entertaining game, though I think he offended a few people with his crude humor.  The game was highly entertaining and including some interesting historical stories as part of the triva (with lots of sex topics so don't bring the kids!) and there were lots of fun random prizes like santa beards, latex gloves, toy dinosaurs, etc.  If you are easily offended or don't appreciate vulgar humor this may not be the event for you."}
{"text":"I couldn't have been more satisfied with my first visit to UP+C.  Simple and stunning, the warmth of the lighting and wood paneled walls were improbably topped upon entry by the friendly hostess + waitstaff.  So impressed with the competence + patience of everyone I encountered.  As both the restaurant itself + the concept of barbeque held to high standards are new to Pittsburgh, there were a lot of questions to be asked.  The knowledgeable servers were more than happy to oblige my curiosities about the menu and the space, and offered specific and helpful advice as i made my cocktail and dining choices.  

Certainly, UP+C is not the first PGH establishment to brave the a la carte menu but i appreciated the unique straightforwardness.  Not only did it suggest a dedication to the dishes and flavors being offered, but it definitely encouraged my interaction with the people around me + took the edge of unfamiliarity off of the communal dining experience. Look beside you, see what's being passed around + fought over, maybe even dare to ask your neighbors for a recommendation?  The environment, coupled with such a well-rounded selection of bourbons to choose from + the ever-reliable East End line up on draft, provides much to enjoy and imbibe during the rather speedy wait for food.  

On that note, the meal.  I was dining with a friend and after much consultation decided to split two meats and a number of sides.  I recommend this strategy as servings were QUITE generous.  The BBQ chicken and pork shoulder complimented one another supremely well.  I ordered the pork and was delighted to find it as juicy, tender + melt in your mouth delicious as I had hoped.  The chicken was somewhat different than i might have expected, but quite pleasantly so.  The meat is magically tender for being marinaded and smoked in a dry rub (thankfully devoid of the goopy BBQ sauce that so often steals the spotlight from the flavor of the meat)  The chicken was flavorful and juicy and spoke for itself.  Although, contrary to other reviews, i was pleased with the enhancement of the tangy sweet table top BBQ sauce.  Again though, the flavor of the meat speaks for itself.  

My companion and I both raved over the collard greens, stewed until buttery + tender + tossed with bacon.  I was gratefully excited for the slaw, which reminded me of the delicious pickled red onions I won't serve my homemade brisket without.  Creamy mac + cheese was the perfect compliment to BBQ chicken but it was the cornbread that REALLY set the meal off.  Smokey, sweet, moist + dense...mmm.  I can't describe it as anything but ridiculous.  I've paid some serious dues on the quest to find a truly great cornbread and this folks, is the big ticket.  

I was more than impressed with the overall experience of UP+C, and cannot wait to get back for the High West Double Rye, the ribs, the brisket, the baked beans and duh, more cornbread."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. I was not disappointed. It was definitely busy. We decided to take advantage of the special menu with the drink pairings. 
First course was roasted red pepper soup with pork. O.M.G.  The peppers were smokey, and it was just the right amount of heat. I ate every drop!  
Second course was the pork belly with seafood and then cornbread. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. The cornbread was warm and soft. If it was socially acceptable to like the plate, I would have. 
Third and final course was roasted duck with potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The duck had delicious gravy and searing. I loved every bite. My only complaint about this course was that the Brussel sprouts were a little greasy. I love me some Brussel sprouts, so this was disappointing. 
The restaurant itself is cute and I like how they have the long table, which promote socialization. 
Service was fast and friendly. 
I will definitely be coming back here and trying the regular menu."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, although if you come for Sunday brunch (until 2:30) this is NOT a barbeque place. They have delicious brunch, though, and the atmosphere is fun and fresh. Servers are hesitant to make substitutions."}
{"text":"Wow...1st spot we hit on our biz trip to Pitt. This place looked like it was gonna be great. From the outside to the inside to the hipster staff. We couldn't wait to dig in. And that's exactly what we did...WAIT. My wife and I ran out of conversation just waiting for our drinks let alone the food. Then I thought to myself, maybe the food would make up for this inconvenience. NOPE!
Mediocre at best. Over smoked everything. Drowning in oil potatoes. While we ate we ordered another round. Didn't come til we were already done with coats on and ready to go. Best part of the whole ordeal was the mac & cheese. But wait!!!! THERE'S MORE!!! Ordered the creamy non meat m&c. When we got the bill they had charged us for the more expensive with meat. At this point I decided to let yelp be my voice. Paid our share and left. Pittsburgh please tell me there is better out here!"}
{"text":"BBQ wise, the only thing here I really really reeeeeally liked was the brisket. I've never been able to find it at any good stuff at other BBQ places around town, but I've only tested it at 3 locations on the east side of town. The brisket had a good smokey flavor and you get a bunch of it. It sort of sucks that everything is a la carte.


Howevvvvvvver, the brunch is pretty effing good. Chicken and waffles done right! Comes with Mac and cheese and greens, and is a ginormous lunch tray full of food for $14. A group of friends and I went one Sunday (5 altogether) and the place was sort of empty. The service was still oddly slow and I still contend that the drinking glasses are ridiculously small the amount of salty foods one consumes, but the staff was friendly and the food was good so whatever. 


I'd really like to make it here sometime during the week for lunch, as I hear that's a good service as well. Would also like to try out their upstairs bar menu as well."}
{"text":"Quite good. Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but definitely the most pricey (then again its all quite pricey). Had an awesome drink whose name I can't recall and the portions were quite large. I'd prefer a bit less gristle on the meat but was overall pleased and despite two of us sharing a meal we still had leftovers for lunch. THe Mac and cheese is ridiculously huge, enough for a meal on its own."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I live in BBQ country. I Didn't have much expectation for a BBQ place up north. We Came out for dinner. Ordered our food and appetizers. We waited 45 minutes for wings. Best wings I've ever had. Worth the wait? Probably so. What upset me was the server was non apologetic for the extremely long wait. Didn't say a word. Food was pretty good, beers were a good price. I would normally give this a 3 or 4 star rating, but the horrible service ruined it for us.

Update***
We decided to go back a few days later since it was right across the street from our hotel. The bartender remember exactly what we had to drink. Apologized for the delay in our previous visit. We came for the smoked wings!! Service was superb on our return, we food was delivered on time!"}
{"text":"It is a small bar above union pig and chicken. The drink menu is small and list of ingredients are strange and difficult to understand. The price per drink is $8-$12. The drinks themselves are good but hardly worth the price. Service is fair."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this hyped up restaurant and the boyf and I LOVE us some BBQ (I may or may not have a countdown to ribfest).   I was so disappointed in the food - BBQ is average at best.  The service is really slow.  Everything was on the drier side.  The brisket was really fatty (I'm Jewish - our family crushes brisket on the reg).  Mac was pretty good.

The big elephant in the room for the one star... this place made us extremely sick.  We eat out often and TMI - it was not good.  I'm legit terrified to return.  Other friends of ours who have dined here as well have said the same thing.  

Just warning you... #goodluck"}
{"text":"Om nom nom nom the brisket is sooooooo good here! I'm so close to giving it 5 stars because I LOVE their brisket! They also have a banh mi sandwich which is pretty good. With long wooden tables across the length of the restaurant, it's simple but nice decor.

Definitely go here for their food, but I gotta admit that they don't get a full five stars because I'm not impressed with their drinks. They don't have a very good beer selection and most of it (all of it?) is bottles and cans. I'm not a fan of places that don't have a good (or ANY) draft selection. Additionally, while they have a nice whiskey selection, they are SO overpriced and are in 1 oz or 2oz portions. Seriously you've paying at least $10 for a shot which is ridiculous.

But there's fun things upstairs at \"Harvard and Highland\" which is guess I separate place but also the same place? On Wednesdays they have Adventure Bingo which is an expletive filled, indie and rock soundtracked, crazy adult bingo with themed trivia on the side. You can win anything from gift certificates to little green army men. It's a sh!t ton of fun and you should DEF go sometime!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have had, especially in Pittsburgh. The place offers a very casual dining experience, with very simple decor, long picnic table seating, and food served on cafeteria trays. Don't be deceived by the simplicity of the place, because the food was amazing. The beef brisket sandwich is incredibly tender, and doesn't have an ounce of fat. Their mac n' cheese is incredibly cheesy, and rich, and is some of the best I have had, . To top it all off, the wait staff has been very friendly on ever visit. While the place is by no means cheap, the prices won't burn a whole through your wallet, and the food is definitely worth the cost. I have gone several times for lunch, often getting their lunch special, which includes a sandwich, side and drink all for $10."}
{"text":"I had put off trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews and the doubtful possibility there was quality BBQ in Pittsburgh having been so badly disapointed repeatedly.  I ordered 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound ribs and greens.  1/4 pound ribs were 2 bones, very small but very meaty.  I will say that this is the most expensive BBQ I have ever had anywhere in the country without a doubt.  

The ribs and pork have a nice dry rub.  BBQ is never spicy and this isn't either, thankfully.  It doesn't come out sauced, another blessing.  The sauce on the table is nice and complements the rub.  It's a little fruity and tangy breaking up the richness of the pork.  Please watch the char.  Burnt isn't good food.  Seriously!  The pork was succulent, there was lots of fat melting in my mouth and making me wish there was more.  I got the end piece of the rib rack but it was still fairly moist.  I wish there was more but I was already at $15 so I wasn't going to order anything else for lunch.  The greens were spot on.  Very nicely done and the portion size (for the greens) was ok. 

The place isn't much to look at.  The service was friendly.  I don't know if it's ever going to be 5 stars for me but I will definitely be back to try it again.

I went back!  Took Miriam just a few days later and it was exactly the same.  A good sign.  This time, in addition, I tried the brussel sprouts and they were delicious.  Bring a friend or 3.  If you order more food, the price gets cheaper.  So a 1/2 pound is less than  2 portions of a 1/4 pound for example and you can save money if you share.  It's still expensive but you can do a bit better with some planning."}
{"text":"The brisket is to DIE for!  (I don't think I've ever used that phrase before.)  Sweet, smoky flavor through and through, a rub that the top BBQ competitors on the circuit would give their eye teeth for, so tender a fork is all that's necessary.  Perfect.  The fat cap some peeps are complaining about?  Necessary.  That's what keeps the meat juicy and tender through the long, slow cooking process.  And there is a huge PILE of brisket on your metal platter.  Sauce it how you like it from the bottles on the table or enjoy it naked - the brisket, not you.  Then again, you can get take out so what you do when you get home is your responsibility. (Eek!)

I got the ribs, too.  Another winner!  Yep, literally fell right off the bone.  And I LIKE my ribs that way!  Collard greens on the side were sweet and tart, smoky and everything I like in my greens...without being mushy.  Nicely done UP&C!  

The hubby got his favorite dish of all - fried chicken.  He really enjoyed the flavor, but expected crisp and crunchy fried chicken so this version wasn't in his top choices for fried chicken.  Next time he'll try the roast chicken or the brisket.  He ADORED the mac & cheese!  In fact, he said it was the best he's ever had - except for mine.  Smart man...if he wants homemade mac & cheese from me again.  lol

I loved the communal tables!  I didn't expect to say that, but the hostess used some good party planning guidelines in seating people.  She put us at a table with a couple around our same age and we enjoyed conversation together!  Then she seated another duo - mother and adult son - between us.  We had a great time talking and discussing food around the country.  Hostess, (I wish I knew your name) you get an A+ in seating strategy!  If you're put off by the communal seating, loosen up a little and ask your neighbor about the food on his or her plate, about the cocktail he or she is enjoying.  You just might find you're talking and laughing and getting the point of the seating!

Cocktails.  I can't really make a judgment on them yet.  I had the \"Jelly Jar.\"  Eh.  It was quite harsh, no finesse.  I loved the concept, though.  The idea is brilliant, actually...pre-package the cocktail in a sealed jelly jar and bring it to the table without waiting for a bartender to custom mix it.  Nice idea.  More ice would have helped, maybe.  The 5-star rating above is ONLY for the food.  When the upstairs bar opens, Harvard & Highland, it will be time to give the cocktails a fair try and a fair rating.

Go for the brisket!."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love good bbq and this place has it. The bahn mi is insanely good and if recommend getting it with cole slaw. The brisket is really delicious. It's a fun atmosphere, too. The cocktails can get a little pricey but that's because the bartenders know what they're doing."}
{"text":"As I reflect on the BBQ we ate yesterday, I'm tempted to leave work so I can go home and eat my leftovers. And the only reason there are leftovers is because I'm on a diet. Full disclosure: this was a takeout order (took about 10-15 min).

The BBQ chicken is AMAZING. It's not served sauced, but there are a variety of side sauces if you like it that way. Personally, I thought it was so juicy and well-seasoned that it needed no sauce, although I wasn't a huge fan of the ones they had this time (the seasonal rhubarb sauce is amazing, though; can't wait for it to come back!). Possibly the best white meat chicken I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

We also ordered the mac & cheese, because I wanted to try the ribs & brisket without ordering enough food for a large family. This was a bit of a letdown. The sauce was great, the meat was great, the crispy topping was all there...but there was just too much going on--the wasabi (which I normally LOVE) was a distraction from the meaty cheesy goodness.

However, delicious chicken + 25% student discount + eminently reasonable beer prices means I'LL BE BACK."}
{"text":"Updating my review.
Good news:  
Consistently good service by the wait staff (fast, cheery, personable)  and great rock-n-roll music upstairs.  

Bad news: 
Inconsistent food quality from great to not-so-good makes me not want to return.  The ribs were dried out as if they'd been sitting around.  And, what is with the yellow runny liquid on my ribs?  I'm gonna assume it was mustard but, honestly, I don't think it was appetizing to look at and I've never had yellow \"stuff\" on ribs before.  The quality of the meat, even with sauce added was just below my standards even when I'm doin' the cookin'.  And, even the slaw, which I usually like, was sub-par this visit.

No draft beers?  

And the unisex one-stall restroom upstairs?  Oh, don't even...  The cleanliness (or, rather, lack thereof) reminds me of a college bar -- no mirror, urine on the seat, and an air freshener that's been plugged in way past its time (as in, it's older than my toothbrush).  If the restroom is like this, then, what about the kitchen?  Mind you, it's 6:00pm on a Friday, not like it's near closing time and there's been a rush and maddening crowd lined up..."}
{"text":"Good ribs, the brisket was fatty. It was hard to trim it because the light was ridiculously low.  Had to poke with a fork to find the edge.  The cornbread was very good. The beans in the baked beans were hard to chew, probably not soaked long enough.  The coleslaw was Ok  not anything special. ( I prefer the McCormick & Schmidt's recipe) 

The butternut soup was excellent.  

The faux checkerboard grease doily ( not really sure what else to call it) failed fairly early in the meal due to the large amount of grease, so I had to be extra careful not to eat paper (UNDER THE RIDICULOUSLY LOW LIGHT).

My wife's BBQ chicken was good. It wasn't entirely clear if if it was skinned and the sauce was baked on or if the skin was burnt. In any event it was discarded and the BBQ sauce was used for dipping.  One \"OK\" vote and one \"Meh\" vote on the sauce. 
We're regular Sweet Rays users so perhaps that colors our opinions.

A low traffic night so staff service and the kitchen were very quick.

Over-priced, to be sure (it's a hip place isn't it ?) but most folks who go here won't need a loan co-signer.

As we waited for the payment business, I noticed a chalk board with what appeared to be specials, but I couldn't read it anyway due to the (did I mention) ridiculously low light.

We'll probably go again and start with the soup and try some of the other options."}
{"text":"Went here to try them out since a lot of people have said amazing things about them. Besides the fact that they were out of ribs, pork shoulder and meatloaf- so we could only order the brisket, it was not a good experience. 
The brisket was dry and leathery, absolutely nothing good about it. We ordered the meaty Mac, which was fantastically creamy but the taste of wasabi was so overwhelming, it was impossible to get more than a couple of bites in, and I love wasabi. 
However, their biscuit was good. And when the only thing I can compliment on at a BarBQ place is the biscuit- that's sad. 
Not to mention it is horrendously overpriced and slow.
Will not go back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First off, any restaurant playing Danzig on the stereo is ok in my book. 

The BBQ is definitely the star here. I typically get the ribs, pork shoulder and brisket. They all have a great bark and smoke flavor. The pork shoulder falls apart easily with just your fork and the ribs pull easily from the bone. My only knock on the meat is it can be a little dry. 

The sides are also very good southern stsples. Mac and cheese. Greens.  Even a southern take on poutine. I can be a poutine snob but their version is very good. 

I've never had to wait here and the staff is always very friendly. Overall it's not the best BBQ in town, but I also never decline an invitation to go."}
{"text":"There is nothing more satisfying than digging your choppers into a plate full of meat.  This is not the place for vegans, and meat lovers should be prepared for a treat.  Simple, and community seating, with a good drink menu and a basic but good choice of dinners.

If you like ribs, cornbread, and pork this is worth the stop.  Plus the local scene is getting better for a night on the town."}
{"text":"Best poutine I've ever had, hands down! The fried chicken and Mac and cheese were really good too. Also had the cookies and milk for dessert which was a lovely finish to a great meal."}
{"text":"Being a southerner I know good BBQ. Finding good BBQ in the north has been a challenge til now. Union Pig and Chicken is outstanding!  We had the brisket, chicken, Mac and cheese, and cheese grits. EVERY bite of it was DELICIOUS!!!  My husband has never been a fan if cheese grits until he had the ones here. The portions are big-even if you are a hearty eater. The wait staff is very nice. We will definitely be back to try to ribs."}
{"text":"Definitely not for non meat eaters. We went for brunch so I just ordered some egg dish - I can't even remember what it was. 

However everyone else ordered chicken and waffles, mac and cheese and greens and was raving about it. That's all I have to say about that!"}
{"text":"Dear Union Pig and Chicken, we used to have a long-standing and satisfying love affair. Your meat was juicy, your cornbread fluffy, and your chicken and waffles were the best in town. So you must understand why it pains me to tell you that we must break up. 

It's been awhile since I've visited (over a year) but this recent dining experience was not even close to what I've come to love and appreciate about UP&C. 

My shredded chicken sandwich was dry and boring and the cornbread was dry and boring. The ribs were mediocre. The Mac & Cheese and cocktails were good, but a gal can't live off of dairy and alcohol alone (I would if I could). Our server was lovely, hence the extra star. 

Honestly, I feel like I was ripped off. Dinner and drinks for two was over $80. I don't mind being spendy, but I expect quality if I'm going to drop $30 on an entree. 

I hope for the good of humanity that the fried chicken and waffles are still delicious, but unfortunately I'm not going to risk getting my heart broken. It's been real and I'll cherish the memories, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken last night. Off the hook. Great job. The ribs were also tender. Greens were good and the slaw tasty. Only the Mac n cheese left a little to be desired probably because it was take out (kinda dry)   Will stop here more often."}
{"text":"Meat was very very fatty.  Orders pork shoulder and half the pieces were pure fat.  

Waitress \"how was everything\"
Me \"ok, half pieces were pure fat\"
Waitress \"that's the way it's supposed to be\"

There you have it."}
{"text":"Small portions compared to price!! Even the drinks were expensive and very small. 
Also the waitress were completely absent minded."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of the place as soon as I walked it, had a very rustic feel with the picnic tables.  Our waiter was friendly and very helpful to us.  It was also a pleasant suprise that we were there during some kind of happy hour and we got half off our meals.  I was very happy with the sides.  A lot of BBQ place I have been the sides were never very good but their sides were great!  Had mac n cheese and the greens, delicious!  An the main event of the meat, ribs/brisket, were yummy!  I loved how this place had the sauce with the vinegar, my favorite kind of BBQ!  I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken, which I hear is very good."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to come here for quite some time now.  After our wonderful dinner at notion, we made our way a few blocks down the road to enjoy some after-dinner cocktails.  My first impression was, WOW!  It has a wonderful smell of meats being smoked emanating from Union Pig & Chicken located downstairs.  I don't know how the bartenders handle it.  My mouth was watering the whole time - I had to remind myself that I just ate!  
The bartender explained the cocktails to us, and I decided to go with a gin based concoction.  It was so refreshing.  You can tell from one taste the thoughtfulness put into each cocktail recipe.  My boyfriend opted for a glass of scotch, and according to him, they have a great selection.  
It wasn't too busy for a Thursday evening, so we took advantage of the free pool in the back room.  The whole place had a cool vibe.  We'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The food is always good enough, but the service here was once again pretty horrible. Not horrible in a horrible way but horrible in a slow way. As a tip, order two drinks at once, the waiter will not be back anytime soon.....even though I do enjoy the general setup I cannot continue to give a way so much of my time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the city. I almost always get the brisket and all but once in 15 or so times it has been fall-apart-in-your-mouth good. Same with the pork shoulder. Haven't tried the other meats yet.  Collards are good (bacon).  It's maybe a shade more expensive than other bbq places, but I also like the design of the place. Still wish they'd listen to me and serve fried okra!"}
{"text":"This five star review is for the pork. It is as good as advertised. The brisket (point cut) and sides (cornbread, cole slaw) were very good as well. Service was pretty slow, even on a quiet night, but not enough to detract from an otherwise excellent meal. We ate upstairs in the bar area; not sure what to make of the main dining section."}
{"text":"I recently went back to the Union Pig and Chicken for their brisket because they ran out the first time I went. I made a reservation ahead of time so my friends and I wouldn't have to wait and were seated upstairs. Since we had a Groupon, we wanted to try as many of their selections as possible. For their meats, I ordered their brisket, pork, and fried chicken. The fried chicken did not disappoint but the brisket and pork were not done well. There was a thick layer of charred meat that was not appetizing at all. I understand that there needs to be a smoke ring on meat but our brisket and pork were burnt to the point it tasted like cigarettes. Although their bbq disappointed us, their other selections redeemed themselves. Their manh me sandwich was phenominal. It had the perfect combination of fatty pork belly, chicken liver pate, and picked vegetables. I plan on going back one last time to see if there is a cooking inconsistency. I will update when I do!"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars to because I was seriously torn between a 3 & 4 star review. We went to lunch earlier this week here and I was really excited to eat here after all the hype it's received. Our service was awesome, the lunch special was very reasonably priced and the beer choices were ok, not stellar, but we each found something that worked for us. 

The beef brisket sandwich I ordered (hubby got the same thing) was the most tender I've ever been served with a decent amount of smokey flavor. I was excited that I could cut the beef with my fork and the toasted bun was pretty good & held up to the sandwich without giving way halfway through. The issue was there was no bark at all on the edges. One of the things I enjoy most about beef brisket is that little crunch and all the flavor on the edges from the rub. Nada here - where the heck was it? Also what I thought I saw on the brisket upon delivery was a sweet section of burnt end on the bottom, which I saved for last because I do love a good burnt end on the brisket. What I got was only charred fat on the end, no meat. Boooo! I'm not a novice at this, I know brisket gets its flavor from the fat melting into it as it smokes and I pulled a few pieces of fat off my brisket without even blinking but, I was really looking forward to that end crunch and I got deprived of the goody I was hoping for. 

The cole slaw gets happy points from me. It was tasty and I ate every bit of it. I've seen a lot of people say it's sour which I certainly don't agree with. It was a really nice compliment to my brisket sandwich. 

And now the less than happy finish.....the unisex bathrooms. YUCK!!! Let's just say that 50% of your customers are female and none of us find a lid up or wet floor decoration acceptable. Fix this or risk pissing off (pun intended) 1/2 your customers. And that's what took that 3 1/2 to a 3 vs the 4 star review your food probably deserves."}
{"text":"We ordered drinks at Harvard & Highland early on a chill night out pre-dinner. 

The staff was super-friendly and the decor made me happy - as in it looked like they built their own stools kind of happy - we were early and it was fairly empty still.

Unfortunately being early meant the bartender was solo and a bit overwhelmed with the specialty drink orders that seemed to take about sixteen steps each. The bartender and some of the other staff were good personalities to stop and chat a bit and it was entertaining to watch so the wait wasn't actually bad - plus I love my friends - but the sixteen steps weren't quite worth it for the drinks. They just didn't hit the mark. I was excited for smoked + Brazilian sugarcane + pineapple and I got a lot of smokiness and a somewhat odd combo. I tasted one of the other drinks and had the same sort of \"odd and not quite good\" reaction, but I gather the third whiskey was killer."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch.  Had \"steak & eggs\" which was terrible.  The 'steak' was beef brisket that was too salty and seasoned with spices that left a nasty after taste.  The 3 slabs of brisket looked like something from a high school cafeteria lunch.  The Bacon Chipotle Hash was a lump of fried potatoes that were stone cold and not a hint of bacon.  The eggs were good.  The seating area was very cold and the music was so loud everyone else there was talking even louder to be heard.  Awful experience!"}
{"text":"The brisket is so good it made me question my atheism.  The mac 'n cheese is also killer."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not supposed to be writing this review right now (or listening to Salt n Pepa) but I just feel the need! The brisket was great! Not too fatty, thin cuts dry rubbed with great spices, but not too dry! The BBQ sauce was good, mac and cheese was good cabbage was good, and most importantly, it wasn't too pricey, which was one of my main worries. Some people do consider it pricey, but I am saying for Pittsburgh, capital of new American expensive food--I could get a meal there for $10 (1/4 pound of brisket plus mac and cheese) and be ok. No it's not the six buck sandwiches I got at Fat Matt's in Atlanta, but what is here? Show me and I will go! And, for vegetarians, don't be deterred by the name, you can get the sides--cornbread, cabbage, mac and cheese, which are not too small and if you get two or three, you should be fine! If you don't eat the red meats or the chicken, there is a shrimp and grits dish and of course for all you freaks, they have tofu so you can pretend you are having as good of a meal as I did."}
{"text":"It's a damn shame that this restaurant which helped usher in a rebirth of the East Liberty area has to close due to an increase in rent!

Consistently great food, friendly service and welcoming atmosphere, what more do you want? The brisket is off the chain and the ribs are smoking!

So long my homies! It was great having you as long as we did!"}
{"text":"1st visit last evening.... drinks were great!  staff was fun!  Grilled chicken hearts in Pgh?!  They were great too!  Can't wait to return to try all of the BBQ sauces!!!"}
{"text":"Union- Pig and Chicken Pittsburgh Vs Slow's Bar BBQ of Detroit.....

Cool atmosphere: union 1 Slow's 1 both used barn style wood work.
Safe parking:        Union 1 Slow's 0 (if Slow's lot is full which it is most of the time)
Sauces :                Union 0 Slow's 1 too much vinegar in the Union sauce, not enough variety of sauces to choose from.

Its all about the MMMMMMMMmeat, my sister and I tried the brisket and ribs at Union, decent dry rub pit style rib, tender meat, wish the rub had more sweet and spice to it. 

My sister said the ribs at Slows were a bit tastier. Brisket does have a high fat content, but the meat is tender and juicy  which many people prefer over a drier brisket.

So union 1 for brisket Slow's 1 for ribs. We got the corn bread for  side, and mac and cheese with potato salad. Mac and Cheese was to die for good, beat Kelly's out around the corner. Potato salad was yum but it is non tradition with a sweet vinegar dressing. Cornbread was a bit  dry for my tastes and a little burn on crust. My sister pointed out to me that i am a polenta fan, this might sway my review of said CB. Also no additional butter for the cornbread... booo. 

Price: Slow's 1 Union 0. Union is new in town (fairly) price is a wee high, but portions are decent we could feed three people with our 2 meat 1 side combo + 2 sides. So slows came out on top but narrowly. Because BBQ is diverse, everyone likes their sauce, dry rub, meat a little different. I've been to Mississippi, tasted chicken that made me cry happy tears (from a KFC mind you. Had warm hush puppies in Florida with my pulled pork sandwich, and  fresh fried okra on the side in Alabama. My point is that every place does their BBQ a little differently I liked what Union has to offer, I think they attempted to unite different BBQ flavors of the country with their menu choices. But everyone's BBQ blueprint is different, order something you know you like and go from there. Once they have established repeat customer base they should bring the prices down a wee bit and add a few more diverse items to the menu. Then they can stand with Slow's."}
{"text":"Upscale urban bbq, small portions and high prices, but oh so exceedingly good.

The ribs - served by the quarter pound, which is like two small ribs - are coated with seasoning, so they don't need any sauce (which is only on the table, not in the cooking), and are in fact better heated up the next day than they are at first.  Meaty, not fatty, yet very tender.

The fried chicken is not so good reheated, but absolutely splendid straight from the kitchen.  Again tender meat inside, and the light, well-spiced coating works ideally with it.  The pieces are small, so don't be afraid to order a half-chicken and eat all of it.  Marvelously good.

Had the greens as a side.  Pretty good, and like the ribs better reheated the next day.

Stark wooden butcher-block tables, disconcertingly undecorated walls. Chicken is cooked to order, I guess, so it takes a while to come out."}
{"text":"A new twist on an old favorite, barbecue.  Really good flavorful sandwiches, great service, cool environment, and most of all an absolutely incredible selection of drinks.  The lunch specials are a pretty fair deal, and the mac & cheese side is a meal in itself."}
{"text":"So industrial chic, this place. Service is good and the food is great. 

The ribs are great (flavorful, smokey, tender, a little sweet), chicken is moist, cornbread is the drier type which I don't prefer but I know others like their cornbread like that. 

The mac & cheese is really good, but should get it there for dine-in, because the cheese gets crispy and bubbly. We did takeout once and the mac and cheese tasted so meh having sat in its styrofoam container for the ride home. 

Plenty of seating on the main and 2nd level."}
{"text":"Oh Yea!  A new BBQ opened by Kevin Sousa.  A Barbecue and Fired Chicken restaurant.  Nice place with wood planks on the walls and 4 large wooden communal tables.   Cool lighting.  Your meal is served on aluminum trays.   

The menu has BBQ Chicken, Pork Shoulder, Brisket, St. Louis Ribs.  Sides of Corn Bread, Greens, Mac & Cheese, and Cole Slaw.    Drinks include Rock and Rye - drinks made with Old Overholt Rye,  XXX are other bourbons, Draft beer - 4 from East End, and Pop - including Cheerwine (a southern delicacy) Sprecher's Root Beer, Mexican Coke and others.

The Pork Shoulder was very tasty and it came with 2 small rolls.  Two sauces - a vinegar based hotter sauce with some hot peppers in the bottom of the bottle - very good and a sweeter sauce that was tomato based.  The sweet sauce was OK but I thought a little to sweet, but then again, I'm not a sweet sauce type.   The Mac & Cheese was good and it comes in a little bowl that is put in the oven/broiler so the top gets a little crusty.  Someone with us had the greens which have some bacon included and said they love the flavor. 

Type of place you should come with a group and try different meals so you really get the communal flavor.   The table behind us was doing that.  They knew someone in the kitchen that brought out a few samples of other food items to try.  Yum!

So all of you BBQ fans out there, here is a new opportunity.  Come get some.

Currently open for dinner, lunch coming soon, I was told.  A couple of people were getting take out.  So stop by.  Have a Rye.  Get take out.

PS:  It is a little dark inside at night.  The communal tables are unique because the set up like a typical BBQ place with picnic type tables, but the benches are set for  two/three  on a side,  3 if you are small per side, so you can have a 4 top and then there is space between the benches, so it is similar to many restaurants  with tables lined up along on side next to each other  with a little space between the benches but the table is connected, so you are not sitting directly next to someone you do not know.  So not really eating with everyone else, they are just next to you."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight with my family and it was very disappointing. Portions are very small service was ok but we waited over an hour for our food. I ordered meatloaf and pork shoulder, the meatloaf was bland covered with no taste gravy, while the pork shoulder was decent. My son ordered a Vietnamese sandwich that was absolutely horrible. He also ordered the Vladimir Putin fries which was probably one of the worst things I've ever ate my life. Some of this food tasted like it was frozen Stouffers food at the local giant eagle. I would never come back nor recommend it to anybody. I would rather eat a bologna sandwich with ketchup in the monkey exhibit at the zoo while somebody through monkey biscuits at me wow the monkeys pick their nose and laughed at me."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious BBQ and a great atmosphere. I had 1/2 lb of Ribs, Mac n cheese and bacon Brussels - I would definitely recommend Union Pig and Chicken and I can't wait to return for brunch! I hear it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"I visited after lunch and it was empty. Being from Texas we have great BBQ restaurants and places that do great fried chicken but I have never been to one that does both as good as they do. I had ribs, brisket, fried chicken, and the mac-n-cheese. All excellent! Staff was friendly and service was good. Looking forward to going back. Thanks June & Jay for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Good drinks, and the bartender recommended me two books on the subject that made good reading.  :-)  They're doing craft cocktails well; if you want a sazerac or a ramos gin fizz, this is a good place to try.  If you're looking for a long island iced tea?  Wrong bar.  Very much the wrong bar.

Bizarre (and pleasant!) bar food."}
{"text":"Yum.  Hip, unique atmosphere.  Brisket was so flavorful but way too fatty for some people.  Over half of my serving was pure fat, literally no meat.  But that was fine with me actually.  Complaints:  1. someone said this place was good for kids.  I don't know what kids because there is only one high chair in the joint and they do not offer anything but water for children who don't drink soda (which is anyone younger than 10 in my opinion).  Someone with a child who was a little older than ours was using the only highchair and luckily they noticed the situation and gave us the high chair and made their 3 year old sit on the bench seat.  2. Waitress was less than attentive.  I came a little later than he rest of my party (who had went ahead and ordered for me but didn't' get me a drink) she never came to ask what I wanted to drink or if everything was fine.  I flagged her down and while I was trying to order a drink, she did no face me or give me her full attention."}
{"text":"I don't think it's much of a secret that Salt of the Earth has been serving some of the best cocktails in Pittsburgh for a while now.  Therefore, it's not suprising that if you take one of their outstanding bartenders and put her in another place, there will be great cocktails.

I visited Harvard & Highland with a group of friends this past Saturday night.  Arrived on the earlier side, grabbed a table, and ordered cocktails from the very creative list of original creations available.  Overall, the space is small (as big as Union downstairs) but has great floor to ceiling windows that look out on the street corner.  There were about 4 tables on the left, a few stand-up tables, a few wooden beach chairs near the corners, and about 8 seats at the small bar.  Being fairly new, the place still had the nice smell of fresh-cut wood!

After our waiter delivered our cocktails, that was the last we saw of him for the evening.  After a long time wondering why he hadn't come back, I saw him in street clothes with a backpack heading out the door.  No other person came by to take our orders.  Getting impatient, for the rest of the evening we had to get our drinks directly from the bar which was challenging because the place was getting more and more crowded.  By around midnight, H&H was jammed packed and there seemed to be only 2 bartenders frantically working.  It was clear they were very understaffed.

If Harvard & Highland stays as popular as it was this past Saturday, they're going to need to hire more help.  Their inability to keep up with the crowd almost certainly cost them money (we ourselves would have ordered more had we the opportunity).  I suspect this will change as H&H figure out when they're going to be the most crowded.

It's important to note that cocktails are the only thing on the menu.  There's a few non-alcoholic seltzer drinks.  I was surprised there wasn't a selection of high-end bourbon or other hard alcohols if you didn't want one of the speciality cocktails.  There's also no food at all (but Union is downstairs if you want to eat beforehand).  

This is a great space with a great bartender and a lot of potential.  I hope that in the future they'll increase their number of servers and offer something to munch on while people enjoy some of the best cocktails in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I don't eat pork or beef, and I am gluten-free so I can't eat many things on this menu, but what brought me in was the BBQ chicken, and what brought me back was the BBQ chicken. Holy moly it is good. I don't mess around with any of those pesky, expensive side dishes. I just order me up a half chicken and do it Atkins-style.

Also, my husband loved it. He fancies himself somewhat of a BBQ connoisseur so if he felt that this place deserved a second round, that's saying something. He did focus on the beef brisket and the ribs.

But let me just say again: GET THE CHICKEN. It's very good.

P.S. My kid liked the meat, but she was kinda meh on the sides."}
{"text":"According to webpage and YELP this establishment is opened at daily. A group of us decided to try the restaurant only to find a handwritten note on the door saying not open on Monday and Tuesday.  In a city like Pittsburgh with so many wonderful restaurants, I would recommend that this company update their social media post so not to turn off other potential customers."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at Union Pig & Chicken.  Long sturdy picnic tables in lieu of more intimate two- and four-tops.  The food comes on trays as though you just ordered from a backyard grill, cafeteria bbq or food truck on the side of the road.  It's a definite experience.  The prices are up there a bit, not the cheapest place to eat certainly, but the food it pretty good.  
With two people we ordered the 2 Meet Combo which comes with, you guessed it!, two meats plus a side, plus cornbread.  The meats we got were ribs and brisket.  The brisket was delightful, fleshy and falling apart with enough seasoning to stand alone but not too much that it didn't benefit from the array of sauces on the table.  A real winner.  The ribs, however, weren't as impressive.  The meat fell off the bone in just the right way, but the outside was tough and hard to bite through and the inside didn't provide the proper texture to make up for that.  They went great with the bbq sauce, but I was expecting more.
For our side we got the baked beans and another side of mac & cheese, both top notch.  Devoured them, they were superb.  As was the cornbread.  If you're going to make cornbread a staple of your restaurant, do it right.  Union does it right, moist and compact with excellent sweetness and just the right amount of crumbliness, it crumbles in your mouth, not in your hand or on the plate.
Along with our excellent beer, the bill came to a bit much for a simple night out, and the atmosphere isn't quite right for a special date night, so you really have to be in the right mood to go to Union, but if you do, it's not a bad choice at all."}
{"text":"After months of reading the few-star rants about this place, I ended up in Sliberty for a one-woman performance piece at the Kelly Strayhorn (which was shamefully low-attendance for a spectacular performer of her caliber) and needed to have dinner before.  Being on foot with a blind lady meant our walking distance choices were limited. BRGR? I don't think so. So we were flip flopping in deciding between Waffle Shop, Ethiopian, or Pig N Chicken, and we decided to give Pigs and Chickens a try.

I have to say...I wasn't expecting to actually be pleased by a restaurant owned by one of the premiere 'foodie' leaders in da burgh. I was expecting a big check for toy food that taste good, but wouldn't fill me up.  I am very happy to report that I was wrong.

It is an odd little joint. The atmosphere is a bit strange.  A large open space, with two rows of old style country banquet hall picnic benches, and what looks like barn wood covering the walls. No art to break it up. Just giant walls of brown wood. Felt kind of barn-like, but maybe that's the intent in the theme.  We went at an 'early' time, so there was no crowd, but I would say that the idea of someone sitting on the bench right next to me during a 'busy' time would be a little off-putting, especially considering the girth of many burgh eaters, but then again since no one tends to talk to anyone next to them in the burgh, it might be kind of cool to actually break down that wall, turn to the right or left and say 'Mmmmmm...hi!'

The music was 1950's hop music which seemed a little out of place, but it sure was fun, and got my body in an up mood, feet bopping on the floor while I chewed.

At first the staff seemed a little typical Pittsburgh uppity bistroid 'disinterested' and aloof. The kind of sloppy wannabeanartist fuzzy captain caveman beard, the sewing spindles in the earlobes...but the waitress who took our order turned that around.  She was helpful, charming, and very polite and made the meal a pleasant experience.

And the meal was the MOST pleasant surprise. The menu is limited, and at first seemed a little pricey, with most 'sides' being ala carte, but they offered a couple of combo 'deals', and since my friend tends to (usually) eat like a bird, we decided to split the two-meat combo.  The choices were two of ribs, brisket and pork shoulder, and included one side and a chunk of cornbread. My friend opted for a second side.

So we ordered the brisket, pork shoulder, baked beans (and my friend asked the waitress if they were out of a can to which the waitress responded 'Oh GOD no!''), cole slaw, and the cornbread - and two sodas (COKE PEOPLE - HOORAY!).

The platter that arrived had bowls individually containing the order, except the brisket which was in a pile on some 'picnic' type paper.  The portions were ample, and every bit of it home made and delicious. Even the baked beans were from scratch, and included fresh herbs to the extent that my tongue couldn't figure out if it was rosemary or sage - which the waitress investigated to find it was thyme. FRESH thyme.  The meats were cooked beautifully, sauced beautifully, tender and juicy. The pork was the fave, as the brisket seemed to lose its spark as the time went by and it cooled off, but I think that's pretty normal for brisket.

My friend, the bird, had two helpings of everything, and there were plenty of leftovers to drag with us to the theater until we caught the ride to take them home.

That two-meat combo was $20. $2 for the extra side, and the price of the sodas. The bill was just under $30, and we were well fed.

Now, bear in mind, it IS called Union PIG and CHICKEN.  It's a barbecue place. I think what perhaps was intended to be another uppity bistroid was leveled off to be an actual pleasant and delicious restaurant experience...for meat eaters.

And it was a very smart move, especially for the neighborhood it's in.  Great job.

Now, with all of that young wannabeartist air floating around...slap some art on those walls! And keep that food cooking!"}
{"text":"this place was pretty cool! i'd heard of it before and heard good things, but never many details. i went here with my boyfriend on new years day (greasy pork and chicken to cure my hangover? yes please). when we came inside, i was kind of surprised to see how small the place was. we were seated immediately, but i imagine quite the wait on busy days. the seating is just several large tables, so you're right next to your neighbors, which i wasn't a huge fan of, but it does add a cool vibe to the atmosphere.
so the server rattled off the special and we were quickly served a big tray of chicken and waffles (a huge breast and leg!) with sides of greens and mac and cheese. i had only recently tried chicken and waffles for the first time, and i really enjoyed it here. the syrup was good, and the gravy was okay, but i couldn't decide which i liked dipping in better. i wasn't a big fan of the greens, and i've had better mac and cheese, but honestly, i'd still get the same meal any day.
it was a ton of food and the chicken itself is worth it, cooked well and tasty!"}
{"text":"I was craving bbq after a lazy Sunday flipping channels and the Husband and I decided to hit up Union.  We sat at the bar and ordered cocktails and placed a to go order. I ordered a shameful amount of grub with no shame.  The food took near an hour to come out but we were still psyched to shame eat in privacy shortly thereafter. Sadly, the 1/2 ib order of blackened chicken was raw in the middle.  If we had eaten
on location I could have at least sent it back. Sadly, garbage disposer ate well that night. Bummer."}
{"text":"I LOVE BBQ. I've been dying to try Union Pig & Chicken for a while now; the man and I finally stopped by today. 

We walked in and were ignored. We asked if we should seat ourselves and were told to go upstairs for more intimate seating... we did. Excited, we ordered 1/4 lb of ribs, 1/2 lb chicken, and baked beans. I was pleased that we had the option to select white or dark meat. 

Cook time was fast at 3 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon, and we received our food within 10 minutes. After reading reviews, I was prepared for dry rub and BBQ sauces on the table. I didn't realize there was only one BBQ sauce option, and it was DISGUSTING.

The ribs were extremely tough and impossible to cut, remove from the bone, even chew. Chicken was moist and tasty, sans sauce. Beans were cooked in the same horrible sauce, so I didn't care for them. 

Total bill came to $22 and some change, which was reasonable, if not inexpensive, for the portion sizes. 

So, the food wasn't for us, but at least we got to enjoy the atmosphere... WRONG! \"Baby it's Cold Outside\" and other Christmas tunes were playing on the radio. It's July 27. Christmas in July, maybe? 

Needless to say, I will not be returning to Union Pig & Chicken. I had higher hopes for Kevin Sousa..."}
{"text":"My husband and I came during the Sunday brunch and had the chicken and waffles. We also got two smoked Bloody Mary's. they were expensive and gross. It wasn't busy, but we still did not have good service. No refills in the tiny water glasses we were given. The food was good, but I prefer Meat & Potatoes fried chicken and jalepeno waffles. The Mac and Cheese was amazing I will give them that. However, 60 for brunch is not worth it.....at least not at a hipster BBQ joint. And if you don't know the location, it's in the ghetto. Lets be honest here."}
{"text":"Ugh. I really, really wanted to like this place. 

FOOD: Pork shoulder was definitely the highlight. Ribs were very dry and flavorless, \"poutine\" was undercooked fingerling potatoes with cold cheese curds, and finally - one slice of cornbread costs $3?!? Come on, people. Nothing we ordered was worth what we paid for it. 

SERVICE: Our server was friendly enough - not overly attentive but we're pretty low maintenance. It took FOREVER to get our food (this always baffles me when ordering BBQ. Isn't the premise that it's been cooking all day and is done now??) this seemed the be the case for everyone around us, too. 

\"FACILITIES\": the bathroom. One stall for everyone - men and women, it's in a teeny space, no mirror, floors were sticky, trash overflowing. Gross, gross, gross. Also, I really don't know how people can see in this place after dark. There are TONS of windows upstairs, but no lights. Just an observation. 

Bottom line: skip it."}
{"text":"My Thursday lunch spot 5 weeks out of 4. I mean you can't beat the FREE side and drink lunch combo. Try the brisket sandwich or the pork. Or try anything else. It's always top notch."}
{"text":"The food was good BUT we waited almost 30 minutes to even get acknowledged to place our order for takeout when there were maybe 6 other people there (it was not busy at all).  After finally receiving the food, we left, and I started to check the order to make sure it was correct.  Of course it was not soooo we then went back.  I stood up front for at least 10 minutes with not one person even acknowledging what I was there for.  I then procedded to walk to the back where the kitchen is to tell the very rude waitress that I did not receive one the items that I ordered.  She was in the middle of shoving food in her face so I guess I annoyed her.  She rolled her eyes, went into the kitchen and came out a few mintues later with the item and said 'here!'  Then after the horrible service, long wait time and disrespectful attitude the waitress had the gall to forge my receipt to increase her tip.  Don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon.  Hope she enjoyed the extra cash.  It's too bad the service didn't hold up to the food quality..."}
{"text":"Cool, chic little place. Our waiter was terrific. We ordered a variety and it was all delicious. The Mac n cheese did not disappoint. It was cheesy and divine. The corn bread was scrumptious. And the meat, well now...I got pork and brisket. The hubby got fried chicken, rib, and pork. The meat is so succulent and juicy and their rub and BBQ sauce is fantastic. I was a little disappointed that the tofu was not done yet but that gives us a reason to go back which we will do. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great bbq. It has been a while since I have been here but I would love to go back again and get the brisket sandwich (the cheapest dish on the menu - but probably the tastiest). Very juicy brisket. The sides were great.

The place is massive somehow. The upstairs has a pool table in the back with a jukebox - when we went no one was around upstairs so we just chilled by the pool table.

The meat mac and cheese is also absolutely wonderful.

I believe they only do speciality cocktails, which was OK but a bit priced high. The entrees are also a bit pricey but hell for that good bbq, I wouldn't mind paying every once in a while"}
{"text":"Meh... It was just ok. The food looked better than it tasted :-/  I had the BBQ chicken, greens, and mac & cheese. I would give it another try, but order other items from the menu. 

Aside from that, the service and atmosphere were great!"}
{"text":"They should rename the place Union Fat & Fat.  I had the brisket & pork shoulder with cole slaw as my side. My brisket was 80% fat - the shoulder was over 90% fat.  It was disgusting.  They need to hire a someone who knows how to dress the meat.  The cole slaw was bad (personally I prefer the vinegar based to mayo based slaw).  It tasted as if someone went to KFC, bought their slaw and mixed it with sugar and elmers glue. On a positive note the corn bread was pretty good.  That's how bad this place is.  It's a bbq joint and I'm praising the corn bread.

I hated the communal seating - that combined with the minimalist interiors - ensures that you send the entire night yelling across the table to make yourself hear.

I'm really surprised by all of the good reviews.   There are three possible conclusions.  1. - they have never had good bbq.  This being Pittsburgh, this is the most probably answer.  2. - they are either employees or friends/relations of the management.  3.  - I was there on a off night."}
{"text":"Union Pig and Chicken is hard to classify.
First off the menu is super confusing and has a dumb layout. We had to ask the server a zillion questions.
I always wanted to try it and when they offered a Groupon I jumped in.
I ended up going twice only because I had two Groupons.
First time we visited we had the wings(good), 1/4 fried chicken,brisket sandwich and ribs. Everything tasted fine but the portions were small, I mean really small and everything is wayyyy overpriced!
Second time we all ordered the fried chicken because we were hungry and because the last time did not satisfy us. The fried chicken is excellent tasting. What i find weird though is they don't offer any sides you would expect to go with this type of food. How about some potatoes guys!!! Mashed potatoes would be great and french fries would be a big seller. The mac and cheese is OK but it is $4...really?
This style of food is not fancy and should not be expensive.
I don't see this place lasting much longer as the menu offerings are limited and does not encourage one to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Food comma!!! 

We arrived at about 6pm on a Saturday and was told there was about a 30 minute wait so we headed up to the bar. Shortly after ordering some beers, the host came to get us which was a nice surprise. They will transfer the bar tab to your table tab.

We were both hungry so we each ordered a two meat combo and a side - my partner ordered pork shoulder and ribs, and I fried chicken and ribs, both mac and cheese. Note, there is a $5 charge if you order chicken with the 2 meat combo so $25, not $20. The ribs had a nice smoke flavor and the meat fell off the bone. I'm not a huge fan of pork shoulder but it was tender and you didn't have to chew the meat. The fried chicken was delicious too - juicy and not dry or bland. The mac and cheese was solid. The corn bread was buttery goodness and moist. We took the waitresses advice and put the available sauces on the table on everything, just to try. The vinegar was okay but their bbq and haberno sauce rocked my palette. We prob should have shared the two meat combo but I'm glad we got our own.

The tables are communal and they offer gift cards in any amount. Street parking is only available."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place enough! Have visited many times now, and after ever visit, I have one word to describe UPAC - - 'consistent'. This place consistently nails it when it comes to quality and service. You will NOT be disappointed if you are in the mood for good ol' BBQ. 

I must say, after having tried many different briskets at many different establishments over the years, UPAC's pulls through in first place without hesitation. You MUST try it.

The 'meaty mac' is also worth an honorable mention, and the cornbread is always excellent.

Plenty of craft beers on the menu as well, if that is your thing."}
{"text":"Went tonight after casbah was packed with empty tables waiting for reservations......    glad we came, we were able to go right in and had excellent service.    The food is awesome.    I am not a huge BBQ person.....   well I guess I am not a sweet BBQ loaded with grease person.   This is not that.    they have long smoked meat that you can order single or family style.   The pork and fried chicken were my favorite, which is usually the dishes I never order.   The ribs were OK but I didn't like the tub on them.   Mac and cheese was good complete with gooey baked cheese on top.    

My only criticism is that it is extremely loud which makes it hard to talk.....    upstairs is said to be better which we may try next time."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. Although it's more expensive than my usual options, I can't help but give it 5 stars because I'm a sucker for BBQ. The fried chicken is juicy and tender every time. The pork is flavorful and succulent. And don't get me started on the cornbread! If you ever have a hankering for southern comfort food prepared in northern kitchens (not that your taste buds would ever be that specific), then Union Pig & Chicken is a no-brainer. Please visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket and the ribs are incredible! Please don't forget the corn bread and coleslaw. I've lived in Virginia for a few year and loved the BBQ there but this place blows any place in VA out of the water."}
{"text":"2 years after the fact my father still brings up the BBQ fr here- the brisket specifically, yinz should go and have the same life changing BBQ foray"}
{"text":"I'm a KSBS BBQ judge, so I'm a BBQ snob.  I really liked the flavor profiles of the food, it was all over cooked.  Mac-n - cheese was bomb.  I think they do better than what I had so I'll go back and try again."}
{"text":"Waltzed in here on a weekday for lunch... left with my bbq dreams satisfied and a good buzz. 

So the place is adorable and the atmosphere is on point for a bbq joint. We came in before the bar opened, but our server, Jenna (= amazing), helped us navigate thru the menu and pick out a few glasses of whiskey. Ordered the ribs, pork shoulder, greens, and slaw (+ a pickle and jalapeños for good measure). The food didn't take long at all to come out. I've waited twice as long for a slice of pizza at a few nearby spots.

The ribs and coleslaw were bomb.com, but the pork shoulder and greens stole my heart. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth amazing and the sauces they had out were delicious: one traditional, one tangy. Really, that's all you need. For the record, I mixed them together... it was epic. 

After lunch, gee what luck, the bar was open. Went up intending to have one drink... fast forward a few hours. The cocktails are fantastic - made w/ unique, quality ingredients. Couldn't have just one. Also, the staff members are lovely people (shout out to Jordan at the bar who kept us full of great spirits *and* the best convo I've had in weeks).

Great food, wonderful people... awesome drinks. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was really disappointing. We ordered a pound of ribs, a pork sandwich, and various sides. The meat was average and underwhelming. I was really not thrilled to spend 50 bucks here - the quality was something I'd spend 20 bucks on at the most. I think they have the food priced to pay the bills; it's not priced based on the quality."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's filling a niche in Pittsburgh when it comes to BBQ food, which isn't necessarily my favorite type of food, but I was open to trying! 
My fiancé and I went for a Yelp Elite event and got to try various cocktails and food. He LOVES this type of food. We tried the deviled eggs (which I don't even think are on the menu), a piece of pork shoulder and brisket, ending with their bread pudding. All was tender, seasoned to perfection and left us wanting to try more. 
After the event, we needed more food to be full so we tried the 1/2 of fried chicken with a side of mac and cheese to share. Yum! I loved the Mac and cheese, it came out very warm and was super cheesy and creamy. The chicken was good as well, the breading was crispy and light. Not southern fried chicken, but getting very close.
The cocktails were all Wiggle Whiskey inspired using their bitters. They were made well and had very unique components. 
Their ambiance was very causal with sharing tables and red checkered details. The service was just fine. There was one girl that seemed rather miserable, but no one else working was.
Now for the negatives, it does seem a little overpriced for what the food is. Being that I loved the cocktails, I wish they'd have an appetizer menu. I would defiantly munch on some friend green tomatoes or pickles and have a few adult beverages. Also, prepared to come out of there with a nice smokey smell. Not from cigarettes, but from their smoker. 
All and all great for if this is your type of food. I'm sure my fiancé will be begging me to come back!"}
{"text":"I went with two friends and we got the platter that had chicken, pulled pork, and brisket. The sides are really good, and the mac and cheese is filling and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Union Pig & Chicken is a good try on Southern food in Pittsburgh, located in a neighborhood that some call up-and-coming.

Atmosphere - quirky and lively. Long, wooden tables and benches. Minimalistic, modern design, gives you a cool vibe. Food menu - they keep it simple. BBQ chicken, fried chicken, pork shoulder, ribs, but that's all you need. Cornbread, mac&cheese, sole slaw, beans or greens on the side. Drinks menu - awesome. Perfect for Whishkey-lovers with a variety of Whiskey-based drinks, a tasty addition to the solid beer selection and nonalcoholic drinks. They serve Mexican Coke - my favorite (I'm easy to please).

I can see why people like this place, and if you dig the food, definitely try it out. I'd come back for the Mexican Coke and the Whiskey. Maybe together?"}
{"text":"Love, LOVE this place!!  If you seek out tender, juicy fall off the bone meat this is the place to go.  Plus very interesting bar drinks menu.  Friendly staff, plan on taking all of my out of town guests here."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday.  Food was pretty good but on the pricy side for barbecue.

The issue arose when our check came. Our party of 5 had the 20% gratuity automatically added.  The server didn't notify us but luckily one of us spotted it on there.  Having worked as a server in the past I know of this trick.  Don't tell the table about the gratuity added, hope they don't notice and tip additionally on top of the original tip.

Didn't work this time for this particular server, we saw what he had done and left the original tip without adding to it.  He didn't stop there though.  While the person who had put the bill on his cards was in the bathroom he approached two of us and asked if everything was ok.  We said yes.  He then said we hadn't tipped (we certainly had).  We said ok, bring us the check and the receipt and if we hadn't we would fix the situation.  Then he tripled down and claimed he couldn't find the check!  I think he was still hoping we would throw down more tip, the gall was incredible.  

I realize one server does not represent an entire restaurant but this was a truly awful experience.  I wanted to come back and speak to a manager and give them a chance to make it right but didn't have time in the weeks following."}
{"text":"Below average, overpriced, unwelcoming.

I have been meaning to try this place since it opened. My boyfriend is from North Carolina and loves BBQ so I've been trying to find him a place in Pittsburgh he might enjoy. We got takeout - brisket sandwich, 1/4 fried chicken, meaty Mac, and coleslaw. We found everything to be underwhelming. The brisket was average- it was tender but I've had better.  The fried chicken was salty.  The meaty Mac would have been better without the blue cheese.  I ate it by picking out meat chunks and the crispy cheese on top. The coleslaw was good, and by far our favorite part of the meal. That should say enough. 

Price was $35 for all of the above. 

As far as service, the waitress seemed uninterested in us. There were only three other guests in the downstairs of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with 2 friends for a late dinner. 

My friend got the Meaty Mac n Cheese, which she absolutely loved. She also got a side of cabbage- I tried it and liked it.

My other friend and I shared a half pound of fried chicken. It was good. We also split the mac n cheese and some cornbread. I wasn't crazy about the cornbread, but I did like the mac n cheese.

Can't remember the drink that my friend got, but it had tequila in it- and my other friend and I each got a beer that was from Slippery Rock, PA- it was good!

Our waiter was attentive, but he was pretty crass, haha.

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"My first time at Union Pig & Chicken was last week for Adventure Bingo, so this will be a duel review. 

This place is on the corner of the block in East Liberty. Once we walked in, we were a bit confused as there is no sign whether to seat yourself, or wait, or that there is even a whole other bar and seating area upstairs. Finally, we flagged someone down and confirmed to head upstairs for bingo. 

As we were a bit early, we grabbed some seats at the bar and ordered our first round of drinks. Looked at the menu, and had a solid chuckle at the amount of Ron Burgundy references. My boyfriend had a beer, and commented on the small but good selection. I had a cocktail and was a little underwhelmed. It was also pretty costly for the venue. 

Now onto the food, THE FOOD. We ordered the poutine to start, it was alright. Nothing special, and nothing I would order again. The meaty mac and cheese on the other hand was excellent, creamy and flavorful. I say this on the pretense that I usually dislike most mac and cheeses as they are too overwhelmingly cheesy and not enough other flavors. I will definitely be trying this again. We also ordered the 1/4 lb of fried chick and 1/4 lb of brisket. The brisket was VERY fatty, I would have to say almost 3/4 of the brisket was fat. Such a waste and was def not a big fan of this. From the meat that my boyfriend did get, he was really impressed with. Now onto the star of the show, the fried chicken! Oh, the fried chicken! ORDER IT, and then order it again!! The skin was delicious, the chicken was moist, and I wish I could have it every day since. I will definitely be back for this, I haven't had chicken like that ever. I was knocked off my feet. 

Lastly, I'll comment about bingo. It was SO. MUCH. FUN. I would suggest it to anyone that can hold a sense of humor. While it is definitely not PG-13, I laughed almost the whole time. The guy was awesome, and I will definitely be bringing my friends back to play."}
{"text":"That's right - 2 stars. I struggled where to begin with this because I was so disappointed in this place. 

First off, I really don't get the a la cartè menu trend. Is this some ruse to think you're getting a good deal by piecing your meal together? I also do not believe that BBQ of any kind should cost $50 for two people. Doesn't this fly in the face of what BBQ is and it's roots? UP&C even charges a dollar per roll. Cornbread will cost you $3. I had to check my bill to see if I was charged for the glass of water. 

The ambiance is just off. It's a large room with two very long picnic tables - read: mess hall or prison chow hall. I do not find novelty in eating with strangers. I'm almost nauseated at watching people I don't know put food in their mouth. It's just one of my pet peeves. Mr. J was very uncomfortable with this set up. He told me that if he goes out to dinner with me, he wants to be able to talk to me. Completely impossible here as the noise level is extremely loud and the tables are so wide that the person you're sitting across from is too far away to hear you. The girl sitting next to me was cupping her ears to hear her guy friend across from her.

It's dark. Very dark. This large room is only lit by tiny, bare Edison lights suspended from the ceiling and the barn wood walls are very dark and do nothing to reflect the light. There is a slit- type window that peers into the kitchen area. The whole vibe of the atmosphere kept me thinking, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 

Ok. Food. 
I ordered the brisket. $14 for brisket only. No sides. You will need sides because for that $14, you get 3 tiny slices of meat. The brisket was a bit tough and the fat was gummy, almost slimy. I expect brisket to be tender and the fat rendered enough so that it's buttery and adds to the flavor. Speaking of flavor, it was totally lacking here. Even trying the vinegar BBQ sauce and the tomato-based BBQ sauce did nothing to add flavor since they were both also bland. 

I also ordered the macaroni and cheese and cole slaw. Grand total for my meal alone, $20. The macaroni and cheese is very similar to the frozen Stouffer's brand and had little flavor with the exception of the charred top. The cole slaw was disappointing too. Vinegar-based and tasted only of vinegar and onions. They use red cabbage so the presentation was a purple runny mess served in a paper food boat. 

Mr. J got the fried chicken. The breading is cornmeal based and this didn't seem like fried chicken at all. Again reminded me of Stouffer's frozen fried chicken, and also had zero flavor and zero crunch. 

We then had to wait for 15 minutes for the waitress to process our credit card payment. Apparently, they only have one computer and were processing the payment for a party of 20. Why is that my problem? 

This is not my idea of BBQ by any stretch. This is a typical \"trying-too-hard, hipster, let's make a ton of money off our cheap rent and minimalistic decor and cheap food\" kinda place. My experience here makes me never want to visit NACL (Salt of the Earth). Ever. 

Perhaps it's their debut week jitters and they need to pull it together; however, since I walked out with an empty wallet and still feeling hungry, UP&C will not get another chance from this gal."}
{"text":"The Meaty Mac is the best mac and cheese I've ever had! Fun cocktails, too. Our waitress seemed very judgmental though."}
{"text":"You can't walk by without being enticed and lured in by the smells. Once inside its like a dream come true with mouth watering meats and Mac & Cheese!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch the day after Halloween.

Our waitress tried really hard to keep things up, but another staff member was a no show and it was very obvious. Even more than not having another server, the kitchen was really backed up and the food took an insanely long amount of time. 

I will say that the chicken and waffles were some of the best I have ever had, though if you are looking for a traditional waffle then you are not going to get what you expected. This waffle was light and crisp and had almost a sourdough aftertaste that paired really well with the chicken and the syrup. Personally I thought the gravy was superfluous and a bit unappealing in that it was quite congealed in the cup and not warm."}
{"text":"What a tasty little hideaway! It's so secret it doesn't even have signage yet...

I was a little confused as to if i was supposed to go into Union Pig & Chicken or if there was another entrance. I went into Union Pig and noticed a brightly lit hallway and made my way upstairs. Thankfully, it wasn't someone's living room I walked into, but a very clean looking bar.

It was clean in the sense that it was literally, very clean, but also it had a really clean aesthetic. I think you just expect craft cocktail joints to look like a speakeasy in the sense were it's darkly lite and mysterious.This place is bright with tons of natural light coming through the huge windows, light colored wood and a bunch of fun adirondack chairs lined against the wall. It was like a southern style speakeasy, but without no mint juleps!

The bartender was super friendly and definitely knew what he was doing behind the bar. I never claim to be a cocktail expert, but I do enjoy a fancy pants cocktail once in a while! These fancy pants cocktails were divine! In my humble opinion, there are times when I go into these places and I feel like there's just SO MUCH alcohol inside that tiny glass. I want to taste everything equally, I don't need to be falling on my face 20 minutes into happy hour! The cocktails I ordered seemed to be the perfect mix of everything. 

I tried the Agnatha & Anni, which was bluecoat, yellow chartreuse, lingonberry and grapefruit. It was exactly what I wanted. Totally refreshing and as I said, the perfect ratio of juice to alcohol. 

I honestly thought it couldn't get any better than that drink. But it did! I also tried the Grandeur & Glory and it may have been better than the first, which I don't even know how that could happen! It was Boyd & Blair vodka, cocchi americano, pear & savory. I have no clue what half those things are but they came together beautifully for another refreshing, not too tart, not too sweet cocktail.

Two things to note: They do not serve food from Union Pig upstairs and they don't serve the drinks from Harvard downstairs. They're neighbors that don't play together. I would think you'd want to serve those drinks downstairs or order up some food upstairs, but I'm sure there's a reason behind keeping them seperate. 

I'll be back... and probably often!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! We were hankering for some beef. Deciding between brisket or burgers? Chose the former and a quick trip to Union P & C. Ordered brisket, tofu, Cole slaw, pickle and red onion some wine and beer. The pickle was the best of meal. Brisket, tofu were way too salty. We remembered the brisket from previous meals as succulent and flavorful. Instead, it was dry and overly salted and peppered. Too salty for salt loving partner, and that's a lot of salt. Adding insult to injury the slaw was surprisingly bland- the server took it off the bill. Oh well, a bad night...the restaurant game is getting more competitive in this foodie city."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I entered the building, I had to stand at the door for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and gave us a seat.  A simple \"seat yourself\" sign would sure help that uncomfortable feeling!  

First time was brunch which is a fixed menu of chicken and waffles.  As my first experience with the combo, it was great!  It came with mac and cheese (good, but nothing awesome) and greens (decent, but not an expert).

Second time we ordered the 3 meat combo to share between the two of us and added on a side order of baked beans.  The combo came with pork shoulder (amazing!), brisket, (favorite one when you got an actual piece of meat, ours was 95% fat) and ribs (least favorite, lots of little bits of bone/cartilage).  The baked beans had 'hot dog' or some sort of sausage in them and were SO good; broiled on top so some of the sugars caramelized.  

The menu isn't huge and the 3 meat platter was plenty for the 2 of us.  Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Union Pig and Chicken is okay but not great.  First of all seating is at benches with strangers.  Second, the amount of food served is really for two people, which makes it expensive if you eat there alone.  Of course, one can always take the leftovers home and they do have nice take home containers.  The service was good with friendly waiters, but the meat is fatty.  Even the servers admitted that the meat had a lot of fat.  I ended up ordering fried chicken.  If I were to go back I'd try the BBQ chicken.  Being from the south I'm used to really good fried chicken and P&C has a lot to learn about fried chicken.  The vegetables were very good.  I got freshly grilled corn on the cob and collard greens.  I was surprised to see collard greens in Pittsburgh, but they were cooked like one would get at a good sole food restaurant in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Had lunch at UP and C yesterday.  Although the brisket sammich was very good (rather expensive), the sauces left my palate empty.  On their own, they were bland.  Mixed togehter (which I did for the second half) the flavor finally came through.
Brisket itself was quite good, very tasty and smoked to perfection.
I wanted to take some ribs home, but I smoke my own so the price kept be from doing so today.
Again, perousing the menu, couldn't help but notice the overall pricing.
If you find yourself in the South Hills, try Rowdy BBQ on RT. 51.  Great food at reasonable prices.
One of these days I will go back to UP and G for some ribs, which, for me, should be the standard bearer.  I will post again after I do."}
{"text":"In my experience, the worse a hole in the wall shack, the better the barbq.  I've never had quality barbq at a nice restaurant before.  Pig and Chicken is the first meal I've ever had (after 27 years of active searching) that bucked that trend like a wild hog!

They give you knives with your meal, but they are purely for show, the slow cooked meat they serve is so tender it separates if you so much as look at it.  We ordered the 3 meat combo with Ribs, Brisket and Shoulder, with a very generous portion of each (enough for 2-3 people to share) for $20.   All the different dishes here are so good I highly recommend either getting a sampler, or going with a group of friends so you can try a bite of everything.

We really labored, trying to decide which we liked best, but it changed with every bite.  I tend to douse meet in sauce, but this meat was so perfectly seasoned and cooked it didn't need anything!  That said, just for kicks I did try the sauces and they were all homemade and delicious.  Combine the barbq sauce with the habanero sauce for the perfect mix of sweet and spice!  The meat was fatty, but that's just a given with this type of food.  Since the meat was so tender you could just pull the fat off effortlessly.  The cole slaw was great (all vinegar based, no mayo so it wasn't heavy) and the corn bread was perfect for soaking up the leftover sauces and juices from the meat.  

The decor, name and food are all simple, straight forward,  and enjoyable.  The inside looks like a clean, trendy manhattan cafe had a love child with a barn in alabama.  They have giant solid wood slab tables for group seating, and multi color distressed wood boards covering all the walls.  The service is extremely friendly and fast (less than 10 minutes from when we ordered until we were served).

This place combines the best of both worlds.  The charm and service of a nice bistro with the great food, massive portions and low prices you'd find at a hole in the wall rib shack.  I doubted that any nice restaurant could do BBQ right, but Pig and Chicken has made me a believer!"}
{"text":"Disappointed again....

I bought a Groupon for Union Pig and decided to give them another shot. 
For $60 i got burnt ribs, soggy fried chicken, burnt dry cornbread and Robo coleslaw floating in dressing. The kicker was the frito pie that had the consistency of wet cornflakes!"}
{"text":"This was disgusting! Tried the ribs, brisket, fried chicken, mac, and beans. None of it was good most of it was inedible. The ribs were tough and dry, off flavors in the chicken made me question its freshness, the brisket was slimy, and the sides were gross. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"They have some seriously good fried chicken.  The kind that is crunchy, crispy, with flavor going all the way down to the bone.  I admit this place is a upscale BBQ place - which well doesn't make sense.  But who cares, when the food is this good!  I suggest you share your entree, portion sizes are huge and so is the price tag."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, but I don't understand why you would ding a pretty creative, pretty new, and pretty excellent restaurant a star because you think it's \"expensive.\" Union Pig and Chicken charges the prices printed on their menu, there's nothing nefarious about it. I mean, how can you tell us that \"you ordered one of everything\" and then complain about the bill?

It's one thing to say that Union Pig and Chicken is expensive relative to the quality of its product (it's not)--or even expensive relative to its execution--but it's quite another to say that Union Pig and Chicken is expensive (universally), as if there is some amount that \"BBQ\" (or \"Hotdogs\" or \"Pizza\" or \"Burgers\") ought to cost, independently of any other factors. Previous reviewers ought to better consider (or ask) what the overhead, including startup, pit boss, liquor, waitstaff, and product might be at Union Pig and Chicken? Who is laying out all this cash so that you can table-up and eat at this wonderful little restaurant in the first place? Don't you think they want their money back?

Don't get me wrong, I like cheap eats as much as the next guy on a budget; it's one of the main reasons I pay attention to reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. But it's just as silly to ding a restaurant for being good but too cheap (\"the food here is good ... you know, but they really ought to charge more,\" as it is to ding a restaurant for being too expensive (the food here is good ... you know, but they really ought to charge less\"). Sillier still, one Yelper even suggested that Union Pig and Chicken ought to be cheaper not because it sucks, but because it's located in East Liberty, as if the \"poor people\" of East Liberty ought to be told how much they can afford to spend on good food; that's not only silly, it's classist.

The fact of the matter is that an excellent BBQ spot has opened in East Liberty and it costs money to eat there. It's called Union Pig and Chicken and it's run by the same folks who brought you Salt of the Earth and the recently revamped Station Street Hotdogs. We tried it for the first time a couple nights ago, and we encourage you to try it, too.

Here's what we liked most: the BBQ sauces on the table and the brisket; the taste, moisture, texture, and savage presentation of the brisket were phenomenal. We also liked the greens, the mac and cheese, the \"store bought\" rolls, the knife work on the potato salad (which betrays the quality of your prep cooks), and the Rittenhouse (if you didn't know about Rittenhouse, now you do). We also liked the tattoos on your waitresses, (ahem, we liked your waitresses ...) and we liked your GM (?), a pleasant gal who stopped to ask us if our meals were OK. The restaurant has been designed, not \"put together\" after a trip to Ikea, and we liked the floor and walls of the interior (red gingham on the left, wood smokehouse on the right). We also liked the communal tables with separate benches, and the width of the benches themselves (not as narrow as picnic benches, but roomy and more inviting). Lastly, we also liked the fact P&C has a waitstaff that acts like a waitstaff (as if you were paying them to wait on you, which you are). They also had a hostess and GM on the floor, and on a weeknight. The place ran something like a contemporary restaurant, rather than like a \"shack\" or a \"pit,\" and it ran seemingly well for being so new. They even boxed up our left-overs like pros, in takeout boxes that I also assume cost money.

Here's what we liked least: the presentation of the pork shoulder, which tasted amazing and is a must eat, but which was essentially cubes of pork in a very dull bowl. We also didn't like that our waiter forgot to tell us about a cocktail with blueberry and mint that was not on the menu before we ordered cocktails. You missed a sale. The one cocktail we did try, with Old Overholt, tangerine, and herbs, was tasty but for us woefully lacking in booze; until this is fixed, I suggest that customers drink your booze straight, or drink beer. Our waiter was excellent as a waiter, but he also felt \"out of place\" given the look of your other waitstaff, a \"look\" that we assume must be partially intentional. We also didn't like that the painted metal supports of the benches and tables reminded us more of a locker room than of a picnic table.

Here's what P&C should consider implementing in the future: (1) a better way to deal with coats and purses (did we miss something?) since there are no chair backs; (2) a better way to deal with daily drink specials; (3) garnish (and booze) for their cocktails, which look (and so partially feel) underwhelming despite their herbaceousness; and (4) a small or large portion (and price) for proteins, or a smaller \"meat-and-three\" plate for solo eaters.

Go to Union Pig and Chicken, and If you want to pay less, order less. One main and three sides could easily be enough for two people. If you want to \"try more\" just go back another time. I know we will."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, our waiter was outstanding. I wood go back. Only concern was how loud the place is. No cross table conversations. My ears were ringing when we stepped outside. I wish the could be changed..."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely astounding.  There are not a lot of BBQ joints I can think of in the Pittsburgh area, so there is not much to compare it to, but the food is top notch, as is the service we received.

I originally ordered the Fried Chicken, however after she went to put our order in our waitress came back and told us that unfortunately they were out of that right now, and she apologized profusely.

Not a problem, I ordered the 3 meat special instead, it comes with ribs, pork shoulder, and brisket.  I also ordered a side of cornbread (apparently I was feeling as though I could eat the entire planet).

I'll start with the ribs - sweet Jesus.  So good.  I have seen other reviews say that they are dry, but that was part of the charm to them, in my opinion.  Often, ribs are completely drowned in sauce, and you end up covered in the stuff.  At UPC they instead chose to go with a dry rub on the ribs and allow the customer to put the sauce on themselves.  Wonderful choice.  I honestly ate mine without any sauce and have no complaints, the dry rub is fantastic and I wish I had the recipe for it myself.

The brisket was also delicious.  A bit fatty here and there, but cooked wonderfully.  Among the other food I had I would say the brisket was my least favorite.

The pork shoulder was....astounding.  Served in a dish cut into cubes, it's not how I am accustomed to eating that particular dish, but every bite was a bit of heaven.  The meat fell apart in your mouth, allowing all of the flavors to just rush out and be savored.

Now, as we were partway through our meal, the waitress brought out a tray to our table - full of fried chicken.  While we had been eating, the kitchen had cooked more up, and since we had not been able to try it earlier she brought us some out, free of charge.  She was absolutely wonderful.

The chicken was the greatest food we ate that night, and that is saying something.

It is as though was eating the flesh of angels, and it had been fried not in oil or anything, but instead in the tears of unicorns.  I cannot recommend the fried chicken enough.  It haunted my dreams the night after we ate it.  

My only real complaint would be about the seating.  While everything looks great and has a nice visual appeal to it, the way they have the tables set up (long tables with benches to sit on) didn't work well exactly for a slightly larger party.  For four people it would be fine, but we had six and it was somewhat difficult to have an ongoing conversation with everyone.  The benches are a neat idea, but difficult to sit in for an extended period of time.

Lastly, the drink choices are fantastic.  They work with other local companies and serve their products, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It gave me a sense of city unity somewhat.  The Wigle Whiskey cocktails we tried were all delicious, a much different flavor than perhaps some are accustomed to.

This is definitely somewhere you should check out, and try the chicken.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My trip to Union Pig & Chicken was long overdue, but when a groupon arrived and reminded me that this was on my \"must try\" list, I was on it.

We were seated upstairs and I was immediately intrigued by the fact that I was standing in a BBQ joint, yet the decor told me I was somewhere else.  I don't mean this in a bad way..it was upscale, tasteful, kind of minimalist.  The recycled-plastic outdoor wood pseudo picnic tables were a neat touch.  You know, that plasticky faux wood they use at newer playgrounds to make park benches and stuff.  Pretty cool.

Beer selection was very good, including some Pittsburgh brews on tap and a neat looking specialty drink list.  We stuck with beer, but I'd come back to try a specialty drink.

Our waitress was excellent and sat down with us for a few minutes to go over the menu options and provide some recommendations.  We decided to split a smattering of items to get the full effect.

1.  Fried Chicken (white meat) - delicious. tender, juicy, all those good adjectives one would use to describe excellent fried chicken.  They have a lunch special on this and if I worked closer to East Lib I'd be all over it.  $8 for 2 pieces of chicken, a drink, and a side.  That's a killer deal for this quality.

2. Brisket - a little slab of goodness.  It was very tasty - served like a little slice of meatloaf of steak, but fork-tender and pulls apart, with a nice little crust on the outside.  It was good with bbq sauce, good with the Carolina style vinegar, and good by itself.  Mmmm

3.  Pork Shoulder - don't get freaked out that it's served in \"cubes\".  The pork was fantastic.  I think I liked this better than the brisket.  It was probably my favorite.  I mixed the bbq sauce with a little of the habanero sauce for this.  I could eat a full pound of this straight up... no sides. 

4.  Mac & Cheese - good not great.  Cheesy and rich, for sure, but needed a little salt and pepper, of which there was none at the table.  Not bad, but I wouldn't fill up on this instead of other things.

5.  Cornbread - best cornbread I've ever had.  My wife almost ordered a second piece to go.  \"It tastes like cake!\", she exclaimed with glee.  It was really, really good and quite dense.  Not dry like many other cornbreads I've had.  $3 for a slice is a bit steep though.

Overall, we were both really impressed with the food and enjoyed the atmosphere.  To be clear - this isn't the kind of bbq place that's all about the sauce.  They don't have a plethora of sauce options.  This place is about the meat.  The sauce is a compliment to it, not a cover-up for it.  You're getting a supermodel with a little blush, not a back-alley hag covered with maybelline.

 I'm docking 1-star only due to price.  Not that the food wasn't excellent, but for some reason I have a hard time looking at the bill and realizing that it would have cost the same to eat at many other upscale places, but instead I got BBQ.  Damn good BBQ no doubt, but I don't know if the \"upscale bbq\" thing adds enough for me to warrant the extra bills or enough to make me choose this over other restaurants for my next date night.

I will say this - I was really happy to finally eat somewhere where they clearly wipe down the bbq sauce bottles at the table.  You have no idea how much bbq bottle crust ruins a meal before it even starts."}
