{"text":"My husband and I decided to break up the week and visit a new pizza place in Willoughby. It's called Bottega Bistro and we fell in love. When you walk in there is a huge board with so many awesome choices. There are so many pizza combo's and panini's not to mention the number of great beer choices. It was really hard to choose a pizza with all the different combinations, but we finally decided on \"The Pasquale\" which consisted of fresh peppers, onions, a combination of mozzarella/provolone and pepperoni which we substituted instead of sausage. Before our pizza we decided to order a chopped salad. I'm so glad we did because it was really delicious. 
Every pizza comes in one size only, has a thin crust and is baked in a stone oven. My husband still talks about a stone oven pizza he had once in Toronto and this ranks right up there. The pizza was done perfectly. The red sauce wasn't overwhelming and the ingredients were really fresh. We ate the whole thing. So much for the diet. Well at least it was thin crust. Before we left we asked for a menu to go, which they didn't have, but the waitress gave us the menu to take home. I also have to say that the waitress's were really attentive and knew the menu well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved it! I stopped by Bottega on a quick trip to Ohio from Michigan last weekend. They have a great selection of pizzas, beers, and cocktails. My aunt and I were pretty hungry so we each got our own 14\" pizza. She had the Bottega which is a nice combo of basil pesto and shrimp. I got the Therese which had very tasty white garlic sauce, chicken, a nice helping of spinach, and plenty of cheesy cheese on top. The pizzas are cooked right behind the bar in a big brick oven and they have perfectly thin crispy crusts, which is crucial when you're eating 8 pieces by yourself. No bread filling here. Be sure to check out the cocktail menu. I sampled a few experimental concoctions which may be making an appearance on the menu this summer and things were tasting good. Be sure to say hi to the bartender/co-owner if you want the inside info on what to order. Thanks Mike for a great dinner!"}

{"text":"I've been trying to get to Bottega Bistro for a few months and finally made it there this past Saturday.  I was really surprized that it wasn't more crowded, because the rest of downtown Willoughby was packed.

I love this place! Nice atmoshere.. Tribe game on the TV.  Life is good!  Great beer, great pizzas, and the bartenders, John and Mike, were really great at helping us choose the best beer!  Turns out our fav was called Flying dog raging bitch IPA.  Delicious beer and an excellent name.

I got the pizza with chicken, artichoke hearts, goat cheese, and spinach.  My friend got the marguerita pizza.  The marguerita pizza was a little skimpy on the fresh basil, and they happily sprinkled more on the pizza when we asked.  Pizzas have a thin crust and were nice and crisp.

We both ordered side salads which were really big.

John said that they are open on Sunday, which is a good thing, since most of the restaurants in Willoughby are closed on Sunday.  He called it  Sunday Fun Day, and I'm sure I'll go back to join in the fun!"}
