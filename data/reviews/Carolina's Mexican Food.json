{"text":"Great place, but I suggest ordering to go. Call ahead and pick up so you don't have to wait. 

I love watching them make the large flour tortillas in the back. Be sure to order a dozen to go. Everything is good on the menu, so you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I showed up at 7:48 on a Sat. night and was informed they were out of carne asada. Really? That's like an ice cream store saying they're out of ice cream. Don't go there, or if you do, good luck!"}
{"text":"Great tamales, fast food prices"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town!! Best pico de gallo, I buy it by the quart. Best tacos, the shredded beef are prolly my favorite. Can't wait till my next visit to Carolinas!!"}
{"text":"Not good. We arrived at 7:40pm on a Saturday night, typically right in the middle of the dinner hour, and half the tables had the chairs put up as they were preparing for closing. I got a #3 combo and two of the three items were cold as well as the rice. My gf's carne asada burrito was cold also, so they remade it, and it still wasn't very hot. No guac was on the burrito, just meat and a little pico. The chips were not good at all, they had a chemical taste. How do you mess up chips???? We will not be returning. I would put this on the same level with Filiberto's. Stick with Ajo Al's for mexican food, at least it's served hot."}
{"text":"Love it, I love this place so much I would eat here everyday if I could, Although I would probably weigh a thousand pounds.
I love the beef tacos and I don't think as many Mexican places as are in the state of Arizona I have found one that is comparable in quality . Hands down eat here !!!"}
{"text":"Tastes are always good, staff friendly, and atmosphere somewhere between shabby and a drive. Great place and family suitable. Never have had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Carolinas is pure happiness.  I go there atleast once a week.  The tortillas are made fresh and the salsa is amazing.  There's not a single item on the menu that I don't enjoy eating.  For a great deal go with the #3 combo which comes with a tostada, enchilada, beef taco, rice and beans all under $5.50"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends tried this place after hearing so many great things about it.  Food was delicious.  Only con is it was so busy and hard to find a table."}
{"text":"The food here is SO good!  The burros are excellent!  And the prices are just right.  I spent one week in Phoenix on a business trip and this was THE BEST Mexican food I had while there, and I ate Mexican almost every day.  The place was a little dirty looking but if you can overlook that, the food is so worth it! I can't wait to get back to Phoenix to go back."}
{"text":"The food is good, typical mexican restaurant.  The best thing about Carolina's is the tortillas.  They make them fresh, and you can take a dozen home with you-they are usually still hot. Soooo much better than the ones in the store!"}
{"text":"We have never walked in that there wasn't a line for good reason...fresh tortillas. Take home by the dozen. Food is just really good in a town with way to many not- so -good Mexican food spots."}
{"text":"Best tortillas in town!  Any burrito is fantastic as they use their famous house made tortillas.  And their salsa might be my favorite ever.  I usually get a double-wrapped burrito and then either a half or full dozen tortillas to take home with me."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and their tortillas and it was better than I imagined! The smell when you walk in the door is intoxicating!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the tortillas.  Buy a bag and try to make it home with them...yummy!"}
{"text":"Had a steak burrito it was pretty good, just wish the meat had more flavor. Will try again"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Best flour tortillas around and good customer service you gotta try this place!!!"}
{"text":"The food is the best Mexican food in the valley!  I take my out of town guests here all the time.  Wish it was closer to me, I have to drive 15 plus miles, but it's worth it!  The food is fresh and the salsa and chips are amazing.  My favorite place for good quality Mexican food.  Please open a location in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Best tortillas in town! I like the green chile burro."}
{"text":"Prices are great, food is delicious,  and we love the Christian music.  You can never go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food that I have found   Not fancy  inexpensive     Usually crowded but moves fast and is worth the short wait  Machaca taco or burro to die for ."}
{"text":"Carolinas is the pinnacle of Mexican in my view. My wife catered a birthday of mine from here.  The burritos and tacos are killer."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and reasonably priced. Love the variety of people here. Everyone is so nice."}
{"text":"After a visit to the hospital  I had my daughter  pickup  a meal for my wife at the Cactus  location . My wife gagged on this piece of string that was in a cheese enchilada from the number two plate. When I called to complain, one person tried to pass himself off as the manager on the telephone. When I insisted I speak to a real manager he handed the phone off to another person who presented himself as the manager.  I asked him to simply delete my charges and he demanded that I return with all the uneaten food.  He refused to cooperate with me.  He suggested that he needed to see the string.  I told him that I wasn't inclined to return to this place. I told him that he would have every opportunity to see the string when I posted it on Yelp.  He then told me to call corporate office if I didn't like that. Then he hung up on me. The restaurant is closed Sunday so on Monday I did call the corporate office. It turns out that the hang up guy isn't really a manager and that I needed to speak to a woman named Victoria. I provided a phone number for Victoria to call me back. No luck. I called again and left a number. Again, no luck.
We have been regular customers of Carolinas for over 30 years.  I don't like to be ignored,  I don't like them implying that I may be shaking them down for a lousy $15 , and I don't like my wife being fed a piece of string in her enchilada. Never again!

UPDATE!! No response from Victoria , however her office manager called back.  She did offer to refund ONLY the cost of the tainted enchiladas. The two red chili burritos we ordered but could not eat after experiencing the grotesque piece of string in our food was an item she refused to refund. The money isn't that important to me , I fart $15. But it is ugly that these people who do quite well have to be shamed into acting like a decent business.  It's just sad, and when you think about it, it's  a terrible business decision. Bravo Carolina's you are a Class Act."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food! Can't say enough about Carolina's. I was visiting Phoenix and stumbled upon this restaurant. A gold mine!"}
{"text":"Great food at an affordable price, one of my go-to spots when I'm craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been eatng at Carolinas for many a year when they only had the 1 shop on Mohave.  When I saw they were opening up on Cactus & Cave Creek,  I was very happy.  I would just like to add a few thoughts to the many reviews.  The consensus of myself and 3 friends that have lived in the valley for over 50 years is: #1 arguebly the best beans around #2 they do have the best tortillas and yes they should be a bit chewy.  The alternative is dry so they crack and leak, no way. #3 they have no salsa, they have hot sauce.  For me, way too garlicky, so I bring it home and docter it up to my liking.  Tacos are good, red and green chili better than average. chips over cooked, but better than tostitos.  Enchildas, better than av.  So all in all, its the beans that keep me coming back.  A mexican food rest. needs 4 things to be 5 star, Hot sauce, chips, flour tortillas and good beans.  Carolinas slips a bit on the hot sauce and chips hence the 4 stars.  \"and thats the truth\", Bob, Caio."}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast burritos. You'd be hard pressed to find better ones."}
{"text":"AWSOME as always, turn over in the wait staff, but service was great....not for kids and that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD:  Tortillas...soft, light, oozing with freshness...its all about the tortillas at Carolina's...and looking straight over the food counter into the kitchen where the cooks are lovingly tossing and stretching each piece of dough by hand

THE AVERAGE:  Bland decor and cafeteria style furniture  that they seem to have inherited from previous incarnation of this location

THE UGLY:   The fillings here have flavors so subtle (bland) that I couldn't taste much...looking around at the packed dining room, I thought may be I ordered the wrong thing...so I kept ordering...by the end of the meal I ate my way through the green corn tamale, the foot-long burro with house made chorizo, the machaca burro, the soft taco machaca and the green chile burro...I'm sad to report that  I couldn't find any tasty filling in all that

I wanted to like this place, but in the end, can't find a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Really like the food...but this policy of putting people on hold is extremely bad customer service.  Happened again just now...6 mins on hold...got to place before they bothered to answer phone. Asked why and just got that vacant look.  Whole point of calling it in is so you dont have to wait.

Trying other mexican places now that value customer service."}
{"text":"Really good and cheap Mexican food fast! Love their enchiladas, green chile burritos and tamales....all for under $5 each! Their salsa is hot and their tortillas are homemade and so yummy!

And although I love the Mohave location, this one is much closer to my neighborhood and it is much easier to park here. Plus it is larger which makes the \"survival of the fittest\" vibe a little less pronounced!

Yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't understand why anyone would wait in their insane lines for bad service and horrible food. Waited 15 mins just to order and another 30 for the food to be ready. We had looked at the menu ahead of time online just to be told that we couldn't order the items listed online. When we got our food it was cold. My burrito was so poorly wrapped that you couldn't even pick it up. The only reason the carne asada had any flavor at all is because it had so much salt on it. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love Carolina's. The tacos. The chimis. The kids meals. The tortillas. The chips and hot sauce. All so affordable. All so delicious. Not much more expensive than eating at Taco Bell. I eat here more frequently than any other Mexican restaurant. 

So why only four stars? The dining room can often be a mess. You order at the counter and are left to your own devices to see that a table is clean. Also, the maddeningly inconsistent wait times. Get your food in five minutes or thirty. You never know. 

The food is consistently good. Any frustrations with service are really just minor inconveniences. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The BEST!!!! Carolina's has been a Phoenix staple for years and finally made it's way to the East Valley. Green chile, red chile, shredded beef tacos, Oaxaca burros, you name it, best flavor in town!!!!!!!! Welcome to Mesa, Carolina's."}
{"text":"Consistently good food...Their Burros Rock!!"}
{"text":"During the hectic after Christmastime we decided to finally try much acclaimed mexican dining establishment. Here is our assessment:

VALUE  excellent
FOOD  good
ATMOSPHERE  poor

As the meals we ordered were tasty, the restaurant was freezing (no heat) on a very cold 40 degree evening. Our food became cool and definitly ruined it's flavor. Also neither of us liked the thin tasteless hot sauce...not even as good as Taco Bell!!! Why not offer a variety of salsas.  The place was packed with hungry customers and the food and reasonable prices keep the folks coming in. Personally I think there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"Not impresed . 
I usually give better ratings , but I have to stay with 3 stars on this one.
We took our friends recommendation , we made a mistake .
Willing to give em another try."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!!! We went in at 750 there was only five tables in there of people eating we ordered  it took them over 20 min to bring out our food they were cleaning and putting the chairs on the table with people still in there and another lady ask about the tea and the girl goes \"oh sorry we threw it away already\" the lady brought up that they didn't close tell 9 and it was only 815! They were more worried about closing and having everything done before 9 then serving the paying customers that were there! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Mexican food in Phoenix. Well...maybe not better than Rito's, but you can count on it being open a lot more! The majority of their menu items are the best in town. Can't go wrong with the Green Machaca...melts in your mouth. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better chicken taco. Anytime I'm close, I stop in for a bite to eat. A Phoenix must."}
{"text":"Call ahead for faster service.  #15 flauta special is very good.  Excellent salsa, tortillas, chips.  If you are feeling especially decadent, order the butter tortilla, heaven.  #9 crunchy tacos with beef are also a favorite.  This place is fortuanetly, or unfortuanetly, 2 minutes from my house.  It is addicting.  No fuss, just good authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Very busy place.   Big seating area. Yet, you may want to take it home.   Little warm inside.   Authentic Mexican Food.  Tacos are stuffed with shredded beef and cheese.   Enchiladas are a bit spicy.  Beans and rice are good.  They just need to add a little bit more.   Homemade tortillas bring back memories...yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Delicious is an understatement. Carolina's Mexican Food is one of the best, if not the BEST Mexican food restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. If you are in the mood for Authentic Mexican Cuisine, this is a must visit. There burritos, tacos, tostadas, and enchiladas are amazing. Each ingredient is tasty alone, but when combined; it's a miracle in your mouth. I never knew how good something as simple as a: bean cheese and potato burrito could be until I eat there the 3rd time. (I have probably  eaten here 900000000 x! :) ) I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A glorified Filibertos. I was extremely disappointed in everything. I ordered the carne asada taco combo with rice. The tacos were freezing cold and the rice was bland (no flavor at all.) It was dinner time when we were there so it was busy but regardless they should have had someone out in the lobby cleaning tables as people left. There were no clean tables at all! People were huddled by the drink area waiting for their food so you couldn't even fill up your drink. The salsa bar area was a disgusting mess, there were receipt papers everywhere, and the food was terrible. I'll give a good review when I feel the place deserved it but Carolinas is not going to be one of those places. Awful."}
{"text":"Great food, never have been disappointed, but not quite my favorite Sonoran."}
{"text":"Food..... was absolutely outstanding. I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas or shredded beef or at least I wasn't until coming here. The carne asada burro was great, the taco was perfect, and the chimi  my wife had was outstanding.

Ambiance.....this is cafeteria style. Nothing to write home about but very clean and plenty of elbow room.

Staff....very efficient and friendly.

Verdict...not the best Mexican in the world but a great meal and very inexpensive. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I love this place, every time I visit they have great customer service it's usually fast and we'll kept, food is amazing love love love Carolina's..."}
{"text":"Carolinas is a special little hot spot! Always great consistant food at good prices. Homemade tortillas that are heavenly. You can order a dozen  (or more) to go. I normally freeze half. It's fast homemade food that's always fresh. Refried beans are awesome. You can order a side of cubed potatoes that are made with real butter. There are tables to eat there plus I see alot of people picking up food togo. I've had green and red chilli ...Red is my favorite here. The rice is good but they use some kind of herb that I can't figure out what it is?...that I'm not absolutely crazy about"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.  They have really good food at a really good price.  I go to the one at 21st street & Cactus, which is pretty new.  Also, the one at 12th Street and Mohave, which is very old.  The food at both seems to taste the same, but I love the downtown location because it is a real dive = lots of character."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest Mexican food place in town but overall pretty good. They are known for their fresh tortillas. I enjoyed the enchilada plate I got there very much."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place  on Cactus and tonight we did. Never again. Nothing like I expected--guess I didn't know the type of place it was.
Everything served in styrofoam and plastic utensils. Ordered a tamale and a cheese enchilada. Could not differentiate which was which or if there even were two items.  There was not a single Mexican person in the place, Guess they knew. No thanks...."}
{"text":"Carolinas is on my way home. I go there only when I am too tired to go other Mexican place that is out of my way. The food is ok but be aware that is not authentic Mexican food. I usually get combination 9 which is two beef hard tacos with rice and beans. I should correct myself..rice is authentic Mexican style. Beans are if cheese is not added. We , Mexicans, do not serve beans with cheddar cheese. 

Today I asked combination 11 which includes  tamales. They are usually served with a salsa on top. I asked without it. When you eat tamales you evaluate two things. 1. masa (dough) 2. relleno (stuffing) the dough was perfect. The stuffing not. 

Service is excellent. I always call in advance 5 minutes and pick it up. My order is usually ready when I arrive.

I have never used their restrooms so I can not comment on it. 

If you are looking for ok food and do not care if this is authentic or not you would like it. I have friends that love its food."}
{"text":"Not bad, but also not the best I've had. The rice was mushy. It's super cheap, though. For Taco Bell-like prices, the quality isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"It's good every time. Pretty consistent with their other locations. It gets really busy in the evening so I'd recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Homemade fresh tortillas, need I say more?  Fantastic quality at great prices.  The decor isn't anything to write home about, but this place is all about in and out quick service and good food. 

I've sampled almost everything on the menu from some years of going here.  Now, I wouldn't rate the food a 5 star here, but the reason I give them a 5 star review is for the price and food.  if you want better Mexican than this, you're going to pay 3 to 4 times the price, have to sit down, and wait 30 minutes.  If you're looking for a quick and cheap lunch in and out, or craving some quick Mexican, check them out."}
{"text":"I've been going to Carolinas for years! Perfect if your in the mood for a filling high calorie splurge! The guacamole tostada, not on the menu, is delicious. Don't forget to pick up 1/2 dozen handmade tortillas. Often you can see them being made right there. This location used to an Asian restaurant and the markings of the old decor are still visible. Not much to offer n the way of atmosphere, but I have always found it clean. You have to order chips, which are fresh, but I think a bit overpriced. Call in your order 10 to 20 minutes ahead to avoid the sometimes long wait. Go directly to the cash register on the north side of the building to pick up your order."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Good food and great prices!  Very popular so be prepared for a possible wait for dine in but they do work really hard to get your food out asap!  Excellent for take out!"}
{"text":"I come here to buy tortillas. They make them like they are supposed to be- large, thin and delicious!"}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty, tasty!! Very fair prices paired with delicious food... why just 3/5??? 
Errors are too common. Ordered from a small group of us at lunch, 4 out of 5 orders had mistakes, and only 3 out of 5 were special order. Even a basic straight-off-the-menu gets screwed up? Come on, carolinas.
When we called about the errors, the restaurant finally offered to discount our next group order, but could not tell us by how much (?!)  When we DID order again, we were told at pick-up time that the discount was only good for a month (it had been 32 days!)! Really?!?!!
Thankfully, we called in order to get take out. The atmosphere inside this \"restaurant\" is one of a cattle barn at the state fair. Orders are taken over an intercom, food and styrofoam plates thrown around like hay bales, and customers are herded through like animals.
In summation, food was deliciously delightful, customer relations were poor, and the inside dining atmosphere was barn-like."}
{"text":"I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Impressed with the taste of the food. I just started work in the area and it's going to be trouble for my waist line. Reasonable prices and quick staff make it a can't miss. I have been to the other locations and this seems to be just as good."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. It has a distinct flavor that is unique to Carolina's. Often I'll find myself craving their food. The menu is simple. I can choose from variations of burros, chimichangas, or pick from their combination list. The real attraction is the speed of service - they're fast. You can see them hustling.

The dining area is ample. It's definitely not a fancy place, but it's great for a breakfast burro or lunch."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for the Carolinas mesa location. The S phx restaurant was so good when i ate there and i was so happy to hear a mesa location opened. I ordered the carne asada burrito, the mini chimi plate and a chorizo, egg, potato burrito. The beans and rice tasted like they had been sitting out for a long time.. and i ordered during the lunch rush, u would think all orders would be fresh. The red sauce tasted JUST LIKE marinara sauce, no spice or heat. The chorizo tasted dull and bland. The tortillas were ok.. they were homemade. But the chicken inside the chimis seemed reheated. I won't be back, sticking to los favoritos!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what is going with this place but the quality of food is going downhill! Ordered a taco salad and got a half-full bowl. By the time my girlfriend got to this half-full bowl the undrained juices from the chicken had turned the shell into complete mush. She couldn't even finish this half-full taco salad. Not sure if you got new staff or are just trying to cut corners, but this is not the quality of food I'm used to getting from this place."}
{"text":"A Great Regular go to place. I stop by all the time. Their flour tortillas are always warm and delicious I am a sucker for great tasting Mexican food and this place is ten times better than any filibertos. Definitely worth it if your near by. Go check it out if you can."}
{"text":"Most of the items are very good and very authentic. One of my favorite places to get Mexican food in Phoenix, and thankfully this one is very close to home. The flour tortillas are awesome - a little butter and salt, dash of Tabasco, and they really remind me of childhood."}
{"text":"Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Eat here almost every week.  Great food and great tortillas all at a fantastic price.  The salsa seems to be made fresh daily and is always very consistently good.  Nice select of soft drinks and frescas.  Really enjoy the taco's and the combination #4.

The place can get a bit busy but not as crowded as the original location."}
{"text":"The worst customer service possible I waited 15 minutes for an Egg burrito. They still hadn't put the order in so I asked for my five dollars back. Nobody was apologetic or seem to give a damn what was happening in that restaurant. Just to get someone to take my order was a challenge in itself and took at least a few minutes before anyone was at the register. If restaurant doesn't care about his customer service do you think it cares about its quality of food?"}
{"text":"The sauce for the enchiladas was raw chile powder and the tortillas tough and tasteless. A smearing of beans on the tortillas was hidden by almost a head of lettuce.
I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Best chicken chimichanga EVER. The tortillas are amazing...the burritos are delicious...don't even get me started on the salsa! Favorite mexican food place in the valley! Love!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty cheap and is one of the best places to get a quick Mexican food meal  in Phoenix.  I wouldn't say anything stands out with so many Mexican food places to eat in the Valley. It is mentioned in a few reviews that they are terribly slow at getting even the simplest orders out but, if you do decide to go and eat-in I would let the cashier know that you are taking it to-go.  They get those orders out faster than the dine-in orders."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends after seeing its Yelp ranking. I agree completely. The food was really good and the prices were juuust right. The food definitely isn't the healthiest, but honestly when it's that good it's hard to complain about it.
I have eaten here several times since my first visit and never once have been disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the problem is it takes forever to get your food the service is just a little bit slow"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Carolina's after all the great reviews.  Prices are average, and food is OK.  Nothing special.  I had the chicken enchiladas."}
{"text":"Moved up north from downtown Phoenix and was bummed that we wouldn't get our Saturday morning burritos from Carolina's in downtown Phoenix.  One day searched for Mexican food on yelp, and saw Carolina's on Cactus - could this be, could this be the same one?  Ordered our chorizo burritos, just as tasty as the one in downtown.  Tacos - much greasier here than downtown :(  Enchilada sauce - almost the same, but not exactly, Tortillas - just as good.  Overall, it satisfies our breakfast burrito fix, but is is not exactly the same as the one downtown."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Save your money and go to a newer fresher ingredients place.  I came here 2 weeks ago after a long day at work hoping to catch a quick meal.  I ordered 2 chicken tacos.  What I got was a soggy greasy mess with rice and refried beans that could be out of a can.  The are where the sauces are obtained looked old and dirty like no one had cleaned for a week.  I know this place has good reviews and is a Phoenix staple but I'm unimpressed.  Maybe once upon a time this place was the bomb, and that's why people keep going.   But as a first timer- it was gross at best and I can probably cook a less fattening meal at home.  Try paqime instead on central and Dunlap."}
{"text":"Food is pretty darn good. I have eaten here 2x this week and plan to eat here 2 more times. Thinking of buying a second home that is across the street so that i can eat here everyday.

I would say it is up there with Espo's and Backyard Taco as far as authenticity and quality."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their breakfast burros (no little burritos here). Trying their in-house made Egg, Potato, & Chorizo with Cheese burro was a revelation and I look for excuses to buy breakfast at Carolina's as often as possible. Their hand-made daily tortillas are 16\" of light, pliable, wheaty greatness. So Mexican that cheese & chicken are still advertised as new additions. No American ham, sausage, or bacon and you won't miss them at all.
When I visit during breakfast or lunch the parking lot is filled with pickup trucks carrying construction workers to the tastiest & most affordable Mexican in the Valley."}
{"text":"We ordered a cator meal for everyone and the portions were very very small and not worth the money we paid for.  The manager refused to do anything extra and said it was fine but it was not.  They said it would feed 8 people but not enough for everyone.  Very misleading and no future catering will be done with them."}
{"text":"I get the green chicken burrito or the machaca taco salad.  Delicious!  If you are getting your food to go, call in your order - especially around dinner time.  Otherwise it is a bit of a wait and the tables are often full."}
{"text":"I don't understand the fuss over this place. Yes, the tortillas are fresh and the family story is compelling, but my group agreed that the food was just OK, with a rather limited menu to boot. The restaurant interior itself is minimal bordering on unpleasant. Maybe the original location is better. We have no reason to return to this one."}
{"text":"Carolina's has terrible customer service.  They have repeatedly incorrectly filled our to-go orders, not including all of items we have payed for.  When I called to get a refund on the missing items, they were unable to provide the refund over the phone and required me to return all the way to the store.  We don't live close, so this was terribly inconvenient.  Their staff was unfeeling and unconcerned only citing \"policy\" rather than trying to help or correct their mistake."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic for mexican fast food. Try the guacamole tostada. You have to pay extra for a tiny bad of chips, but they are delicious.  Worth stopping by. Expect a wait or call your order in ahead of time and pick it up at the back register."}
{"text":"Buy some flour tortillas to take home for quesadillas and wraps.  they are almost  the size of hubcaps, thin and yummy!
Very casual, food served in styrofoam containers, no plates."}
{"text":"Went to Carolinas becuase everyone said it was amazing. I didnt think it was that great. To busy and nothing great."}
{"text":"Great food but very frustrating customer service. Called in an order and had it come back incorrectly multiple times"}
{"text":"Ordered large take out order for work. Five or six items left out and one item wrong. When we called back, we were accused of lying and that they gave us everything when we picked it up. When we went to go back and get the forgotten items, we were accused again. We order from there a couple times a month, but this was the last time. There are other restaurants with just as good food who know the value of customer service."}
{"text":"It's all about the food.  

And the prices are great.  I get a #3 (chicken taco, tostada, cheese enchilada, rice and beans) and a beverage for just over $7.00.

There is no ambiance unless you count \"non-ambiance\" as ambiance.  You'll be eating out of a styrofoam tray and plastic utensils while sitting in an echoing room at tables that, after the perpetual daily lunch or supper rush, may or may not be clean. 

So how can this get 4.65 stars?  (I had to round up.)  It really is all about the food.  

And there IS free wi-fi so you can dine and surf.  :)"}
{"text":"Food tastes good. Standard Mexican fast food. I would recommend the combos they offer. Pretty good value and lots of food. Delicious salsa and chips. Their homemade tortillas are a highlight. I also recommend ordering to go. Not the cleanest or nicest place to dine in. As others said, not too incredible but it's consistent and tastes good."}
{"text":"Was super excited for this place to open! Now I wouldn't have to drive to Central Phx!! So disappointed :( I've given it 2 tries and both times my order has been wrong! Service was okay but more importantly, the food was just bad. Plus it was cold!! They still have the best tortillas in the valley but what good is that if what's inside is horrible!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Mex food and this is the real deal. They remember me and Julie and are always friendly. They are ALWAYS busy,and it takes awhile to get the food,but its so worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have ate at Carolina's many times and thus far the only menu item I was not impressed with was the green chili, not sure if it was just the batch of the day but was very bland and tasteless. 

The Oaxaca(say it with me now: wuh-ha-ca) is amazing, best I've tired around but do order more than one (small size burro). The Zarape Special is my second winner of the menu and consists of three flauta's garnished beautifully with a homemade guacamole that is excellent, and again some of the best in town. Especially when compared to Filibertos.

Last but not least, their red sauce is addictive, with a noticeable garlic taste, wish it we were spicier though or that they had hotter options available."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place for cheap, delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here quite a bit.  Love the beef tacos...love the tortilla.  Until today I've never had a problem. 

Met here for lunch today.  Cashier was great. I was ordering flautas...I wanted beef and chicken.  He recommended the combo and confirmed I would be able to have mixed...2 chicken and 1 beef.  

It takes awhile for the food....not too long.  Well. Mine had only chicken.  No beef.  I let the girl at the counter know.  This is where it gets ridiculous.

She offered to take my entire meal and remake it.  No...I didn't want to wait for an entire new meal. My sister had her food and we were ready to sit down and eat.  
I asked if she could just make me one  beef.  
She said I would have to pay for it.
(I considered it...but it would be too much food for me)
I said.  Just take one of the chicken and give me one beef.
No.  She would not do that. 
I asked was she going to throw mine away.
She said...yes. She would toss my meal and make an entire new one.

So. I had 2 choices.  Buy a beef flautas OR wait for a brand new meal. 

I opted to just eat what I had.

The food was great.  But....the customer service was absolutely horrible. 

Why not just frigging make me ONE darn beef flauta.  You can toss ONE of my chicken...but why toss my entire meal and make me have to wait.  How hard is THAT????   YOU MESSED UP MY ORDER.....be a little accommodating. 

Hopefully someone from Carolinas actually reads these yelp reviews.  If you do. Talk to the chick that was there today about 130 or 2 pm

OH.. it was not busy and most of your tables were dirty."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. 
My wife loves bean burros, and these are some of her favorite in the Phoenix area (and we have tried most of them). The homemade tortillas are the best part for me. Actually, maybe the best part is that we fed a family of six people for $23."}
{"text":"Casual place, everything homemade. If your not close, it's def worth the trip. Made to order, everything is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Closed on Sunday! :( 

Best Mexican food in Phoenix!! Total hole in the wall, can end up waiting a long time for your order and 90% of the time they mess up, so make sure you check before you leave. Or if you eat there you can always bring it back up. Order & pick up at the counter. 

They make the tortillas fresh and omg are they delicious. I always get a cheese quesadilla and sometimes a chicken burrito with green sauce (extra onions), enchilada style, with a side of sour cream. Super cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Most plain green chili i ever had.  Hyped up just for the name.  Service was great overall."}
{"text":"Best tortillas......it is one of the best places Best tortillas......it is one of the best places to eat the burros awesome!!!!  to have great Mexican Food.. The service is great too"}
{"text":"The best food but needs to stay open longer!"}
{"text":"I normally don't rate this way because taste comes before anything else for me, but I couldn't even try the food here due to incompetent front register employees. I have young kids so take out is our preferred method of trying new places. I called to place an order and was asked to go on hold, I said sure politely, and then got hung up on. I figured it was an accident so I called again and no one answered the phone. Okay, I get that I am calling during a busy time. Called a 3rd time waiting for a long time, was put immediately on hold again and then hung up on. Maybe the food is good, but if they can't even take an order that is pretty pathetic service"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good place to go to for quick mexican food. Tortillas are made fresh (you see the ladies making them in the background). Been here countless times and not once have they messed up our order. Good place to go to for a quicker Mexican meal. Will continue to go here."}
{"text":"The food is very good! Their bean burrito enchilada style and machaca chimichangas are my go to! My only complaint is it's REALLY loud and always cold inside."}
{"text":"What happened to my family's favorite?  Very sad :( .  Smaller portions, higher prices, Lowe quality.  Fact."}
{"text":"Excellent service. I went with a vegan and the girl was able to help pick just the right food. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Driven by this place numbers of times, but got to experience it yesterday. The sign touts that they make their own tortillas and are the best. I was looking forward to trying this place, and although I'm not willing to write it off (as I like to try things twice before doing so), I can't say that I was really impressed.
I ordered a chicken burrito with green enchilada sauce inside the burrito as a combo. The burrito itself kind of reminded me of the Patio frozen burritos my dad would have in the freezer as a kid. Now, I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but there was certainly no wow factor for me. The burrito filling's texture was that of the frozen burrito, although the chicken was very tender and the tortilla was, of course, better than frozen.
As far as the best tortilla I've had? Far from it.
The salsa was the highlight of Carolina's. Very flavorful and I just wanted to put it on everything!
Beans and rice were the usual tasting filler sides.
The atmosphere of this place was very entertaining. You have to speedily grab a table while you can, as this place is packed! Reminiscent of a cafeteria, but just a little dirtier. I didn't mind in the slightest, and I think it added to the \"charm.\"
With Phoenix being a very big place, I'm sure there's better Mexican to be found."}
{"text":"Nothing like a handmade tortilla drenched in butter!  The Oaxaca Special is the perfect anytime burrito as well.."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Cactus Road restaurant since it opened. Never had a complaint until today. Not at all pleased with the new menu and for the first time our food was barely lukewarm. I understand that this is a busy place, but the food we received today was typical fast food fare not the restaurant quality we have been accustom to. It's close and cost effective but the quality of today's purchase will find me at a different restaurant."}
{"text":"My go to take out place.   Not close to my home but I make a special trip there every few months and buy 2-3 dozen burros and a load of beans to freeze.  Yum.  Best ever.   Became acquainted with them when I worked near their store on Mohave and have not looked back since.  Now go to the one on Cactus."}
{"text":"Carolina's is very hit or miss. I usually order for pickup. I have had amazing orders and orders that were soggy, sloppy made and not the best tasting. It's a very roll the dice Mexican food. When it is on, it's great, other days eh... keep driving. The tortillas are amazing, as are the mini chimis. The chips are LOADED will salt, but still good. Overall not a bad price and quick family dinner if running short on time."}
{"text":"I frequent Carolina's mostly for their breakfast fare and occasionally to buy tortilla's to take home.  They have reasonably fast service even when busy.  I like their Machaca and Chorizo with eggs...  I don't care for their addition of mashed potatoes so I get it straight."}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving something cheesy I always think of Carolina's quesadillas. Everything I've tried here is good, but the quesadillas really take the cake. The combination of fresh, homemade tortillas and gooey cheese is just perfect. If you haven't tried one you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I can only tell you about the \"non-meat\" options, because I'm mostly vegetarian.  The tortillas are great, the bean burritos are great, I especially liked the egg and potatoes breakfast burrito. I usually call to order and pick up a couple of burritos to take on my way to the airport because I don't actually live in Arizona. I live in Miami, but according to Yelp, I'm a \"regular\" here. Go figure. Oh, and prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Meh. If the Original Carolina's can't get it right, how can they expect a new location to produce quality food. I'm sure even the POTUS would say \"this is FAKE Mexican Food\""}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had in my life. Mouth watering temptations after leaving this place, will make you dream of Carolina's. Don't let the interior scare you, it looks bad inside.. but the food is amazing, so I can look last the building..lots of people working back there, the food is made to perfection. Incredible"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Arizona! I recommend so many people to come here and eat. I eat here at least twice a month. The food is fantastic! Always busy and always fast! The best place for great food! Amazing prices! I love to eat here!  :)"}
{"text":"Honestly just super mediocre. Just your average Mexican food place with greasy unimpressive food. The facility itself was nice, made me feel like I wouldn't walk away from another sketchy Mexican food experience with a weeks worth of diarrhea. Food was \"ehh\" just like every other Mexican food place in the area, nothing special."}
{"text":"Look, you want authentic Sonoran style mexican food like Arizonan's are used to then Carolina's is the place.

Best tortillas in town. LOVE the machaca, tamales, even the 2 beef taco combo!

The place is constantly packed yet she can still afford to be closed on Sundays. Normally, that would be considered restaurant death but not for Carolina's. What better sign do you need?"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at location near downtown, and found it tasty. I never been to this location so I can't speak for the food. This review is for the doordash option. When we ordered through doordash tonight we were really really looking forward to trying Carolinas again. HOWEVER after placing our order, we were informed that restaurant \"currently wasn't taking orders\". So my opinion is why would Carolina's offer this service if they can't fulfill the customers orders? I don't know if we will try eating from here at all. I feel like maybe Carolina's only fulfills doordash orders on their \"downtime\" versus making it a priority just as someone who would visit their establishment."}
{"text":"Had 3 tamales here today. - Very small and barely any meat filling. Will not go back. My friend also felt the food quality was lacking. Place was clean & busy so I guess other customers were satisfied with their food."}
{"text":"Have been going here since moving to Phoenix 1 1/2 years ago. Previous visit was given wrong order (1 item). Few days later mgr issued a credit to use at later date. Went back few nights ago prior to dinner rush. After waiting 35 minutes asked clerk for my food (again 1 burrito). Was advised given to wrong person, but found it for me. Got home again with the wrong item. While there during my lengthy wait noticed many people returning orders that were filled wrong. Food here is good, NOT great & definitely not worth being abused continually by the inept staff. Phoenix is loaded with great Mexican food & this one is not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I went for the first time after reading the competition article in Phoenix New Times about the Chimi debate between them and Tee Pee. Both are equally good don't get me wrong and really it's like comparing apples and oranges. I really enjoyed Carolinas enough to buy a dozen tamales to take home to keep in the freezer to pull out when I need a quick fix."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes I've tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side."}
{"text":"Nonexistent customer service.  Carolina's claims to offer catering services, but they didn't respond at all to our email or phone call to cater an event.  They have an entire portion of their website dedicated to catering and yet, they don't take orders. Hmm. We were excited, had everything picked out and contacted them - twice - days ahead of their 24 hour deadline and NO response.  A good business would have at least responded to say they were totally booked, had a kitchen fire, that the catering business was dead, whatever the reason they had for being unavailable, especially when they still have the restaurant open. 

I see a bunch of (mixed) reviews for their lunch hour service; can you imagine if 50 people came in during their lunch hour and were simply ignored by Carolina's employees? Yep that's pretty much the amount of business they lost. 

Bottom line, Carolinas doesn't seem to offer the catering services that they advertise, so don't waste your time. We went with another company that responded promptly, did a great job and even followed up afterward!"}
{"text":"Carolina's is our new favorite for fast, cheap, spicy, awesome Mexican food.  How can you go wrong with homemade tortillas (they sell them by the dozen, cheap, and way better than what you'll get at the grocery store), chips, salsa, and my favorite, a red chile burro?  You can't.  The spice is perfect, hot but not overpowering of the flavor.  And 3 of us can eat for $20.  Where else can you get that kind of price with this kind of quality?  There's a reason we're regulars here!"}
{"text":"They have the best hand made tortillas in the valley. The food is always fresh and handmade!  This is truly a Phoenix original.  The Phoenix location is my favorite but the other two awesome.  I always get a bean and cheese burrito double wrapped.  i love the tortillas."}
{"text":"Love this place! High quality inexpensive food. I'm a rolled taco fan and these are the best I've had. Clean, friendly, fast."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good.  I go to Carolina's at least twice a month, sometimes more.  They don't necessarily have the best Mexican in town, but they are really consistent and solid.     Since I have moved to Phoenix, I would say for the prices, its one of the best places to dine in or get carry out.  My lady and I have sampled majority of their dishes and most of them are really good.  Our favorite is their green chili.  Get that on your Carne Asada burrito!  It's my go to meal.  We usually get their combo plates, the enchiladas, burritos,  machaca, tacos, chorizo are really good, the only thing I didn't care for are their tamales.  Maybe I'm used to eating my family's tamales, but just not a fan of theirs. Also make sure you get a sample of their salsa, its really good, not really spicy, but flavorful.  I could drink that stuff.

Overall, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best inexpensive authentic mexican in town with the best tortillas you will ever have. Green chile pork will make you have dreams about it."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.

She was totally spot-on.

These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.

I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.

I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!"}
{"text":"Great food @ a great price. Gluten free options and did I mention great tasting. You are paying for taste, not atmosphere. Would recommend again and again. Also, playing Music that is uplifting and encouraging."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mexican food in Phoenix. Tortillas are to die for. Beans are delicious. Everything on the menu is out of control tasty...and really cheap. I love patronizing this hardworking staff!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype??  It's basically a Filaberto's you can sit down at.  Don't get me wrong, I like Filaberto's but this is literally the same food - so what is the hype?  It's good. But I'm perplexed lol"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but every time I go now, the service and quality just plain suck. 

The last 3 times I have bought  guac from them, labels, slices of skin and brown guac are what I get. I used to really love their guac but I can't even bring myself to purchase it again.

The service that I get is just getting worse and worse. The kids they used to hire were really cool and respectful, now they are nothing but jack asses. 

I used to love this place but as of today I won't be returning. It's a shame because I know the family used to take pride in their food and service."}
{"text":"I read somewhere today that Carolina's uses a ton of lard in cooking their tortillas and I say... awesome.  Use whatever you have to Carolina's but keep that taste sensation coming.  

My normal order, because I can't bear to be at Carolina's and not have this, is the green machaca burro, add potatoes.  And it's amazing.  Every single flipping time, it's amazing.

I'm really happy I just ate (unfortunately non-Carolina's) or else I would be seriously tempted to abandon work and drive the 8 miles for that burro right now."}
{"text":"Had a problem with a large order.  The manager took care of it ASAP!  First class customer service and the subsequent order was perfect."}
{"text":"Still feel like this place is highly overrated.  Have gone 2 different nights for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. I've heard and read really amazing things and how this is the best Mexican food in Phoenix...and it is not. It's mediocre and lacking flavor. Meh."}
{"text":"Pretty good and authentic Mexican food. The atmosphere is very fast food like and most customers take out. Enchiladas are very good and are cheap."}
{"text":"Best red chile and Im picky"}
{"text":"I will make this short and sweet. Called in a phone order, waiting for me when I walked in. Food was awesome. Thank's Carolina\"s for opening in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I'm a Chicago native that visited Phoenix and people raged about Carolina's when I asked them where I should eat. All in all it was a pretty good experience... this was the only place where the food was good and I didn't spend $30+. I paid around $10 for a huge meal and stuffed myself.

I would avoid their new chicken, it was something new we saw on their menu and figured we would all try. It was really bland and tasted like crap. I think you would be fine with anything not chicken. Their beans/rice were pretty good, and they definitely loaded you with everything. If I had to go back I would stick with steak/beef/pork, and I would definitely go back. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Never been to Mexico, so what do I really know? But this place feels pretty authentic. Everything I've had has been good; I go for the tacos!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall spot! I love that is family owned and operated! Can't wait to go back and get some more fresh tortillas and Guacamole."}
{"text":"Initial thought: A more \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant than chipotle. 

Modern and hip interior design but I'm still confused if this is suppose to be \"authentic\" or is a bite off a true Hispanic restaurant. The food is decent for the price range but I DEFINITELY HAVE HAD better tasting Mexican food for a lot less. I would NOT take my Hispanic Fiancé here to eat. Target demographic is defiantly non-Hispanic and I would say it is pretty decent. If you want a true authentic Mexican dish, then this is not the place to eat. 

Rice and beans are ehhh..."}
{"text":"Pretty good hardshell tacos filled with cheese-yum!! Cheap food and was not super oily. I think its family owned as well."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible dining room.  

Carolina's has excellent, cheap and very filling food.  Their Carne asada is done right and flavorful and their tamales are the best readily available options in an area saturated with fast Mexican food.  The interior of this place looks exactly how you would expect a place that churns our a ton of delicious and super cheap food.  It's packed and dirty.  I'd almost suggest they give up on trying to keep everything clean themselves and just leave out a bucket full of bleach water for everyone to use.  Maybe someone with some crazy OCD would wander in every so often and wipe the tables down.  

I suggest you call ahead. The lines can get long and there's a separate register for people who called where the food is distributed away from where the masses order."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at, staff is polite and quick at what they do, I ordered 2 tacos and a lemonade with rice and beans on the side for lunch and it filled me right up the tacos are decent size not small at all and only spent 8$ on my order with free refills :)"}
{"text":"Carolina's has always been our family favorite from going to Paradise Valley to the one on Mojave and it's never been a miss, Until now our food was somewhat cold, the beans were horrible not like what we were used to. If you want to eat the real Carolina's don't bother going to Mesa."}
{"text":"Don't understand all the rave reviews for this place's food. The chicken burrito was horrible and had a funny awful extremely spicy taste.  The prices are out of line for the serving size and food quality. That red sauce coming out of the dispenser?-horribly bitter and too hot tasting. I'll take any other Mexican restaurant over this place-Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best cheap, no frills Mexican food in Phoenix. Their tortillas are next level, the beans & salsa are delicious, and you can't beat the price for a $4 burrito. The green machaca is an absolute must order!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in the valley. I have eaten at the Mohave location for 30 years and so glad to have a location in the east valley. I hope they can open one in Chandler eventually."}
{"text":"one of the only Mexican places I truly enjoy in the Phoenix area...their Machaca is off the charts and second only to their hand made tortillas....if you want a treat, try and buttered tortilla - YUMMO!!!
Tamales, Burros and Chimis are also great!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place...the shredded beef has been freshly prepared every time I go, the hardshell tacos are not the healthiest, but who eats Mexican for the health food! Love the hot sauce, love the place!"}
{"text":"So impressed with the new Mesa location! The ambiance is certainly improved from the original location in Phoenix on Mohave! As usual, the food is excellent! All three of us left with a dozen freshly made flour tortillas! My only concern is that every staffer on the floor today was \"in training\"; therefore, none were able to answer questions without a wait for an answer! Needless to say, this new location was slammed with diners! Congratulations for the wisdom to open a location in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Not what I had years ago! Tortillas turn into mush after a while and the green Chile, no green color flavor blah!"}
{"text":"Arrived right at 8am and there was a line of 20+ people waiting in line. Line moved very quickly and service was wonderful. Food is just like the original location. Thank you Carolina's for coming to Mesa!!"}
{"text":"Why can't I give Carolina's SIX stars? I L-O-V-E this place and, if I could come to terms with being 500+ lbs and seriously reducing my life span, I would eat here twice a day. The Number 3 is where I go every time....taco, enchilada, AND tostada.....plus one of their amazing parachute-sized tortillas to compliment the meal. Their salsa is addicting, as well, and I go through a minimum of 6 small cups per meal. 

Another thing I love about Carolina's is that they haven't sold their soul to the soft drink corporate incentive gods....i.e. they have BOTH Coke and Pepsi products (as well as some exciting punches!).....way to give your patrons what they want! 

Lastly, if you ever want to cheer yourself up or just throw an impromptu party at your cubicle, go to their main website ( www.carolinasmex.com ) and let the sweet music brighten your day. I dare you not to smile!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Better than the average Mexican food joint. However, that's all there is to this place. The food is pretty good not great, not really worth getting out of your car for as there is no drive thru."}
{"text":"Really good food at very cheap price. Had a chorizo and bean burro, chorizo tostado, and beef taco. All were delicious. Lettuce and tomatoes were super fresh. Whole meal plus soda was $11."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, but worth it! The food is consistently good. My kids like watching them make the tortillas fresh! I can feed my family of 6 for $40 with leftovers!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the highly rated tortillas, that are indeed huge! It was busy because the food & service was awesome! I bought 4 dozen tortillas, which are served to you still warm & freshly made. While I was there I decided to add a quart of beans and a quart of red chile. I'm so pleased I did, SCRUMPTIOUS! Brought it all home to my family & we are happily eating leftovers the next day. Delicious, well made food"}
{"text":"Love love love the food here! Staff is always friendly and service is always incredibly fast.  A great place to hit for a quick bite and that Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Pretty good carne asada burritos, the tamales are very tiny, bit of a wait time for food considering it's always busy (been here about 3 or 4 times so far). The traffic in that area is really congested, and the parking lot is completely dark so be careful not to hit any drifters that are really common in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. It is very clean and new. Lots of seating both inside and out. The food is excellent and they make their own tortillas in house daily. 
I have been to their central Phoenix location a couple of times and it is in a not so great part of town and frankly is pretty old and run down. That DOES NOT affect the quality of the food one bit. This new location is in an older building but has been totally renovated and is awesome. 

Don't miss the opportunity to check this place out even if you need to drive to get here."}
{"text":"OMG!!! These tortilla's are off the hook!  I really enjoy going here for breakfast, nothing like taco's and cheese tortilla to start the day off.  My family can kill a dozen fresh tortilla's on the way home.  Better buy two to go."}
{"text":"So my mom came into town last night and after a night of drinking at Finnegan's, my belly was asking for a tasty Carolina's burrito. My mom was impressed with the homemade tortillas and enjoyed two green tamales, a chorizo burrito and coffee. Hubby ordered chorizo, egg and cheese burrito, that disappeared in minutes. My taste bud enjoyed each and every bite of my potato, egg and cheese burrito......like a bite of heaven. The bill was super cheap, 15 for three people! We left full and smiling."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist.  When I'm in town, I like to stop by Carolina's for lunch at least once.  I have great memories of ordering a couple of burritos before a spring training game and eating them in the parking lot before the game.

So, I was in town and stopped in and ordered a red chile burrito and green chile burrito.  This is where my memory may be faulty.  I don't remember them being this small or this expensive (for the size).  Taste wise, they seemed a little lackluster.  And finally, they were wrapped in something like tissue paper which could hold together.  I think I need to start looking for alternatives."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food in mesa. Everything is made fresh every day and you can really tell by the end product. They claim to have the best tortillas in town and i believe it. Eveyone at our table enjoyed what they ordered and I was even debating ordering more after my original entree, and not because I was hungry just because I genuinely enjoyed their food. I would recommend to anyone. Service was quite fast as well considering how packed they were! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here for the very first time and I thought that the food was delicious! I got the chicken chimichanga and the outside of it tasted like an egg roll which I thought was very tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy, which is probably an indication of its quality. If my review was only based on their bean and cheese burritos, I'd give them a Five Frijole review instead of Four. Seriously their bean & chz burritos are the best in Phx. Reason I give 4 stars is because the tacos are just okay. Not great but good enough. Definitely try the burritos. Hot sauce here is great too."}
{"text":"Carolina's has some really good food.  My favorite is #16 which is the Chimichanga (I get mine with machaca beef) with rice and beans.  LOVE this, it is really good.  The beef is amazing, the rice is really good and so is the beans.  They are famous for their flour tortillas which I find to be just ok.  Then again I woke up every morning to that wonderful scent of homemade flour tortillas...my Grandma in the kitchen making her flour tortillas from scratch. Carolina's are ok, too big...amazing flour tortillas is not about the size is how they are made and what they are made of.  I did buy a dozen to take home and see how they would um \"hold\" up, they didn't...they got ROCK hard fast.  And who has a comal that big to accommodate a flour tortilla that big? I always come back though for their Machaca beef burritos and the #16. Oh and let me say this one other thing, I ALWAYS order cheese inside my Chimi, they NEVER put cheese inside, NEVER! I know they put some cheese on top, but even when I have asked them to put some inside as well...they don't! So don't bother asking."}
{"text":"hollllly hell, this place is hands down the best mexican food restaurant in Arizona! Their tortillas are bomb and so is everything else on the menu! And you won't break the bank, place is CHEAP! looking forward to visiting their new location in Mesa."}
{"text":"Well Carolina's is just freaking yummy. It's so good. It's also so cheaply priced! The menu is varied, the take out is fast, and the staff is friendly. They have a salsa bar and varied soda machine.
I have to knock a star off for the inside \"dining\". It reminds me of a school cafeteria. A big room with old tables that remind me of card tables. They also play strange Christian songs when on hold for takeout. Be advised they are closed on Sundays.
Give a call and do some takeout. The food really is great and they certainly don't skimp on cheese and other ingredients."}
{"text":"Awesome green chilie and bean burro.  Get it enchilada style!  Yummy!!!!!  My fiancé loves the red chili burro special.  Great service and wonderful Mexican food!  Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the area and price. I am a huge fan of their tortillas and bean burritos."}
{"text":"Love their tacos! Family run, very nice guys.  Their tomatillo salsa, purchased not the free sauce,  is very tasty.  The prefect heat for me.  Also their guacamole is very good.  Fast casual Mexican."}
{"text":"I guess if you're willing to wait for 45 minutes, spend a ton and get mediocre (at best) food, it's good. Oh, and don't forget them losing your order 16 times. Save yourself the money, eat at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant using Yelp!  Wow, a great choice.  Even if you don't like frijoles, you gotta try theirs!  Incredible!  I had enchiladas and they were great.  Portions are very large so I suggest not ordering a whole lot to start with - you can always order more.  Be prepared to wait - it is about the most popular restaurant I have visited in a very long time (you know its good when the Police and Fire Departments eat there).  Oh, also try the buttered flour tortilla - yum!"}
{"text":"Green chile, green chile, green chile!!! Need I say more. There was a line out the door when I arrived at 2 pm on a Saturday. They moved through it very quickly, however. This a very low key joint, the food is fresh and delicious. I got a chicken chimichanga with green chile on top. This smothered delicacy almost forced me to take a nap before driving home. I paired it with some horchata, which came from a fountain, but was surprisingly palatable. The price was about $9 for a meal and a drink. And one order of chips is enough for 3 people to share."}
{"text":"Place was overly packed when I visited.  Not impressed with their carne asada but their bean burritos are good."}
{"text":"I dont get why people love this place. I came because of the word-of-mouth; I thought it was fine but just fine. Definitely not worth driving from downtown Phoenix. If you're going to go don't believe the hype and you will probably enjoy it."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch as I was in the mood for some green chile burritos.
I have been to this restaurant before and it did not disappoint. The green chile was on the money. My wife had chicken flautias, and they were great.
The red chilli on the other was good, however the meat was not as tender.
I would still return here. The food is great..."}
{"text":"Not all tortillas are made equal, and there is no question that Carolina's makes the best ones.  They're huge, not super greasy, and perfectly made so that they don't break even when they are overfilled with goodies inside.

I'm partial to stuffing my tortillas with green chile and chorizo w/ potato, but even if you just fill those tortillas with only cheese, you've still got yourself a real treat.  Do yourself a favor and skip the Mission tortillas at the grocery store, and pick up a dozen at Carolina's!"}
{"text":"The best hot fresh tortillas ever.  As a matter of fact, that's all I need. They won't even make it out of the parking lot.  The other food is awesome as well.  Favorites are beef tacos, cheese enchiladas, chimichangas.  This place is always packed for a reason.  Great prices. Definitely not fancy, but the staff is friendly and fast!  Perfect for takeout. Great for catering as well.  Be prepared to wait because they are always packed!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican food place in the world. I used to live right down the street from this location and it was a frequent stop for me. Even when I moved up to Flagstaff for school, I would always always always have to stop by Carolina's when I was visiting home. The wait can get long during peak times, but your food will never be cold and it'll always be worth the wait. Their shredded beef tacos are my go-to but everything else on their menu is wonderful as well. Make sure to grab a buttered tortilla too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been back there twice in the last week. Ordered the number 13 combo. Mini beef chimis were great and so we're both sides, beans and rice. So glad they finally opened in Mesa. Line was huge the opening weekend but not as bad today. This will be a regular stop for my family."}
{"text":"My first visit to Carolina's is now my last.  Not impressed with this place, whatsoever.  Prices were low but so was the quality of the food.  My green chili burro was bland and the beef chunks were tough as nails.  The green corn tamale was a mushy mess.   The chips were over cooked and tasted like cardboard.  The salsa was nothing to write home about.  However the tortilla on the burrito was awesome.  If you're looking for a GREAT green chili burro...go to RITO's."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. Thought we would try this new place. Ordered at 535pm. Didn't receive our order until 620pm. This is a casual dining place?? 

They slapped us in the face again when they got our order wrong. Come on. I'm just laughing at this point.

Any response from the manager? I will probably never hear back."}
{"text":"New to Arizona and we've checked out many Mexican restaurants being that it's my favorite food... I totally recommend Carolina's it is delicious! It's usually a little crowded but pretty fast to get seats and service is fast!"}
{"text":"Carolinas is a AZ staple for fast casual Mexican food.  They have been around for years and haven't tried raising their prices to extortion level as some other local places have.

Super thin light huge tortillas.  Excellent bean burros.  Good beef tacos.  Solid menudo and breakfast burros.  

This location is much cleaner than the one on Peoria and the 101.  

Fast, good price, good food.  

What more do you want?"}
{"text":"The only reason I give Carolina's two stars, is because the people here, are very nice. I realize, food reviews are very subjective, but I've never seen the big attraction of this place. I LOVE Mexican food, but this place is at best, MEDIOCRE, and that's on a good day. My son and I, went into Carolinas to eat, last night, and I felt as though we were in a dairy barn. There were flies, EVERYWHERE. Flies light, on feces, then they light on you or your food. And, it's been that way, for the last several times, I've been there. I'm very concerned about my personal hygiene, so I know it's not me. I observed, several other patrons, swatting flies, as well. It's a wonder, Phoenix Health Department, hasn't received complaints. One more place, for me to cross off of my list. Too many, GOOD Mexican eateries to spend my money."}
{"text":"The tortillas are so big and taste so fresh! The burritos are pretty good especially the machaca green chile burrito with potatoes. Sadly, they have shrunk in size in the past few years. I remember their burritos being bigger and more flavorful. The chicken flautas are pretty good except I wish they had more meat. Don't be stingy!

This place is the spot that me and my family get together at for reunion's."}
{"text":"This is a go to lunch spot for my coworkers and I. Recently it has taken a while to get our food, but if you dont get here by 1130am during the week this place fills up very quickly. 

The chips and salsa are a must! 

I usually get the chicken taco's but we have ordered a lot of different dishes off this menu and we never had something we didn't like."}
{"text":"My rating is a little weird.. and I'll tell you why...

I LOVE the food here at Carolina's.  I love their red chile cheese enchiladas and their beef tacos.   The tortillas are amazing.  I can't try a lot due to my tomato allergy, and I do NOT trust the service in the restaurant enough to try to navigate the whole - \"please let the kitchen know of my allergy, so no cross contaimination\" speech, because I will end up dead.  I don't think they care that much. 

So, the food is amazing, the staff is uncaring... what's next?  Oh... the restaurant.  It's uncomfortably dirty... 

HOWEVER, their catering service is off the charts FANTASTIC!!!   Anna, in the catering department, could not be nicer or friendlier.   I have ordered food for both my office (parties of 20) or for home (parties of 60) and each time the food is amazing, well packaged, and ready to serve!     They even have delivery service available for catering.   Anna pays extra special attention to the fact I am allergic to tomatoes and not one tomato has shown up on the trays.  

So, I highly recommend Carolina's for catering an event and maybe consider taking the food to go rather than eating there.   Just sayin'...."}
{"text":"I can't stress how good this place is for authentic Mexican food. It's not fancy and you can tell by just looking at the place, but all their effort goes into making the best food for a great price and I believe their food is the best authentic Mexican  North of the boarder."}
{"text":"I walked into Carolinas at 7:00 and and was tired I've been to other Carolinas and they had great service and had good food but when I came to this one I waited 30minutes for my food I asked for an individual Tortilla to snack on while I wait and it took 10 minutes to get it when I did get it was cold and when I got my food it was cold and soggy the staff was very slow and not very good 2 other people walked out while I was there"}
{"text":"Basically instant diarrhea. Driving out of the lot after eating their \"food\" I felt a pinch and then a slow burn in my gut. I knew what this meant for my afternoon. Was it the luke warm bean spread tostada? Was it the salsa that comes out of a ketchup dispenser sitting on a countertop surrounded by flies? Or perhaps it was the cooked, frozen, microwaved meat filling from the taco that was somehow both burning hot and ice cold? Either way, it did the trick. I had to drive home fully clinched making sure to race through all the yellow lights. Why didn't I go in the store? Well their one stall in the men's room was occupied by another satisfied customer. You don't own Carolina's, you just rent it."}
{"text":"Where to begin?

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. 

It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.

If you haven't gone... you're missing out."}
{"text":"I've frequented Carolinas over the past few years and have had mixed experiences. The last two visits have been subpar and today's experience inspired me to leave this one star review. I decided to stop in for a late carryout dinner at 730pm hoping to get in and out quickly. To my discontent, it took me nearly 25 minutes to get my food (2 tacos, beans and rice). There's absolutely no reason why tacos should take more than 5 min to serve, especially at a restaurant who specializes in them. By the time I got home five min later the food was lukewarm and the chicken tacos severely lacked in flavor. If that wasn't bad enough, I only received about a spoonful of rice with my meal. Not even enough rice to feed a small child. This is not what I was looking forward to after a long day of work. This experience will probably be my last at Carolina's."}
{"text":"Carolina's Mexican Food has always been a favorite comfort food when I'm in the area. There is one closer to my house in NE PHX but this location is right by my work. Yes!

Inside is nicely decorated with a comfortable dining area and plenty of room to move around. You basically order at the counter and wait for your number to be called out. Sometimes the wait can be quite a bit long and it only makes my stomach want to scream out \"hungry\" amongst the crowd. Good thing there is plenty of background noise to cover up it's growls.

Usually order a couple of Machaca Burritos and maybe a Hard Taco. Their tortillas are very fresh and made in house. You can just order them with a little butter and dip them in their yummy homemade taco sauce that they have on the side counter. So good!

Their menu has a good mix of all the standard Mexican Food items. You can go all out and get a delicious combo meal with rice and bean or order several a la carte items as I usually do and eat them separately throughout the day or maybe go crazy and eat them all at the same sitting.

This is not a fancy restaurant and the service is very basic. The food is not what I'd call authentic or traditional Mexican and is more of a fast food version of what you may see around town at similar places. 

Get there early before the crowd and you will find a decent seat to enjoy your meal. The higher chairs and tables along the windows are a great place to cool off while you eat. For whatever reason the air vents blast right out and hit you right in the face. Not a bad spot when it is 119 degrees outside and you need to chill out for a few. OH YEAH! 

3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get some really good Tex Mex in this part of town. The food is always fresh and the seating area is usually packed full of happy customers.

Normally get one of their tasty Burritos and drench it in their homemade salsa. The Tortillas are made to order and this is definitely what makes this place so wonderfully delicious.

The menu here is pretty large and offers several combination plates as well. It is always fun watching the newbees standing in line with all their excitement. You can tell they have not been here yet and can't wait to check it out.

Get here early for lunch or visit during off peak hours. The seating area gets very crowded and you may even get to share a table. No worries. Everyone is super friendly here.

This is not a high end restaurant and it more or less reminds me of the kind of Tex Mex that we used to eat back in TX. Just fresh fast food and a simple eating area to consume it.

Bring the whole family and a hearty appetite. This place is great for kids too. Just remember those delicious tortillas can be brought home for a snack later too. ESTOY LISTO!

{"text":"I have been going to Carolina's for over 5 years now. In the past year I have been very disappointed. The great taste is still there but the have cut down on the amount of beef they put in the hard taco. Taste more like a lettuce and cheese taco.   My entire family loves the red chili burro with bean's. Not anymore your lucky if u get one piece of beef! We ask for extra meat and pay the extra $1 but 90% of the time they don't add any extra meat. Don't waste your money! Seams like their trying to cut back to make ends meet. It's not like their prices are cheap either!"}
{"text":"I love this place! There are other locations! Be careful of high volume times cuz it gets crowded! I love the tacos and redchille!!!"}
{"text":"My aunt took me here! She bought a deal chicken or something :) I got a tostada good but nothing amazing she got green chilli chicken. All average but their tortillas so good! On point and delicious at home with butter. Place was really busy but I'm not sure if it was because the deal was expiring or if people really love this place. - one star for being a bit on the dirty side!"}
{"text":"We really like the food at Carolina's!  The prices are fair, not the cheapest mexican food you can get, but delish!  We like the wide variety on the menu..they also have a very large fountain drink selection, both pepsi and some coke products as well as other fountain drinks!  It has always been very busy when we have been there so we generally take it to go or try and grab a seat when someone gets up!"}
{"text":"We were out and about and decided to give this location a try. I wasn't overly impressed. The bathrooms were dirty and messy. The drink bar needed attention as well as the patio. There were a lot of employees so there was no excuse for the lack of cleanliness. 
I ordered the chicken tostada. It was good, nothing to write home about, although the chicken was tender and shredded, which I prefer. They only offer thin taco sauce, no salsa. It was too hot for my liking. My boyfriend ordered the beef taco/enchilada plate. It was good but in my opinion, not great. Nothing good enough for me to come back. 
At least there was horchata on tap."}
{"text":"Awesome food! It's always a full house but worth the wait! Had a chimichanga made the 3way style with red chile, green chile, beans & cheese. And the #11 2 green corn tamales rice & beans! Yummy food! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Carolina's is my all time favorite place to eat however the quality of the food in the Mesa location is below par of the Mojave location.  I have been to the Mesa location many times and each time the butter tortillas are not served hot and have barely any butter on them and the shredded beef tacos are messy (cheese all over the paper fold) and not enough meat in them.  It seems they have more front staff than needed, and no one is on the same page.  There is a particular female employee that enjoys yelling the pick-up numbers at the top of her lungs, very distracting and unneeded."}
{"text":"The tortillas are to die for, however the Mesa location is way better than the Peoria location."}
{"text":"Best tortillas in town! Great food. I love the butter tortillas and bean and cheese burritos....also the tacos are awesome...enchiladas too....can't lose."}
{"text":"Not worth trying. They only had some items available when I ordered so I ordered some something else and then after 20 min of waiting they come to the table and tell us that there is no more of those items but could have what I originally wanted. So I agree to go back to the original item and then wait another 10 min for the food to come out. I think they made all the food and let it sit for most of our wait and only one item of 3 dinners was warm."}
{"text":"This is a place if you haven't made the trek over, you are surely missing out! Low prices for a boatload of food! Flavorful, robust, and hot! It never takes to long as they having it rolling in the back. The red or green Chile Burro's are delish. Tacos, crispy and like momma used to make. They are cranking out fresh made tortilla to buy. Salsa several choices all really good! You have to go!!"}
{"text":"This place is D Licious. I haven't had a bad meal yet. It reminds me of two pesos that used to be in old town in the early 90's. Their tortillas are extraordinary and their beans taste like bacon. For a fast Mexican restaurant place I would say this is the best one. Did that make any sense? Either way try Carolinas , you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner to go. I went with two beef tacos and the #12, which is two double wrapped beef enchiladas, with rice and beans. My order was ready when they said it would be. The food was decent. I have a feeling that if I ate in, that the food may be better. I will definitely be giving it another shot."}
{"text":"Having a Carolina's so close to home is dangerous. The tortillas and hot sauce are so tasty! The dining room is packed every night and expect a wait but it's definitely worth it. Picked up take-out 4 times in a week! We've tried bean burrito, carne asada burrito, cheese enchiladas, and machaca cheese tortilla. All delicious, especially with their hot sauce. I'm not keen on hot sauces because I usually don't like the taste (not because of the heat) but I really like the hot sauce here. 

I read someone else's complaint about the A/C here and I laughed out loud. As a native I'm so thankful that the dining room is nice and cold. 

Thanks Carolina's for coming out to the east valley!"}
{"text":"I went in for a pint size of menudo and the cashier recommended the red. When I got home it was brown and mostly contained hominy and tasted more like refried beans. Hardly any spice of Chile and there were three pieces of tripe. I will continue to search for a good tasting Menudo. I have tried other things at Carolinas but definitely not any more Menudo."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for Mexican food if you're in Paradise Valley however if it is a Friday or Saturday night you might want to call in your order because it does take time."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the phx location a few times and loved it. I always got the Oaxaca special. When the Mesa location opened I couldn't believe it. We, the citizens of Mesa, have been gifted. 
 I have now had the opportunity to expand my menu range and I must say I haven't been disappointed yet. From the awesome enchiladas to the wonderful burritos and tacos they have not let me down. Even the price is reasonable. I love the fact that they make there own tortillas there and that they are good as well."}
{"text":"For fast food it's as good as it gets. However remember it is fast food. All the food is served at Styrofoam boxes but it is very quick. I give it five stars because the quality of food is excellent.    Prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad giving this place 3 stars considering all the good reviews that it has.  The food is pretty good here, but it's just not great.  I finally decided to trek out to Carolina's after hearing so many good things about it.  I ordered the chorizo and bean burrito with 2 red beef tamales.  It didn't take long to get my order, which was nice since I was hungry like the wolf.  The burrito was decent.  The chorizo was spicy but that was about all that could be said for it.  The tamales were actually fairly tasty.  Though the red chile I asked for was sadly missing.

For a quick-stop mexican food place, it's very good.  I'd certainly go there for a bite before most of the other places I've tried out here.  That being said, it's exactly what you expect of it.  It's not gourmet, new, or exciting, but it is a good solid meal."}
{"text":"Would give negative stars, but had to give one.

For the price you expect at least decent food.
Ordered the tamale combination. Got home and the tamales were barely warm they were still partially frozen.

And to top it off found a hair in the food. YUCK!!!

To management hair nets!!!!!

If you work with food and have facial hair need to be covered. Also females even if you have hair on a bun no dangling around face need hairnets."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on Saturday and the burritos were good but the service was horrible.  My husband and in-laws ordered coffee and were told it was out and would be about 10 minutes.  Ok.  We waited quite a while for our food and were half way through when my husband went up for the 3rd time to ask about the coffee.  Was told it would be another 30 minutes.  When he asked for a refund, the lady rolled her eyes at him and said he had to wait in line.  It wasn't a huge amount but to wait 30 minutes for coffee?  This was my 3rd time to this location and the service hasn't been great any of the times.  I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was so happy when they opened their North Phoenix location!  It's definitely a \"styrofoam\" kind of atmosphere, but sometimes that's how the best food comes.  You can buy fresh tortillas which are delicious, and their salsa should be a controlled substance because it is so addictive.  Some of their items are generic, but others are phenomenal.  My favorite are the crispy chicken tacos.  I could eat those every day.  The breakfast burritos are good too.  And if menudo is your thing, theirs is tasty.  If you have a lot of people to feed and not a lot of money, this place is a delicious option."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Authentic is a definite! This family food business has been around for years! Their food is fresh! Just enough spice and the food is homemade taste! Been to their west, south & east restaurants... delicious and reasonably priced. Eat in or take away, Buy tortillas chips/ salsa to take home!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here at least once a week when I worked in the area, at LEAST once a week.  My go to items were as follows;  Red Chili burrito W/ beans (enchilada style), Machaca burrito, Machaca plate, Red Machaca burrito, Tamale and Enchilada plate, Two Taco plate, Chicken Tostadas, Green Chili combo....  Basically the whole menu.  Now that I think about it, my Carolinas fandom was probably the single greatest contributing factor to my ever expanding waistline.  It is not the best Mexican food evarr, but it is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I could drink their enchilada sauce as a hot beverage. Their cheese enchiladas are my absolute favorite enchiladas in the entire world. I also enjoy their beef tacos with rice and beans. Priced nicely, served hot and all the soda a human can consume. They do get jam packed at lunch time but offering good food will do that. I always get a dozen tortillas to go which I believe they make themselves. 
My one complaint is I hate eating off of styrofoam and everything is served that way. If you ask they will give you paper plates to transfer you meal onto."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Carolina's makes very authentic and tasty Mexican Food!  Their flour tortillas are amazing, tasty, and not too thick!  Their tacos, chorizo, enchiladas, tamales, red chili, and green chili are wonderful!  I recommend calling in your order, ahead of time, to alleviate your wait time. I suggest to Carolina's that they offer Drive Thru or Curbside - I'd gladly pay a little extra for  to bring my order to my vehicle - this would help those of us w/disabilities greatly!"}
{"text":"This is as close as I kind find to homemade.  Best tortillas in town. Never shy on the meat and beans are fresh and delicoius. I'm so happy they now have a mesa location and not having to drive to phoenix to get my fix.  This location is huge and plenty of seats and a/c works awesome."}
{"text":"I arrived at this restaurant under the impression that I was about to eat at one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area. Unfortunately, I couldn't be more incorrect. As a matter of fact, if someone were to tell me that this was the worst Mexican restaurant in the area, I would have completely believed them. I ordered the red chili burrito, which according to Yelp, is a regular favorite. The red chili had an almost expired taste to it. The portion was incredible small. I don't know if it was because I ordered it as a combination platter, but the portion was one that you would expect to find in a kids menu. I left completely disappointed that I made the drive all the way to this place when in all honesty, disgusting ass Taco Bell would have been just as appetizing, if not more appetizing. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but I don't think I will ever find out as I don't see myself giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"MACHACA TACOS!!
Homemade tortillas are terrific, as well. Especially the hard shell"}
{"text":"I am and always will be a fan of Carolina's. I've been to the Original location at 12th St and Mohave and within my family that's my favorite location but my parents and one of my brother's prefers this Carolina's. I think it's because it's open later and the neigborhood doesn't look too risky plus it looks cleaner. 

Anywho, Carolina's just has really good Mexican food, I like their Chimichangas, their burros, and their tortillas. OH their tortillas is one of the best in the Phoenix area, and is comparable to the tortilla shops in south tucson. I always get a chicken chimi with the works, and i'm always content. I also get myself a cheese quesadilla because the melted cheese in their buttery fluffy tortillas are outta this world. *yum* 

The drive to this Carolinas might be farther for me but it's a great alternative to the original location if you find yourself in north phoenix. Oh plus you can have dinner over here since they close at 8:30 or 9."}
{"text":"This place is super busy for Friday night. Hard to find a table.  Don't expect to find a high end eating experience this is pretty basic and inexpensive. 

Tables on cement floors  Need to listen for your ticket number as they call them fast and furious 

The photo shows what $10 will buy

Chicken soft taco rather boring in taste

The beef tostada were hot, as in spicy,  and average in tast

BUT The beef machaca is what you order.  That was really good tasting and what I should have ordered"}
{"text":"Carolinas has consistently good Mexican food. The red chili beef plate is always a good option. The Salsa could be spicier but then the gringos wouldn't drink it by the gallons :) lol."}
{"text":"I work @ the Harley-Davidson dealership up the street on Cave Creek.
We come here at least 1x a week to place Tamale orders. Today, I brought a cstmr. We had placed phone an order into the wrong Carolina's,..(Mohave). Noah the Cashier was so helpful and not flustered at all. Tom also greets us and always asks if we are happy with our order."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day.  Was expecting so so food.  I ended up eating the chimis.  Best chimi in the world.  I loved every bite of it.  This placed has a nice friendly atmosphere and was packed.  It was impressive to see them get our food out quickly and correctly.  I definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome food and always packed. But unfortunately the young staff isn't trained well. Was overcharged as we were told one thing and then another happened. How does asking for an ingredient from a burrito on the side make it turn into a full combo? Uhhhh.. Was told there was no way just put an item on the side? After explaining the situation several times they did not listen and out of frustration just gave into being overcharged. This was only my 3rd time here. But my first time was only a week ago. Thought I found my new go to spot but might have to keep looking. But again amazing food. No question about it."}
{"text":"Today was my second time coming to this establishment, and I'm still not sure what all the hype is about. Maybe some people are just too easy to please, I don't know. Both times the food was just, \"ok\". I've had better Mexican food at other places. The wait for a take out order both times; inexcusable. 15 minutes and counting is a ridiculous amount of time for a one-person order to go. With all the help they have running around, it shouldn't be that kind of wait. I've had faster service picking up a to go order at sit down restaurants during the lunch rush, where they don't have nearly as many people in the kitchen. This place is okay if there's nothing better around, but I certainly will never go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"This was my first time as I decided I would try it out. I love Mexican food and was super hungry. I ordered my food and took a seat waiting and waiting and waiting. Becoming HANGRY and wondering what is going on. 10 mins became 20 and 20 mins became 30. I finally went up to see what's going on as people who ordered after me we're getting heir food! 

I told the clerk it's been more than 30 minutes since I ordered so he apologized and stated they have a new cashier. What does a new cashier have to do with the fact that it took 35 mins to get my food? 

The food was good but I think it would have been better if I wasn't on the verge of starvation."}
{"text":"First time eating here, was extreamly good! The green corn tamales were amazing! Will def recomend this place and will go back!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Carolina's! My favorite is the yummy tortillas and green salsa! I only wish the service was faster. It is not uncommon to wait for your food upwards of 30 minutes. I've even tried calling in my order but it doesn't make any difference in the wait time. They are always wildly busy which shows their food is good. It's worth a try just don't go on your lunch break or if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place absolutely amazing mexican food. My recommendation is a bean and cheese burro with a cheese chrisp!!"}
{"text":"Eh... not really a fan at all. And I like almost all Mexican places. Can't say I've ever really left anywhere hungry before because I usually don't eat a ton of food but I got the two enchilada combo with beans and rice and the enchiladas are so small and thin it was like two bites each one. I'm sad to say it was a seven dollar meal and I had to dig my enchiladas out of the sauce. I like a decent amount of sauce but they almost completely covered. And in my opinion nothing really stood out in anyway that would make me want to come back here."}
{"text":"The food hear is so fresh, the staff are very friendly and accommodating. I ordered a chicken Taco Salad  YUM!!! The portion size was great they didn't skip on the chicken either! It was a great bowl and I left extremely pleased."}
{"text":"just go in and order a dozen tortillas and you will be the happiest person on earth... their bean burritos are to die for as well..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Authentic, reasonably priced with hard working employees who move quickly.   Delicious food."}
{"text":"This is me and my wife's go to spot for when we can't think of what we want to eat...or are craving it so hard, both of these things happen often. 

First off their tortillas are the best in Phoenix. This is the only place I make sure to also pick up a buttered tortilla or cheese quesadilla just to make sure I'm getting extra tortilla action in my meal.

My favorite thing to get is the chimichanga combo, but I also love the beef tacos, enchiladas, and 3 way burritos. Oh also they recently started serving carne asada burritos and those are real delicious too! Actually I like everything they have, let's be real."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but not as great as I expected. I had the mini chimi combo with beef. It was very flavorful and the guac wasn't very flavorful either. Rice and beans were the same. The salsa was very good and definitely helped. The wait was really long for a to go order but it was on a Saturday afternoon and they were really busy."}
{"text":"I've heard from a lot of people that this place is pretty tasty-so I had to check it out. I thought maybe I had been there before and had an idea of what to expect but I walked in with a new picture in my mind. I thought it would be a sit down restaurant, but it was set up more like fast food and it was very fast indeed. I enjoyed a great red machaca burro and also tasted a flavorful bean, cheese and lettuce toastada and a side of Mexican rice. 

It was pretty busy in there at lunch time and we lucked out getting the last available table for our party of 3. 

The bathroom does not have a changing table and I had to change the baby on the counter top right behind the door-If you have small children that wears diapers I recommend changing them elsewhere. 

I would definitely go back here for some quick savory Mexican food on another day : )"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Carolinas in the past so I thought I would stop in a grab a bite to eat on my way to a church conference a few blocks away. I must say this recent visit to Carolinas was absolutely horrible.  I ordered a #9 two beef tacos rice and beans.  The taco shells were extremely hard and the beef inside the tacos along with the rice and beans had absolutely no flavor. The entire meal was so bland, I would rather eat at Taco Bell. It was like eating food that had been consistently submerged in water.  the beef was almost white in nature from the apparent boiling or simmering too long or something.  There was no seasoning not even a pinch of salt.  The portion was shameful, it was like a kids plate. Only a spoon full of rice and a spoon full of beans.  The entire experience left me very disappointed.  It was as though I just walked in the door and donated hard earn money but in return got cold, bland and tasteless food.  Fortunately, I was on my way to church which gave me something to look forward to that evening. As far as Carolinas, it has gone \"downhill\". The cooks don't seem to care about the quality of food that they serve their customers. My advice, If you don't have to eat here, Don't. I was just pressed for time and decided to eat here.  Silly me I should of asked for a refund but I didn't. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Place is large and sparsely decorated.  It's the kind of place where you order upfront and they call your number.  Think a bit larger and upscale Filibertos.

Food is good, quite good given the type of place. Most surprising is the price.  Combos are $6-8 range and that includes rice and beans.   Al-a-cart items for every thing also.  I love that as sometimes a combo just isnt enough.  Great for a quick lunch or dinner.  Did I mention they also do breakfast?"}
{"text":"This is a great place for inexpensive Mexcian food.

I get the red machaca burrito - smother it in their salsa.
If I'm feeling hungry, I add a side of beans.

Chow down and enjoy.  :-)"}
{"text":"2nd review Ever.  I'm on a roll.

1) Best Tortillas in Phoenix.  No question
2) Salsa is in the top 5 of Phoenix
3) Beans and rice......again....amazing
4) Low Low prices

So...... Amzing Tortilla + Amazing Salsa + Amazing Beans & Rice = Delicious 

Hell, even the flautas (we always get the Zarape Special) are crisp and thin.  If you're a fan of flautas/taquitos, you know that too thick of a tortilla is a downer.

This place is an easy 5/5....but.....enchiladas are a 2.  Sauce is good, not great.  Texture not right on the enchilada itself.  So, I can't give a mexican joint a 5/5 if there enchiladas are just ok."}
{"text":"1st time here today. The food is one step above Filiburto's... It's pretty good but by no means great! The price is pretty low but the portions are really small so the overall value is only fair. The staff was knowledgeable but not friendly. Food came out in a timely manner. 
IDK I guess over all my sock were not blown off. 
I wasn't bad... it just wasn't great..."}
{"text":"Not a lot of atmosphere here but outstanding Mexican fast food. Spiced and prepared just right, so very tasty. Service is quick, and the food is priced reasonably. Polite and pleasant staff. There are 3 of these in the greater phoenix area. I think we prefer the one by the airport. Very authentic and tasty. Absolutely worth a try."}
{"text":"This location is near my house but there is the original location neary my work.  We order from them all the time at work.  I must eat here at least once a wekk.  I think they have been in business for over 50 yrs. Seriously, I can't get enough of this place.  Sometimes i get withdrawls.
I usually order #9 with all rice no beans and 1 chix 1 beef.  
Their tortillas are super sinful. you know they have lard in them but who cares..when they are good.  I've also tired the corn and beef tamales.  They also sell them by the dozen frozen too.  It's great during the holidays.  i tried to first cook them in the microwave..lets just say not a bright idea.  It turns out perfect in the rice cooker.  
I also like their chocolate chimichangas.  totally sinful.."}
{"text":"Grear food fun people waiting for they're orderes.
Need to better organize the delivery process.
Seams to always take a while and never in order.
very glad there is one now in Mesa!"}
{"text":"GREEN CHILE CHICKEN BURRO! AIYIYIYIYIYIYIYI! [/battlecry]

Don't argue - it was featured in the Arizona Republic six years ago. This is the one place that I've remained a faithful customer to for the last 6 years. This is by far my longest love affair.

This probably isn't real Mexican food, but who cares. You like Panda Express, don't you? You can't go wrong with the tacos, tostadas, and buttered tortillas. Don't forget to stock up the salsa. It's amazing. I've seen people fight to the death for this stuff. Really."}
{"text":"My daughter has had her credit card compromised at the Mesa location on Country Club Drive.   It was bad enough it happened a couple months ago, but it happened again just the other day......within 24 hours of using it at the MESA location, someone is off on a buying spree.    I do not know if the Bank looks at this  and investigates but I would say......there are other reputable Mexican restaurants in the East Valley......don't support businesses that have someone doing this to their customers."}
{"text":"Ate there today. It has been a long time and what a treat it was!! We love this place. We don't come for the drinks or the bathrooms or the ambience....we come for the food. Don't get me wrong..it is not a crap hole..it is just not fancy at all!. But the food....Oh the Food! INCREDIBLE!!!!!

P.S.

This place is much cleaner that the Peoria location!"}
{"text":"While not a fancy place, it is relatively clean. The food is excellent, authentic Mexican. I had enjoyed hundreds of lunches from Carolinas in south Phoenix when I was working near there. It is so good to have them in the East Valley. I will especially utilize the carry out service."}
{"text":"Mexican food for Arizonians.  It's cheap, fast and tasty.  Expect line-ups when you come. I had the Flauta special and was very satisfied.  It's a much better dining experience than the original location in Central Phoenix only cause it's newer.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"We tried several items, the machaca taco was a delicious 5/5. The green corn tamale was flavorful 4/5. The cheese enchilada was good but nothing special, 3/5. Unfortunately the carne asada was only 2/5 because the meat tasted like it had been sitting around for awhile, which would be pretty odd with how busy they are. Also, the meat just lacked seasoning. Their flour tortillas are delicious! The chicken chimichanga was tender, good but nothing memorable. 

One minor frustration is that it's so busy and loud that the cashier has trouble hearing our order, which caused a couple of mistakes."}
{"text":"Live on the other side of town and LOVE the original Carolina's! Stopped in for a take out order of 2 3-way burro plates (planning to reheat tomorrow) and a 2 crunchy tacos. Simple enough, right? Ended up paying for that, but actually got 1 taco plate, 1 bean burro plate and 2 tacos. No 3-way burro...the whole reason we even stopped in! BTW, food quality no where near the original Carolina's. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food I have had so far since living in the valley.  It's quick, hearty, authentic, and VERY well priced.  The tacos, enchiladas, quacomole, tortillas and chips are amazing.  Will definintely be going back here frequently.  Only recommendation would be for them to sell queso.  The chips are soooo good its a crime to not have queso for them ( I sadly do realize how un-authentic queso dip is, but still love it).  Writing this has made me hungry, think I'll head there now..."}
{"text":"Place is great, come here for the tortillas mainly but there plenty of other things on the menu that are good. Can be pretty busy at time, particularly around lunch time but the line is worth it. Staff is always friendly and fast at getting the food out to you. If you are craving some Mexican food then I'd go here. Grab a dozen of tortillas for home too. Won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place! They already know who I am when I call my families order in. They take care of us and I wouldn't have it any other way!! Anyone who has the nerve to complain about Caroline's restaurant then here's an idea go somewhere else cause I love the food and the staff here!!"}
{"text":"The food came out really fast and it tastes good. No complaints other than it was very crowded and noisy, i can understand why they are busy and popular"}
{"text":"This is as close as you go to Tito's tacos. The meat is quite tasty as are the tortillas. This is not traditional Mexican street tacos but more if Tex-Mex variety. The salsa is tangy and has a mild kick. Options are tacos, \"burros,\" enchiladas chimichangas and red beed or green tamales.  All are solid but the crunchy tacos are my favorite.  Service is pretty fast and the restaurant is almost always busy. That is a good sign. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy as it is the strip mall that the restaurant is in"}
{"text":"So good! I would recommend buying a pack of tortillas to take home with you while you are there. They are always friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"I'd prefer you not go so the line wouldn't be as long! Just kidding because this place is the real deal. Whatever you order will be authentic and delicious.  The tamales, Burros, tacos, enchilada's are legit!  No matter what you get, add a dozen of their homemade tortillas to be blown away. It's obviously great because every time I go, there are many other regulars waiting for their fix. If you call ahead, you will get to pick up your order at a separate counter and will get to skip the line."}
{"text":"I ate here today for the first time. It's not really a \"sit down\" kind of restaurant, but the food was very good.  I had the two tacos meal and iced tea. The taco meat was flavorful, the beans didn't taste like canned refried beans, the rice was really good, and the tea was freshly brewed. It's filibertos-ish by way of the menu  but WAY better in quality of the food.  There was a huge line after we got there but people were in and out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential Mexican restaurant in AZ!

The machaca was fantastic as usual the tortillas are fresh and warm 

Aaand they have horchata and frescas in the fountain!

The only downside is that it's not as good as the original f2f downtown"}
{"text":"Yassss! Thank you for coming to the East Valley. Food, of course, is the bomb. Atmosphere is a huge step up from Phoenix. Love their crunchy tacos - my favorite anywhere. Of course, gotta get tortillas to go, to not do so is criminal. 

Only drawback were the crowds (though the line moved quickly) and the millions of little unruly kids that were there that night. People really should avoid being jerks though - if you are at the end of the line, it's really NOT COOL to send someone to camp on empty tables. - wait until you've ordered and THEN find a table. Much more efficient and considerate of others."}
{"text":"I rarely admit it in public, but I will for those of you who have lived in Yuma for any period of time...  I am a Yuma native.  I know, most people think that Yuma sucks, and quite honestly I agree to an extent.  I mean, there is a reason why I left.  

Now to get to the point of my public admission...  There are 2 fast food and 1 sit down restaurants in Yuma that anyone who has lived there for more than a few months loves.  I won't say the names b/c I am afraid Yelp will remove my review, but those restaurants are owned by the Gutierrez family.  Seriously, Yumans ship their bean and cheese burritos all over the world to other Yuma natives.  It is a stop that most make when they go back to visit. 

And why have I been talking about Yuma?  Carolina's has got to be a near relative of the family who owns those restaurants.  Or at least originated from the same town in Mexico, because this is the closest thing that I have found to that, VERY FAMOUS among Yumans, restaurants.

Maybe I have been gone too long, but I think that Carolinas may be a little better.  The bean and cheese burritos taste exactly the same, and the salsa is close (Carolinas is better/thicker.)  The machacha meat is near the same taste too, and the folded tacos are identical.  The rolled tacos aren't as good at Carolina's but it is the same taco that you would get in any Mexican household on the border of San Luis, Somerton, or Algadones. The rice is different too, similar but I had it once and I think there was corn in it. Carolinas has a bigger menu and offers more than its Yuma competitors.  

Now, Carolinas isn't for everyone.  Living on the border nearly my whole life and being fed by friend's parents who were Mexico natives (some illegals,) my palate has been refined by traditional Mexican food from the northwest border of Mexico.  I have hard a hard time finding what I would consider good Mexican food here in Phoenix, because it seems to be a smorgasbord of cuisine from all of Mexico. 

So, if you grew up near the southwest border, give Carolinas a try.  You may find that you wont have to drive the 3 hours home when you get a hankering for a bean and cheese or a machaca burrito.  

FYI:  Everytime I have been there it is crazy busy.  So if you are planning on going during lunchtime, dinnertime, or on weekends, plan accordingly and make sure that someone stands and waits for a table while the other people in your group place an order.  Also, true to the Mexican restaurant style...  The tables will probably be dirty so bring some disinfectant wipes if you have issues, don't look at how dirty the floor is, and don't pay mind to the spilt salsa at the self serve salsa station, or the ice that has been dumped all over the machine.  We have been in there quite a few times where there was more ice spilt than actually in the machine.  Consider in ambiance.  This staff is swamped with customers at meal times and it is your fellow patrons that make it that dirty."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. But the hours are crap. The breakfast burritos are the best but now we have to wait for lunch. Why specialize in breakfast but not open until 9 when people can't wait til 9. Dumb idea that needs to be rethought. Think about it carolina. Think."}
{"text":"I have frequented often and enjoyed eating here until yesterday, when my wife and I stopped in for a late lunch. I ordered a combo that had an enchilada with it and my wife ordered the cheese enchiladas. Instead of getting enchiladas, we received a table spoon (if that) of cold cheese wrapped up in a tortilla with drenched in red sauce. I brought the food back up and their response was, 'we ran out.' So if you are out of something, let the customers know. Don't just half-heartedly attempt to mimic the entree someone ordered. That's dishonest and a rip-off. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure. Yummy and the price is right. Warning, the dinning room is very crowded. I usually take food to go."}
{"text":"We visited again, like I said, we are 3 generations Carolina's fans. The order was not correct, the Carne Asada Burro was cold, the Pico de Gallo (sp?) was so salty it was inedible. come on Carolinas, let's get back to where we were.  The guacamole was fabulous as always, the lettuce on my beef taco was wet...  Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Love it.  The tamales are great, the tacos and tostadas are simple and satisfying, the menu is straightforward and cheap.  Only flaw is it being closed on Sundays.  Highly recommended, especially if fast and cheap are priorities."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and the food is amazing!!! This is a taco shop with several locations and their tacos and tortillas especially are out of this world.  They are always busy, but they are fast and accurate.  I usually get a dozen tortillas and quart of beans to munch on during the week."}
{"text":"5 stars for the best tortillas in the valley.  No one beats their homemade tortillas.  Also love their tacos and green burros."}
{"text":"Second time hosting a catered lunch by Carolina's and everyone loved it! The tacos and mini burritos are a big hit. Staff is extremely friendly and VERY efficient, especially Alyssa. She was always available and kept me in the loop at all times. The two delivery girls were as sweet as the apple chimi's! Sorry- I didn't get their names! Have recommended this place to friends and family and it is a personal favorite with the staff where I work."}
{"text":"Awesome food all the way around. The best fresh tortillas in town. Better and cheaper than Some Burro's but be patient as there is always a line but worth the wait. So glad they opened up a location in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Would check in but I'm in Chicago.  Family just brought me 3 burritos and hot sauce plus 2 dozen tortillas.  Nothing compares anywhere especially in Chicago. Hands down best tortillas I've ever had! 

Get the 3 way burrito.  Beans,  red Chile,  and green Chile!"}
{"text":"I was reasonably happy with the food here.  Ordered a beef chimichanga with rice and an extra tortilla on the side.  The chimi was just a little dry, with lightly seasoned shredded beef - probably could have used a little more of a kick, but it was ok.  Rice is rice - nothing out of the ordinary there.  The tortilla was piping hot, and was pretty good.  I don't know if it's really the best tortilla in Phoenix like they say, but I wasn't disappointed with it - just a little chewy and had a nice flavor.

Including a drink and tax, it came to about $8.50, which was about right.  Overall, not something I'd go out of my way for, but I think I'd go back if the opportunity arises.  Plus you can get fresh tortillas to go for a good price, so I may just do that next time I'm cooking at home, instead of getting store-bought."}
{"text":"This place would easily be 5 stars if they stopped using styrofoam. Really?  Does anyone in AZ care about the environment?"}
{"text":"Grand opening is next week but they are on soft open and the food is great! Glad to finally have a location for all the east valley people. They have menudo on Saturday's and there are 4 options for kids that come with a drink, rice, & beans. We had 3 different plates and all were great. My recommendation for first timers is to grab a few tortillas to take home."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times the staff is friendly and they are always moving around. The place is clean and it always seems to have people filling the seats.. so people must like it plus it is very kid/family friendly. Over all it's a nice place to come and eat I have brought people here out of convince and it's not very expensive at all. but I feel like the options are limited and they kinda make you pay for everything individually to some point. Their food is decent and like I said it's not badly priced but In my opinion Some of their food taste bland or dry even if they have spices or seem fatty, Their hot sauce is not that great. I guess it depends on who's making the food. Another experience when ordering I asked the person taking my order what something contained and she looked very confused and had to walk around to find someone that knew the answer. Oh they also have outdoor seating which is cool i even saw some People eating outside with their pups.
Not super impressed but it's a nice place and I'll still come back every so often."}
{"text":"I'm glad I re-read my reviews! I love this place, but somehow I mis-posted a bad review for a different restaurant within a couple miles of Carolinas. So, I deleted that bad review! SORRY GUYS!

Carolina's is one of my favorite places that I take family and friends who are visiting town. Fresh tortillas. Excellent selection of salsa/garnishes. Everything I've ever ordered here tastes great!"}
{"text":"Justin F. is right on target, except that I use Green Chile as the proof! My sis & my Argentine brother-in-law are in town from the UK, and, as in the past, an obligatory stop at Carolina's PHX was in order,. However, we hopped into the time machine bound for Mesa and teleported back to the great old days days of \"real\" AZ-Mex cuisine. That means: BURROS, not wimpy \"burritos.\" That means green & red BEEF chile w/ NM chiles & no pork. That means a sweet, green corn tamal. And that same, simple, ubiquitous cumin-laced hot sauce from the '50's! Even before our large order arrived, that unique aroma of bilistered flour tortillas suddnly grabbed our olfactory attention. It's impossible to have too-high expectations. The burros & their tortillas were utterly perfect. Guacamole was excellent. This was a flawless meal! Well, maybe there could be some trozitos of green chile in the burro or machaca, but everything remains 99% better than the rest (excepting perhaps Rito's)! So, wanna' have some REAL AZ-Mex food? Then, hop in your DeLorean and set out for any Carolina's! Just one request: When are you opening a restaurant in Brighton?"}
{"text":"Solid food, but the best thing is probably the horchata from the coke dispenser!"}
{"text":"There were six of us who went just after the lunch crowd was over.  My first impression is that the place could use a good scrubbing.  Also, the girl taking our order at the counter had zero personality.
I ordered menudo which was some of the best that I have had.  My husband and I also ordered the tamale platter.  We both ordered beef tamales.  We each got one beef, one corn.  They were just okay.  I am glad that all of our orders came out in styrofoam \"to go\" containers even though we were eating there, because I saw everyone getting their orders of cheap, flimsy paper plates that ended up being soggy.  One couple ordered tostadas.  There was more lettuce than beans or cheese.
I can tell you that I will never go back.  The food is definitely not authentic."}
{"text":"After hearing about the Phoenix location for years, finally got a chance to try some of the food. Due to the wait lines, we were smart enough to call ahead for a to go order. The lines were almost out the door but we were able to pick up the order and go. The burritos were good and had the right amount of spice. Hopefully the lines will die down and we will be able to sit and enjoy a full meal soon. Even as a \"to go\" order, it was really good for the money."}
{"text":"Have been hearing a lot of hype about this place. Finally decided to try it, service was average. It was good, but I've had better local Mexican food for the same price. I debated giving it 4 stars because my experience was neither impressive,  nor negative. I'd rate it 3.5 stars if I could, because this place just doesn't rank with other nearby choices, but it also doesn't suck. P.S. they don't have a taco Tuesday special."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, had the chicken chimichanga, beans, and rice.  Nothing was bad, and the ingredients looked fresh.  Unfortunately, the taste was a little bland.  Just a big wad of chicken breast in a fried tortilla, the guacamole looked like it was from a tub, nary an avocado was found.

The food was served quickly and the dining area was clean.  I will have to try something else on the menu next time, though."}
{"text":"They have fixed their to go order process haven't had any issues this past year. They could use an upgrade in their phone system. At peak hours you may have trouble connecting when calling in your order. I guess that is a good indication that the food is good."}
{"text":"Finally a good Mexican spot close by! The tacos and enchilada sauce is to die for! Even though there's a tiny bit of a wait and always busy that just means their that good."}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Prices.

we love Carolina's"}
{"text":"If you love them in Phoenix -they are the same delicious in Mesa. There is a wait. The wait is worth it! Hang in there. The food is authentic and filling. We always have carne asada burrito and it is great. Love the beans and rice with every combo meal."}
{"text":"Super good. Sauce is a little spicy, but hits the spot. Fast serve style. Chips and tortillas are fresh!! Salsa is really good!"}
{"text":"Great food as always. So glad they expanded to Mesa, the place is packed but the line moves pretty fast. Their tortilla chips are the best."}
{"text":"This is the Best place for Mexican food in East Mesa. It reminded me of the food back home food n El Paso. The place was clean. I am definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"As an Arizona native, Carolina's is hands-down my favorite Mexican food establishment! From the fresh homemade tortillas to the perfect consistency of salsa, there isn't much I don't love. Our normal go-to meal is a bean and cheese burrito for me and a two cheese enchilada combo for my husband (a little on the spicier side). I've tried almost every entrée and normally recommend a chimichanga for first timers! I was super happy when they opened this location which is much closer to my home, but they could definitely use some work. The ordering process goes much slower and calling in an order doesn't help the cause- our order just sat under the warmer until someone came over to help us check out. I really hope they'll get better with time!"}
{"text":"This is Mexican food...seriously I've never had better. Carolina could have stopped after creating these tortillas and I would have been happy. Their carry out containers of meat, beans, rice etc. are ideal for gatherings. Make sure to hide any extra tortillas out of reach of your guests so that you can munch on them for days to come, cause you deserve it!"}
{"text":"Carolinas burritos are on fiyaaaaaaa!!!!!! Amazing flavor and this is probably because of the fresh made flour tortillas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice new decor, and service was fast at 4:15pm. Green chili was kind of bland, Green tamale and cheese enchilada were decent but not great. Beans and rice were tasty. Tortilla was good - they have the reputation so they should be because they are fresh made - dipped that in the beans with the hot sauce which is good. Yes this is definitely better than lots of take out. But after eating Rositas (Guadalupe/Dobson) for years (IMO the best Mexican food and by far the best green chili burro and salsa in town), nothing really compares. Everyone has there favorites. Carolinas has the New Times award winning reputation to live up to. And frankly, I did not think that it did. They have only been open at this location a few weeks. So I will wait and give them another try. Maybe they will be better next time."}
{"text":"Good food and variety but every time I come here the food is cold. I'm sure it would be so much better if I got it while it was hot. I've only been to the Country Club location and I know it's new and maybe that's why but I don't think that's a good excuse."}
{"text":"5 stars for the tortillas. Best in the valley by far. Cant say enough.

Chorizo and bean burro made long is my favorite. Sometimes double wrapped if I am feeling skinny. 

Hot sauce is good. Chips are good. Not always as clean as it could be but thats due to being busy all the time and not a fault of the wait staff or management."}
{"text":"After hearing my peeps talk this place up, I decided to try this place out when I was out an about the other day. 

I had the Muchacha Combo and a soft drink. The Muchacha included beef, refried beans, lettuce and rice and a large tortilla to roll your own burrito. The food was ok and very reasonably priced at under $8. There was plenty of seating at noon when I went on a Tuesday afternoon. 

I would definitely go back to try other menu items, but this place doesn't crack the regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican restaraunt of all time. Not fancy, not healthy, but so so good. Their tortillas are big and homemade and full of flavor. Their green chili sauce is chunky liquid heaven and their new carne asada burritos are seasoned perfectly. I eat here at least weekly and have trouble eating Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have been to Carolinas a few times and liked it but will not be going back after this last visit. The girl who took my order got about half of it right and when I got home I was sick for half of the night with stomach issues. 
There are too many options for good Mexican food without having to deal with this."}
{"text":"Great cheap Mexican food...no atmosphere.  Gotta try the tortillas!"}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by stating that I have not been to this location. Or any Carolina's location for that matter. Not yet atleast.  It's my husband who regularly visits this establishment on his lunch hour...and subsequently has RAVED about the place!

A couple months back he brought home some salsa and tortilla's for our Saturday morning breakfast burritos. I was amazed at how HUGE the tortilla's are so I only had half--which he was thrilled about since it left more for him.  They have great flavor and texture to them. I can see why they've been voted the BEST of the best! 

Then there's the salsa. Oh the salsa. I plan my weekly meals in such a way as to incorporate this salsa so I can enjoy it as often as possible. Essentially that meant paying $6.00 for a quart of it. But seriously, this stuff is like \"liquid gold' to me--I'd (almost) pay any price for it...because it's THAT amazing! 

The flavor is smooth (at first) then smokey, sweet with a punch of heat and the end. I can't get enough of the stuff! It's spicy enough to make your nose run (if you eat enough of it) and hot enough to keep your metabolism up for hours! 

I can't wait to go try their FOOD and see how it holds up to the amazing reputation of their salsa and tortillas. Surely I won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Mexican food at a reasonable price. First stop when landing in Phoenix. 9 minutes from  yummyness"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST tortillas I have ever tried. I get a dozen of their flour tortillas and a quart of their beans and make my own bean burros at home. But when I'm really hungry I order an already made bean burro too and eat it on the car ride home. I LOVE this place. Only negative is they're closed on Sundays :("}
{"text":"The red chili is amazing. We went on opening day not a good thing. Took 1 hour to get food due to overwhelming popularity but we would do it again just for the food."}
{"text":"Like the original location this place is hopping busy, food is just as good here as the other locations and as always buy the tortillas the best in Arizona."}
{"text":"When a place gets voted as having the best tortillas in Phoenix, it is worth a visit. When it delivers this well, it's worth every possible chance to eat there.  

So the graduation and assorted flyer mile and affinity point programs coordinated to have us in Carolina's area for a week. That's probably why we went four times. Even if we had been staying closer to the family (about an hour away) we would have gone at least twice. If I lived in metro Phoenix I'd probably go  as often as I could get there.

IT IS THAT GOOD. OK, there are a lot of things on the menu I didn't try. But the machaca and anything on those tortillas make being in Arizona worth it."}
{"text":"I am shocked at how few people give this place five stars. Carolina's is the most authentic Mexican food you will find not on a taco truck. They make the tortillas by hand but they don't use lard so they are good but not like the real thing. The beef tacos are wonderful, the red chile burro, and the oaxaca special are my fav's. The 3 way burro is also great. If you are into chimi's they all rock. I read one review that said the food had no flavor, well I hate to think maybe that person was sick and lost his taste buds. I have never had bad food here, actually it is consistently delicious. I always get my food to go because the dining area is nasty. It is always so crowded and hard to find a spot clean enough for me to want to eat at."}
{"text":"If Carolina was a women she would be my second wife ( 2nd because my wife now is #1 for a reason ) It seems professional and home made at the same dang time. The three way is to die for . Wife don't get jelly it's a burrito daaaang !! Red chili beef, beans, and green chili . Everything really is worth trying. Never disappointed ......NO LIE !!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to check this place out . Real good Mexican food especially for what I guess they consider this place a fast food Mexican spot . But taste better then some high end Mexican restaurants.when in a hurry and I want something to go or dine in like I did I will be coming here ."}
{"text":"Yet another Mexican fast food place made popular by people with no taste buds or basic food knowledge. YAY! I should have knowk by the customer base to turn around and walk right back out the door instead of waiting in line. I need to learn to go with my gut more but no I thought I'd give it a chance and people kept annoying me about the tortillas here. They are giant thin and not even fully cooked tortilla's, so what's so good about them again!?!?! The menu here is pretty damn BORING!! Some basic ass Mexican fare which in some parts of the country none of these items even exist! Just a guess but maybe just maybe some of you were high before going up in this Carolina North!?!? 

My Ma had a green chile burro it was THE worst ever congrats!! It barely had any meat in it or green chile!!! That's right it was a \"green chile\" burro made with maybe a teaspoon of actual green chile the rest was basically gravy. Not the good kind either I mean a lot of flour and water mixed in to the sauce that it was not even green it was gray!! GROSS!! A gravy burro doesn't sound too appetizing now does it?!?! The green chile burro gets -1 star here people. 

I had the cheese enchiladas w rice and beans. The rice was quite edible not burnt or crunchy but surprisingly fresh tasting and moist. I would eat it again if I had too the beans were not bad either nothing spectacular. Last but not least the cheese enchiladas.....they were good, I ate them and I don't even like red enchilada sauce. 

Now if I was in the area of the original location I would probably give it another go for sure. This location not so much however there is a far better Mexican place up the road that serves way better options and ummm real Mexican food and I don't care if it's cheap here either."}
{"text":"How Good Depends On What You Order.

 I have been to Carolina's a few times.  The food at Carolona's is hit or miss and the quality really depends on what you order.  Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entrée from a large menu. 

 As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates, walked over to the salsa bar, grabbed a  small cup filled it with salsa from the big stainless steel dispensers, and found a table.

The hard-shell taco, rice, beans, horchata and tortillas were just okay. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre at best (tortillas are hard, very little cheese).  The meal just wasn't very good.

It might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's."}
{"text":"This place is as good as any mexican restaurant, a whole lot cheaper and faster. I love their brown enchilada sauce, quite different. I wish they had ground beef for tacos though."}
{"text":"Amazing mexican!! Couldn't believe the quality difference of mexican food here than compared to the NE. Really good! Try the enchilada and tamales and im sure you will like the hot sauce!@!  great thumbs up all the way"}
{"text":"I love the potato bean and cheese burrito. Their enchilada sauce is pretty good and I love their salsa. This is definitely a HOLE IN THE WALL so keep that in mind if you're looking to dine in. You never know how long the line is to order or pick up so come prepared to wait either way. Nothing fancy, just good mexican food. I give it one less star because of the long lines and sometimes even ordering thru the phone you have to wait a long time to have somebody pick up and take your order. But hey, if you have cops and people in business suits eating here even though it's in the sketchiest part of town, you might as well give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Super fast, super delicious, super affordable.
and they have the BANG! drinks!!! 
I've had beef, machaca, and chicken tacos, burros, and tostadas. 
Even if there's a line, I have not experienced a long wait.
I stop by for a quick bite whenever I get a chance if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't give 5 stars to a place this loud, chaotic, and not exactly spotless.  But it is the day before Christmas Eve and half the city was in there buying tortillas, tamales, etc, including yours truly.

Of course, I had to have lunch too.  I had the 3-way burro (red, green, bean) so that I wouldn't have to choose which way to go.  All I can say is that if this what a 3-way is about, I'm in Mr and Mrs Carolina, and bring enough tortillas to cover a king-sized bed!  Those are damn good too.

I seriously need to find a reason to be in this part of town more often.  Oh, and some may have heard me gripe about so-called \"cheap\" Mexican food.  This really is cheap.  Tacos for $1.75, $3.25 for a burro, and I found a penny in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"I went to the dry run opening of the restaurant for friends and family. The tortillas are as good at this location as the original in Phoenix. :)"}
{"text":"The chips were hard, not a lot of choices for salsas, only red which was mild, the burritos wasn't good, the taco salad had a lot of meat but the shell was too brown."}
{"text":"I eat here several times a month! They are always packed because the food is so good. I recommend the number 3 combo!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Tortillas were the next because they are hand made. Machaca beef was way better than green chili beef. Green chili beef lacked a lot of flavor. Beans were very good and rice also"}
{"text":"We usually go to the Mohave location, but decided to try the store on Cactus instead.  We ordered chicken tacos, chips and salsa, guacamole and Carne Asada tacos.  The tacos were bland and had very little taste. The chips were stale and the salsa lacked taste also.  The guacamole was pretty pathetic too.  There are way too many great Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix to waste my time here."}
{"text":"Carolina's, you disappoint me. For a few months, your lines are always so long and tonight, there was only 1 party ahead of me. So either you changed or the mobs caught on.

The enchilada sauce has an Asian fusion taste (very weird), the salsa is so thin and watery I'd be better off with a straw, and it was all served cold. Incredibly disappointing considering I have driven from Gilbert to your Mohave location just for a burrito."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch or dinner this is one of my all time favorites in the valley for true mexican food. Nothing fancy .. you'll find only the basics. Order at the counter, sit down & wait for your number to be called then enjoy your meal on paper plates or in a styrofoam container. The chorizo or machaca & egg burritos for breakfast are very tasty and I enjoy everything on the menu for lunch/dinner.

This place would be 5 stars on my list if it 1) was open on Sundays and 2) served beer."}
{"text":"OMG Simply the BEST, excellent food, great low prices, all homemade chorizo, I cannot say enough about how great this place is.  Family oriented and divey but who cares when you can eat their food.  A great date place if you know the person for a little while.  Will return again and again.  Thanks for opening another store so close to my home.   Anyone rating this place below a 5 star should really have their palate checked. They don't serve liquor or beer, so don't expect it.  The Horchata is great."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Why do people go ape sht for this place? I've been here and to the original in Phoenix and it's ok, but not ballz-tastic like everyone says. The food at this location was just like the other one; not a lot of flavor and like warm temperature wise. I honestly prefer Fili B over this place."}
{"text":"This is a COMPLETELY different experience than the Carolina's on 91st Ave and Peoria store. This location is clean, well-kept, looks new, and has a good vibe inside of it. The food was even better here. Everything at this location seems to be on a higher level. 

I wanted to get Huevos Rancheros, and it's not on the menu. Isn't this blasphemy? I would say so. Settled on the Enchilada, Tostada, Taco combo. Delish. 

Everyone has raved about the tortillas, and they really are all of that, and then some. 

This is THE place in town to get quality FAST Mexican food. Worth the little detour from the Bertos brothers."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in on a Friday for lunch since I get off at noon each Friday and wasn't on a schedule. I got there a little after noon and while it was busy there was no line. SCORE! I had a bean and cheese burrito, carne asada taco and a dozen tortillas to take home (I mean how can you not grab a dozen tortilla when you come to Carolina's)! For them being pretty busy I didn't wait long. This was the first time I've gotten a taco and it was very tasty. The burrito was awesome like always. I know I will be back very soon as it's one of my favorite little spots."}
{"text":"Some of the best flour tortilla's in town.. food is about the same as any 'berto's around the valley. Which is fortunate 'cause I don't mind 'berto's. 
Green chile is pretty darn good here.. do it up in a foot long burrito with a horchata and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and delicious Mexican food. Chimichanga that I got was simple, yet delicious. Service was quick, and their new location in Scottsdale is way less sketch than their Phoenix location (although I enjoyed going there too). Lots of seating, and tables are turning over quickly, so not an issue finding a place, even on a busy Saturday. 

If you're environmentally conscious, you might hate this place, since almost everything they serve in is made of styrofoam, even if you're dining in. Keeps costs down, and makes taking stuff to go extremely easy, but seems to generate a lot of trash."}
{"text":"The food is always great, but the service has been getting slower and slower. Doesn't mean I wont continue to visit them for taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"This place is famous yes. I'm not going you tell you anything new. But the corn tamales, one of only a couple of non meat options, are still some of the best. What is not the best is the vegetarian burrito.  It's cold and few things are less appealing than a cold tortilla.
So, stick with the regular greasy stuff...save your veggie fix for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very overrated!.... my girlfriend's carne asada burrito was very dry...and my beef taco was also very dry..i can say the best thing was the chips...the salsa was just red water..top shelf is waaaay better"}
{"text":"Prices are good but quality is not there
Beans have no flavor too runny
Carne asada has no good flavor
They don't have home made aguas frescas"}
{"text":"This is by far the best fast food Mexican food in the east valley. Love this place. Brings back old memories of the original. Not matter what you order it's always delicious."}
{"text":"For some reason, my in-laws and friends enjoy eating Carolinas Mexican food for take out and eat in.  Maybe it's because the tortillas are fresh, and are actually good, when they are fresh.  

Do not be fooled by any other review of this place, the food is awful in so many ways:

1.  So much salt! On the chips especially, but you can taste the sodium,   and probably MSG, in all the meals, and there is A LOT of it in there, trust me!

2.  If the tortillas aren't fresh, they are rock hard and indigestible

3. The beans are pureed to no end

4.  They cover their boring flavors and terrible enchilada sauce with cheese.  Everything had cheese, cheese and more cheese!

5.  Unfresh produce, with brown lettuce and mushy tomatoes. 

Never again will I eat at Carolinas Mexican food, it must be some of the most unhealthy food I have ever ingested, and if you care even one iota about your heart and your health, you probably should avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  The tortillas, chips and salsa, and machaca are especially good!  Nothing fancy but great food and fast place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Didn't understand the hype about the place though. Reminded me of chino-bandido's"}
{"text":"I am convinced people don't know good food. I have gone many times and this time felt the need to write a review. 

First the establishment is a mess. Stuff everywhere and this happens to be everytime..not just this one. Salsa Splatter everywhere, holes in the wall paint missing etc. I've never seen a table cleaned. 

Food- Chips are hard and thin. 
I ordered chunky salsa ( which is seperate charge) and got the free salsa. 

Guacamole doesn't taste like guac.

Chimichanga is bland."}
{"text":"Best taco shop in Phoenix - hand made flour tortillas are delicious - shredded beef tacos are out of this world. The absolute best is their salsa!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough nice things about Carolina's. We eat here just about once a week because it's so affordable and delicious. Also, there is just something so comforting about a warm homemade tortilla the size of a tire. My absolute favorite menu item is the Oaxaca special.  The Oaxaca is a burro filled with pinto beans, chorizo, potatoes and cheese. All of this goodness costs $3.45 and is great for breakfast or dinner.  If you are not into chorizo I would also recommend a soft taco or burro with chicken in the green chili. The chicken practically melts in your mouth and the green chili is very flavorful."}
{"text":"The best tortillas this side of the border. 
Green chili was very good, with a little kick but not too much
Price and service we good.
The place was super busy but kept clean and kept em moving."}
{"text":"el mejor del mundo! the best! go back to the older cheese maybe but, either way it wont stop from eating here 24/7 lol I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! When the Mesa location opened the food wasn't as good as the Phoenix location, but they definitely have improved since they opened."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out they opened a Carolinas in Mesa. Obvi the tortillas are the best. I'm normally a green chile type of girl but I go for the red chile at Carolinas! So good. Chips and salsa are good too with a self serving salsa bar. I just wish it had more of a restaurant-y feel at the mesa location. Other than that, I feel blessed it has come to the east valley!"}
{"text":"Always good salsa, tortillas made on site, and beans!  We go here at least once a week, even though it is 30 minutes away!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The tortillas are the best in the city!  This is comfort Mexican food at it's finest. Inexpensive. Fast and friendly service.  Best Of Phoenix for a reason. No frills in decor but you dont come here for that. The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"What happened? Did this place sell? Food has changed for the worse.  Combos used to come with lettuce and tomato's   Prices up, tomatoes gone, and everything covered with melted cheese.  Not the same place I remember. Even the tortillas seem different."}
{"text":"First impression, I saw a lot of customers in there meaning the place could be good. Despite the customers & friendly environment, the food was cold and needed more seasoning specifically the green and red chili, which. were pretty bland. Also the carne asada burrito was also cold and tasted like it was sitting there for a while. Chorizo was okay that's what gets the stars."}
{"text":"I NEVER thought it would be possible to give Carolina's less than 5 stars.  I love Mexican food and Carolina's has always been the gold standard.  I have been going to the original for 25 years and this one since it opened.  Unfortunately our last several trips have not been good.  They have a help wanted sign on the door and its clear they are having a difficult time finding good people.  We ordered our regular last night which is not complicated - a burrito enchilada style and the #15 flautas dinner along with chips and salsa.  First, even though the line was not long it took way too long to get our order in.  The place was not all that busy but it took about 20 minutes to get our food after we ordered.  They apparently do a big phone in business as it seemed they were calling out phone orders over and over.  Once we got our food, my burrito was good but luke warm.  My wife's flautas were ice cold.  Not just because the toppings were cold but they had clearly been sitting for a while.  Even the beans were cold.  She took it back and it took them an additional 10 minutes to redo the meal.  We sat right by the food assembly line and as I watched them it was clear they were struggling with how to do it efficiently.  There wasn't a person working there who looked older than 20 and most were clearly teenagers.  The gal running it and expediting the food was really struggling.  Orders were stacked all around her and it was clear orders were waiting after being put together.  I don't think we were the only ones who were disappointed as most people waiting for their food were not smiling.  Since we had time to sit there we also noticed how dirty the place was.  Napkins, trash and food on the floors and it was very sad.  There really wasn't any indication the place was being managed.  My wife likely won't go back.  I will but not as often without my better half.  I really hope they get their act together.  Its easy to put up with some of the not so good aspects when the food is stellar but if the quality of the food drops off, they may not be long for this world."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the the first time to get some of their homemade flour tortillas. They are huge and worked out perfectly for a week plus of breakfast burritos. I  will have to make a return trip to have a meal, it obviously very popular judging by the number of cars in the parking lot and the line I waited in to place my order."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to Mexican places in Arizona.
I really enjoy the chicken flautas and enchiladas. The enchilada sauce is sooo good, I love mixing some with the rice.

The rice is very good and I like the fact I can get whole beans since the refried beans contain pork. 
I don't think there is carne asada, since everything says shredded beef so I wish they had that.

It is always busy there and not a lot of sitting area. It is better to order ahead so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in the valley. They aren't the fanciest, but they offer consistent quality for the best price. They have the best tortillas in town for sale. The machaca beef is outstanding."}
{"text":"the tortillas are killer here! huge and cheap and sooooo good when fresh! but the rest of the food is .... meh. it's a good fix when you're hungry and craving some cheap mexican eats from a clean place (ie not one of the 24 hr bertos). unfortunately, they have really inconvenient hours, and aren't open too late. and some of the cashiers seem to hate everyone that wants to order food.

if you want menudo, get here early on the weekends. with that said, their menudo is completely unremarkable - not spicy at ALL. and unfortunately, i have no alternatives.... what can i say? it's cheap, fresh, and clean."}
{"text":"Moderate hype alert here. Carolina's was good but not \"wait in a long line\" or \"best in town\" good. In fact, we're enchilada people and didn't find theirs to be particularly appealing. The sauce had an unwelcomed spice to it (for us) which tended to overpower the otherwise bland contents. The chimichanga wasn't bad and was the item that evidently led to the relatively long wait for our food. Even then, we've as good if not better elsewhere nearby.

Glad we came, but no real reason to go back."}
{"text":"Flew in from Florida and ended up going right to lunch here.  It was amazing.  Authentic Mexican.  No fuss and incredibly reasonable.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They say Carolina's has the best tortillas in Phoenix and I would agree.  It's a greasy spoon for sure, but the food is great.  A must try for anyone that wants good Mexican food."}
{"text":"My family has catered from Carolina's before and LOVED the food.  I am hosting a party in the near future and wanted to cater from there.  I called to speak with someone about catering and was on hold for over 5 minutes.  I hung up, went on the website and was going to research it there.  I was unable to print their catering menu due to the way they have it uploaded on the web.  So I called back to talk to someone about catering.  After being on hold another FIVE MINUTES, Thelma came on the line and I asked her to fax me a catering menu...she asked me to hold so she could get a catering manager on the phone. I told her I had already lost 10 minutes of my life to holding for that already, gave her my number and asked her to fax me the catering menu.  A moot point, because if it takes 10 minutes to get someone on the line, how good is the catering service going to be?  I'll be getting my catering from another company :("}
{"text":"When I saw they were opening one at Country Club and the 60 I couldn't wait to eat there.  I have eaten at the one in Peoria many times and love it.  I have to say I was very disappointed at my lunch at this location.  To be fair, I went opening week so they may still be working out some issues.

The green chile tasted like it was made with corn starch instead of masa.  Very little flavor.  The only redeeming point of the meal was the tortillas.  I had the opportunity to go back to the Peoria location this week and could immediately taste the difference.  I'll give them another shot soon to see if things improve, but I was hoping for a much better meal."}
{"text":"This place had a really nice modern and clean look. When I arrived it was packed with people. Mind you it was a Tuesday night so I was excited to see what all the fuss was about. Unfortunately the food quality wasn't good. I ordered the carne asada burrito which was pretty big by the way. It had a lot of meat which was good but it just didn't have much flavor n was kind of dry. I like my burritos to have guacamole to make it juicier but only thing that you can use to add flavor to it was the salsa that they had."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner.  Ordered the enchiladas.  They were really really spicy for this California girl.  The handmade tortillas are not really hand made.  Service was fast."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Carolina's that I convinced my husband to try it on a Tuesday evening. The place was packed, always a good sign. We placed our order to go, and went towards the pick up area to wait, and wait, and wait. Finally after a half an hour, one of the girls noticed we were still there. Apparently they had been waiting on something. We got our stuff and left. I was still expecting the best, after all the wait had to have been worthwhile, right? Wrong! The food was lukewarm at best, the tostada/taco shells were stale, and my husband said his enchiladas were very bland. The best thing and this was truly the best I've ever had were the chocolate chimis for dessert. I would go back just for those. I so wanted this to be better than it was, but unfortunately it just fell short."}
{"text":"Anyone that makes their own chorizo should come here first and taste the Chorizo at Carolinas and think very carefully before they brag again about making their own. It will save them the shame of knowing your \"homemade\" version will always be inferior to what Carolinas whips up every day.

It's been a few years since I've been here and I always remember it being good, but didn't truly remember how good it was.
other food is great too. Their amazing
I'm only in town for a few days and guarantee I will be here at least one more time before I leave, maybe for breakfast tomorrow. 

Their giant flour tortillas are awesome and they have jamaica on the soda fountain. 

Their kitchen is open, so you can see the production of all their delicious foods."}
{"text":"I love red chile. I judge the quality of a Mexican restaurants food based on how they do red chile. The Original Carolinas in Phx on Mohove has the absolute best red chile. I would drive from Gilbert into south Phx for my red chile fix. 
When I found out that they expanded to Mesa, I was excited, and worried at the same time. 
When we arrived we were treated with the standard long line. As soon as I smelled fresh tortillas being cooked, my stomach knew it was game on!  The menu is the same, except it's new and not dilapidated like the original one . Ordered by foot long red chile, chips and salsa and I tried a carne asada burro instead of my staple Oaxaca Special burro. 
The salsa was the same great, simple hot sauce. The chips were the same. 
When I got my food, i attacked my red chile. It was good, really good, but just not quite the same. But it was way better than 99% of red chile out there. The meat was not as tender. But I attribute that to the volume of people they are serving. The carne asada burro was fantastic, but could only eat a few bites as I was stuffed. 
I will be back. Soon. You should go now and get a foot long red chile burro!"}
{"text":"After a few bad and early in the trip Mexican food experiences, this was a nice find! 
Almost ready to bale on the food, Carolina's renewed the interest. Better quality materials and service."}
{"text":"Eating/drinking on styrofoam and eating with plastic utensils needs to be your mindset since this is what you will be doing.  The food is worth it.  I consider it some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix.  Take some tortillas home and order a side of chips and salsa with your meal.  The salsa is a bit hot for some of my friends but I think it is perfect.  All the food I have even had here has been awesome!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast burritos especially the big meaty tasty chorizo and egg.   The machaca is great stuff as well.  More than casual place with quality food."}
{"text":"Favorite authentic Mexican restaurant in town. The house-made tortillas live up to their accolades. We order chips, salsa and tortillas often for parties and they do catering for large parties as well."}
{"text":"My first time trying \"Carolina's\"...it was okay. I had the #11 (2 red tamales, beans and rice) The sauce was great, rice was good (wasn't dry like some places) beans eh. The tamales were smaller than I expected. I also tried their \"Green Chile burrito\"...I won't do that again. It was more like a gravy burrito. Everything else was okay like I said. Will I ever come back? Of course I will. They've got a nice sized menu with food I'm willing to try and I'm always hungry.  Oh, I almost forgot they make fresh homemade flour tortillas...niiiice!"}
{"text":"This place I believe is a chain off the famous original diner located in south phoenix.  The food tastes exactly the same as the original.  I highly recommend trying this place out at least once especially if you like Mexican food.  My favorite is the cheese  quesada, folowed by the taco and burrito.  I think it's best known for the burrito.  The environment is setup like your typical fast food joint and you don't have to worry about dressing up since its very casual."}
{"text":"Carolina's on the east side of town now! Yea that's what I am taking about! I have been a fan of Carolinas for years and am happy to see them on my side of town!

My goto items are the red chili beef & bean burritos, shredded beef tacos and tostadas, and plenty of there hot sauce.

I won't lie, I sometimes crave their red chili burritos, they are so good and my idea of perfect comfort food. Fresh handmade tortillas, perfectly flavored and spiced red chili gravy over tender beef and homemade refried beans, man it's the perfect burrito. The tacos are legit too! The perfect crunch when biting into it! Can't get enough."}
{"text":"Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Get a buttered tortilla it is incredible!  I like the green machaca, get the foot long it's worth the 90 cents.

It's fast, cheap, and easy but it is good!  You can't find better inexpensive Mexican food.  The tortillas are to die for."}
{"text":"I'm almost embarrassed writing this review, because this was my FIRST experience with Carolina's and after telling a few people, I quickly learned there's a bomb sister spot in Phoenix that's been around forever! 

Well, all reputations aside, I can tell you that my expectations were very unassuming because I just thought this was a new Mexican spot to enjoy. I was worried given the neighborhood, but this location is super clean and huge! great for big gatherings. They also have a nice patio area. I ordered the chicken chimichanga, which came with a side of sour cream and guac on the side, the meal also came with their rice and beans. The tortilla was nice and crispy, but I don't think the meat had much flavor, my tiny plastic side of guac was only half filled (come on guys! I need more than one bite full) and the rice and beans, again had no flavor.

I will go back again to try something different, but my first experience didn't WOW me. I'm hoping for better flavor next time, any one with more Carolina's experience that can recommend a better dish for me to try next time?"}
{"text":"Dining at Carolina's always reminds me of how things can be just so right with the world, all without any extra trouble or fuss.  The place is always hopping with a bustling counter crowd, particularly after work with takeout orders.  Machaca (in anything) is moist and flavorful, and the tortillas are whisper thin, just the right amount chewy, and perfectly cooked - the perfect home to any conceivable filling combo.  Better yet, you can get tortillas by the dozen to take home and fill as you please.  Something to think about the next time you have guests over for margarita night and want to impress the socks off of them with nibbles.  Hatch chili cheese crisps anyone?

This place is unequivocally not for people who want romance, candlelight, ambiance and serenades with their tortillas.  It's for people who like their aguafrescas in styrofoam cups, their red and green chile combos on plastic trays, and don't mind counter service and booth seating.  Basically, it's unfussy heaven.

A caveat - come here for the tortillas more than the combo plates.  You can find better tamales and tacos all over the city, whereas the tortillas are the main attraction.  Treat it like going to a seafood restaurant and purposefully NOT ordering the steak.  To do otherwise would be silly, kids."}
{"text":"We heard raving reviews about Carolinas and we're sad to say it was disappointing. The food wasn't bad but it was cold! It just didn't seem fresh. That all said we will try it again, hoping that it will live up to reviews next time."}
{"text":"I've already eaten here three days in a row it's SO good!!!!! The machaca meat is the best so flavorful. The butter tortillas are amazing. I'd buy just a dozen of their tortillas."}
{"text":"This place is wildly popular and established. The food is cheap and the delivery system is efficient. There is nothing bad on the menu. Its all in a decent sauce if you like red or green. The bean burritos are smooth and cheesy. The homemade tortillas are what keeps people coming back. 
The food Is not a good value. The special
Burrito is filled with potatoes as a filler. I would rather pay more to get no filler and more meat. The green chili burrito is the diameter of a small hot dog with a bun. I order two and then it's not a deal and I'm eating tons of tortilla and less fun stuff inside. A good burrito is supposed to have a great tortilla (which they do) but that holds all of the delicious toppings together and makes the burrito."}
{"text":"The food is known to be real good and it really is. However,you have to be patient in line and then wait for your food. I stood in line for 20 minutes @ 5:30ish pm.  That's why I score this place a 4 stars for the taste of food, but take away 2 stars for the long wait.  Ugh"}
{"text":"Good food but rude customers. It was crowded and nowhere to sit for dine in.  One f*t a**ed lady wouldn't budge and she was take out. I saw this happen numerous times actually.  Move it people haha."}
{"text":"It's great to have this place a little closer than the far north valley, but it honestly won't be our first choice when it comes to Mexican food.  The tortillas are the bright spot in their lineup.  You can always count on them to be delicious.  They charge you for a side of green onions at this location, which the north location never used to do.  It took quite a while for us to receive our order.  I have always had an issue with the amount of trash Carolina's generates.  They use a ton of styrofoam and wrap every food item multiple times, which creates a lot of unneeded waste.  I am a fan of their bean burritos and their red salsa, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here."}
{"text":"The tortillas at Carolina's are legendary.  Everyone in AZ knows that.  I am a bean expert and I think Carolina's has some amazing beans; not too salty and not too bacon-y flavored.  The one problem I have with Carolina's is the use of SO MUCH packaging!!  They use Styrofoam everything which is horrible for the environment and also horrible to put hot food in because the chemicals leach into the food.  Each item is wrapped in multiple layers of paper and I feel like we can fill a landfill with just the trash from a meal from two people.  They have got to put some recycle bins in here and change their packaging.  Would it be so hard to put combination meals on washable plates?"}
{"text":"Excellent tortillas and red/green & bean burritos at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"So happy to find a good Mexican food restaurant in the area. Decent price and quick service. This is our new go-to spot for Mexican food for sure!"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed the food here. Took food home today. Ordered a machaca dinner but got a bean burro. Not even close people!!!

Should have checked after I saw dine in people repeatedly bring their orders back due to errors."}
{"text":"Brought home a taco salad. Took one bite and threw it away. I would avoid this place!! Soggy, no chicken, no beans. No nothing. Waited in line for 30 minutes for junk. Never again"}
{"text":"Don't get your food to go unless you're OK with the order being wrong at least 75% of the time. To say the management doesn't care about your constant wrong order is an understatement. And you won't get your money back either. I was also being charged $3.00 for extra LETTUCE on my tacos which only actually contained extra lettuce about 25% of the time. Never again."}
{"text":"My friend goes here all the time and brought me with her once - now we go all the time together! Great atmosphere, awesome good that really tastes like legitimate Mexican food, the way it SHOULD taste. It may not be gourmet, but it's still good and very high quality for the price!

I always get a #9: 2 chicken tacos with rice and beans. So good! But I definitely need to try their other menu options, too. I've heard the burritos and enchiladas are great.
Oh, and the horchata is amazing. Drink it."}
{"text":"We had a solid first visit. Chicken chimichangas all around. The tortillas are bomb--especially fried. You can taste each individual calorie. The chicken is very tender and moist, not at all fatty, but not really mind-blowing. I've had better chimichangas, but this was still a decent one. The chips are pretty good, but the salsa is fairly mediocre. It tastes too much like tomato paste and is too thin. It would be nice if they had a red salsa that tasted fresher and if they had some other salsa options--like a really good pico de gallo and a nice tomatillo salsa. 

The building was clean and spartan--concrete floors, white walls, exposed duct work. Nothing fancy. The food came pretty quickly--less than a ten-minute wait around 5:40 on a Thursday night. The prices are really cheap. And the free refills on drinks are nice. Overall, we'd give this another shot so we could try something else to see if there's an item we like better."}
{"text":"We've had take out from Carolina's a couple of times, but have never eaten inside. The food is great. The mini-chimis are tasty. We got tortillas to go last time, and they are nice and soft, making great burritos. I'd venture in for a sit down meal but they don't serve alcohol, and Mexican food is just not the same without beer."}
{"text":"Authentic cafeteria style Mexican food. Well done but double check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. 
Tacos are $2.75 which I think is a little pricey, especially if your getting a potato taco. I'd come back but wouldn't make it my main fast food Mexican place. I also got a taco salad which was good."}
{"text":"The food was good; the homemade tortillas looked so good (after I had already ordered something else) that I wanted to come back to try them.  
      But then the wait!!!  Yes, the place was packed and phone orders were constantly coming in.  They had a sufficient crew ( it seemed to me) to crank out the food in a timely manner-- and yet I waited over 20 minutes!  Several other people in there came up to the pick-up point and complained about how long they had been waiting.  I asked one lady if this was common here and she gave me the arched eyebrow with a yes nod.  So I would remind the server every 5 minutes that I still didn't have my 2- plate order to go.  
     I don't get it-- do they just need more organization to crank out the orders in the order they came in, or what!??!   
      I came here because of the Yelp reviews, but I saw 3 or 4 people who may have waited longer than I, who were pretty torked at the long wait or their order being forgotten-- and this was in my 20-25 minutes of standing there waiting for my order.  
      I think they have good food, and you can watch them making the huge tortillas behind a glass enclosure behind the crew putting the plates together--so I was entertained at least!  
     Hope this place gets some organization because they've got something good going here food-wise."}
{"text":"So glad they opened this one near us. They have the best tortillas and beans. We also really like the tamales. Both kinds are great, but we prefer the green corn. It was full of corn, green chile, and cheese. Very flavorful. The tacos and chimis are good too. Just wish the hot sauce was a little less spicy. If you want good plain hearty Mexican food come here. Thank you for opening this location. We have become regular customers."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Authentic menu items and tortillas are amazing (can even be bought in bags \"to go\")"}
{"text":"Carolina's is at the corner of Cactus and Cave Creek Road with its own parking lot that was easy to navigate and find a spot in.  Walking inside it became obvious that this place is a local hot spot since it was packed!  

To order you go to the cashier at the front counter and pick either individual items or a meal combo.  The cashier was helpful in recommending menu items and was nice enough to suggest a combo deal for us that was cheaper than the meal we had pieced together ourselves.  

I had the #15 - three flautas with a side of rice and beans with a taco added on (hard shell).  My fiancee had the two taco meal with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were very tasty, which we have had a hard time finding since our move to the Valley.  The taco fillings were good (shredded beef, cheese, lettuce, etc.) but the taco shell itself was oddly greasy and tough to eat.  On his last taco, my fiancee actually just pulled out the filling pieces and ate them without the shell.  

The place itself wasn't the most organized and cleanest, but in their defense we went at dinner time and it was very busy.  There were a fair amount of people taking to go orders, which we may do if we venture here again.  

Overall: B-  
Suggestions?  Try the soft taco instead of the hard shells and I don't recommend the flautas since they were a touch burnt and there is WAY more shell to filling ratio on those - so not quiet as yummy."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their burritos and prepared items. I usually just get sides here.

Their rice is really good and their tortillas are awesome. They are fresh baked and grande. Try out their butter tortilla. It is the best thing on their menu and worth it."}
{"text":"Their homemade tortillas and salsa rock!  The plates dishes are a bit greasy so we switched to the ala carte meals which are much better in my opinion.  Love their potato & bean burrito.  Don't expect fancy but do expect to pay less.  Always bustling crowds in here so grab a seat after ordering."}
{"text":"Fantastic flavor and great prices. Can't wait to go again. Red Chile was excellent and of course the tortillas are awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Mexican food.  Buy some tortillas and chirizo to take home with you."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I'm a creature of habit so I can only speak on a few different menu items.  I always order a bean and potato burro (hold the cheese) and a bean tostada (again, hold the cheese).  If I'm getting the order To-Go I always order extra hot sauce on the side.  Neither of the items come with hot sauce.  Sometimes, I order a package of tortilla's to take home.  Anyway, I've been there enough times to say that I really love it.  The employee's are ALWAYS nice and always seem to be doing their particular responsibility well.  Nine times out of Ten, the place is packed... so be prepared.  Also, they are not open on Sundays and are closed on holidays and sometimes a day or two before and after holidays."}
{"text":"The mini chimis were very good. I liked the rice. The beans were a little to watery. They should give pagers instead of saying the number out loud. They  were pretty busy, almost every table was taken. We didn't have to wait long at all for our food"}
{"text":"Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars.

The food was delicious.   A bit on the spicy side.  The group had a enchiladas, tacos, and quesadillas.   All of it was great.  Definitely retuning when I am in the 

 The self serve drink station was a bit congested and they ran out of brewed ice tea."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I was recommended this place from some of my friends so I had pretty high expectations. It was pretty crowded on a Saturday afternoon (granted, Cinco de Mayo) that I felt lucky snagging a seat.

The food was decent with good portions, and the menu was simple enough to not be overwhelmed. For $10, I enjoyed my mini chimichangas with machaca (and the salsa!) It was definitely heavy enough for me to ration out my portions and have some leftovers for dinner. Yummy, but this place isn't somewhere I'm dying to go back to. Worth checking out if you're in the area and craving a big meal though!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food at affordable prices!

Hot fresh and delicious!!!  Our go to spot!"}
{"text":"I've been in Phoenix for about 3 weeks now (relocating from So Cal) and have been very disappointed in the Mexican Restaurants thus far. A friend of mine suggested Carolina's. It's only 3 miles from my office so I gave it a shot for lunch. GLAD I DID! 

I went with my wife and a colleague who both verified my evaluation! We all 3 ordered different things. I'll speak for my chimichanga.... Lightly fried and full of white chicken meat. I also ordered some chips and salsa (extra) which seemed fresh as can be. I ordered 6 corn tortillas to go because i heard they were so good (made fresh daily). I had to try one (they were still warm). Delicious! 

Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but by far the best Mexican food thus far in Phoenix. You order and pay at the counter and your number is called within minutes. Fair prices, too. This place will be in my regular rotation for lunches going forward!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for many years and LOVE the food. It looses a star in my book though due to cleanliness concerns. The ladies room has never had hot water so I can't help but wonder if there is any in the place. The door handles and entry areas are filthy, and the common food areas (get your drinks and hot sauce counters) often look like they need attention. Again I love the food here but wish they were more concerned with the cleanliness."}
{"text":"I haven't stopped thinking about this place since I left. It's everything you could ever hope for in a dive-y Mexican joint. FRESH DOUGHY TORTILLAS. I repeat GET THE BUTTERED TORTILLAS.... or 10. I mean they're $1. You can take them home and freeze them... or eat them all in a day. 

The beans are just. SO BEANY AND CREAMY AND GOOD. You can't go wrong with a classic bean and cheese here. It's actually a Must. 

The Machaca is a fave. It's fancy for shredded beef. So moist and flavorful I like the Machaca burrito or carne Asada myself. 

Chips are salty and good and the guacamole is chunky! Better than expected. Not the fake smooth kind but actual real restaurant style guac.
Now on to the salsa... a Mexican place is only as good as their salsa, right? Well I've read mixed reviews on the salsa. I will say that I did in fact enjoy it. It was heavy on the garlic but I love garlic. It's a thicker paste salsa not watery which I also prefer. Anyway, this place is a 10/10 must try. It's fast cheap and DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this location is nothing like the original. Food came out cold and tasted terrible!"}
{"text":"Yum! I could eat it every day. My favorite is the \"special\" burro.  My second would have to be the two tacos. Beef or chicken, both delicious. Affordable, quick, and take some tortillas home for later."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Not sure what happened but the food has turned into the most flavor less Mexican food I have ever had.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service experience.  My granddaughter is allergic to gluten.  They would not just give her a burrito without a tortilla. Real easy, just pour the stuffing into a bowl or cup.  They charged my daughter for a more expensive plate.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"LOVE the shredded beef tacos! They come with a generous amount of cheese! Pleasant staff and ALL fountains drinks are UNLIMITED refills!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. 

I wish there was one closer to Tempe. 

I would recommend the chorizo burrito (freakin delicious)!!! The guy taking my order said it was one of his favorites, so I thought I'd try it. It did not disappoint. 

Everything else on the menu is excellent too. Love the chicken marinated in green chili!"}
{"text":"I usually love this restaurant, but tonight the food was disgusting. The mini chimis were not freshly cooked, and the beef was like processed meat. Even the tortilla for the taco salad was stale. I'll try again, but if it's like tonight, I won't be eating there."}
{"text":"Yum yum and yum! We stopped by for some lunch burritos. It was a super long wait but worth it. We ordered green chili burros with rice inside. Their salsa is tasty too"}
{"text":"This is an inexpensive Mexican restaurant that has great quality food. Very tasty, very crowded, and did I say very cheap? 

I'll definitely be back, but for you all, don't expect gourmet anything. This is downright casual with no frills."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this restaurant. This was my first visit to a Carolina's Mexican Food location and I had really high hopes for it especially since people have such high reviews for this place on Yelp.

When I came here this past Saturday evening, the place was packed and in such a disarray. Almost all their tables were taken up and so I had to settle for a table right in front of the entrance which was not wiped down and covered in crumbs. As I sat there waiting for my food, I heard numbers being called out and people sitting at tables get up and get their to-go orders. Wait!! They didn't have an area for people to sit while they waited on their orders so they took up tables that people who wanted to dine in couldn't use. This is a big thing in my book, they need a waiting area for people who aren't dining in can wait in. 

Other than that, their condiment/drink/utensil counter was a huge mess! Everything was all messed up and there was spilled drinks all over the counter. I didn't even want to touch anything from that area. Same with the hot sauce section. Even though their sauces are in pump containers with bowls under them to catch anything the would drop, people somehow still managed to get sauces spilled all over the area. Again..no thanks for me. I didn't even bother getting any of their sauces. 

I do understand that they were busy with lots of customers and orders, but while I was up trying to order, several people interrupted me to let the guy at the register know that the drink machine was out of ice..ugh. 

On a positive note, the food was amazing!! I had originally wanted to dine in, but with all the mess I decided to take my food home to eat. By the time I got home, my food wasn't as hot or fresh yet it still was so good! I ordered 2 hard shelled chicken tacos and one soft Carne Asada taco. All of the tacos were filled to the top with meat and toppings. Meats were well flavored and moist. Would definitely go back just for the tacos!! The tacos all cost $2.50 each. My guest got a cheese enchilada, which had a great tasting red sauce. I don't usually like the red sauce that they put on enchiladas, but this one was very tasty. He also got a bean and cheese chimichanga. He said it was well cooked and flavored. 

All in all, not a bad place to come, but I'll probably always take my food to go unless I come at opening."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is quite good when it's warm.  Unfortunately ours was cold by the time our number was finally called.  There were 4 or 5 teeny boppers mostly starring at each other instead of calling out one of the many orders that were ready and piling up.  Every now and then one of the kids would grab the order on top and call it out while the orders beneath just sat there.  In the end it took 25 mins to get our food."}
{"text":"Carolina's is the perfect place for a quick lunch without all the fuss. Quality, inexpensive food with kind service in a clean environment- oh, and it's absolutely delicious. That matters too ya know. I doubt there's a bad menu choice here but I've had and would recommend the machaca plate with tortillas (order two!) and rice and beans, chicken tacos and the apple chimis."}
{"text":"This places is miles above the Filiberto's, Ariberto's, or any other widget-bertos that you come across in the great state of AZ. Like many of the reviews have said, the tortillas are soft and chewy and thoroughly delicious. I work right around the corner from this place, and it is incredibly crowded at lunchtime. May fav is the bean and potato burrito - just the tastiest thing. I know you are thinking - potato? In a burrito... but it's good I promise!

I have a very sensitive stomach.. this might be TMI but my friends always make fun of \"Grandma\" that can't eat at crappy food establishments.. i.e. Jack 'n the Box because \"remember that one time we went there and then went straight to Disneyland? Michelle almost lost it on Space Mountain!\"

I can't eat at a lot of mexican joints that will \"tear you up\" as my guy friends say... and this place doesn't do that! So, for that, you get 5 stars Carolinas!"}
{"text":"I'm quite happy to have stumbled onto Carolina's North for some really good Mexican eats. Is this place worth all the five stars I've seen? Nah, but for now it is a very solid 4 stars.

I had a chicken taco, a tamale and a chorizo with potato burrito and they tasted very good. This helped me overlook the things I'm not that keen about the place ... crazy atmosphere during busy times, dive-ish good looks and hard to get tables during the rush.

I'm sure to find my way back here whenever I'm in town! Really good cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Prices okay. The most authentic thing was the temperature inside. Just like a summer day at a taco stand in Mexico. HOT! No air or swamp cooler! Hotter inside than out! Better food at Mucha Loocha on Alma School and 8th. Prices are higher but, at least they have air."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, and I love tex-mex, which probably makes me a little harsher on this place than others would be.  The ambiance is perfect.  Exactly what you would expect from this kind of place.  Quick, cheap, easy.  The styrofoam containers everything is served in and the plastic silverware it comes with is a nice touch, too.

But the food is a little lacking.  I had the cheese enchilada combo and the rice and beans were excellent.  The actual enchiladas though...left something to be desired.  I don't know what it was, but they just tasted...funky.  Like they had been cooked in my old gym sneakers.  After I ran a 5k.  With athlete's foot.

Now maybe the cheese enchiladas are an aberration.  Maybe I have a different idea of what kind of greasy Tex-Mex I can expect out here.  Who knows.  My experience here was just not that great--which makes me very sad.  I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I've always heard about this place after living here most of my life.  Now, this was not the original, but they opted to branch out so I tried it.  My first impression was that is was had a very modern and trendy design like a lot of newer business that are opening. The concept is definitely the new business model, order your food (either dine in or take out) but everything is conveniently pack for take out/leftovers.  We tried a couple of combo plates and a side order of a red tamale along with chips & salsa.  For the most part, everything was definitely edible, but lacked seasoning/flavor.  Now, their chips were light and salted lightly, which I enjoyed.  The salsa was questionable at first glance, because it appeared very watery, but once you taste it, it has a rather nice kick.  Salsa & Chips is what saved this review.  I would have given them only 2 stars, because it was only a slight step above Del Taco & Taco Bell.  And the red tamale I order was incorrect, they gave me green chili instead; but we had cut into it and taken a piece, so I didn't bother to go up and exchange.  The service is quick, but the place fills up quicker and the person that took my order was courteous.  I would get take out from here; but I just wouldn't necessarily go out of my way."}
{"text":"Food is good but not great.  Tortillas are excellent and come out warm as they are making their own. I arrived around 9am and there was no line.
Breakfast burritos are about the same price as other restaurants but smaller in size. Cheese is extra and they don't add much. I'll still end up coming back because the tortillas are so good."}
{"text":"Nothing Mexican about this place. The taco reminded me of what you get at Jack In The Box. Salsa sucked. Not even a slight chance I will eat here a second time!"}
{"text":"Some of the best restaurants are the ones that taste like they are right from home. That is how Carolina's Mexican Food is. I been eating at this place for years and it takes like the real deal. All I can say is the food is \"YUMMY.\"

Read the history about this location and other locations. This restaurant has been around for many years. Known for their famous handmade right in the kitchen tortillas that melt in your mouth.

Daily lunch specials. Always fresh and tasty. Be sure to bring home the salsa or place an order for catering. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Would normally get them 5 stars because we have been eating at different Carolina's restaurants for 20 years in the valley. Love their food! Unfortunately had a recent experience where I spent $50 on food for several families. Requested a single corn tortilla quesadilla for a child who can't have gluten because of an allergy. Though they have cheese and have corn tortillas they were unwilling to make that for me because it's not on menu. Incredibly insensitive and really poor management as the manager refused to actually come and talk to me. Hopefully they'll reconsider how they handle this in the future. Big miss in how they treat long time customers..."}
{"text":"This was our first experience here at Carolinas.  I have a combo plate with a cheese enchilada and tamale. Both items were excellent and the rice and beans were extremely tasty and I'm so glad as we haven't found many places with good beans.  My wife had the bean and potato burrito and added cheese for $0.15 and it was well worth it.  My son had a cheese quesadilla and he is the true taster, he ate every bite.  They make their tortillas fresh in the back kitchen and you can taste the difference.  We will be back to try more items.

Keep in mind that they are closed on Sundays.  Pricing is cheaper than most fast food restaurants.  A typical combo plate is $5 and a soda is $1, which is rare these days."}
{"text":"The food here tastes exactly the same as the original location. Fresh tortillas to go, umm yes! Love me some shreaded beef tacos and a 3-way."}
{"text":"If you love crunchy tacos, this place is for you. The shells are so fresh you can taste the hot oil on them. Love them. Also prices are awesome for what you get!!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken taco, it's amazingly good if you don't mind a little grease. Call in your order ahead of time-it's always insanely busy, and make sure you check that you have everything. They've forgotten to give me my order of chips a few times, which is really a bummer because the chips are some of the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"We've never had a bad meal at this restaurant.  Even our out-of-town guests want to go to Carolina's when they are in"}
{"text":"Everything.  I mean everything is out of this world.    Yum yum yum. I could drink the salsa."}
{"text":"Slow service. 23 minutes? For 2 Tacos. Way to cold. Bathroom a wreck. No tp, no paper towels: employee walked out so they know. Don't care. Then they got it wrong.  Don't get the raving reviews."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tortillas in Arizona,  most of the time I just order 2 dozen tortillas to go; they are amazing. They have a large menu and should satisfy just about anyone's taste. So, skip Taco Bell and go to Carolina's!"}
{"text":"if you haven't been here then it is your loss. Chimichanga style it all. haha no, but really all the food here is delicious. I love their in-house, hand made tortillas. Definitely a plus for me. 

You can't really argue with that, but just incase you can. Go try the food on your own. I normally get the same thing every time (a combo chimichanga) and i never walk away dissappointed...unless i was super hungry. 

This place will most likely satisfy the regular eater, but you super eaters/college kids, sumo's in training, or have eaten a buffet out of business in one night...this probably wont satisfy you."}
{"text":"TORTILLAS.

You order anything that comes in one of their delicious flour tortillas here and you can't go wrong.

My absolute favorite is their egg and potato breakfast burrito. Eat it with their delicious spicy hot sauce and you can't go wrong. Oh how I wish they were open Sundays. It would be the PERFECT hangover breakfast.

I have had their bean burrito which is okay. I'm not crazy about their beans. I have also had their cheese enchiladas which are not that great.

My husband says their machaca beef is pretty good and their green chili pork.

One of my favorite things to do for dinner for the fam is to order a dozen tortillas, and containers of their beans, rice, and green chili pork to-go, grill or saute some veggies, set out cheese and sour cream and let everyone go crazy. Easy, cheap, and tasty dinner.

I can honestly say that sometimes I just crave their butter tortilla. Yep. Just a warm, soft tortilla smothered in butter and folded up. Excellent snack."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food hands down.  Oxaca Special, double wrapped is where it's at.  Order that and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Very good food. Great deal for the money. The hot sauce and guacamole very good. Had the chimichanga, it was wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been going to Carolina's for years. I have to say, the quality has gone downhill. The salsa is watered down, the flavor of the food is lack luster and the portion sizes have diminished, as the prices have gone up. It used to be fantastic, but not anymore. If people offer to buy me food from Carolina's, I decline. I go across the street instead. I'm sorry Carolina's, but you have lost a customer. In the PHX fast Mexican food market, there are many better choices, even within walking distance."}
{"text":"I was in town and wanted a good machacha for breakfast. Looked this place up here on Yelp and this place had good reviews. As a result I wanted to try this place out. Ordered a machacha with eggs & potatoes and I ordered the chips. The machacha was very bland and did not have much flavor. I had to sprinkle a lot of salt on it for it to have taste. I was not happy with my food but I be willing to try this place again. Maybe that day nothing tasted good and other days it could be better. But I, unfortunately, came on the bad day. The chips and tortilla was good but not enough for me to give more than 2 stars. Try this place if your close by and maybe you could come on the good day when the machacha is good!"}
{"text":"Wow - really awful. Took fifteen minutes to get three tacos. And they were not worth the wait. 

I spent four months in Mexico, and it is an insult to that country to call this comida mexicana."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of the Phoenix Carolinas because we've ordered there for lunch at work. We were thrilled to learn that they opened a Mesa location.

We came here on a Saturday afternoon at just before 4 and it was shockingly busy. We waited in line for about 10 minutes and a table for four didn't open up until right before we ordered. We ordered a number 7 (soft tacos) with one machaca and one chicken, a carne asada burrito with beans, and two bean and cheese burritos. The orders went off without a hitch. Definitely had no complaints at all about the service. We sat down and waited.

The dining room itself kind of sucked. In fact, I was going to knock off a star for it, but the food is too good to do that. For starters, their air vents produce extremely cold, turbulent air. Now, this sounds like it would be awesome when it's 110 out, but it was so windy that napkins were flying and burrito wrappers weren't staying under burritos. It was annoying. It was also really cold. Not only that, but it's SUPER loud in there. Eff that noise. Literally. I will only come back for take out in the future. Anyway, we waited about 20 minutes for the food to come out.

The food came out and it was uh-maze-ing. So, so good. The taco meats were insanely flavorful and juicy. The tortilla was delicious. The only complaint I have is that my tacos broke. Next time I will order them double wrapped. The beans are so flavorful and phenomenal here. The rice is also super good. My son ate all of his (large) burrito and then moved on to my rice. My daughter said she wishes she had ordered more. My husband said he carne asada was excellent and that there was not one bite of fat or gristle in the entire burrito. OH! And their red sauce is delicious. It has a kick to it, but it also has an incredible depth of flavor. Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Fresh tortillas!!

You haven't had a real burrito unless you have one here, made with a tortilla that's just a few minutes old. 

And they have Horchata and Menudo

Enough said. And it's super inexpensive.  

The chocolate mini chimichangas are a great dessert, too"}
{"text":"A classic. I've been to this Carolina's location a few times now and each time is better than the last. I would recommend the 3-way burrito- green chili, bean, and red chili in 3 sections. It's delicious. Honestly, you can't go wrong with your order- everything is made fresh daily. It's counter service and basic chairs/tables so don't expect anything fancy. Sip on some horchata if that's your thing, they have several flavors. Prices are reasonable, I think I paid $8 for the 3-way burrito, a chicken taco and a medium soda. Not bad, and a lot of food. Head over early to beat the lunch rush Mon-Fri."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch today to give it one last try.  

We always get bean tostadas as they are our favorites, but the last 3 times we have been here there have been almost no beans on the tostada.  

Today while I was waiting for the order to be done, I was watching the guy make the bean tostada... he put a nice portion on the tostada, then he proceeded to scrape all the beans off back into the tray!  Are you kidding?  I watched this happen over 10 times for each bean tostada!   So instead of actually having beans on the tostada, it is just maybe a millimeter of bean juice and the rest has been recycled on to the next meal!

Beans are cheap!  If I had a choice, I would pay more to have a tostada that actually had beans on it!

My kids butter tortilla had more beans, which is sad as there is only butter on that item."}
{"text":"I call BS on these rave reviews.  They sound really scripted and phony.  Carolina's is just your usual dumpy Filiberto's-ish place and you simply either like it or you don't.  The same way you might feel about one of those other polarizing institutions, Chico's Tacos in El Paso.  Even the people who like Chico's Tacos will admit it really isn't that good.  But if you claim this is \"the best Mexican food anywhere\" or \"so so good\" (right out of a commercial script) or \"fantastic Mexican food\", your credibility takes a nose dive.  This has the appearance of \"stuffing the ballot box\", and something's fishy here.  Even within the bounds of dumpy Mexican food joints, this place doesn't even meet mediocre standards.

The food in detail:

Combo plate with tostada, taco and enchilada on my first visit:  taco... passable.  Which incredibly made it the star of the combo plate.  The enchilada was a formless mass of tortilla resembling something you scooped out of a casserole with some institutional enchilada sauce over it and no detectable filling.  Total amateur hour.  The tostada was like something spawned from an Ortega or Old El Paso kit and probably would have bored Midwestern Mexican food neophytes from Iowa.  A school cafeteria could have matched the quality. I can't even remember the rice and beans, I was so stunned how bad the main items were.  The cherry on the sundae was how severely pissed my wife was at me that I suggested we try this place.  Can't say I blame her, really.  It doesn't take a gastronome to see that this place serves up some really nasty food.

The green chile burro I had during my ill-advised second try here was a bigger disaster than the first experience.  It felt like I was holding a water balloon.  That's because it was filled with a gray, soupy, gravy-like, watery substance that had chunks of, well... nothing... in it.  It was like a folded tortilla soup bowl that gushed all over the place when I took a bite.  And it tasted like it looked.  Hands down the worst burro of any type I've ever had anywhere.  Honestly, I've had way better burritos from Taco Bell, of all places.  Needless to say I didn't finish it and it went into the garbage with extreme prejudice.  

I sure would appreciate a few more honest reviews here instead of people shilling for this dump.  Don't believe a word of anything positive you read here.  I've never hated any eating establishment like I hate Carolina's.  Not even MacDonald's.  At least people aren't heaping undeserved praise on MacDonald's.  This place doesn't deserve another thin dime from me."}
{"text":"I'm putting this right on the table:  I don't find anything appealing about mexican food, I don't like the way it looks, smells or tastes.  I don't like tacos, burritos, shredded meat, sour cream (unless it's on pancakes or waffles), salsa, or avacados.  (I went to Arriba's one time and had a garden salad.)

EVERYONE where I work swears by this place so I went there once, and only once.  A long time ago I read an article that said the quality of the food at a restaurant is comparable to the cleanliness and condition of the restrooms.  If this is true, and it seems like there's a logical correlation there, the food must be downright awful.  The bathroom floor was filthy, there was no lock on the door of the stall I was in.  No toilet paper in the stall.   No hot water coming out of the faucet, only cold. I vaguely remember the bathroom door not closing properly.   I'll never go here again and certainly never eat anything from this place.  How this place passes inspection is beyond me."}
{"text":"This place is a can't miss. Always really good food. The location is pretty cramped so I'd recommend you take out. Great food and a must visit if you're in the Cave Creek area."}
{"text":"Only because I had to. Food wasn't fresh not good st all. Won't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. We liked the location in downtown Phoenix and so we had to try this closer location. Very nice building and food was great. The staff was still in training so the wait time was pretty long, but that is understandable. My husband loves the butter tortilla and bean and cheese burrito. I really like their rice and beans!"}
{"text":"Five years ago we stopped in to the original Carolina's and loved it. As we planned our recent trip back to Phoenix, I insisted we stop in again.  Once again, we loved the food and the prices. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"1450 S Country Club Dr
Mesa, AZ 85210

For those of us that have lived in the valley for a long time, Carolina's in the South Phoenix area was the Mecca for Tortillas. Huge, soft, hand stretched and made with real lard, they had a flavor that couldn't be beat. Time has taken it's toll on the original Carolina's and it is a bit run down, with occasional bullet holes in the outside of the building.

Welcome a new Carolina's on the East Side. Located almost at the intersection of Country Club and U.S. 60 is a beautiful, shiny rebuilt building with lots of parking and plenty of tables to sit at. The same menu items are available and have the same wonderful home made taste.

Companion and I arrived for lunch, and the place was packed. However, we were still able to find tables to sit at. Companion ordered a Carne Asada burrito and was not disappointed. Companion did point out that it would have been nice to have had guacamole on it, and I pointed out that it was available and just had to be asked for.

I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga with 2 toppings. I must confess that this was the best one that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was totally filled with pulled chicken, wrapped in one of their fabulous tortillas, deep fried, then covered in sour cream and guacamole. There is a salsa bar that only has one type of salsa, but it had great flavor.

Drinks are sold either as regular or large. You take your cup to the beverage counter and fill your cup with whatever you wish to drink. Refills are free. 

I must mention the wonderful flour tortillas that they make. Each one is hand stretched, enormous,  and made the original way with a little lard in it which gives it the flavor that so many tortillas are missing. Warmed up, they make a fabulous munch in front of the idiot tube at home. We ordered a dozen to take with us. 

Service is fast. We had our food in spite of the noon rush in less than 10 minutes. 

Dings - only one - I wish they had some limes available to put on your food. They do have lemons, but in Mexico you will never find a lemon - only limes.

The place was beautifully clean, and there is an outdoor large patio where you can enjoy your food when the weather moderates. Much as I hate to say it because it will bring even more people, I highly recommend Carolina's for some wonderful food. 

5 stars"}
{"text":"Carolinas has the best Machaca burro in Phoenix. The new location is clean and spacious. The line was out the door!!!"}
{"text":"Carolina's is a classic local Mexican food spot in Phoenix, if you don't like it you probably suck!  It's not the atmosphere that makes this place great, although it is not terrible (actually pretty nice if you compare it to any other fast food joint).  It is not the service that makes this place awesome, although I never have waited more than a few minutes for my food.  I actually recommend calling in your order over the phone so you don't wait in line since the place is so popular many times you wait longer in line (think Chipotle at lunch time).  IT'S THE FOOD THAT MAKE'S THIS PLACE THE BEST!  The tortillas are homemade and I usually get a dozen to go.  The salsa is so flavorful, the re-fried beans are taste, the breakfast burritos are perfect, and I have gotten the rolled tacos, enchiladas, bean burrito, red chili burrito, taco, tostada, & tamale and never once was it ever less than great!  This place is as good as it gets and the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Beat tortilla in Phoenix!   Awesome service!   Best food especially salsa!!"}
{"text":"The Machaca was as great as helpers advertised!! I highly recommend this very authentic restaurant!"}
{"text":"I used to drive down to the Carolina's on Mojave near the airport just to get my fix. Thankfully, God heard my pleas for an east side Carolina's. We eat here at least twice a week and are barely making a dent in all their lovely dishes. Their beef machaca is out of this world--burros, chimis, you name it. Their beans are slow cooked like your Abuala would have made them. Mine was from Ireland so, sadly, no frijoles! Their #15 combo has 3 amazing, thin, crispy flautas covered in lettuce, guacamole and sour cream set off by red chopped tomatoes accompanied by beans &/ rice--heavenly!    They have eat in  or take out, but either way, just go ahead and bring home some of their stupendous and huge fresh made flour tortillas. I dare you to make it home without eating at least one of those warm beauties!!!"}
{"text":"All the wonderful food as the other locations with faster service and a clean smart decor. Couldn't be happier than having Carolina's less than a mile from my house. 

The #5 with Machaca Beef is the best in the valley."}
{"text":"Great food, great price. The wait is a little long but there are typically a lot of people eating in or picking food to go.

We went on Monday night and ordered the following for 2 adults and a baby
1 Cheese Enchilada
1 Oaxaca Burrito (chorizo/potato/bean) 
1 Red Chile w/ Bean Burrito
1 Flauta
2 Drinks 

All together, our bill was $18. 

Not only is it a good price but the food is delicious. Carolina's has hands down the best tortillas in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great green chili, tacos, tamales and especially the tortillas. Just need better salsa!"}
{"text":"I hate to admit that I am addicted to the #10 Chicken Enchiladas.  In addition to the red sauce they use, I also douse them with the red salsa in the big dispensers they provide.  If you like Enchiladas, you simply must try these!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I wish it was closer. The Machaca is always amazing. The salsa is like no other. Prices are good, too."}
{"text":"Started coming here 25 years ago with my grandparents. It's still my go to today for authentic Mexican food. When I lived in NY for 5 years, one of my first stops every visit was here. Or my grandma would pick up a huge order from here and we'd go at it around the family table at her house. We don't go for the ambience, but the food is fantastic. They keep it simple, and the staff is always very nice. Love their beef hard tacos, the cheese enchiladas, and there is nothing like their chips and hot sauce. Get a dozen flour tortillas to take home, they'll be gone in no time. And the price is perfect! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Haiku to the Oaxaca Special Burro:

Oh how I crave thee
Chorizo, potato, beans
Breakfast perfection.

:)

LOVE Carolina's. Authentic Mexican food, reasonable prices and tortillas that are big enough to sleep under while you have steamy dreams about them. Buy extra to take home and have one for breakfast with butter and jelly!"}
{"text":"As you can obviously see by all the GREAT reviews, Carolina's is the TOP for quick Mexican Food. 
Every time I go there the place is packed WALL TO WALL with people! yet you STILL get in-and-out in about 5-10 mins TOPS! 
I'm the type who LOVES the occasional Filiberto's, but ever since I've gone to Carolina's I haven't stepped FOOT inside another mexican \"fast food\" restaurant again! 
Try it and you WILL love it!"}
{"text":"Count us in for a #5 Combo, a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!

Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!

Always busy at lunch, but they get through the orders in a timely manner.  Seating can be tricky, so have one order and another stalk tables! :)

You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI."}
{"text":"I'm glad that this shopping center is getting some new businesses, including Carolina's! Opening up in the spot where Ocean Buffet used to be, the parking lot was chaotic around lunchtime but there were plenty of spots at least. When I entered the line was already stretching around the corner of the restaurant but it moved fast with the two cashiers at the front. Browsing through the menu they offer mainly meat based items, in chicken, chorizo or beef form. I decided to keep it simple and get a machaca burro to go.

They will give you a number and call it out when it is ready. I looked at my receipt and saw that 30 other numbers were before my order! How's that for popularity. They all came out swiftly and I wasn't waiting too long. Before I left I got a small container of salsa from the side bar. By early lunchtime it seemed like at least half the large pump style salsa containers were already empty. 

I got home and dug into my burro with gusto! The meat was well seasoned, tender and juicy. The tortilla was soft and fresh and held up to the juicy meat well. The salsa was perfect with the burro and had a medium heat level. The total was less than $5. Not bad!

The easy access to this spot from the 60 is a good draw as well, and I anticipate trying more from their menu in the future!"}
{"text":"I ordered about $190 in party platters for a dinner party on 12/3, picked up at Peoria location. I gave our credit card over the phone, as is required for catering orders. I used a credit card that we haven't used in over 60 days. Today we received a call from our bank that there have been 63 charges made on the card from all over the country, as well as outside the country.  These fraudulent charges occurred after using it at your establishment (again our only charge in over 60 days). It is apparent that someone working at Carolina's is selling charge card numbers.  I'm highly disappointed and will not be patronizing your restaurant again. I would warn anyone paying with a credit/debit card at Carolina's."}
{"text":"My hubby and I visited Carolina's for the 1st time last week. Our order was wrong. Today we  returned to give them a 2nd chance...in less than a week. Both visits were for take-out orders. Our first take-out order was missing the guac and sour cream that I paid for with my chimichanga. When we returned today I told the gal at the counter and she apologized and said that when it's busy sometimes they forget to include side items. Then she immediately gave me a free side of sour cream and guac to go with my meal. When we got home with our second take-out order my hubby's order was completely wrong! He asked for a beef taco combo plate - he only eats corn tortillas because he is has a gluten intolerance and does not eat flour tortillas. What he got was a cheese enchilada (flour tortilla) and tamale! GEEZ. He could NOT eat the enchilada because of his gluten intolerance and missed out on the tacos he was looking forward to eating. If the staff is aware that they make mistakes when it's busy, why don't they take the time to double check orders before giving them to the customers. I'm sure we are not the only customers to receive the wrong order. Yes, the food is decent, but if I can't get what I order it's not worth going back."}
{"text":"About time they came to the east valley! Same yummy food-- in a safer hood & cleaner surroundings! This is a must visit!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and exactly what good Mexican food is. Only downside? You have to pay for the chips!"}
{"text":"There is really only one Phoenix area restaurant when it comes to the best tortillas in town. And now that they have a Mesa location, we can get to it in the east valley. 

They have lots of standard dishes. The salsa is spicy compared to many places that are standard Mexican food around here but nothing overly so. 

The thing to do when you go here is to buy and enjoy a straight up buttered tortilla. Really. This is why you come here. The red chili burro is decent too. I personally do not find the rest of the menu to be outstanding, but their marquee claim is about tortillas- and at that they are well-deserving of the title of \"best tortillas in town\".

Good low prices. This location is nice and clean with well cooled eating area."}
{"text":"I have never been to Carolina's because I always thought it might be a mass production machaca beef fest...and I was right.  Never been a fan of overly braised beef stuffed, fried, or folded into a tortilla.

But, I must say it's pretty good... Fresh tortillas are a big plus...salsa isn't too bad...beef tastes fresh...enchilada sauce is pretty good...rice and beans were great...chips are fresh, saw them frying them up out back...really pretty good food, helps that the price is right!!

Come around 11am or after 1pm, lunch is packed, seating is limited, or just take it to go....they always package it that way anyways...."}
{"text":"The food is some of my favorite in Arizona. It's my go-to place, because most everything is delicious (the one thing I'm disappointed with is the guacamole, which is really bland...I can make it better myself, and that's definitely not the case of anything else on the menu) and it's really reasonably priced. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because sometimes the service is really slow, to the point that my food has been cold when I have picked it up after calling in an order. I get that they are busy, and I wouldn't mind waiting, but when my food is sitting there ready and I'm standing there wanting to pay but not being helped, it can be frustrating."}
{"text":"How much Carolina's is too much?

I already know the answer. There's no such thing as too much Carolina's. I just wanted you to get it wrong so I could fight you.

-1 star because the tortillas are always a little burnt."}
{"text":"We had some reservations based on the prior Yelp reviews but I must say that our experience was top notch. First and foremost, the young man at the register was delightful! Friendly and efficient service is always a great way to start. The food was fantastic! Oh so good - which is exactly what we expected having spent our younger years frequenting the original Carolina's in Phoenix. There are a couple of opportunities for improvement. 1. There were a couple of tables that sat dirty for the entire time we were there (we dined in) and 2. The self serve salsa station needed cleaning. No one appeared to be cleaning the dining area and that could become a problem."}
{"text":"I do enjoy going to Carolina's when I'm in the area. It is definitely a step above the fili-b's. I like some of the burritos they have such as the chicken burro. The tacos are good too. 

If you want a good but not expensive mexican takeout  place this is for you. I will go back and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"i had ordered the mini burrito platter and taco platter for my sons birthday party the food was amazing for the price it finished very fast the staff was very nice i will definitely order catering from this location again"}
{"text":"This was my first time here...wow...great great food, love the mix and match...the staff was great, very nice people, we had placed the order, they forgot the tamales...went to the counter, they immediately fixed our order, will definitely come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  My first time here as I'm never on this side of town, but came here based icon a recommendation.  

Place isn't much to look it bi only ordered the taco combination plate, but what I lived about it.  Is this is simple Mexican food done right.  Not greasy.  Not covered is stupid enchilada sauce or some other over salty mess.   Rice and beans were prefect.  Great flavor and not over salted.   I had hard shell beef tacos and the shells were homemade not some Ortega store brought crap.   

Wish this was over in Chandler as I would love to try something else on the menu.  

For anyone who is going through reviews and isn't sure. This place is worth a quick stop."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken soft taco. $1.85. Amazing tortilla. Nice free salsa, super fresh and decently spicy.

The green chile chicken burro is also amazing.  Added onions.  Super tender chicken and flavorful chile.

FYI, this place is closed Sundays."}
{"text":"If you want REAL Carolina's, you need to go to the location On Mojave and 12th st.

YES, its ghetto, BUT its the original, its a hole in the wall...and its the best!!!

I have been there more times than I can count,in the three years I have lived in the valley.
I have never once been unhappy with the food.

And my Harley has never been stolen, and my Challenger still has all its wheels :)"}
{"text":"We were vacationing here and were told this was the best and most authentic Mexican restaurant to go to. Well, it is more cafeteria style. The chips and the hot sauce were the best part of the meal. The food we ordered - enchiladas, tacos, tostadas - were just average. I thought we were going into a sit down restaurant when told about it, so maybe that was part of my disappointment. Will not return because I know there are other better restaurants in the area for this type of food. But I would stop in to get the chips and hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a craving for a good taco. I'm sitting here, still craving a good taco. The only thing that could help this would be some cheese and tomatoes, but the food light on cheese and no tomatoes. Very bland, like cafeteria food. That said, service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Rand H., this Carolina's is far superior to the one at 12th St. & Mojave.  It's well kept inside and most times that I have visited this location it is pretty clean. I have been there times when there are dirty tables, but when the line of people ordering never stops you have to go easy on them. 

Either  way the food is worth the wait. The machaca tacos are my favorite along with the standard bean and cheese burritos. I love that you can load up on as much salsa as you want.  The breakfast burritos are great (try the four way: egg, potato, bean, cheese). 

It is cheap and fast (even with said lines) and the tortillas rock. I always buy a dozen to take home and them heat them in a skillet before serving. YUM!"}
{"text":"I had forgotten about this place until recently.  I am obsessed once again.  I love their prices first and foremost.  The quality is nearly as good as a sit down restaurant and is at least 1/3 cheaper.  I love their tacos, beans and tortillas.  The service is pretty quick even when they are busy.  I love that they have an Orange Julius type drink right out of the fountain.  They are just shy of the 5 star mark because I am not a fan of their enchilada sauce  I have tried hard to like it but I just can't.  Some strange flavor to me.  Maybe you will like it.  I also wish they had salsa with chunks of tomatoes, peppers and onions in it.  They have a salsa bar but it is more of a liquid and is dispensed out of a pump.  Not a deal breaker but just something I'd like to see.

This place is great for a quick meal.  Plenty of seating and definitely authentic.  I love this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"WOW! The machaca breakfast burrito was muy delicioso! Carolina's was so good, I had to return for lunch the same day!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but super busy. Make sure you have time because everyone loves this place and they probably got there before you did."}
{"text":"There's definitely different styles of Mexican food and plenty places to in AZ to choose from, but if you google or yahoo search \"what is sonoran style mexican food\" a picture of Carolinas pops up......Seriously, I screenshot it for proof. 
Carolina's is the best! I'm so glad they opened their first East Valley restaurant this year."}
{"text":"I love Carolina's. I got a bean and cheese burrito, a dozen tortillas, a carne asada burrito, chips, and salsa, and a large pina colada drink."}
{"text":"I think the four star rating is based on the fact that it's fast food, but I don't think it's even good for fast food. It was $40 for my family of five to eat out (same as what we'd spend at Chipotle), and I would've preferred Taco Bell, chipotle, Qdoba's or Rubio's over this place. Service was terrible. It was crowded. It smelled."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The customer service HORRENDOUS. Called ahead and placed a to go order which was very clearly ready and getting cold while I waited for one of the 4 employees running the front to check out myself and 2 other ppl waiting in line to also collect their to go orders. Finally one of the other ladies lost patience and asked who was helping to go orders and to our surprise it was the manager who said \"he is\" as he pointed to another employee and began helping a new customer waiting to place an order. The person who was supposed to help w Togo orders kept bagging other food while we waited and let our food get cold. When I asked to speak to a manager is when I realized that the man who just told us someone else would help us was the one who was running the show.. well no wonder the service was so awful, look at the example being set!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is not a one-off review.  I have been going to this place for years and it was very good. (Not the best, but good). 
This morning my wife and I took a trip over for my fav menu item. Machaca breakfast burrito with potato.  I've had this many times in the past but OMG!  I could not even finish it.  It tasted like old used fryer grease and did not even have an egg in it.  How do you call it breakfast without an egg?   Just mushy mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of hamburger in it.  (Yes burger. Not even real roast beef)  Worse yet the portion size had reduced to 1/3its normal size (barely 3 bites of filling) and was still wrapped in the usual giant tortilla.  Anyone that has been here before knows how good those are.  Er... Used to be.  The tortilla had the same used grease taste as the rest.  My wife had the chicken taco and even it had suffered major changes and used grease taste.  (How do you mess up a taco?)
 I am so sad and will be reluctant to return anytime soon 
Beware, this place may be on the way out."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I felt it was overhyped by other reviews I have heard. But the price is right and the portions are good sized. I was a bit disappointed by the red chili con carne burrito. It was more chili and less con carne but for 3 bucks for a burrito I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Carolina's tortillas bring me back to the old neighborhood, walking down the street with a hand made, paper towel-wrapped tortilla, butter running happily down the forearm.  Siblings hovering around begging for a bite, but oh no, that was not  to be.  Good Times.  I do think Carolina's tortillas can be accurately labeled \"authentic\".

Yes, yes, everything else is good too.  But when I've got the really good tortillas that are so hard to find, it's difficult for me to put much more thought than that into the rest of the meal.  

Can Carolina's get horrendously crowded?  Can they get behind on cleaning up the dining area?  Yes, they can.  Do I care?  Nope."}
{"text":"Spectacular food!!!!!  Great prices!!!!!!  This place is tops.  Love getting food from here, have to be careful that I limit myself or I would seriously over-eat here.  The buttered tortillas are absolutely fan-freaking-tastic!!  Great tacos,  The service is super fast, but they are super busy all the time so be sure to check your order before you leave as they sometimes make mistakes.  If they do simply call back and talk with them they will even put a credit under your name for next time if you cannot drive back that day."}
{"text":"The short version:  probably the best Mexican food we've had in our lives (and that includes 58 years living in California and Arizona). So, why \"only\" four stars?  Just can't bring myself to giving five to a restaurant that serves food in foam clamshells and where you order at a counter and pick up your food when your number is called. Oh, did I mention that (as a result of that and plastic silverware), it is also perhaps the best quality food value anywhere."}
{"text":"Decent for fast food Mexican.  I had a hard taco which was good but not at all warm.  I also had a cheese enchilada which I didnt much care for because it wasn't warm at all so not melty and delicious.   I will definitely have tacos again for quick takeout.   My husband and those two items as well and also a tostada.   His comments were..\"pffffff\" he was disappointed because of all the good reviews and Check Please Arizona.   Easy cheap fast lunch but there are better choices at same price point."}
{"text":"If heaven were a Mexican restaurant, Carolina's would be that paradise. Seriously though daaaaaayum is this place tasty. I struggled to find truly delish Mexican food in Phoenix after moving here from Tucson, and after many disappointing visits to local restaurants after people raved about them, I was so glad that the recommendation for Carolina's paid off.

Their tortillas are the bomb. Soft and chewy and flavorful are only a few words to describe them (BOSS is another). Their salsa is amazing and they sell it by the pint and quart (praise da lord of Mexico). I also wanted to give a shout out to their beans. I usually forego beans at Mexican restaurants bc they are just mediocre BUT at Carolina's, these beans give me life. Like seriously, you guys, these beans are the shit. Well. Uh. I mean. Okay yeah whatever let's go with it. Anywho, their rice is also tasty. 

They have a large variety of options for combination plates, as well as individual items you can get with either machaca beef (shredded and amazing), diced beef, carne asada, or chicken. You can also get some things without meat. My personal fave is the machaca beef chimichanga. Unlike some of the restaurants up here, Carolina's does it right by NOT piling on enchilada sauce on top which defeats the whole frying purpose. Their hard tacos are also tasty. I've literally never had a bad meal at Carolina's. The only thing I wish is that they were open on Sundays. 

Carolina's FO LYFE. *drops mic*"}
{"text":"I don't know what I was thinking this place was when I heard about it from co-workers, but I had more of an idea that it was a sit-down and order off a menu kind of restaurant. Boy was I surprised when I arrived here!! 

Ordering is rather quick and no-nonsense about it. The menu is easy to read and find what I wanted. However, the guy at the register seemed really preoccupied while I was trying to order as he kept on looking another direction and I had to repeat myself several times what I wanted. Good thing I only wanted a bean and cheese chimichanga. 

Most of the tables were taken up and the ones that were available were dirty and hadn't been wiped down yet. People, I guess think that this is a restaurant where some waitress will come around and pick up dirty dishes?!? I wanted to eat in, but decided to take it to go since the place was super busy on a Saturday evening. 

Service was pretty slow and even though they give you a number, they don't get orders out in the order that your number is. Also, they just call out your name when your order is ready. 

The food I ordered was delicious! I would get it again. That is the only reason why I gave this place a 4 star instead of a 3 star that it really actually deserves."}
{"text":"Good food like the in Central Phx just the service is a little rude at times but it's still good"}
{"text":"This placed was packed.  My husband and I went in last Saturday around 6:00 - lucky to find a table.  I ordered the combo cheese enchiladas, he had the beef, we both tried an asada taco.  I've had the food from downtown and it was pretty good.  This was mediocre.  The sauce was zingy in a good way, but not flavorful like the one downtown.  Also, our tacos were stone cold.  Very little meat and grizzly with it.  My enchiladas were lukewarm.  The food looked to be coming out fast as they were calling #s left and right and we only waited about 10 minutes.  I was very disappointed in the taste - not my cup of tea - I'll stick to Jalisco's."}
{"text":"The rental car guy at the hotel I was staying at raved about this place (while establishing it was fairly casual, busy, and inexpensive). He was right on, and the food was INSANELY GOOD!

The tacos were supurb, the chips outstanding, the beans so creamy. Yum, yum and yum.

If I lived down there, I'd eat here once a week. And be fat :-)"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and tasty.  The potato and egg burrito is awesome for breakfast. It's light and fresh not greasy and rubbery.   Had a few other items here before, the tamale was good but messy and not put together very well. The tortillas are very good, but I hear they're \"authentic\" and made with butter/lard or something like that.

Good breakfast or lunch spot. The inside is pretty big and cafeteria style looking."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Horrible tamales, beef taco and passable enchiladas and burritos. Average beans and rice. I don't get why this place is so popular..."}
{"text":"Nothing obvious on the outside distinguishes this place from any one of dozens of Mexican joints around--but you can see one clue to its quality if you look.  This place is right next door to a Denny's, and if you pass by frequently, you will notice many times when the Carolina's parking lot is full while the one for the Denny's is nearly empty.

When you go inside, the restaurant is loaded with all different kinds of people from the community from single folks to families, here to try some of the tasty food.

It's not what you see that counts here though, it's the taste, and Carolina's has one that is distinctive.  Can't describe it--it's just Carolina's. The tacos are not greasy at all, and are perfectly crisp.  My favorite are the cheese enchiladas, which have a uniquely-flavored red sauce.

This place is one of my favorite for Mexifood.  Whenever I'm in the area (which is all too infrequent these days), I look for an excuse to go there.

By the way--chips and salsa.  You do have to buy them separately, but DO IT here.  For me to recommend chips and salsa that you have to actually buy, over ones that are complimentary, that says A LOT."}
{"text":"Mexican food done well and salsa that is good enough to drink straight.  Mexican food is pretty basic, let's be honest, but you can mess it up and you can make it great.  Carolina's makes very good food, but the draw to this restaurant is the incredible salsa.  Heat, but not too much and flavor for days.  Let's face it, a taco is tostada is a taco.  Not too much you can do with it, except put great salsa on it. My favorite item is the machaca, egg, bean and cheese burro.  They also have one of the all time great basic combo's with a taco, tostada, enchilada, rice and beans.  Come hungry for that one."}
{"text":"Severs and cooking staff were rude food was cold! Don't waste your money. Severs yelling at kitchen team in front of customers very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Nothing says delish more than pipin hot tortillas right when you pick them up, soooo good that by the time you get home your dozen turns into only 8 tortillas because you snacked on the way home ! Lol today I ordered a green and red tamale ! They were delish as usual , enough meat to fill the tamale and not to much masa! I love the fact that this place is always so busy I used to go to the original but it was too far. This location is always clean and someone is always out and about picking up to keep it clean. Seriously almost every table in this place was full today! I'll be back next month for another dozen tortillas, or maybe sooner....."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food on this side of town. I've never ordered anything that wasn't good here. We always get the chicken tacos, red tamales, tostadas, burros, chimichangas, and rice. It's all good. You can't go wrong here. 

Even though this place more like a fast food place I love the food here. Sometimes it takes awhile to get your food so I would recommend that you call in. It's so much faster but it's always worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's inhumane that you don't have ac for your employees and customers. This is phoenix. Get it together."}
{"text":"I love their food but is it really worth the wait and inattentive employees? I understand they are busy but when you look though the window and see your order along with a handful of others ready and just sitting there for over 10 minutes and no one bothers to grab those and call out order numbers...sheesh..."}
{"text":"Almost as ghetto as the original, Carolina's (North [as we call it]) offers amazing and cheap Mexican food-the greasy, cheesy kind-and their tortillas are the best in town. Their signature (red) hot sauce is great, but not many people know you can get tasty green hot sauce or tastier pico for a small fee."}
{"text":"Everything is as delicious as expected at the new location in the 'burbs. No more needing to take a day trip to experience the amazing food."}
{"text":"I would actually rate this place 3.5 but yelp doesn't give that option. 

I have been on the hunt for decent Mexican food since we moved to the area in June. 

There were definitely pros and cons to Carolina's. 

The place is big and was busy (order took 20+ minutes to come out after I went to the counter and asked the status of the order). The ordering line moved quickly and the girl who took my order was friendly and answered my questions. 

I ordered a chicken taco and a single tortilla (since that is what they are famous for). My daughters had the kids b&c burrito and the kids beef tacos. I also ordered the chips and salsa. They do have salsa on a bar area but it is dispensed in ketchup pump things. Which made the consistency more watery than the salsa that came with the chips and salsa. The salsa that came with the chips was much better even though it was probably the same recipe. I got a water to drink and it tasted like fish tank water. It was disgusting! I've worked in restaurants before and I would guess they never clean the soda taps. 

The taco was ok, the rice was bland and unimpressive and the tortilla was good but not the best I've ever had. However their beans were amazing!! I would go back and take my husband to try a bean and cheese burrito but am still on the look out for a Mexican restaurant that has it all. Coming from CA you get a bit spoiled!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food as always. I'm a fan and was so excited when they moved to the east valley. Sometimes there is a wait and sometimes your order might take a few minutes but so worth the wait. Gotta try the apple chimis q the sauce on the side. Delish. Why do you think they are busy?"}
{"text":"We spent Easter in Arizona for the first time and all the natives suggested we try the burros at Carolinas.  The woman at the front was super friendly with the tourists from SF with the questions.  The place was clean and packed (Tuesday at 1pm) but it was  fast service.  We ordered three burros (3 way, green and red I think), two soft and two hard tacos (chicken). The burros were SUPER GOOD and my kids loved the tacos.  We ordered a dozen tortillas to take home - we were not disappointed! The prices were so reasonable...I wish Carolina's opened up in San Francisco....I miss it already..."}
{"text":"Huge Carolinas fan! This one is cleaner and just as amazing as the others! Glad it's finally on my side of town. 

Was there the first night and quality was the same. 

One small request and I'm sure it's because it was opening night but, can you keep the chunks of pork as small as the other locations? Mine were a bit large in my green chili burro. Everything else was on point. Look forward to coming back and spending lots of $$$ here years to come!"}
{"text":"Obvious ownership change.  The place used to be PACKED and the line out the door by 9am.  The place was very empty and zero line. We have not been there in a while so we did not know.  Food not as flavorful as it used to be.  Completely new staff.  Not sure if we will be going back."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid. Food is always great and consistent. Machaca is great, but make sure to get it double wrapped."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Carolina's is clearly the top of the quick-service Mexican food pyramid. I love that their tortillas are made onsite, and the rice and beans have amazing flavor. I enjoyed a machaca taco and cheese enchilada for my first visit to this location. I'm excited to try more items on their menu. I'm a huge salsa fan, so I liked being able to get as many cups of salsa as I want at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I've been to the original Carolinas in Phoenix, that is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. I was excited to see they opened one here in Mesa. The interior a lot nicer comparing phx. The inside was open, has a cafeteria feel, tables without booths. I ordered the #2 with cheese enchilada and green corn tamale. There are so many mexican restaurants in Arizona. I like to judge my mexican restaurants on the rice, if you can't get rice right then what are you doing? The rice was okay...not very flavorful, not dry and not too fluffy. Didn't have that, \"this is yummy rice\" taste. The beans are alright. Corn tamale was good, the enchilada was good too, I do really like the red enchilada sauce on it. It was pretty good, not the worst I've had but not the best I've had either. I have a couple other favorites I'd rather go to. Maybe I'll come and try another item off the menu, but first impression...it was alright."}
{"text":"wonderful tortillas, machaca burrito, everything is great.  The staff wears gloves and 
they are wonderful, enjoy."}
{"text":"Carolina's has awesome food. Love the machaca beef and really good flour tortillas. We also ordered from them to cater a party and delivery was on time and all the food was excellent."}
{"text":"First time ordering food here, I usually just pick up their amazing tortillas. Took 30 minutes to get a kids quesadilla, kids chimis, a burrito and flautas. They weren't busy at all and multiple parties ordered after us but got their food and finished eating before we even got out food. When we inquired about or food, we were told that they were waiting on the flautas and chimis to fry. Flautas came out cold, had clearly been sitting for 15+ minutes. Employees on their cellphones didn't seem the least bit concerned with finding our food. So disappointed as I love the downtown location and was excited to have one closer. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were given a recommendation from our neighbor to come here. The cashier at the front was really helpful when I told her we had never been there before. She was able to explain some things and give us her recommendations. We thought that the beef was better than the chicken, the salsa was spicy and yummy, and the chocolate chimis were delicious. It's a semi-sweet chocolate, probably just chocolate chips, but chocolate deep fried in a tortilla is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to coming back here after our last time in Arizona.  I'm afraid I would have rather gone to any of the other ***o's in town.  The tacos were ok, not the best shredded beef tacos that the area has to offer.  The star of the menu would be the cheese enchiladas.  Their enchilada sauce is especially complex and tasty.  I wasn't so thrilled about the chicken enchiladas though.  To reiterate what some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the fillings were bland and maybe a little bit overcooked."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for tacos. 
Since I'm not eating meat right now, I had a potato taco. It was one of the best things I put in my mouth lately. I also had the cheese enchilada but they were only ok. Deduct 1 star for being far away and for a little dirty inside the restaurant. Still, I would 100% recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food hands down! If you are looking for ambiance and service, go elsewhere. But the food makes up for it all. I've had good mexican food everywhere, but this is the best. I get the enchiladas with the amazing red sauce and the incredible tortillas. Cheap, delicious, cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Carolina's is my all-time favorite!  My family has eaten here for years.  I go here WAY too much!  I absolutely love all their food.  It is such a great value.  They have the best tortillas in the state.  The #3 Combo is my favorite.   I love their shredded beef tacos, beans, tortillas and salsa.  I never grow tired of it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken enchilada combo plate. Fabulous enchilada sauce which is the make-or-break for this dish. Yum. We also ordered tacos - and found them american-ized, not authentic, so they included the lettuce, cheese, etc. Chips and salsa did not come with the meal so we ordered separately. GREAT salsa/sauce. Inexpensive and worth every single penny spent! We ordered ahead on the phone. When we arrived there was a long line to order. We didn't have to wait, but went straight to the second register, paid and left."}
{"text":"ordered the red meat combo.  YUMMM!  it might be the best red meat ever with a little bit of a kick.  it came with rice, beans and 1 tortilla.  i'll have to remember to order more tortillas next time.  i also ordered a side of chips and salsa.  double YUMM!"}
{"text":"Spending many years in San Diego, I would say this is the closest to the top taco/burrito shops in SD. Tortilla's are the best in AZ, no reason they have been voted that years in and out. Grab a bag of tortillas for later.

FYI, try the Green Corn Tamales, not on their menu, but a hidden masterpiece at Carolina's."}
{"text":"One of the best places for mexican food.  Usually get the machaca soft tacos and a 3-way burrito.  Anything covered in red enchilada sauce is also delicious.  Their tortillas are the best, get a dozen for the road.  I can eat them warm and plain right out of the bag and be perfectly happy.

This location doesn't have the ambiance of the OG laundry mat location, but it has it's unique features (old chinese buffet?)."}
{"text":"The service is so poor here. I waited in line behind two people for at least 15 minutes. The food is good but don't come here hungry because you'll be waiting. Just saying.  Back a second time and the service still sucks. Where is the management here? Tables are dirty, too many people on the line, too many people standing around doing nothing. Clean your act up or this is my last time here."}
{"text":"Emperors new clothes. This place gets a lot of hype. I don't know why. The beans taste like they came from a can. The enchilada was so cold the cheese on top never came close to melting. The red sauce is just ok. The shredded beef taco is pretty good but was also served barely warm. Everything served in styrofoam.  Bummed as I picked that for my birthday dinner and no one liked it."}
{"text":"The price is right! 16 bucks for two huge lunches, chips & salsa and two drinks.

If you're looking for upscale, squeaky clean and Scottsdalish, this ain't your place. If you're looking for good Mexican food, at reasonable prices, quick service and great flavor head on over to Carolina's."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place, since I have heard a lot of great things about it.  I normally give one stars to places that give horrendous service or the food made me sick and while this place did neither of these things the food was extremely bland.  I got the beef taco plates and the beef was so bland it tasted worse than a place like Filibertos.  Yes, the salsa was good, but tacos should not need salsa, it should only enhance them.  The beans also were overcooked and burned my wife's mouth.  Overall, I think this place is overrated and while not bad, it is comparable to getting food at Filiberto's."}
{"text":"Looking for someplace new to try. Was not disappointed. Just got some hard shell tacos with refried beans and rice along with some tasty Horchata. The tacos were really good and the salsa was so delicious. Just the right amount of spice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands-down best tacos (crunchy) and the BEST hot sauce! I eat here at least twice a week! This place makes me justify Taco Tuesday every day of the week! Except for Sunday- they're closed."}
{"text":"Always the best food, not the most healthy, but super delish!  I love the green chili burritos, tacos, beans, red chili burritos, you really cant go wrong here.  My only recommendation would be to have salsa pre-packaged to go."}
{"text":"We came here because he reviews were high and they supposedly use Hatch green chile. We were disappointed. First of all the place is not the cleanest. When I asked the girl taking the ordering they use Hatch green chile she had no clue what I was talking about. Ordered green chile chicken enchiladas with a taco and tamale. The enchiladas were somewhat spicy but I can make better enchiladas than that. The taco was pretty good. The red beef tamale looked and tasted like it was made with canned Hormel Chili, not so good. Probably won't be back. On a mission to find a place in Phoenix that serves Hatch green chile."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good at his place but it is really annoying when they start shutting  everything down before you even get your food.  They are literally putting up chairs as you are eating. The second we got our food they told us they were shutting down the soda machine and salsa bar.  They close at 9pm and we got there at 840pm.  Only restaurant I have ever been to that won't stay open  past close to make people happy.  This has happened to us twice.  We came over after a track meet with the whole family.  Spoke with a manager on both occasions and they don't care.  If you don't want our business then don't stay open until 9. Your food is not good enough to put up with the crappy service 

Also why waste plastic bags making food togo when we are eating in?"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Mexican food currently. My all-time favorite is Carlos O'Briens, but it's too far of a drive when you just want some takeout.

The beans are phenomenal, as are the chicken chimichangas and homemade tortillas. I have never had a bad meal here and I've gone at least a dozen times. My only complaint was that the outstanding tortillas are way too big: storage is a real problem and there invariably ends up being too much leftover tortilla when making a reasonably-sized burrito with them.

The atmosphere is Filiberto's but the fare is worth it."}
{"text":"There aren't better tortillas in Phoenix. Green chili is the best. Place looks like a dump but you can't get a better burrito anywhere. When people from out of town ask where to eat, I say don't leave without a Carolinas 3 way burrito"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and it was packed. They have their act together. Friendly staff that works hard to get the orders out. I had the enchiladas and they were excellent. This place will be on my list. 
I've changed my review from a 5 to a one. I revisited the week before Christmas. It's looks ooks like the grand opening is over. The place was dirt and the music in the dining area was so loud I ate fast and left. A big disappointment since from my first visit."}
{"text":"So happy to have Carolinas close by in Mesa!  Best machaca chimichangas in town!  No frills dining means very reasonable menu prices.  Our new go to for Mexican carry out!"}
{"text":"Always an Awesome Meal.
Popped in tonight instead of driving to 40th Street & Greenway for PIZZA.
Glad we stopped
THE SALSA IS ON FIRE That NIGHT"}
{"text":"since it has been open I go there 2 a week it's so good! The tortillas are amazing! I always get there bean burrito with carne asada inside! It's amazing I also love there green chili burrito it's not spicy at all but has so much flavor! 
The only thing is that finding a place to sit is so hard because it is so busy so it's a good thing for them so just make sure you go during the off hours! But hands down best Mexican food place!"}
{"text":"This a must try if you like authentic Mexican food. It's every bit as good as the original restaurant down on Mojave!"}
{"text":"We had visited the original Carolinas a couple of times before and always had great service and delicious food. Today we visited at the Cactus location. Tables were clean and inside looked nice. However, our food arrived cold. Maricopa Dept of Health should definitely stop by his location to test temperature of food that is suppose to be kept at a certain temperature like meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy:0!!! The tortillas weren't warmed  and chips tasted old and stale. Manager Vanessa was very unprofessional when we expressed our concerns. This is a one and done for us. We will visit he original location from now on."}
{"text":"Been back 3 times now, and still trying to adjust the best time without a long line..lol..

This place was WAY overdue from opening, and this location would need probably another location to help support the huge customer base.. 

Same consistent flavors as the original Carolinas in Phoenix. 

My goto: Plain Chimi + Cheese Tortilla ... yummm and the sauce,,, man,, we get extra sauce EVERY time to use at home... 

Only Flaw hear is some of the \"moist\" or wet ingredient Burritos, tear up the tortilla and makes a mess.. 

Now other than expecting a line, we would be here at least once a week, but coming from Chandler, its a bit far to try to eat here for our 1 hour lunch time.."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Carolinas. I always crave it on Sundays (usually due to alcohol consuption the night before) and it is closed on Sundays, which is why it doesn't get 5 stars. :-) We typically order several servings so that we can eat Carolinas for days, especially Saturdays, so we can enjoy Carolinas on Sunday. 

My husband swears by the machaca burros and I love the bean tostadas or bean burros. Their breakfast burros, salsa, and tortillas are also wonderful! 

The only thing I don't love are their cheese enchilladas, because I don't like the enchillada sauce. Its not because it is bad, its just different from what I am used to. It is probably more authentic Mexican, than I am used to. Everything else is great and their staff is always friendly.

Be prepared to wait for a while, because the line can be quite long."}
{"text":"Consistent, solid food. Good green chili, excellent machaca, great and quick service. Standby is the machaca plate- well seasoned, long grain. Fairly warm during the dog days of summer -- recommend take out. Saturday at lunch is very busy - call ahead for takeout. Menudo on Saturdays!!"}
{"text":"Ive been to Carolinas many times in the past decade. I use to always stop by and pick up a dozen tortillas because they are hands down the best tortilla that ive had. Other than tortillas, i usually get their tamales. However the last time I was in AZ, i stopped by and decided to try something new. I gave the green chili burrito a chance and i was hooked. I had to go back again the next day for some more goodness. They are kind of small so i decided to try a red chili burrito too. The red was good, but the green was the best. I left full, happy, and satisfied. Cant wait till im back in AZ again for some good mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very busy place.  Feels crowded, from the line you stand in to order to the spacing of the tables.  Line moved pretty quick but we had to wait about 20 minutes for the food.  Prices are right.  Nice menu.  I had the soft shell carne asada taco and green chile burro.  Both were excellent. Just one salsa offered."}
{"text":"Carolina's is one of my Top Ten reasons I don't leave AZ. 

I've always dreamed of living near the beach and maybe someday I will. Until then, I keep a list of things I would miss if I left AZ. Carolina's Mexican Food is always in my Top Ten. 

Yes, the place is a dive and the line can be long, but the amazing authentic Mexican food and incredibly cheap prices more than makes up for it. The hard machaca beef tacos are my favorite. Anything with their machaca beef is outstanding: slow-cooked, seasoned, and shredded to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. It's available with green chile peppers, red chile peppers, or plain. It's served in a taco, a burrito, or anyway you'd like. Sour cream and guacamole are great extras. 

Another important tip: Carolina's freshly made tortillas are legendary. Be sure to take a dozen home. They're homemade and served warm in a plastic bag. If you're like me, you'll only have 9 or 10 left by then time you drive home."}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona 2 years and this restaurant is my best friends favorite. I've only just eaten here recently. Amazing food. Great Prices. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I must state up front that I am a Carolina regular. I've eaten there well over 100 times over the years. So what keeps me coming back? Foremost, the prices are very reasonable.This is not Taco Bell. This is Arizona style border food, but at fast food prices. Try a simple beef taco in any one of the many combination plates to see the superiority. And the fresh flour tortillas are wonderful (hot, large & thin).  

So why only three stars (see update below)? The dining room can be a disaster at times. Want a clean table? It's up to you. Get behind a large carryout order, expect a long wait. Order when the kitchen staff is taking a break, expect a long wait. Or get lightening fast service. You never know. The hot sauce is flavorful and actually spicy hot, but it is watery and presented in metal pumps. All three pumps are often empty before staff comes out to refill them. Meanwhile, the pump area can become an unsanitary mess.

Perhaps the best approach to Carolina's is as a carryout restaurant. Or bring an extra friend who can save a table for your group while you order.  Enjoy the food, but pay a little extra elsewhere if you want some atmosphere.  Solid, traditional Mexican border fare, a refreshing change from ubiquitous Mexican grill chain restaurants.

09/23/2014 Update: They've been doing a little better keeping the hot sauce pump area and the tables clean. Still not ideal. And the speed of service is still wildly inconsistent. Bumping the rating up to four stars."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Always ordered food from the Phoenix location with my work so I was excited for a location to open near home. We finally got to check them out yesterday for an early dinner and they were completely full! The place is large so it's amazing how every table was filled. As you order your delicious food, you can watch them make the tortillas fresh from scratch! They have a great system because there were a lot of employees but everyone had a purpose. 
They have agua Frescas on tap and I could live off the Pina colada one. 
Food was delicious as always. Fried tacos were not greasy at all and pricing was great!"}
{"text":"Idk maybe it was all the rants and raves about it that set me up for disappointment. Maybe it was what I ordered, but really that shouldn't have mattered. If it's as good as everyone claims it to be everything on the menu should be bomb. I ordered 2 chicken crunchy tacos with beans and a tortilla, only cuz I heard that the tortillas are amazing. My cousin ordered a green chili bean burro & a green chili machaca burro. I bite into my taco. Crunchy I love but the chicken was cold! :( no bueno. #epicfail. I finished my tacos by the time my cousin had devoured his 2 burritos. He tells me \"you ordered the wrong thing. The green chili burritos are what's good here.\" Well crap, not a place to come while on a no red meat diet I guess. I move onto the beans and tortilla. Much better but nothing too spectacular about it. The tortilla I'd say was the best part of my meal. bUT nOT as good as my momma's. 
Overall .. let's just say I'm stickin with my fave Mexican food joint. My moms! No place, no body beats my moms tortillas, menudo, tamales, green chili anything!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit my home town of Phoenix this is the first place I go. Fast and delicious Mexican food, there is NOTHING like this where I live now.  The shredded beef tacos are awesome!  The beans and rice are always good. I have ordered many things off their menu and have never had anything that didn't make me smile!  I always get a fresh hot tortilla with butter and a dozen of their giant tortillas to take home.  This is one of my favorite places ever, don't ever change Carolina's!"}
{"text":"A little backstory first.............

We had a team meeting at work a few months back, and I was in charge of the \"ice breaker\" question that would begin the meeting.  My question was, \"If you were moving out of Phoenix, and could eat just one last meal in town, where would it be?  A couple of different people said \"Carolina's\".  I am pretty picky when it comes to my Mexican food, and so far in Phoenix, I have only found a few spots that I consider \"good\".  If about 1/4 of our team claimed that Carolina's would be their last meal, that was a sign for me to check it out.  I finally made it down here today, for lunch.  Hell of a recommendation!

I was talking with my friend at work, Kelly, about what she usually gets (she was one of the people that had stated Caolina's would be her last meal in Phoenix) when she comes here.  She said she was a big fan of their shredded beef tacos.  I knew that was the first thing that I was going to try here at Carolina's.  I jumped in my car, drove down the 17, exited on Cactus Rd and pulled up to the joint.  I walked inside, ordered 2 shredded beef tacos, one chicken flauta, and a glass of water.  My total was just under $7.00.  I grabbed my receipt, my cup of water and headed over to the salsa pumps (pump action, like a ketchup dispenser) to fill up a couple of plastic containers.  A few minutes later, my food was ready.  Here is how everything was.................

Beef Taco-  These things come individually wrapped in white paper.  You could see a little bit of sheen/grease through the wrapper which is an ok sign by me.  I unwrapped my first one, and was immediately impressed.  The shell was perfectly fried, the meat was hot and stringy, the lettuce crisp and cool, and the cheese...oh, the cheese...the cheese was extremely plentiful and absolutely fantastic.  They use a chopped/shredded style cheese that almost reminded me of a parmesan cheese in a can almost (the cut/shred of it).  There was a ton of it and it tasted fantastic!  I would recommend grabbing a fork to scoop up all the cheese that will fall onto your paper plate/wrapper.  Scoop it up and redistribute it back onto your taco!  I added some of their thin hot sauce to the mix and the flavors complimented each other perfectly.  My favorite beef taco of all time is Tito's in Culver City.  These tacos here at Carolina's were the closest thing to Tito's I have ever tasted. They were fantastic and are definitely some of the best beef tacos I have ever had (top 3, easily!)  I mowed down my 2 tacos and could have had about 3 to 4 more.  For $2.25 a pop, these are cheap, filling, and absolutely awesome!  Reason enough to return here over and over again.

Chicken Flauta-  I ordered one of these a la carte just to see what the chicken tasted like.  The flauta comes in a box with lettuce and a ton of their shredded cheese.  The flauta was good.  It was a little bit small though and wasn't mind blowing.  The shell was crunchy, and the chicken tasted fine.  Dipped in their hot sauce, it was tasty.  Not sure I would get one again though...pay the extra $.75 and get yourself a taco instead. 

Service was quick and friendly, and prices were great!  I can see why there are so many Carolina's fans here in Phoenix!  Those shredded beef tacos were easily 5 stars.  I hear their chimichangas are great, and I hope to try those sometime soon.  Until then though, I will be thinking about those shredded beef tacos!"}
{"text":"Got the carne asada burro with rice, chips, and salsa. It was all good, the tortillas I enjoyed the most and you can even order them to go also. Definitely would go again given the price and how cheap it was."}
{"text":"BOO!!!! If i had the opportunity to give this place a HUGE ZERO I would.  This place is not only disgusting it hires the stupidest people to work their front register. I figured 4 stars from Yelp this place cant be bad.  As Shane does not eat beans he simply ordered a steak burrito with NO beans, he even asked the chick at the front counter if it had beans inside and she said no.  Why did we end up with a soggy chimichanga and a bean burrito when we got all the way home?  Their salsa taste processed like pace or cheap. The soggy chimichanga was wet and not flavor full.  The man was not able to eat anything as his whole order was messed up resulting in all beans.  I was able to salvage the chicken from the soggy chimichanga and fed it too the dogs.  At least they did not go hungry."}
{"text":"Carolina's is a great spot for some delish lunch. It's inexpensive and you get a good sized portion. Their known for their tortillas which are incredible. I usually go for their two hard shell beef tacos that have a nice crunch when you take a bite. I get the combo plate for the addition of rice and beans. I will say I've had that meal both as take-out and dine-in. I highly recommend dining in, it's the kind of food that should be eaten hot and ready."}
{"text":"Well...I wanted to fall in love with this place but I didn't. It was just okay for me. The young girl at the counter was super friendly, no question, and our meal came out pretty quickly. I knew going in that the dinnerware would be styrofoam with plastic utensils, but it's seems so wasteful. The place was busy on a Saturday night, so it seems popular enough. 

I had a cheese enchilada and a green corn tamale with rice and beans. Everything was just fine. The chips came in a plastic bag...very hard, over salted and cold. When I can find warm, freshly made chips, salsa and guacamole at my local sports bar, why would I make the drive here?

There were used napkins on the floor, no clean tables and both the drink and salsa station showed evidence of heavy use. Kind of off-putting, really. 

Our family of four ate for $40. I can make a mean Mexican meal at home for far less than that. We have lived in the Phoenix area for over four years and we have not yet found a Mex place we love."}
{"text":"First time, visiting from out of town. I was expecting more hole-in-the-wall, but it was more like slightly better than fast food. it was super busy, so I don't know if the service is usually this slow and several people usually wait  around for their food. Food wise, it tasted okay. I can't be too picky, given the price. 

We ordered a chicken taco salad. I asked what was in it, but the person behind the register didn't mention jalapenos. Too spicy for my child! I complained and the woman was very apologetic. I appreciated her, but what I didn't appreciate is somehow the order to remake it with a different meat did not come! I went back to the counter, and she had to ask for it again.

So i feel bad giving a poor review since the staff was very nice, but it must not be a well run place."}
{"text":"Carolina's is a place for the whole family. They have won the tortilla award 21 years in a row. It is in a good location. Their is so many different options from tacos to tortillas. The breakfast burritos are especially good.  It took a while to get our food but only because it was busy."}
{"text":"I used to love Carolinas so I dread writing this review.  But my last experience wasn't pleasant and this time was horrendous.  I ordered enchiladas over the phone, that way they could be ready when I got there. They told me 10 -15 minutes wait time... totally reasonable.  I got there about 12 minutes later, they told me my food wasn't ready,  which is ok.  I don't mind waiting a few.  15 minutes later I asked if my food was ready.  The guy working said they were making it now.  But I noticed there was a to go box with a #8 on it just sitting there.  That's fine, it must have been someone else's.  Another 10 minutes roll by and I ask another girl if my order was ready. She realizes it's the box that had been sitting there that WHOLE time and gave it to me.  When I got it home it was ice cold and tasted terrible. Sadly, I will not waste any more money here."}
{"text":"Food sucks bad! Cheap ass non authentic grengo food. If your an arizona native you know better.
Try: el Nortino or el bravo. Much better."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? 
Oh, I know. The chicken burritos always have way too much \"juice\" dripping out of them. I'm not saying I would ever stop eating them, I just thought I would point it out since I didn't see anyone else mentioning it. This location has a pretty steady stream of customers, and the food is always good, but the cleanliness of the place can get pretty lacking at times.
Also, did you know you can order your burrito with \"double meat\"? YEEHAW!!!!"}
{"text":"Not even close to the original Carolinas in south Phoenix!   They can't make special orders of just egg and cheese buttons and I realized it is because they have pre made food!!!!  

Service was not good at all......  they should rethink how they run his place.  I will definitely take the extra drive just to have the good stuff that made them good over the years in phx!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets, fast service, excellent pricing.  A destination when we are visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"It scares me how close this place is to my house. Food is epic every time. Glad they have carne asada now as well.

The chimichangas as so good and crispy when fresh. Salsa and chips are a must every time as well. You cannot go wrong with this place I promise. It will be jam packed just like it always is so be prepared to wait and stake your claim at the first open table you can find."}
{"text":"I was craving this place so I was happy from the minute I parked the car.  I had the 2 tacos, rice and beans.  The rice and beans were fabulous, the tacos were so-so, but still filled my craving.  What I really wanted were chips and guacamole because I saw some other people eating them and they looked divine.  Anyhow, I plan to go back and try more items off the menu.  But for the most part, I was pretty happy.

1/27/08-- the chips deserve 5 stars ohhhh the chips!!!!!!!!  
I had the cheese enchilada's last night, not good. 1 star"}
{"text":"A group of teachers at school were ordering food to go from Carolina's so I decided to as well. The menu items were cheap. I went simple with 3 cheese enchiladas and I was very disappointed. They had almost no flavor, very bland. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Carolinas is by far one of my favorite mexican food places.  Its affordable and you can sit down or get take out.  The service it very friendly and the food typically comes pretty fast.  They are always busy which is a good sign and I have not been disappointed.  This is a go to restaurant for my family and I."}
{"text":"I love Carolinas Tacos!!
I ordered 6 shredded beef crunchy tacos  to go.
When I got to my destination. We sat down to eat.
I could not believe how salty the beef was. It was so strong I couldn't eat I had half a taco my son had one and we couldn't eat the rest.
I called to let the restaurant know about the meat. The lady on the phone told me to hold on  & Left me on hold for 5 minutes. I ended up hanging up I had to continue my evening. Homework, showers, kids to bed. 
I really love the tacos. But their lack of concern for the quality of product they are selling was really disappointing. On a positive note my son said he really enjoyed the lettuce, cheese, and taco shell."}
{"text":"Came in and it was busy!! Very humid atmosphere.
Refineries beans too runny for my taste.
Green chili had flavor but really really runny tortillas were too thin."}
{"text":"I go to the Carolina's on Cactus because it is convenient and the food is fantastic. The portions are huge and the atmosphere is casual but fun. The tortillas are fresh and fantastic. The price is reasonable. It's just easy to go there and get a good meal."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than simplicity!  Carolinas delivers tried and true Mexican fare with few frills but solid flavor. Nothing better than a homemade tortilla that envelops cheese-comfort down to my toes. Love their beans. Looks like they are adding  more choices to building a combo. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Had a good quick lunch here. I loved the chimichanga and their chips were fresh. It's cheap too so we liked that."}
{"text":"The food is Excellent here, I stop in here every time I'm in the area. The service is always friendly and the food always comes out in a timely manner, the down side is there salsa and chips. Very plain and nothing special."}
{"text":"This is a must go place. Efficient, friendly staff.Quick,  Consistent fare, year-after-year. Economical meals for two. Simple menu, and a lot of people eat here so I believe the food is fresh. And what about those tortillas? To die for. Love the hibiscus drink. And deep-fried bean burritos."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! This is our go to place for rice, beans and tortillas. The staff is friendly and on one occasion we decided to order a tray of beans and rice and they were able to accommodate us with pleasure on short notice. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Seriously unimpressive.
I ordered the #16 for take out.
That's a chicken chimi with everything.
They handed me a suspiciously light package.
I get home, and there is no hot sauce, no utensils, no napkins.
The serving of beans is tiny, and the chimi looks small, and FLAT. WTH?
I taste it. The rice is old, lukewarm, and clumpy, and the chimichanga is mostly tortilla.
I think I understand why they said they were super slow.
Probably not bothering to go back.
Not worth the money."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in Phoenix (maybe anywhere.) This place is a hole-in-the-wall but MAN what great food! I've only had one dish, the enchiladas, because they are so good I don't dare risk trying something else.  They are spicy hot and sooooo good! Incredible bang for the buck."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Carolina's last night for dinner.  I just want to say that I have experienced better Mexican food at a simple walkup or kiosk in Central Phoenix.

The Enchilada I ordered was salty.  The taco I had with it was also salty
My wife did not enjoy her tamale & enchilada.

Also, the refried beans taste like they came out of a can.  If I did not see the person running the tortilla press, I would not have found that to be special.

Perhaps it is just me.  I have been to Mexico many of times.  I just did not find that this food measures up to what I remember eating in Guadalajara or Mexico City."}
{"text":"Overrated. Don't go out of your way. The tortillas are better than most places but the entire dishes are not special. If you are in the neighborhood its worth a stop but don't make a special trip."}
{"text":"The best! if your in the area, you got to stop by carolina's. you won't be disappointed in any of the food! definitely a fast reliable, and reasonable place to regularly go to"}
{"text":"As much as I love Carolinas, I got sick for the 2nd time recently.
A breakfast burrito (Chorizo and egg) which looked a little grey, but tasted good. 
I wasn't horribly sick (like what happened the time before), but it was enough.
I can't go back.  At least for a year or two until I forget.

I just worry sometimes that things happen so fast in there is the quality and cleanliness always what it needs to be.

I have eaten at the Cactus store 100 times and sick twice is too much.
Still great food and a great spot, just need them to be more careful."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying how much I really love Carolina's - the Original One. This was my first time here at the new location. I will start by saying this ~ some of the staff here are so rude and bitchy. They are not warm and not welcoming like normal places. I had to end up calling and speaking to the Manager on duty, who like me was a Latino. He really listened to my concerns about the, how did her refer to her oh yah \"The Weda \". This young lady needs to learn more about customer service and smile a bit. She slammed by large drink cup on the counter, that was only one of the things about her attitude I did not like. Maybe I will give this location another chance. Only time will tell. I would like to give a Shout Out to the Manager, A tall Hispanic, sweet male, who I apologize I forgot your name, for taking the time to speak with me and hear my concerns about the cashier on 04/22/17.. After spending almost $30 for me and my family there , I guess I expected much better than what I got."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Best Mexican food by far! The machaca is my favorite!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to get sn order right . We stop by once a week usually for dinner . If I order a comination and it's supposed to ha a tortilla put a freaking tortilla in with it . If I order 4 tacos put 4 tacos in the bag , not 3   not 2 ."}
{"text":"Awesome food, portions are a lot better than most places, prices are good too... well definitely be stopping in when in that area... friendly staff"}
{"text":"I paid nearly 3 dollars for the smallest tamale in the world. And they were not good."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great grab and go place. Wish they had a bar! Tortillas are fresh. Definitely not diet friendly, but come on people.... Did you really think it was? Really?"}
{"text":"Had a really rough day, then Carolina's turned it around. I love a Mexican restaurant with Orange Bang on tap. 

The tacos are fantastic, the salsa was spicy but had a lot of flavor from the tomato and peppers. I really liked the side tamale with my meal also. 

The desert chimichangas were my favorite. Very sweet and satisfyingly crunchy."}
{"text":"Got a to-go combo from Carolina's tonight- two hard tacos with rice and beans.  I got one chicken and one beef taco.  They were completely devoid of flavor - the chicken tasted like nothing, and the beef wasn't much better.  The rice and beans were good, I had to add some to each taco to give it some flavor.  Maybe I got the wrong thing, but I seriously doubt the other meats could be much better."}
{"text":"Great, home style, Mexican food. Not Tex Mex.  YES! Casual environment. Reasonable prices. Good selection of all Mexican cuisine.  They make their own tortillas from scratch in house. I don't know any other casual dining restaurant that does that."}
{"text":"We asked around and were told that Carolina's is the best Mexican food in town.  We wouldn't call this place a restaurant; it is more of a Mexican fast food joint, but done right with fresher, tastier options.  The place reminds us of a Taco Truck, but with clean, air-conditioned indoor seating.  With Carolina's in operation, we don't understand how a nearby Taco Bell, Taco John's, Chipolte, or Taco Cabana could stay in business.  Overall, it is not the best Mexican food we've had, but it is still really good, fast, and convenient.  We will definitely be back when we are tired and want take-out.

Food we recommend: Chimichanga - Fried up perfectly and well seasoned.  Best thing on the menu.  Enchiladas - Make sure to get them with the red sauce.  We preferred the chicken over the shredded beef.  Flautas - They were good, but we'd rather get the Chimichanga.  They taste similar and you get more food for a similar price.  Machaca - Great dish that we're never had before.  You may want to order a few extra tortillas.  Their tortillas are huge and amazing.  We tear them in half to fill and we needed more than the one to finish the food.

Stay away from: I was really disappointed their tamales.  I'm a big fan of tamales, but I'd rather eat canned ones then eat the ones from here again.  They were cold and flavorless.  I had mine served with the green sauce, which had no flavor too.  Maybe they'd be better with the same red sauce that came with the enchiladas, but I'd have a hard time ordering them again."}
{"text":"Not the rating I wanted to give however, this is after our 3rd attempt at eating Carolina's.  Our first experience was during the 2nd week of opening.  The first few weeks were lines out the door.  Expected for a new spot, but looking back now, I can't say why so many wanted to try their food. 

I tried their mini chimis and flautas.  Very basic and nothing exciting.  We were hungry and had no idea what would be worthwhile trying.  Unfortunately, the meals were nothing special and pretty boring and lacking in any flavor.

The second time we tried they were not nearly as busy...only a few weeks later.  Tried a red and green burrito enchilada style.  Dull dull dull, no flavor and certainly not red and green, more a bland brown shaded green or red.  Tasted like they had forgotten to add any flavors what so ever.  

The third meal was yesterday...this was disgusting.  Only way They could have saved this order failed also....here's why.  We got there at around 2:30. We both ordered Carne Asada Burrios.  They only come with Carne and Pico ...  we added sour cream guacamole rice and cheese...this did not save the flavor or add to it...I couldn't even finish my meal.  We watched for over 30 minutes while the entire food line left the floor (perhaps a team meeting?) regardless, our food sat on the counter for what seemed like the entire 30 minutes.  No one to tell the cashiers that the food was sitting there getting cold the entire time.  I was hoping that their \"famous tortillas\" would save me from writing this, however, they were a huge waste of money and quite ok honestly not even the same as what was used on our burritos.  The tortillas taste like flour-bland as can be. 
Because of this, I will never go back--can't say I'd want to waste another $20 on food there or even $5-just not worth the time or disappointment.

Horrible and never going back."}
{"text":"Bad for the waistline, great for the taste buds and wallet.  Don't come here if you are looking to \"eat healthy\" -- that's not what this place is for.  It's the place to go if you are looking for good, cheap, Mexican food at an affordable price.  For just under $10 I can eat like a king including a drink (and describing me as \"portly\" would be polite.)  

The major downsides are lack of ambience (but awesome compared to their \"downtown\" location) and wait times.  You *will* have issues finding a table during busy hours of 5-7pm, so it's best to bring a friend and immediately have that friend save your table.   Hot sauce is perfection and lives up to it's name...HOT.   Love everything I order here and I'm a picky eater."}
{"text":"Best machaca around, hands down. The places gets busy, but you cannot beat the price and the food all around is good."}
{"text":"Went to this place but different location for the third time, wonder what is the big deal???  Had shredded beef bland taco plate when indeed I ordered the crispy chicken tacos!  I complained about my order and told them I would take the beef because I did not have time to wait was due back at work.  They searched my order and found the chicken request was not included on my order...did not get a refund or credit either!  The food here looks good but it is bland and tasteless.  Being of mexican decent I know good tasting restaurant mexican food when I taste it and this place ceases to amaze me how bad their food is and all the people who love to go?  Its constantly crowded and over rated.  Service is not even good!  Will not waste my money, time or frustration here again."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican food.  Nice folk behind the counter, even when it's slammed.  Drink bar is a wreck, salsa is excellent.  Sometimes there isn't a table. We still go, it's an institution around here.  I have yet to manage to have menudo there.  Holiday tortillas are to die for.  Everyone is pleasant, including the customers. And it's not a zillion dollars plus tip."}
{"text":"You better know what you want by the time you reach the front of the line because this place operates like a hustle and bustle fast food joint where all the food is prepared to go even if you order it for here.  I dined in, but it was obvious that most of their business is to go.

Rather simple menu which is fine, and I thought the tostadas and bean & potato burro was pretty good, considering how simple these items are.  Potato was rather soft, refried beans were smooth, and tortilla was above average.  On the whole, it was very affordable, and it's always good to offer tortillas to go by the dozen.

I'm sorry folks but I'm just not feeling the butter tortilla.  Of course butter is probably good on anything, but this just didn't do it for me.

They could offer more substantial serving ware for those dining in.   You would think they would have served the tostada open faced for dining in, but it too was neatly packed up to go.

Table and floor cleanliness wasn't up to par either.  Maybe that's another of their ways of telling you to please just order to go?"}
{"text":"So, I've tried the phoenix location and wasn't shocked... However, after driving by it I figured I didn't give it a real chance so my crew and I just came here for lunch. Walking in it smelt like they just got done burning the rice (good thing I wasnt there for rice). I ordered a carne asada burrito and a green Chile burrito. These things are 5 bucks each and are flippin tiny. They should call these tortilla and green Chile burrito because there is so much tortilla to meat combo... I tried the carne asada first and it was decent. It was a tad salty but the problem is the tortilla is thin and wraps around the meat like 3 times its so Damn big. I next tried the green chile... Instead of throwing it across the parking lot and yelling at the skies with fury and anger, I gave it to the human garbage disposal sitting next to me in my truck (coworker). It was slimy with bits of meat and had absolutely no flavor. I would have rather had a certain fast food restaurant burrito that usually you get after drinking. Well, I gave it another shot and it failed miserably. I wouldnt ever spend another dime there."}
{"text":"Carolinas has the best tortillas in Phoenix area. The location in Mesa has Menudo on Saturdays. All the combinations are delicious. And, the machaca meat is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is great! Came here once for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised by how good my meal was. (I really wasn't expecting anything great due to the very mixed reviews). I got the chicken enchiladas combo. My SO was basically eating off my plate (he just got a chicken burro...I though it was pretty tasty too, great tortilla).  Dinner for 2 came to just over $11 bucks. So it's salty, greasy and carb loaded, but if you're eating at a fast food mexican restaurant, this is expected! Unfortunately, this is not very 'fast food' due to the number of patrons who frequent this place. Average wait for dinner is 25 to 30 minutes. Just call ahead and do take out. That's what I plan to do from now on."}
{"text":"This is definitely not the original flavor of there downtown location the homemade tortillas were old and stale. I ordered a green burrito with beans and a crumbly day old tortilla considering there know for the delicious warm tortillas it was disappointing probably will not return to that location."}
{"text":"Everything here is hand made and delicious. You can even see them making the tortillas in back, so fresh! Everything I have tried here is delicious and Carolina's in now my go to Mexican food place in the area. 

It is often busy and can take some time to order and get your food, but it is so busy because it is so delicious!"}
{"text":"I had a small event catered by Carolina's and it was fantastic.  Samantha returned my call quickly and responded when I changed the order late in the game. They arrived on time- actually a little early- and set everything up neatly. Very friendly and prompt which helped everything run smoothly.  The food was delicious as it always is.  And they did not scrimp on the sides- lots of cheese, lettuce, plates and cutlery, and extra fuel for the chafing dishes. Highly recommend this if you need catering."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Used to go to location in Sunnyslope but moved east valley years ago.  Thanks Carolinas for coming out here."}
{"text":"i like this place. the prices are right for my budget and the selection is very good. there is a new location on Country Club just north of the #60 freeway."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 breakfast burritos...on bacon, one carne asada.

Nothing special about the ingredients (egg, aforementioned meat, cheese, and potatoes...I think, couldn't tell).

Tortillas while fresh had a distinct uncooked/powdery flour taste.

They only seem to have one salsa and it was too spicy (I like mild/medium).

3 might be overly generous but I'm going with it for now."}
{"text":"The best machaca and flour tortillas anywhere!!!

I'm craving a machaca burrito as I write this.  Unfortunately, they don't deliver to Kentucky!  I spent 90 days in Phoenix last year and 'discovered' Carolinas.  From that point on, I ate there at least 4 times a week.  Everthing on their menu was good to outstanding.  

A caveat - this place is a total dive in a less than desirable part of the city.  But, it's close to downtown and my hotel.  When I departed, I brought back several dozen tortillas."}
{"text":"I dont know if they were instructed to by mgmt or they have a specific person in charge of putting potatoes in their burros but the one on Mohave has a problem with how much they put in their burros recently. If you order an Oaxaca burro like we always do, the last 6 times its been mostly potato. One time it was almost 95% potato. I am not exaggerating. I end up just ordering the 3 way burros to play it safe but they really should fix this. I have had it on 6 occasions, one time in all 3 burros and it ruins the damned thing."}
{"text":"So glad this location opened up in North Phoenix. Always simple low price quality food at all their locations. 
Best tortillas in town so always have to get a burrito. Green Chili Burrito is my favorite with the green machaca a close 1A. Red tamales are awesome and the kids love the chocolate chimis . 
No frills place but everything is a winner whether you eat in or take out, if you don't go it is your lost."}
{"text":"The food is great. I love the authenticity.  I would give them 5 stars but they need to work on customer service.  I called to place an order for 7 breakfast burrito for myself and colleagues that we do every Friday for breakfast. I simply asked if it were possible if they could cut the burritos in half and the lady's reply was \"we don't cut them in half\" Oh. Well excuse me. It's so sad that there's no such thing as customer service anymore because they could have made an exception.  I thought to satisfy a customer, you try to meet their expectations and accommodate them. Whatever tho, overall the food was good, just need to work on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Carolina's in my area! 
But unfortunately my excitement was met with a mediocre experience. 
First, I called in to order and I had some questions because usually I get the chorizo burrito but I had a taste for something else tonight so.... asked if the taco salad was good the kid on the phone said \"I don't know...\" I said was it popular he said \"I mean sometimes people order it\" then I was like okay forget that... what's in the chicken burrito, he responded \"I wouldn't know.... do you want me to find out?\" I was like \"uhhh yessss...?\" Fast forward, I placed my order, showed up, paid. As I'm waiting I get my salsa, sit with my boyfriend, we shared a laugh and the kid that placed my order walked over and said \"your order is on the counter\"... (the counter that was about 10ft away)... 

AGAIN: He WALKED to the table 10 FEET away and told my my order was over there (there are mics by the registers where they say order numbers) 

Anyway I tried to ignore it asked a question about onion and cilantro he told me it was an extra charge so I AGAIN ignored it and WALKED ... I repeat WALKED to the counter to get my food. 

Lastly I get home so excited to watch the season premiere of house of cards and eat my burrito in bed on my little laptop tray that I was going to turn into a food tray. I unwrap my burrito and it was FREEZING (I live 8 mins away and it was wrapped in foil)... HOW!?! 
overall I'm extremely disappointed I much rather have drove 30 mins to the one in phoenix then experience this crap."}
{"text":"I love me some Carolina's Mexican Food!! Let me start off with saying Im a fan of the original spot on Mojave in Phoenix, but the fact that they've added this gem to Mesa is just great!! Its closer to where I live....which means I'll be over more. Ugh oh! Lol 
They have extremely reasonable priced food, good portions & their salsa is to die for! They also offer my orange whip drink which is super delicious!
I have never had a bad experience at a Carolina's before & I don't intend too. They have wonderful customer service. The waitress had asked if she can refill our napkin stock before actually doing so which was really nice; she did not want to interrupt our dinner. 
Take the family here, bring your friends, or make a new friend at the restaurant.....either way you have to come here!"}
{"text":"A fine place to pick up addictive Sonoran staples, or, if you dine in,  hepatitis.  I thought this was supposed to be the \"nice\" location, a step up from the gangland locale, but it's jammed with junkies, disgustingly dirty, with all the ambience of an Okie squatter's camp from \"The Grapes of Wrath\".

The original on Mohave is cleaner, less crowded and even with bulletholes and security bars over the windows, really quite charming compared to this."}
