{"text":"An unassuming, authentic and affordable spot for meat lovers. David knows his stuff and is always thoughtful when it comes to helping customers find the perfect cut. This butcher shop offers the right compromise between product variety and awareness of Québec's local producers community. If you're near the Quartier des Spectacles, this is by far the best stop for succulent sandwiches, organic wines and artisanal beer. My favourites picks: chicken brown meat and mustard or juicy brisket with apple sauce."}
{"text":"Great products and they sell a tons of craft beer. The staff is amazing, courteous and helpful! A little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Post Script, Dec 14, 2016  From the time I wrote the first review, I came here probably 10 or more times.  New things - New cow bones (super dope) - Cute exterior decor (warm and welcoming. I liked it)  My absolute top favorite food is roast beef sandwich. I heard they have lamb sandwich, so craving to try it but within my 10 time visit there, I've only seen it on the menu once. Gonna try it next time they have it. The kitchen is always super clean, owner/chef are super friendly. Taste, Quantity, Quality, everything is really in superb quality. Love this place.  ------  Boucherie Dans La Côte is located at the intersection of Parc and Sherbrooke. They sell all sorts of meat and processed meat product along with some sandwiches.  The decoration inside is very simple. They have several tables and bar chairs. Also you can see the kitchen from the eating space.  All menus are in French however the owner/chef does explain the menu to you if you do not understand French. As a non-French speaker, I am not sure whether they have menus other than sandwiches except all sorts of meat.  I had several sandwiches and I recommend beef one, not sure what it's called in French.  Their sandwich is very simple. It usually comes with meat, 2 or 3 kinds of veggies and sauce. I recall they used a whole french bread, so it's definitely suffice for a single person. The beef sandwich is not like the one you have at Schwartz's, meaning the sandwich is not overwhelmingly beefy. I liked how they balance the beef with vegetables and sauces.  The price is around 10 to 12 dollars for a single sandwich.  Absolutely my favorite place to grab a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"I got a head cheese/kimchi sandwich there, and devoured it in a few seconds. Both the head cheese and the kimchi were some of the best I'd had in a while. The service is excellent, both guys working there were super friendly and helpful. Yes, it might be a bit expensive compared to other meat shops, but they assured me all the beef is grass fed, so you're paying for quality.  Only downside is that there weren't many cuts of beef (only 3-4) when I went in, and they didn't know the names in english, so it was a bit confusing.  Still, I can't wait to sample their other sandwiches, and maybe I'll try calling in beforehand to order a specific beef cut next time. They also have a bunch of other products, like non-homogenized milk and yogurt, which seem worth a try."}
