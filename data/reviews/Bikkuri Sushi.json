{"text":"(This review is from my visit on May 5, 2014. I intended to post at the time but there was no listing for this \"Bikkuri Sushi\" on Yelp yet. I forgot about it for a while but just found my receipt while cleaning and decided to check back. Noticed Yelp now has a page for them so I decided to post my experience since I still remember the incident very clearly as it infuriated me so much.)  Stopped by for lunch and noticed something was different. The people were not the same as before, the menu was different, and then I realized Miyako was no more. I didn't pick this up before I came in since all of their signage outside was still for the previous occupant \"Miyako Sushi\". I could have got up and left but decided to stay and give them the benefit of the doubt, since I just wanted to eat. I was in the area and alI I wanted was my quick fix of AYCE Japanese regardless what restaurant it was now as long as the price was fair.  After my first batch of food arrived, I was refused further service and from ordering anymore food. They gave me a load of twaddle about my first order being \"last call\" - if that was the case, they should have told me sooner so as to kindly give me a warning! So much for ALL YOU CAN EAT! Maybe they think I ordered too much and didn't want to lose money from big eaters. If you're going to be this way, then you shouldn't be offering all-you-can-eat then!  Food was very average at best - nothing special at all but as I said earlier, I didn't come here expecting much. All I wanted was some cheap \"AYCE\" Japanese food and I didn't even leave feeling full!!! I would *never* visit here again until hell freezes over. Unless they see this and contact me in hopes of making reparations, I genuinely hope they will close down and make way for a much better place after they're gone. Good riddance!  I would give 0 stars if possible! They are lucky that Yelp forces me to give at least one."}
{"text":"Ok. So this is where the old Myiako Sushi (Sp?) used to be. Which had excellent food but rude service. None the less it's under new ownership. First thing I noticed was the place wasnt very clean looking. There were no menus or place settings. The cost for adults is $21.99 and kids 10 and under $14.99. They had one server working the restaurant which shouldn't have been an issue because there were three tables of couples when we came in. The new ayce menu was very limited to start. The server was nice but slow as hell. It was 15 minutes before he took our order card and we had to find him to ask to order drinks.   Then comes the food. He brought one order at a time and we timed it in between dishes, we waited anywhere from 10-16 mins. Sitting there Hungry. It took two minutes to eat each dish. The last dish came 40 minutes after the first and we only put in one order.   Now the food. We ordered dragon rolls and they were small, cold, hard and the avocado was turning brown. The shrimp dim some was absolutely flavour less. We had to dip them in soy sauce to get them down. Same with the wings. The tempura was average but the sauce tasted like water mixed with sweetener. In fact all the dipping sauces were odd.  We sent two dishes back. The beef teriyaki was pretty much inedible.  The teriyaki sauce was orange and goopy.  The beef looked like hamburger. The fried dumplings tasted like they were stuffed with bread onions and sugar. Everything had a deep sweetener like taste.   Bottom line, huge waste of time and money. It's close to home so I was really hoping they would at least be decent. I won't be back there again."}
{"text":"Wow. I can imagine why people rated tuis place so badly but ive been to a lot of average Japanese ayce and this one is definitely at least decent. its not terrible as 1 star. ive been here 5 times now over a year and its been pretty much 2.5 to 3 star.  the chicken is fresh and generous in whichever form you order it.  not like some places where the cutlets are pathetic half size and thin cuts.  sushi making is not terrible.  just good enough but the selection is typical and not extensive but theres enough there if u r also eating cooked items.  very nice service tho only one server but she got us everything we asked her for. plastic fork for kids extra spicy sauce on the side more tea etc...so oveall i give it a solid 3 star rating."}
{"text":"ZERO stars! Absolutely the worst place I've ever been to for sushi!!! Terrible service, \"forgot\" items I've ordered (it's written on a damn sheet, you can't forget), terrible food quality, dingy place, etc. I only tipped $1 (shouldn't have paid for the meal at all) and they got all pissed off that I was cheap. HA!  Avoid at all costs!"}
