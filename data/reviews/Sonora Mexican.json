{"text":"Food was excellent! Carne asada tacos were great! People were friendly and the place wasn't over crowded, wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Salsa tasted awful. Food was not fresh. Flys all around while we were eating. They hardly speak or acknowledge you, they don't tell you to come get your drinks or anything. We took 2 bites and threw it all away and left. Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The menudo was on point!

That and the fact that this place is right around the corner...hell, if y'all are looking for me on a Sunday, you might want to stop here 1st and join me for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here so we weren't very familiar with how everything works. There was a young woman working the register, she was not informative.. AT ALL. We asked her simple questions about the menu, she seemed annoyed and was not helpful. Also, she did not inform us that we had to go outside to get our tacos. Since it was taking longer than we expected, I got up to ask and all she said was \"you have to get them outside\", which could've been explained at the register. Oh, and after we waited for our tacos (the second time) to be made, we still had to remind them about our drinks. Everything was very unorganized, the only reason they're getting three stars is because the food was amazing. I am definitely coming back for the food but maybe we'll go through the drive through."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Everytime I go they always fuck up my order. They don't have guacamole. My boyfriend likes this place so when I go it's only with him but they are just horrible service and food is not good. Idk what he likes."}
