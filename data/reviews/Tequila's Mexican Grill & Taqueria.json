{"text":"Tonight, my husband and I were looking for a Mexican restaurant since we are new to town. Tequila's was great! Definitely get the Roasted Tomato Salsa. It was very good, with just a little kick. My husband got the fajita burrito and I, the chicken quesadilla with poblano peppers. Muy rico! The wait staff also receives a commendation for their friendliness. We will return again."}
{"text":"A favorite for Mexican in my home town. The combos give more than enough to eat, so I almost always have some to take home. Also very affordable. Yelp says the restaurant is closed on Sundays, but it is open."}
{"text":"Great mexican food.  Two locations.  Very accomodating for large groups.  Friendly staff.  Super lunch place and the daily lunch specials are great. A favorite is their grilled chicken or shrimp salad with avocado and a lime dressing."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  It's like your regular quick Mexican fix place, but with a snazzier atmosphere.  Prices are about the same, and food tastes good, so why not choose it over other Mexican restaurants?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is within walking distance from my home and the service is great.  The portions are very large and the taste of the food is very good.    If you are looking for casual dining after a long day and your tastebuds are craving Mexican, this is the place for you:))"}
{"text":"Coming from southern CA I have a very high bar when it comes to Mexican food. While not overly great, the food here was decent and the atmosphere relaxed. I may return for a second opinion."}
{"text":"I lived in Gastonia for a while.  Where was this place when I was there?  It was a town that was happy to get an Olive Garden, for chrissakes.  My lovely lady and I went to Gastonia to check out some furniture and happened to pass by Tequila's on the way to the store.  We both had a sudden urge for a taco (though she ended up eating a quesadilla.  It's a woman's right to change her mind she always says).    Don't let the commonplace name fool you.  This is no Los Arcos or La Playa or El Cancun or El Rodeo or El Ranchero.  You won't see the Speedy Gonzalez plate on this menu (or at least I didn't).  You will see a chicharron taco, though.  I ate a chicharrones taco, a carnitas taco and a carne asada taco.  All three were delicious.  It probably isn't like being in old Mexico and it's not quite the taco truck outside Roosevelt Ave Station in Queens, but these are the best tacos I've had in the greater Charlotte area.  Main Street in Gastonia looks poised for great things and Tequila's just happened to get there sooner than everyone else.  Do yourself a favor and eat this food.  It's great and the people that work there are super friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We live in Charlotte and were getting discouraged by the Mexican food scene. Great quality and even better service.   Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wife and my first visit on referal from a friend.  Had a delicious Pablano relleno dish and 3 beef tacos which were packed full and much to my liking.  Had not the food been so tasty I definately wouldn't be going back for a return trip ,, Given NO greeting when we entered the restaurant from the person who seated us, slow slow service and the flippant attitude of our waiter were definite turn offs.  We will be going back for the food but will look to be seated in someone else's area and hope for a change in attitude."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant in downtown Gastonia.  I had a Texas Margarita, Shrimp Burrito, and Carne Asada taco and they were all great.  I'll definitely be back and would recommend to any yelpers out there looking for a good Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Moved to the area not long ago, I grew up in Central CA surrounded by amazing Mexican food.  I left over 8 years ago and have lived several places, none of which had decent Mexican food.  I was ready to be let down, yet again.  This is the first place that even gets close to what I'm used to and I am THRILLED.  FINALLY a place to fix my cravings!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Mexican restaurants, and we have many good ones. Service is always very prompt and kind. The food is always spot on."}
{"text":"Very fresh food & fast service. Great little-known spot!"}
{"text":"For almost a year, lunch at Tequila's was a weekly (at least) ritual.  Each meal made me look forward to the next!  Ask for the special salsa verde, if you like some real heat!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh the atmosphere is cozy and the outdoor seating is a huge plus. Love the way the chef actually takes time to make the dish look as good as it tastes. A lot of Mexican restaurants have huge menus that are too much look through. Tequilas strikes a lovely balance between an overwhelming amount of options and too few as to be pretentious.  The prices are great too. I can't tell you how nice it is to go to a mexican place that doesn't overcharge for the same giant menu you can find anywhere. I'd recommend the three cheese quesadillas, and the shrimp tacos are amazing!! +points for supporting a local business!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Tequilas. There has rarely been a time that I was ever disappointed. I always get the Arroz Con Pollo or a chicken chimichanga. Their queso is also very very good. Staff is always nice and service is usually always great too. Best Mexican restaurant in Gastonia, hands down."}
{"text":"Tequila's is a cheap and great place to grab some mexican food. I have eaten here for lunch several times and it's never disappointing. I just love their chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Very surprisingly great Mexican. Very very nice staff and diverse crowd of diners.  Authentic stuff.  One of the best margaritas these former Tucsonans have had in NC.  It was the pricey one...real juices...not a gringo-ized cool aid mix.  Wife had the most amazing stuffed poblano with shrimp and a great sauce. I was jealous.  I got tacos al pastor.  Good...not best ever...but really good. The re-fried beans are better than I have had most places....rice...eh.  The salsa the set on the table is almost sweet and absolutely no heat. They are nice and afraid of cooking you. Ask for their creamy green hot sauce that they make and their house made red (habanero). They were MORE LIKE IT.  My boy got the kids quesadilla..they were super nice to him. Very welcoming.  We travel back and forth from Charlotte some and I would say that this will be out go to dinner spot. Not far from the highway in the struggling downtown.  This family owned local spot is not fancy...but it is great.  Had Mexican Soccer on the TV."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while in Gastonia looking for a bite of lunch before heading over to the Schiele museum.  It was a holiday so not many things \"downtown\" were open.  The food was just ok.  Don't think I would pick this place again over other restaurants around."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! if there was a lower star than no stars I would put negative 5. the service was mediocre at best..as soon as we wlked in the host, on her phone by the way...caked in makeup had a horrible attitude had us wait to be sat down in a empty place like....seriously....then our food was cold...it was no flavor tasted horrible...just absolute dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop for lunch if you're in downtown Gastonia. Food is typical Mexican with an accent on the Tex. Plenty of lunch specials below $10."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place? All the food is good. Some is exceptional. A lot is exceptional.  Just make sure to get the chorizo queso fries. Omg. I chose this place for my bday dinner with my family just because I wanted the fries. My mom told me a few weeks later my dad asked her to recreate them at home. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Tequila's serves up tasty Mexican dishes. Their lunch menu is really affordable and has a ton of options. They're always accommodating to large groups, which is a plus, and the refills on drinks and chips are constant."}
{"text":"Tasty surprise on a road trip.  Not too far off the highway."}
{"text":"I've been looking for AUTHENTIC Mexican food since moving to NC from California in June & Tequila's did NOT disappoint... (& I was SUPER READY for disappointment being that I've barely seen anyone Mexican since moving here)... chips & salsa: salsa just like my ex-mother-in-law made... not too hot, not too mild (I prefer UBER hot, but I know most people don't - this wasn't as uber hot as I prefer but the flavor was right on!)... and I ended up ordering the Surf & Turf Chimichanga - which I NEVER order a Chimichanga, but their menu made it sound BOMB and it totally was - grilled shrimp with shredded beef and I ate every single thing on my plate (even tho the portion was huge & I probably shouldn't have, it was that good...went with my parents who enjoyed their meal (so focused I mine I didn't even look at theirs lol) and am totally looking forward to going back with my significant other who is also a foodie!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm really torn on this one. I have been looking forward to trying their food for a while. Have heard great things about their tacos. There was only one waiter taking orders for the whole dining room on Saturday afternoon. He was running around like crazy but actually doing a pretty good job. He was definitely polite and friendly. Modelo especial was on special. They brought spicy and mild salsa, so the kids could have some too. The lemondae was homemade and delicious. I had the Tacos al Pastor dinner. They had good flavor and the salsas were nice but pretty fiery. When I have had Puerco al Pastor in the past it has been a soft stewed meat not dry strips that have been seasoned = they were just okay. The smothered burrito didn't have any beans in it, but a ton of beef. The kid's quesadilla was standard. So basically some 3 and 4 star areas = a 3.5 if you will. I'll round up to give them the benefit of the doubt on some things and just because their tacos al pastor were atypical but not necessarily in a good way. I'm defintely willing to go back and try some of their diffrent tacos."}
{"text":"Don't forget to grab the cheese dip! A good little place in downtown Gastonia. Out of the Mexican restaurants I've tried in the area, this is one of my favorite."}
{"text":"When there are so many avg Mexican resturants this one stands out . Espically for the Pork Dishes (Pastor & Carnitas ) with the Pineapple Salsa . Pass Cancun Los Arcos and the rest and head to Downtown for some real flavor. Also second the Salsa Verde infact ask for that and Pineapple salsa with whatever you get . They have a 2 nd location somewhere."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is decent, nothing to write home about. Not the cheapest regular prices though. The service is fast and very professional. Ordered the lunch fajitas half chicken half steak and they were out of steak but the server was very apologetic.  The chicken was delicious. All ingrediants we fresh and guacamole was homemade and fresh as well. I'll definetly be returning."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly great! The atmosphere was nice and our food came out very fast! The price of the food was average/cheap. I'm a vegetarian and they had a lot of options available! They had a lot of options available overall and the food was great too! I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Gastonia! We moved from Charlotte and couldn't find a good place for authentic Mexican food. We ordered the lunch chicken fajitas, stuffed poblano pepper, and tacos  al pastor. Get in my tummy! It was all amazing and delicious with lots of flavor. Our favorite was the tacos al pastor; delicious marinated pork slices that are grilled to perfection! The pineapple salsa that goes with it is a must have! Check this place out! Found our fave restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken tacos! They were good, the meat was cooked very well. Although it was a little bland for my taste, the grilled peppers and onions made up for it. The services was fast and friendly! Added bonus the cheese did is awesome, and the Togo cups are huge!!! Lol. Over all I was very pleased with my experience here."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive food. Great service. Very appropriate ambiance. Nice location. Margaritas could use some work."}
{"text":"We love Tequilas.  The carnival were so soft and tasty.  The kids had fun and the fish tacos were crunchy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside."}
{"text":"Day after Christmas, so this place was busy. Service was a little slow but we're giving some leeway because of how busy it was. Staff was friendly and we were seated fairly promptly.  Chips and salsa were good. Nothing special, but good. 32 oz beers in VERY frosted mugs, (I got the last frosted mug so my guy was given 2 16 oz, same price) I mean it was like an iceberg melting on our table. Yep, our table was a puddle and we used every single napkin they gave us to sop it up, LOL. That being said, the beer was fresh and the price was good.  My fella had the Huge Smothered Veggie Burrito, I had the Enchiladas in Mole Sauce. His burrito was quite large. He had asked for black beans in the burrito but got refried, but the waiter made good and brought him a side of black beans at no charge. Other than that, he liked the burrito quite well and it was enough to satisfy his man sized appetite. My enchiladas were quite good, perfectly cooked chicken with a pretty darn good mole sauce. I would have a hard time ordering anything else there now, but mole is one of my favorite things, and if I see it on a menu, I have to have it.   We had other plans for dessert, but maybe next time we'll try a sopapilla or chocolate chimichanga.  We'll definitely be going back here, there are some other things on the menu we'd like to try. It's definitely a nice little Mexican joint."}
{"text":"My go to for quick, tasty Mexican food in this area. Having eaten Mexican food in....wait for it.....Mexico, I'm kinda picky. I have tried several others in the Gastonia area but they don't have it quite right. This place never lets me down. The food is good (I ALWAYS get the steak quesadilla and 2 carnitas tacos when I am in for a quite meal), it's fairly priced, and it gets out to you fast."}
{"text":"Hey Welcome to the most overrated mediocre Mexican in NC.   If you were anywhere else in the rest of the country this place would never survive.  I can't member anything about my meal except being upset about being charged and not telling me. I asked for some hotter sauce after ordering a few tacos.   They charge $2 for green salsa????  It's like McDonalds charging for ketchup.   In the real world, all respectable Mexican restaurants serve this is free. No these morons charge you and the idiot waitress doesn't even let you know.    Sure it's on your menu, but come on tell us that you want to over charge for something everyone else gives out.   Also $3 for avocado?   I feel sorry for people who live here and have no other options or places to go.   What an insult."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mexican food.  Best salsa in town!  Catering service is superb."}
{"text":"Francisco has done well with downtown Mexico in Gastonia! Consistently good food, great service and reasonable prices.  They now have a covered patio in the back with plenty of free parking.  They also serve up great Margarita's."}
