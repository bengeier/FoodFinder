{"text":"Nice and affordable place to eat unlimited Filipino foods, you will be full and satisfied after you leave this place ..."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall. It's old, the paint is fading, the signs are remnants from its old tenant, and really just very plain. The prices are incredibly inexpensive, however, because the quality of food is much better than those in the ritzier areas. The staff is extremely nice. For me and my wife, this is the place to eat Filipino food when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The sisig is legit!!!  Authentic and it reminds me of back home in the P.I.  I could go back here everyday just for their sisig=)"}
{"text":"Located in Lafayette square and next to another Filipino buffet (Joys Filipino buffet). Also put east charleston on GPS or else you will be directed some place else. Food is mediocre and sits under heating for awhile. Dessert is not included and drinks too were extra. Only plus may be that they offer lots of napkins. Fresher food comes in slowly. There was a lady talking to everyone walking by asking if they'd like to eat at the restaurant. I'd suggest going to pinky pinky buffet more."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday for lunch and found it pretty good. All the food was fresh except for the adobo which might have been not so fresh.  Under $20 bucks for two including drinks.  They also have free cantaloupe punch which most Pinoy restaurants charge at least $1.50 for a glass.
I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for decent Filipino food restaurant with no frills and of course it's an all you can eat buffet on top of that."}
{"text":"Was craving philipino food, so this hit the spot
Good variety. Some of the foods were out a little too long under the heating lamps

Flavors weren't bad for what it is, but I've had better 

Decor was fair- \"fast foody\" but clean"}
