{"text":"I was excited to try Bob's because coming from North Carolina we don't get a lot of quality BBQ in the Midwest.   Staff, including Bob, were very friendly. Location was simple and down home but clean.    We ordered collared greens, a pork sandwich, grilled cheese and coleslaw. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the collared greens but they were ok. Pork was very tasty, loved the simple white bread. Our friends had the chicken sandwich and envisioned in coming on a bun but again I liked the bread. I got the grilled cheese for my 5yr old son and instead he stole half of my pork sandwich, always a good endorsement.  Had a beer while we waited for our food and although the selection was small it was all local WI craft beer which always makes me happy.   Tried the following sauces: Carolina mustard, Carolina Vinegar and Brown Sugar Molasses. I liked them all but was most impressed with the brown sugar molasses and the Carolina mustard.   Oh and add some wings and onion rings to the menu, just my two cents.  I'll be back the next time we are in town for sure. Thanks Bob!"}
{"text":"What should I start with? My daughter's last remarks as we leave, \"Ribs ROCK\" or our tasty cobbler we left with that is already gone, to go box, scraped clean?  We checked out a new BBQ joint in Mount Horeb tonight. Bob, \"THE BOB\", Kathy and his whole staff were super friendly and welcoming to their new digs on Main Street. We ordered a half rack of ribs, side of mac n' cheese and a side of collard greens.  4 sauces are on the table for you to try. They have a small but well chosen selection of local beers, sodas and water to sip on and wash back your delicious BBQ. The ribs were moist, meaty and you could taste that hickory smoke. Sauces included: Ghost pepper, Carolina Mustard, Carolina Vinegar and I believe a Molasses sweet sauce.  All perfect to go with our ribs.  Mmm...  The collards were perfect, smoky, wet, and tiny bits of bacon mixed in.  Mac n' cheese was cheesy, breadcrumbs and just enough seasoning for myself and my daughter to enjoy. They also have a variety of sandwiches; pulled pork, pulled chicken, cuban, Pork Belly, Grilled Cheese, Brisket, and more dinner plates and samplers.  (More to try next time)  They have take out or dine in so we stayed to enjoy the atmosphere and company.  Bob and his merry maids checked on us several times, gave us some tips on the food and encouraged us to try the blackberry or peach cobbler. Can't wait to go back and support a local business and BBQ Pit Master!  Look for the giant carved Troll outside!"}
{"text":"The brisket is pretty good but the rest is mediocre. When we called the owner wasn't the friendliest but I was hoping the food would make up for it. Unfortunately, it didn't. If you want delicious bbq, check out Bob's Bitchin BBQ is Dodgeville. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the brisket and the chicken. The sauces were wonderful and I particularly liked the ghost pepper sauce. A very tasty addition to the Mount Horeb food scene"}
{"text":"The shame in Bob's is what it's not, but could be.  I've been to Bob's twice, and also had his catered food once.  It's very good, for the most part - the pork is excellent, brisket is decent (although could use some trimming - no one likes full mouthfuls of fat), sauces are great, beans great, coleslaw good, mac & cheese decent.  But that's where it ends.  I can't help but think that everything on the menu is about a dollar too expensive.  I'm OK with a pork sandwich for $7.50, if there's a reason to pay that much... if the meat was local or all natural, if it came with a side, etc.  The sides are a la carte, and $2 for a portion hardly bigger than a Dixie cup.    The meat is served on a couple slices of bread.  It's good bread, but who eats BBQ on slices of bread?  Not even toast?  By the time you are 1/2 way through your sandwich, the bread is starting to fall apart and get all mushy. When we catered, I told him we would just buy the meat and then buy our own buns.  He insisted he'd make us some beer buns, but said he uses bread in the restaurant because it's easier.  Again, we're paying $7.50 for a sandwich here!  (BTW, the buns were excellent for the catered event.)  The location is promising, as it's on a corner in downtown Mt. Horeb and has a nice porch to watch Main Street.  But inside the old house are white walls... and nothing else.  To walk to the bathroom, you walk through a side room that has crap all over the floor... the same way it looked 6+ months ago when they first opened.  Mt. Horeb is known for its art galleries, art fair, and art tour... let a local artist display some work and give the place some ambiance!    Bob has the location, the recipes, and the skill to cook dang good food.  Now if the portions could better align with the price and he could create some ambiance, that place could really shine!"}
