{"text":"Excellent food, SUPER friendly staff. Definitely try the fried pork dumplings sooo good!! Larb was great and my husband loved the pad Thai. Generous portions"}
{"text":"Great new Thai restaurant in a shopping center Ive driven past without thought for years. Portions are HUGE and the staff is incredibly friendly. I had the Totally Red Curry, Medium Spice, and it hit the perfect balance of creamy vs spicy with great Thai basil strewn throughout. If you get a curry get a 2nd order of rice though because it is a largeee amount of curry. Pad Thai for my wife (no spice) was a little bland but I usually think that about the dish regardless of preparation. Curry puffs were almost like curry samosas and were a great app."}
{"text":"Awesome food and super friendly owners. Will definitely be back! Their soups are tasty, as are their entrees. We've had their noodle, rice and curry dishes and will try more in the future. The service is also very good and you're made to feel at home!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out a new spot for date night and we're so glad we did! The first thing we noticed was the squeaky clean space and adorable decor. A smile greeted us as soon as we entered followed up with impeccable service by the owner. He walked us through our vegetarian options and recommended the most delicious cuisines for us to enjoy. And boy did we ever! YUM! I dined on the \"vegetable panang curry\" while my husband chose the \"cashew nuts and more\" entree. We also selected the spring rolls and curry puffs for our apps. Luckily they served enough for us to enjoy leftovers tomorrow! We can hardly wait. The owner explained that he and his wife own and operate the restaurant while his mother-in-law whips up their family recipes in the kitchen. And, get this, they try to be eco friendly by serving all meals on compostable plates and use eco friendly utensils and cups. Love it! The concept is fast casual so it's great if you're pressed for time, but also suitable for date night and family affairs too. We were offered the donut dessert, but we simply couldn't fit another bite into our bellies. Next time, for sure! 2 apps + 2 entrees for less than $40.....just do it!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in an aging strip mall on Independence but don't let that deter you. The food is amazing, inexpensive, and the owners are arguably just as great (like remember your name and stop to talk to you great)! The interior is pristine and has a cozy, almost \"rustic-chic\" feel. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious. I've become a regular here and can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great food and the chicken pad Thai is to die for.  My wife brought some home that I finished and we had to go back in 3 days since it was that great."}
{"text":"To be from a family that has spent a lot of time in Thailand, I was skeptical at first. Upon arrival, we found a cute, clean restaurant, excellent & attentive service; AND the BEST Thai food we've had outside of Thailand itself. The lunch specials (even on a Saturday) were well-priced and great portions. We tried Panang, Green Curry & Red Curry; and between us had medium, spicy and Thai hot levels of spice. Everything was fresh & delicious. Also tied the Thai iced tea which was delicious. We're already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"Aroy has become our go to for Thai takeout. It is always delicious with generous portions. The owner is very kind and the location is convenient. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very underrated delicious Thai food.  Great service and great restaurant.  Don't judge this great place by the older shopping center."}
{"text":"Tried Aroy Thai for dinner and enjoyed everything!  Service was fast and friendly.  Great for kids- the chicken teriyaki and fried bananas were a big hit with them.  They got the level of spice just right for the dishes we ordered- shrimp red curry and papaya salad.  portions were very generous and we had quite a bit left over to take home for later.  can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  We ordered customized (less salty, more sour) dishes to get authentic Thai food. They can made real good one for me."}
{"text":"Finally!!!  A nice little Thai place in Charlotte on my side of town!!!  Everything I've gotten here has been great!  It is basically a super nice takeout place with a really nicely decorated dining area if you want to dine in.  You order at the counter and they bring it out to you.  The owners are awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend read about this gem in the Charlotte Agenda and we were super excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We went for lunch during the week and although we were the only seated guests, a few people came in for take-out during our time there. From the moment we entered, you could tell the owners were passionate about what they do and the customer service was top of the line-especially for a casual restaurant.   You order and pay at the desk, but then the food is brought to you. I ordered the Ultimate Garlic Lunch Special with Chicken-Mild Spicy and my boyfriend got the Sweet and Sour Lunch Special with Chicken-Hot. They also let us sample the Crab Rangoon's since it was our first visit. We both really enjoyed our meals. The only thing we didn't love were the Rangoon's (too much cream cheese, in my opinion) but they were free, so who's complaining?  All in all, it's very exciting to have this spot on the east side, and we may take advantage of the carry-out in the future."}
{"text":"Have been keeping an eye on this spot for a couple months as I drive by it multiple times per week. When I saw the 'Now Open' sign, I had to give it a try!  I used their online ordering and placed an order for a chicken Pad Thai lunch.  Their lunch portion was of decent size and came with two fried pork gyoza - a pleasant surprise (though I wished they were steamed)! Non-pork eaters take notice though. :-)  The inside of the restaurant was small but very nicely decorated. The person working the counter was extremely pleasant and welcoming. She confirmed my order, which was ready on time, and asked me how I heard about them. She thanked me and asked me to return soon. Their takeout menus have a couple of  coupons on them if you're planning a large order.   The food was tasty, though not quite as spicy as I'm accustomed to for a medium spice level. Next time I'd do regular spicy.   I hope the place is successful, as the shopping center has some challenges when it comes to exiting. Will hopefully be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food!! My fiancé and I went there on a whim about a week ago just to check it out. We love Thai food and this one's not a hike to get to. Walked in and the owner was very kind. We ordered the chicken pad thai and veggie fried rice and we were amazed! I had actually ordered the veggie pad thai first but the owner was thoughtful enough to inform me that they use fish sauce in making their pad thai so I switched to the fried rice. The veggies were crisp and fresh and didn't feel like someone had defrosted my meal. The flavors were really great as well and they have a fair portion size (I was able to save the rest for lunch the next day)! My fiancé had the chicken pad thai and he said that it tasted great, everything was cooked well and the flavor was what he was expecting. We had ordered an app as well, the spring rolls, and they were freshly fried and delicious. The owner even offered for us to try one each of the imitation crab and the curry wraps--both were fantastic.   If you're looking for a place with great food, great flavors, and a good portion size... then I would definitely recommed trying this place out! The prices are pretty standard for a Thai restaurant, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  So happy to see such a nice little gem of a restaurant on the east side.  Best  Crab Rangoon I've had in ages.  Loved the Red Curry with chicken.  Fresh, quality food perfectly prepared and spiced exactly as requested. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Family owned! The owner is so nice and welcoming, they just moved from out west to Charlotte. The food is amazing amazing. Restaurant has a casual but nicely decorated dining area. I got the pad see ew with chicken and papaya salad. Get it spicy! Makes the flavor kick. I'm Cambodian and I know my southeast Asian cuisine very well... this Thai restaurant's food is supreme. Tastes like home! Flavor packed and not over cooked or bland. Portions are also large, it could be shared between two people. It is located off the busy 74 freeway but there is an additional lane dedicated to turning into the shopping center so it wasn't that bad entering and exiting the lot. It's off the beaten popular streets of Charlotte but it's so worth it to hit up this place! I know I will be a regular. Give them your business, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Second time here today and YES I definitely love the place. The service is great and friendly both times. First time I had the chicken pad Thai and wanted to try again the second time. Although, I prefer thick noodles for pad Thai, both times were great and flavor were consistent. It came with 2 fried dumplings which makes me happy because I have to love them! But it is only during lunch time. My boyfriend had the lovely basil beef, and he cleaned his plate! There is a wok taste which is always a plus for authentic asian food. The chicken tom yum soup was sooo good the first time we had to get it again this time. The soup opens up your appetite and makes you keep wanting to drink it more and more. The only down thing I would say is the pricing. The soup is so good but it cost almost $6 for a bowl. But then again, Thai food does cost more so if you want something a little cheaper, go during lunch. We like this place, so we'll surely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this new local spot today (for takeout) & was pleasantly surprised! Had the pork dumplings and cashew chicken - both very good. Don't let the sketchy shopping center deter you, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"If it matters and it shouldn't I ordered thru Door Dash. At best it was ok food from the freezer. I ordered the Shumi, very tiny and not made in house. They are about the size of a thimble. Next pork dumplings, 4 big meatballs with a wonton wrapper around the bottom. Last was the seafood fried rice. I didn't expect to bite into the shells on the small shrimp. 2 mussels in shell shell also. It's was more like regular rice with some soy added for color. I gave the star because the serving size of the rice was excellent even though I'm not so sure I'll be eating it. Maybe eating in house makes a big difference. I'll not be finding out anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just recently returned from a trip to Thailand, I was searching for a restaurant with authentic Thai food. So given that disclaimer I had a really good idea on what Thai food should taste. So one day driving down Independence I noticed the sign for Aroy Thai restaurant and decided to pull over and try out their traditional Pad Thai dish. As soon as I walked in I was greeted kindly and immediately felt welcomed.   I was told they had a to go style service which I'm not accustomed to but had no issues with it whatsoever. I ordered a mild spicy Pad Thai and a Thai iced tea. As I was waiting for the food I noticed the decor was very nice and cozy nothing fancy but just right the restaurant. When the food arrived at the table, (which didn't take long) I immediately felt like I was about to eat an authentic pad Thai dish and boy was I right!!   The level of spiciness was perfect for being a mild spicy pad Thai dish. The choice of ingredients were very similar to the ones I tried in Thailand. The Thai iced tea was delicious and the quality of service was extremely good, I couldn't have been more satisfied. As I was enjoying my pad Thai dish I was offered a curry puff appetizer to taste for being a first time customer which was delicious and a really nice gesture.   I would highly recommend Aroy Thai restaurant to anyone who is looking for authentic Thai food and Thai hospitality in the Matthews area. Try their curry puffs and shrimp shumai appetizers for starters, followed by Pad See Ew or their famous Pad Thai dish for an entrée accompanied by a delicious Thai tea. I hope everyone has the same enjoyable experience I had while eating at this restaurant. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open because of its location, I'm even more excited about how delicious the food is! I got the red curry and my husband got the green curry, both so flavorful! I will be frequently visiting this place!"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant.  Super neat and clean inside with cute decor.  It's nice to have a close Thai spot on East Charlotte located off the hwy.  Super friendly staff.  I loved the egg roll sauce which seemed like sheds of pineapple were in it.  The egg rolls were price but you get four for $5 and change.  That's starting to be the norm.  I hope they'll offer fresh spring rolls in the near future.  The chicken pad Thai was like any other Thai spot.  The spice was close to the crushed peanut side which snuck up on me although I ordered mild."}
{"text":"Someone bought me take out from here for lunch it's was really good I had the chicken pad Thai and two potstickers came with it I was pleasantly surprised at how much they give you and everything tasted hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Nice to have a Thai restaurant in East Charlotte. Love the place. Didn't get 5 stars because not all we ordered were perfect. It gets a 4.9   You pick where you want to sit. Someone gives you a menu and tells you how the place work. Once you know what you want, you go to the counter and place your order and pay. They bring out the food in to-go containers. Once you finish, you clear your own table.  Curry puff is a yellow curry veggie filling in a wonton skin, it's fried and comes with a sweet/tangy dipping sauce. Very good. Very original.  Papaya salad was has a tany, sweet and spicy sauce mixed with shredded crunchy green papaya,tomato and peanut. I liked it, husband thought it would be better if less sweet.  Tom yum soup was not to my husband liking. He felt it lacked flavor.  Panang curry is my favorite type of curry, it's the most flavorful out of all curry. A very subtle peanut note. Very good. Had plenty of sauce to take home and mix with rice for lunch.  Pad Thai noodle was the right balance between salt, spicy, tangy, and sweet. Noodle were cooked just right, al dente.   Fried donuts come with a condensed milk sauce. Who knew you can take biscuits, deep fry it and it come out great. I inhaled it in 5 minuets.  Recommend this place. Will come back soon. The young couples are very friendly and great service."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, I ordered to go for my lunch break. I loved how nice they were, the food was very tasty and a good portion for the lunch menu. Also included two pot stickers. I would definitely be back to try some other items I had the pad Thai ."}
{"text":"Sweet service and spicy food! A small group from my office decided to check out Aroy on Friday afternoon for lunch. We were greeted by the sweetest hostess who immediately pushed two tables together for our party of five and brought us menus, explaining that you order at the front counter and then they bring the food to you. The restaurant itself is really cozy. It almost feels like a country-style, home cooking place rather than a Thai restaurant, but no complaints about that here!   For lunch, I went with the Totally Red Curry, medium spicy, with chicken and added veggies for $1 more. The lunch portion is huge and comes with two pork gyoza and white rice. (All for $12 WITH tip, y'all. Such a great deal!) The medium spice level was perfect for me! It had some heat but also didn't burn my face off. They have five levels from no spice on one end to Thai spicy on the other. Not going to lie, Thai spicy terrifies me.    Every one else in my group ordered the Pad Thai with various takes on the protein and spice level. Each variety looked delicious. I may try the tofu next time! One particularly kind friend shared a bit of her Thai Iced Tea with me. Holy cow, y'all! Hook me up to an IV and just pump that stuff into me 24-7. It is like crack! Sweet and creamy but with a fresh, light tea flavor at the same time. I'm hooked!   After our meal, the lovely hostess was kind enough to bring us a complementary dessert of fried dough and a condensed milk dipping sauce. It was the perfect sweet ending to the meal, cooling down my mouth which was a little tingly from my medium spice curry at that point.   We are excited to have Aroy so close by our East. Charlotte office! When you work off Idlewild Road, you sort of resign yourself to being in a good restaurant desert. However, with the addition of Cooking Pot and now Aroy Thai, things have been looking up for our little neighborhood recently!"}
{"text":"Stopped by at this joint this eve and tried their penang curry. I was very skeptical about the food initially, but to my surprise, the food was amazing! The owners are very likeable and friendly people, also very hospitable and welcoming. They also gave us complementary curry puffs and aroy thai dessert and both were delicious! The quantity and the price are great too. Will definitely go back for the flavourful penang curry again! Happy tummy, happy me!"}
{"text":"So excited that a Thai restaurant opened close by! Very pleasantly surprised! Interior of the restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Ordered the ultimate garlic with pork and kapow fried rice with chicken. Both very flavorful and filled with fresh veggies. Got to sample one of the crab Rangoon appetizer and even though not a fan of cream cheese, it was pretty dang good. Hope this place sticks around!!"}
{"text":"Yay!! A Thai restaurant on the east side! My husband and I just went here for dinner and had a great little date night. We ordered pork dumplings (fried), pad Thai, and green curry. The owners offered to let us try the curry puffs as well. Everything was delicious! In addition to the food being great, the owners here made the experience 5 Star. They make you feel welcome and right at home and you can tell they are genuinely excited to be a part of the Eastland community. Go check this place out and let's all make sure they grow and are here to stay!"}
{"text":"First off, the owners of this restaurant are so friendly and welcoming! The interior of the restaurant is so modern, cozy and clean. The menu names are so appealing that I will definitely have to try them all soon. I love how they cater the spice level to your taste and the portions are really good for the price. The crab rangoons were really delicious~ aroy! The tom yum was the best I've ever had and their curry was unique to their own. Definitely will come again! Come here and you will leave with a happy stomach!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Thai food with the friendliest owners! I got the pad Thai and my husband got the basil chicken and steamed dumplings for an app. All so good! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Two days after writing my review and I already need to update so I can add some more fun facts and tid-bits.   Yet another fabulous strip mall gem on Independence Boulevard. This one is tucked away in the Independence Promenade shopping center (other businesses here include The Red Door, Crazy Horse, Neck Breakers, and Hispanic grocery superstore Supermercado La Unica).  Originally, they were just going to open a take out spot. They wanted to provide people with affordable, quality food. When they saw that the space was bigger than they had thought, they decided to add dining. They've decorated really well. It's cute and cozy. You feel like you're eating at someone's house. It still has the take-out feel. You order and pay at the counter, then your food is brought out to your table.  Your food is served on disposable plates.  There are lunch specials every day from 11am-3pm, $7.95-$9.95 depending on your protein. Each come with two pieces of gyoza. The Totally Red Curry is their best seller. I've tried the Pad Thai with chicken, Ginger & Bell with shrimp, Sweet & Sour shrimp, and the Tom Kha Kai soup (comfort in a bowl). Appetizer-wise, the curry puffs are delicious. Even if you don't like curry, you'll like this. It's not a lot of curry, so it doesn't hit you in the face. The thai iced tea is dangerous (I say that because I could easily drink a gallon of it). Note: you can order pickup online on their website. There is also Doordash delivery for a limited area.   The owners are so sweet. You'll usually find Meghan behind the counter. My first visit, she fully explained the menu, walked us through the process of ordering and dining. Since it was our first time there, she brought us each a fried donut with a condensed milk dipping sauce. So good. My next visit, she remembered my first visit, even down to where we were sitting and what my lunch companion was wearing. Amazing.   Support this great local business!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai spot! I love that I can easily and quickly order food to-go on their website. The quantity and quality are always on-point, and they remember my husband and me every time we come in. I recently had my baby, and the next time I went in to pick up food, they had a little gift for him-how thoughtful!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Aroy Thai was marvelous. Terry and Meghan are very sweet and hospitable. I loved the shrimp Phai Thai. I get it every time. And the Thai tea is my favorite drink. I come here a lot and look forward to coming here more."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly service. A great local place to have. My wife said it felt like getting the food you hope for, when ordering Thai."}
{"text":"Green curry is delicious! Not a fan of the Thai tea, have had it much better other places. Food and service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Another favorite Thai restaurant in town. Pad Thai is tasty and delicious. We love the tom yum soup as well. All in all great food and service."}
{"text":"Great new casual Thai place! The food was outstanding, fresh and authentic. We had the Curry Puffs, Crab Rangoon, Papaya Salad and the Red Curry. Each dish was fresh with just the right amount of spice.   The owner was very nice and helpful! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so lucky to find this place in my Thai food search!  When I arrived I was greeted by a young friendly couple. I placed an order to go. As I waited the couple continued to chat with me. As I sat there I noticed the Decor was not traditional Thai however it was very modern/trendy with barn-wood on the walls!  It felt like it was designed by the team at Fixer-Upper on TV! Ha ha The place was very clean! I ordered red curry shrimp which definitely varies from restaurant to restaurant however it was perfect. The shrimp could've been a little larger but the spice was perfect! I also ordered the curry puffs which were perfectly deep fried! I wish this couple the best of luck with their new restaurant! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Charlotte about a year ago and began the search for a go to Thai place. We drove twenty minutes from our house to try out this place and we were not disappointed! We absolutely love Thai food and Aroy Thai served us the best Pad Thai we ever had. By far the best Thai place we tried here in Charlotte. Not only was the food amazing, the staff was so kind and attending and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute and modern. We will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"They need to get a soda machine and decide if they are going to be a take out restaurant or dine in. Ordering at the counter is ok but again are they dine in or take out.  Add for the food out wasn't that good. The pad thai was a pile of super spicy noodles (and we only got medium spice) with no flavor. The red curry, medium spicy was way too spicy a d the flavor levels just weren't there.   We won't be going back. Although the strip club could entice us back.  Haha just kidding that place is way too sketchy."}
{"text":"It's great to have a reasonably priced Thai restaurant in the Charlotte area. Aroy Thai is in a strip mall on Independence Boulevard. It's a very simple restaurant, small with a few tables but very serene atmosphere. The servers are so nice and helpful. I had the Pad Thai and the shrimp yellow curry and they were both really good. The portion sizes were huge. I'm looking forward to making this my new hangout for Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Very nice service looking to please and make sure you are enjoying your meal. The food is fresh and well prepared. They go beyond to make sure you have a great experience.   Come and enjoy you will agree."}
