{"text":"I stopped by here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend while visiting Canada. We were staying close by in Longueuil and were looking for anywhere we could eat dinner around 10pm. Several of the places around here were closing up, and someone was kind enough to let us know 1957 was open late. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a nice little terrace, like the name implies. It was nice out so we decided to sit outside. I wouldn't recommend sitting outside if smoke bothers you however. Lots of smokers in this city, and at times the smoke became a bit much.

I ordered the deluxe burger. It was your regular patty, lettuce, onion, tomato and bacon burger. The burgers come with fries and I believe you could substitute it for poutine if you wanted to. The burger tasted great. The bread was soft and the patty was well cooked and seasoned. The fries were delicious and not soggy. Nice and crispy just how I like them!

My boyfriend ordered an open faced sandwich. I had a bite and it was pretty tasty, but I liked my burger better.

Their beer selection wasn't too extensive, so I ended up ordering a Guinness with my meal.

My only complaint would be the service. Our server wasn't too enthusiastic, just wanted to do her job and get out of there it seems. I don't know if it was because we were there late, but there were other tables too. It's not like we were the only people keeping them there. After we finished our meals, we waited for our server for a long while. Then, another girl came and took our empty plates. Then we waited even more before our server decided to finally come back to check on us. I was getting annoyed, I just wanted to pay and head to the hotel.

More enthusiasm, girl! It'll get you better tips~~"}
