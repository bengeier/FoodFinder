{"text":"I used to work for a Music Company that was located very close to this Super Taste location. Which made it a terrific place to pick up a quick lunch. That was over 12 years ago, but Super Taste was right across the street in that Food Court. It was simply a very convenient place to pick up a quick order of chicken fried rice, or beef satay to go. The service was very fast, and they always gave you a LOT of food for your money!  Its helpful to know of a place like this."}
{"text":"This place is located in a kinda hole in the wall food court it is in the same food court as Mike's BBQ (4465 Sheppard Ave E.), not to be confused with East Court & Mike's BBQ located @ 4400 Sheppard Ave E Scarborough, ON M1S 5J5.  Don't expect great service here.  They even got our order incorrect the first time around.  For English speaking visitors, I would strongly recommend pointing to what exactly you want on their free take away menu.  We had ordered dish #37 (BBQ Pork and Mixed Vegetables w/Udon noodles) and the lady behind the counter interpreted dish #73 (beef brisket on rice)..which they prepared dish #73 and I informed them that it was wrong, and had to re-point it out on their take away menu.  Even with the snafu, the #37 dish was actually good, along with dish #15 Chef's Special fried Rice Noodle.  Good value for money paid to portion size received.  on a per head basis this would fall as a $ ($4.99 - $9.99).  I would recommend this place if you are on a lower budget for a single person eating or a couple.  Place isn't exactly great for super large groups since it is a food court after all.  For payments, this resto is CASH ONLY.  So plan ahead to stop at the atm before chowing down here."}
{"text":"Tucked in this Chinese strip mall is a small food court that only has 2 operating venues while 2 others have long closed; Mike BBQ House, and Super Taste Chinese Cuisine.  I came here for the $6.50 Bitter Melon with Beef on white rice which has been on my mind for a week now.  A small bowl of soup is included.  Finally, I get to come back here and to write about it...and the meal was already for pickup before I even finished posting this review.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to place for Cantonese cuisine in Scarborough.  The dishes are always consistent and the \"wok hay\" is great.  The portion sizes are generous (we usually get 2 dishes for our family of 4).  Our favorites are Beef and Soy Sauce Fried Rice Noodles and Salted Fish and Diced Chicken Fried Rice. You can call ahead to place your order if it's take-out. There is a minimalist but functional set up of chairs and table if you're dining in. Dishes are around the $4-5 range. Parking can be a bit of a battle as it is in a small plaza and shares the foodcourt with 2-3 other vendors.  Cash only."}
{"text":"It's been 6/7 years and although my family and I live 25 minutes away, our stomachs always find our way here a few times a month. Don't expect tablecloth and fine cutlery but you can expect great food."}
{"text":"Located inside a Chinese food court. Its a very sketchy looking plaza and the food court itself looks pretty sketchy too. Many stores in the plaza are closed down and the businesses that did survive are very questionable. Asian woman waiving a towel at me from an Asian spa just doesn't seem right. I looked back to see is she was signaling someone else but I was the only one there. I just smiled and kept on walking.   Anyway, I grabbed a satay beef with fried noodle for $5.50. Noodles didn't taste fresh. Good portions. Service was extremely fast. It took them no more than 5 minutes to prepare the dish. Food is decent at best but I would only come here if I need some quick food for cheap."}
{"text":"Love their fried fish with corn sauce and sun chicken! Been going there for 10 years +++"}
{"text":"Super Taste is  in the same food court as Gourmet Garden.  We always order the Dinner for Two for Lunch ($12.50). The portion is big, which we can share among 3 people. It comes with 2 soups and 2 steamed rice.  The chicken with fish sauce which it is famous for is always juicy and tender. And I love their stir fried bitter melon with beef too!  The prices are great for the quality and quantity of food!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a dish today...and it was just okay.....all the ingredients used were not fresh ...kind of disappointed."}
