{"text":"This is one of the best shawarmas I've had in the city, second only to Empire Shawarma. The seasoning on the chicken is incredible, they marinate the beef shawarma au jus until perfectly tender and their falafels are light and delicious.   Their dinner plates are great and they come with roasted potatoes, lentil rice and a little salad, plenty of food for just over 7 bucks.  The shawarma wraps are a little expensive for a shawarma (around 5) but are big, I can only eat one. The combination of tahini and spice with Le Gourmet's tender marinated chicken is unbeatable, they are saucy and delicious!  I haven't tried any, but they have a big display case full of gelato.  I usually opt for a baklava, which are fantastic here, but you should always warm baklava, so take it home and nuke it for 15 seconds, mmm.  The owner and his staff are all really nice and there's never much of a wait.  The location is a little out of the way, but if you are in the area, definitely try Le Gourmet, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I venture here a couple times a month, but crave it way more. The best falafel I have ever had, their vegetarian plate is amazing with a bottle of the Mango nectar they sell. During the warmer months they sell gelato and you can sit out in the back at this table and chill, eat read- all while in the quiet shade (some parts are nice and sunny though). Since I live close it's great for takeout for those long dreary study sessions. A little known fact unless you talk to the guys is that they make their own hummus and hot sauce (I always wondered why it was sooo yummy). If your coming from out of the neighbourhood by subway, its right beside the station!"}
{"text":"Quite simply, the worst chicken  shawarma in pita  that I have ever had. The sandwich was dripping wet and the chicken was either  badly over marinated to the extreme or decomposing to the point of turning into mush. I pointed this out to the owner who showed me where he had taken the meat from (NOT from the rotating skewer, but rather from a plastic bucket). My guess is that this \"leftover\" chicken had sat in this bucket from closing time Saturday until Monday lunch time (they are closed on Sundays). He offered to take off 1/2 the price of the sandwich. I paid him and left. I will not be back. No restaurant owner should ever serve \"food\" like this to any customers; better to throw it out."}
