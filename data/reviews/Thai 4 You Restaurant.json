{"text":"It seems nobody can remember the name of this place, so let's just call it Indian Road Thai.  Indian Road Thai wins: Fast and friendly service Cheap - About $8 a meal Plenty of vegetarian options - I recommend asparagus/mushroom or spicy bean curd Great for groups - always plenty of space  Indian Road Thai Losses: Spring rolls - skip 'em Tom Yum Soup - kind of small Overall quality of food is just average - nothing spectacular.   OVERALL I'd say this is a great option for a weeknight meal - very fast, nice and fresh-tasting, and inexpensive."}
{"text":"**Drove by Thai 4 You last night and realized that it's now called My Thai Kitchen. Review still applies.  Thai 4 You, despite its somewhat lame-o name, is actually one of my favourite Thai places in town. It seems that they've recently changed management or chefs and the food has suffered a little bit regardless it's still good and seems very authentic. It's fair to say that some of the food can be a little bit inconsistent. One of my favourite dishes that is always great is the Panang Gai(chicken red curry.) I also enjoy the little plate of crunchy shrimp chips and peanut sauce that is offered to all tables as a pre-appetizer. The servers/cooks are actually Thai and until recently wore traditional thai dresses/jackets. It was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Go here a lot.  it's always empty and I expect it will close soon (but have been thinking that for about 9 months).  not a huge difference between the best and worst thai - this is slightly better than average...and like @michelleanne says... it's on the cheap!  (one time took a group of 11 out for dinner and the whole bill was $140)."}
{"text":"This one has had a few different names - wasn't it Thai One on? Or maybe the Thai?  Never seems to be busy and it deserves more attention than many of the more popular and highly mediocre Thai places in the city (and neighbourhood). Meals are affordable and unchallenging - recognizable as Thai but not trying to impress anyone with authenticity or adventurousness. Service is always pleasant and efficient. A nice selection of Asian beers in the bar. You could bring your kids here without fear they won't want to eat or they will offend the sensibilities of other patrons. I think take out and delivery business is brisk."}
