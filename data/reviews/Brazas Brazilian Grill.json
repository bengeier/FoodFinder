{"text":"I don't recommend this restaurant. I paid 28 dollars for dinner buffet but they had only 4 kinds of meats and the tastes were bad. I don't think they are worth 28 dollars! I'd rather go to golden corral! At least they are cheap!"}
{"text":"I was one of the party of 11 that went with another reviewer. I agree whole heartedly with the experience related by him. Rude waiter (clinton as noted in other reviews) SLOW service. I think they had 2 guys getting meat at a time. 5-10 minutes between skewers of which they would give a slice in the same amount as a slice of ham from a package for sandwiches in a grocery store. A slice from that package. Seriously, we got some alligator (after requesting it) and the size was like popcorn chicken from KFC, and I got 2 pieces.  For a 400+ plus bill, this was a very bad experience. 

Only thing good that night was the garlic beef and the bar (yesterdays, next door, not related to this place)  that saved the night for our group."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here the other day, and was very impressed.  Tons of great food, unique atmosphere, over the top service.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We only decided on Brazas instead of Chima because we got a deal from Groupon. We thought this would be a good way to try a Brazilian Restaurant with some savings. We would have been much better off going to an upscale steakhouse. This was complete buyer's remorse. We hoped for an experience but there was none, at all. 

The server was weird, kind of off putting. The girls who filled our glasses and picked up our dishes were nicer. They came with meat often and it was kind of annoying because we could barely have a conversation or get up to go to the bar. It is not like there was anything on the bar though, the salad was awful, I didn't even have any. The best food I ate the whole night came from the Indian bar, which was sad because that whole side was empty. 

The sangria was not good. The meat was fatty. The only thing everyone loved a lot was the grilled pineapple, which I was still not impressed by. For the price I think there should have been some dessert on the bar which may have salvaged the night. Everyone there had a groupon, and I don't think anyone there will go back. 

We were hoping to at least get an experience, but was extremely disappointed ."}
{"text":"Well my boyfriend and I tried Brazas tonight for the first time.  We usually go to Chima, but as another person mentioned we got a great deal from Groupon so we said \"Why not?  First of all when we arrived there was no one else in there and we had to wait for a table.  Secondly, the side dish options were terrible and they had the nerve to be cold! Once we got over that, the server began to come around with various meats for us to sample.  And I mean \"sample\".  The portion size was ridiculous.  They gave us each a small piece of meat, which was very dry, no flavor or seasoning and over cooked which were all  just a far cry from our experience at Chima.  I would not recommend you spend your money and not be satisfied!  Oh, and on our way out, since I purchased two coupons and we only used one, I generously gave our other coupon to a couple sitting near our table because we knew we would NEVER go back!!"}
{"text":"Every thing was good the only problem I had was the flank was not up to par, sad thing they will be closing end of the month"}
{"text":"Took my wife there for Valentines day, and was fairly disappointed. I have visited other Brazilian steakhouses before so I had an idea of what to expect, unfortunately this place did not meet my expectations.

The food was fairly good, the bacon wrapped scallops were terrific. They are also attached to an Indian Restaurant, so you are able to sample from the Indian food, which was pretty good.

The service and selection was the disappointing part. They only brought out like 4 or 5 types of meat to try, and the selection on the hot bar was pretty thin.

Next time I will go to Chima..."}
{"text":"OK, if you read all the other review sites out there, people either hate this place or have a blanket answer of how good the food was and the great atmosphere (Sounds like someone putting false reviews in my book.) The food is low quality, over cooked, and/or tastless. The price for a party of 2 was over $75, hows that for a fixed price? The unique atmosphere, that's children's paintings of Brazil on the wall. They go well with the dirty ceiling and rotting wood floor. (Check the bar for the last part)  The service was good and the people where attentive, but there was 3 couples there at 7pm on a Friday. So you look at my profile and see one review, that should tell you something. I spent my time to find this site, sign up for and account, verify it through and email, and right this flaming review. You probably shouldn't take my word for it."}
{"text":"Brazas is closed due to the upcoming expansion of Indpendence Blvd."}
{"text":"Now, I normally Yelp before I go to a new place, but this place was HIGHLY recommended by some friends of mine, so I went out on blind faith.   Previous reviews aside, my experience was NOTHING like theirs!  The place was packed (on a Friday night, Christmas Eve) and the ambiance was very nice!

Our servers couldn't have had better table-side manners and the meat was good!  Everything I had was hot, fresh, juicy and cooked to heaven!  Roasted meat on a stick brings out the primal nature in me and I would consider myself a well-to-do Southern (California) Belle!  I rolled up my sleeves and duked it out with the best of them!  I even tried a piece of alligator, and yes, it tastes like chicken (which now begs the question: WHAT EXACTLY DOES CHICKEN TASTE LIKE IF EVERY F'N THING TASTES LIKE IT?!).  Lastly, what I most appreciated was the rotisserie pineapple....*drool* covered in butter, cinnamon and sugary deliciousness.  According to the servers, it's served last so the acids from the fruit help with the digestion of the heavy meats.  Whatever, it was F'N YUMMY!!

Honestly, I've been to better Brazilian BBQ spots, but none of them are in the state (Um, Fago de Chao is on my wish list thank-you-very-much).  It was a bit on the pricey side, but considering it was all-you-can-nom meat, meat, and more meat (and a salad bar blah, blah, blah), I feel it was worth it.  I'll definitely have to do some more recon on this place and see how it goes."}
