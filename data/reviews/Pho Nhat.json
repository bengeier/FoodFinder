{"text":"This is hands down the best pho place in the valley. I have been to a lot of pho places here, but this is the one I've been going to for over 10 years, and will continue going to for as long as they're still slinging the pho. They have the clearest, cleanest broth. Not a speck of fat, which can turn you off a bowl of pho midway through. Some of my white friends (and my white husband) complain about the atmosphere (or lack thereof) and quite honestly they complain about the dubious cleanliness too. But, if you know Vietnamese restaurants, and authentic Asian restaurants in general, then this is no surprise for you. Sure, the old Taco Bell ambience leaves a little to be desired, but damn - that's good pho. Also, considering that half of the cleaner looking pho places these same friends enjoy have been shut down for health code violations, and this place proudly displays their gold stickers on the wall, I feel pretty safe here. The husband and wife team are quiet, but always super nice. Also, try their bbq pork spring rolls. So good."}
{"text":"This place has the best pho in my opinion in the entire valley. During the school year, I eat here at least twice a week. The soup is always consistent and has tons of flavor without adding too much msg. If you are looking for good authentic pho, this is the place for you. The building is not the most eye catching in the world, but I can look past that as long as the food makes up for it which it absolutely does. Been coming here consistently for a year and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Oh, and also plan on using the bathroom before coming here as they don't have a restroom inside their building for costumer use."}
{"text":"Has the best Pho in the valley have been to many but they do not compare at all to this place. The people are super friendly nice and food comes to you fast. We used to come all the time but now that my honey has left asu we don't get to go as often as I would like but we try as much as possible. They have wonderful rice as well and their noodles are terrific too!"}
{"text":"First, let's be clear. The Mickey Mouse mural came with the restaurant (it was on the wall before Pho Nhat moved in). OK, now that THAT is out of the way...

#42, how I love you! I love you for your barbecued beef, shrimp, and eggroll all lovingly plopped onto a giant bed of vermicelli noodles with leafy greens beneath! I cannot help but adore your fish sauce, and I will keep coming back for more. I shall not stray from you, #42. You are the only one for me.

Update: The last time I went here, the staff didn't seem very happy to have my (and my friend's) business. Maybe I will try some other pho. It's a bit sad that they haven't upgraded anything in this place either. You would think that a bit of paint wouldn't cost TOO terribly much?"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? Best Pho in town by far. I have been in this place to eat lots of time. The owner told me that I am one of the few that has eat at least every dish on their menus. She, the owner, is pretty smart, she pretty much knows what you want when you walk into the restaurant. But she told me I am one of the few exception because I tends to get a different things when I am in there. I often eat at Pho Nhat 3 or 4 times a week because it is that good. They just don't serve Pho alone, they also have \"bun\" rice dishes and specialties. My favorite dishes over there is the Lemon grass chicken and the Nhat House Fried rice.  Their Pho is extremely good too. If you want to eat Pho, Bun, or Rice this is the place for you. Also, their Thai Ice tea is the best!!! Don't believe me, come and try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"My son, an student athlete at the college across the street, chooses to eat here twice a week.  Sometimes orders two bowls of pho -- they are that good!!!  Healthy, authentic and fairly priced.  Consistently a great experience."}
{"text":"Hello comfort food! I have been eating here for years and have always left happy :) 
 
This is one of those restaurants where you can close your eyes and pick something!- everything is amazing! 
The prices are also extremely reasonable-especially for the fairly large portions.
The family that owns this shop is also very sweet- and for the whole place being operated by two people, the wait is never very long- even during dinner rush!"}
{"text":"The Mickey Mouse mural is gone now.  

The spring rolls are fabulous and the Vermicelli noodle dish is a favorite.

I go regularly and ALWAYS get speedy friendly service."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado, almost three years ago. But for what it's worth, this is the best, most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far. =)"}
{"text":"Having never tried Vietnamese food before, I really had no idea what to except when my sister brought me here for lunch one day. She pointed out what she usually orders and I stuck close to it. I believe mine was #40 - the rice vermicelli noodles with BBQ beef and Eggrolls. It was delish and tasted considerably light for a noodle dish! My sister had the same thing, but with pork (I want to say #34 maybe). I would highly recommended both of them. And oh my gosh, the Thai tea with tapioca was the best I've tried anywhere. I would definitely come back for the same meal!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho but the Bun dishes looked a little sad. Prices are really good and service is fast.

Pho Nhat is perfect for a quick lunch but don't confuse it with other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley that specialize in really flavorful food and cool decor."}
{"text":"As the name implies, getting Pho here is what the majority do. I have tried their pho and it taste great. You can tell that they spent long time developing secret recipe of the soup. I would recommend all kind of pho here and you would not feel regret !! 

This place is average when it comes to the other dish than pho or soup base. I would say it's not their speciality but it won't hurt to try. However, I would at least try their pho!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. ...However the service is not and the owner never shows customer service instead he makes you feel like you're an inconvenience to him"}
{"text":"Having eating my mothers and grandmothers homemade, authentic pho my entire life, its hard to beat theirs. Being away at college, I was in dire need to find a place to fill the void and Pho Nhat did the trick! For years I visited their restaurant and would never go anywhere else. Having lived around the country as well, this remains my favorite after all this time. 

Their spring rolls, meatball and beef pho AND fried rice are my go-to's but I can certain anything you order will not disappoint! Service is quick and friendly and great prices!"}
{"text":"Don't bother stopping here. Don't think that their food is less pricey just because the place look like a run down. I can cook better than this, and I'm not even Vietnamese. Unclean-looking, no public restroom. Dishes unwashed. Too bad the place I usually go to is closed on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This place has the best pho in town, and possibly (probably) the state.  I've been coming here for ten years now, and I still cannot get enough of this man's pho.  The spring roles, eggs roles, fried rice plates, vermicelli, thai tea, Vietnamese coffee, and boba are all so good you won't help but come back for more.  This restaurant is a very lowkey diamond in the rough, but the food is so worth it.  Every friend and family member I have brought here falls in love and returns frequently.   If you haven't been here, you are missing out on some REALLY good pho."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place probably 1,000 times and never knew it was there. The first thing I noticed is the dining area... it's pretty small, but I'm here for the food not the size of the dining room :). I ordered the Pho Ga (Pho with chicken) and it was pretty good. The price was 5.50 for a pretty big bowl of pho. Overall all it was pretty good but it didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! What everyone else says... Hole in the wall but delicious pho and great service! Good experience every time, dine-in or takeout! Definitely my favorite Pho place close to home! (I like Noodles Ranch but they're a bit of a drive.) It's often late by the time I can place my to-go order, like 8:45pm, 15 minutes before they close. But the owner (I'm guessing he's the owner because he's always there) always answers the phone and my pho with rare beef is always ready and waiting, steaming hot, when I arrive just before, or right at, 9pm. Also, my friends and I have gone here after work and one time we were there until almost 9:30pm before realizing there was no one left around us and maybe we should see what time they close. The owner never even said anything or tried to kick us out!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years. Its a go-to for MCC students, and I would often go out of my way to eat here even after leaving college.

The owner is a serious man but very nice and always says hello to us. The restaurant itself is a pretty old building; it more of a hole-in-the-wall kind of joint. Its very simple. incredibly clean and well-kept. Small, but cozy and at-home. We would often still be wearing pajamas on the weekends in winter when we came in for a nice hot bowl of soup.

The portions are more than generous, service is quick, prices are fair, the food amazing. I always get the combination brisket Pho with meatballs and flank steak. My brother always gets the roast beef. His Girlfriend the Chicken Pho. Everything is oh so good.

Stop by for lunch some time, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been to pretty much all the Pho spots in the valley and this spot is authentic. As for customer service, I really enjoy having my order taken and not being bothered while I enjoy my dinner HOT. Affordable, delicious and the broth is aaaamaazzziiiinnngggg."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, who introduced me to Vietnamese food, brought me here for the first time about 4 months ago.  It is not convenient to where we live, but it is worth the drive.  I order the #39 and he gets the #4.  The owner knows what we both order and its always delivered quickly.  Their Thai Iced Tea is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered Togo for the first time and the pho was disgusting. I had to throw it out. Very disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"This was the worst place ever! We walked in one door saw a COCKROACH that was big enough to pull a wagon! And walked out the other door! That only means it must be a dirty place!!! Never go there again"}
{"text":"This place gets high marks for value!  I can take my girlfriend and we can both get full off $12-15 with tip.  The place is run by a husband and wife pair who are always there.  This place is no frills dinning, which is fine by me.  My girlfriend and I love the spring rolls and the noodle dishes with whatever meat we are feeling like that day.  This stays in the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Was in Arizona this past week and hit up Pho Nhat.. still AWESOME.. The #17 is the best.. can't wait to go back in a few months."}
{"text":"Great Pho I  would recommend the #7 and with the prices so low you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"By far the best Pho in Mesa! It's a family operated and owned business, the prices are also very reasonable. You definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This spot was recommended by my Vietnamese nail gal and it delivered. VERY authentic, reminds me of the little downtown L.A. Asian gems you may eat at. Really hearty portions, bathrooms are in the back and yes it smells like pee but at least they were fairly clean! The spring rolls have shrimp as well as pork in them unless you tell them otherwise. Will return to try more items but this is the place for PHO!"}
{"text":"My place to go for comfort food. 

I have never had a bowl of Pho here that wasn't excellent. I used to live in an apartment complex just behind the Pho Nhat. I was a student at MCC and didn't have much money, but I could afford to eat here once a week. It was five minute walk and a bright spot in a hum drum diet. Everything I've tried on the menu has been delicious. 

The staff is a staff of two and sometimes things can be slow, but, it's well worth the wait. Despite this, the food is frequently out faster than I expected. This is one of my goto's when I suggest places for friends."}
{"text":"Being new to pho and my friend having it before, we decided to try this place. It's right across Southern from MCC where we go. Don't expect to be impressed by looks in this place, it's outdated and no-frills. Saying that, the food is uh-mazing! I had wonton with egg noodles pho and it was delish. The portions are huge, you get a ginormous bowl with a plate of side items you can put into the pho if you like. Everything is fresh and is quick. 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yesterday for lunch, a few coworkers and I went to Pho Nhat. It was my first time there, however my coworkers had previously gone on several occasions and raved about the pho. Since it had been quite some time since I had pho, I was looking forward to the experience. Perhaps it was simply a case of mis-aligned expectations, but I expected more in light of my coworkers opinion of the food. The portions are generous and inexpensive, yet the taste was bland, even by pho standards."}
{"text":"I ordered pho soup and it's funny that they served me sliced lemons that were used up by someone else, it gets more interesting when the guy next to me gets used napkins in his soup! Ha! The owner said sorry and that was it and didn't care and walked away! :)"}
{"text":"Alright.  To begin, the place only had one customer when we walked in so it wasn't very busy obviously.  That's fine.  The person who waited on us didn't even say hello or smile.  He actually looked bored.  We ordered #9, #26, and #74 plus some lemonades.  I had read on Yelp that this place has the best Pho in Mesa.  

That's a lie!  I have had better Pho in Washington state.  The broth was greasy and just above warm.  There was plenty of side condiments especially bean sprouts, which I love.  However, I had to add Sriracha and Hoisin sauce to lift the flavor up and out of its doldrums.  My son ate egg noodles with shrimp which he liked pretty well.  He ate most of it, and my other son had Chicken Fried Rice.  The chicken was overcooked and dry, but my son seemed to like it because it had egg in it.  

The prices were very reasonable which is the ONLY reason this place got a 3, otherwise it would have gotten a 2.  Poor customer service and they need to work and getting that broth really hot.

I don't think I'll be back.  

Disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese food in Phoenix.  I'm Vietnamese and this food is \"almost\" as good as Mom makes. Except for the Pho, the Pho is a lot better than Mom made. It was better for us to go to a Vietnamese restaurant and eat Pho. I also grew up in Hawaii where there was this particular restaurant in Chinatown that always had a line outside because the Pho was so good and this place can stand up to that restaurant. As far as the other menu items, you can't go wrong with any of them. The rice or noodle dishes to the Bun BO Hue. This restaurant is where I go for comfort food."}
{"text":"Write hard to believe this restaurant is in any way related to the nhat on southern, this must be the redheaded stepchild of the two. No matter, you should go to the nhat on southern and have them cook for you. They have the best pho in phoenix guarans brah"}
{"text":"Pho is good and authentic here. You come here for the food. If you're looking for wait service, this is not the place for you. For me, the pho more than justifies the lack of service. Pork chop with rice isn't the best here, but broth for their pho is one of a kind. It doesn't taste like all the other generic broths where they add a ton of msg in it. Egg rolls aren't bad either but definitely try the pho before anything else."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I tried once before and I thought it might be a fluke. Went back today and the service was even worse. 

I walked in and sat down at the only available table. The waitress dropped off the menu without ever looking at me. When she walked-by 5 minutes later, I tried to flag her down and she literally looked the other way. It was 5 more minutes before she returned to take my order...the #17 chicken and Pho, plus an ice tea. I wasn't happy to wait 10 minutes just to place an order, but I let that slide.

A couple minutes later she returned to tell me to switch to another table in the back corner. I thought that was a bit rude to inconvenience a customer like that, but again I let it slide. I complied with her request. 

Unfortunately, I didn't realize that she had asked me to move to an unclean table. There were spills all over the table. I wiped the spilled Pho and hot sauce down with napkins. When the waitress brought me an ice water and hot tea (not what I had ordered) a few minutes later, she never bothered to clean up the mess.

Eventually, my Pho was dropped off at my table. The waitress never made eye contact and scurried away before I could ask for anything. The bean sprouts looked like they hadn't been washed (still some caked-on soil). When I went to grab a soup spoon from the stack on the table, they were filthy and covered in oil and dust. I seriously don't know how the place manages to pass health inspections.

The waitress never did come back to my table to offer me a refill or to ask how the meal was (and of course never came to clean up the table).

Needless to say, I didn't give a tip (I don't even think I should have been charged for the horrible meal experience)."}
{"text":"I picked up some food and by the time I got home it was cold.
I eat a lot of Vietnamese food, but this was really bad.
I wondered why it looked close on the outside, and I was the only customer. Now I know why."}
{"text":"Will be sure to return again. I worried at first but would have regretted not going after having a great meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I'm working and need pho fast! The prices are good, the flavor is good, and the service is good. I've tried better pho, but since this is one of the places close to my work, unless I want to wait 2 hours to get my pho even thought I ordered over the phone, I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Pho: good with chicken that was perfectly cooked. Skip the fried rice. Spring rolls were ok. Service was slow and not welcoming. Outdoor access restroom needs a thorough cleaning. Decent Vietnamese food if you're willing to overlook the not so clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE NOR USE YOUR CREDIT CARD AS METHOD OF PAYMENT!!!
Customer service is extremely poor. Not only is the waitress rude and disrespectful, but her demeanor was very offensive. We are paying customers, but she treated as if we were intruding beggars! On top of all, she helped herself by self tipping an additional amount on the credit card slip!!! Spare yourself the experience of shoddy dine-in service and wasting valuable time disputing an unauthorized amount with your bank."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for awhile since I moved to central Phoenix and either my taste buds got more discriminating or I got used to the pho restaurants in 
Phoenix. I ordered pho tai: the soup tasted salty, lacked depth I.e. sweetness, cloves, something..and the beef in the soup was tough, overcooked, and bland! I also got the barbecue spring rolls but it was small, thin, and also tasted salty without the sweet kick.  I also got Vietnamese coffee but it came \"ready-mixed\" in a plastic cup with ice and not in the \"fun to mix little coffee canister\" that most Vietnamese restaurants give you. I give only one star for the food and I'll stick to Da Vang restaurant on 19th Ave."}
{"text":"I walked in and i sat at the table for 10 mins. No one came to serve me so I went to the counter to try to talk someone. There was a cook and another man. I tried to get their attention but they just ignored me. So i left the place, after being angered. On top of that, the place isn't exactly clean either!"}
{"text":"It was mine and my boyfriend's first time in. We love Pho and just wanted to try a new place. The Establishment is a bit smaller and the decor could really use a pick-me-up to make the place feel a little more warm and welcoming. As for the pho, it was phenomenal. My boyfriend got the Super Bowl combination pho and I got the wonton pho. The broth was extremely tasty, all the meat in his combination Bowl was nice and tender. He got the Super Bowl which is about 25 to 30% more pho for an additional $0.50. Well worth it to feed his appetite. My wonton were good, but I've never had it before so I don't have anything to compare it to. The prices were very reasonable. We left full and happy customers. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My family and I are looking for an excellent Vietnamese place last Dec 19th for my son's birthday since he has been craving for Pho.  I picked this place due to the good reviews.  Boy, was I wrong!  The entire family was disappointed with the food.  They are definitely cheap -- you do get what you paid for.  Place is old, greasy floors and looks very small.  

My husband and I order the bbq pork combo and the well done pho with tendons.  The meat on the pho was extremely dry and there were barely any tendons.  The soup base was ok.  The bbq pork was dry as well, the egg thingy that came with the combo was bland and the eggroll was too oily and bland as well.  The guy also came out to tell us that they ran out of rice -- we were shocked!  OMG! This is an Asian restaurant and rice is part of their meals, why would they ran out of rice at 7pm??  The other people that came after us had rice on their plates except for us.  They also got their food first before we got ours!!!  We also got the shrimp rolls which were dry as well and the peanut sauce was bland.

My family are definitely not coming back here for sure!!  Very disappointed considering it has good reviews from other yelpers.  I guess some people opts for quantity rather than quality.  Such a horrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"Orderred for a pick up on a Thursday night. Although with just 2 people working, theyy managed to prepare the food on time for me. 4-Star because I orderred the \"Com Dac Biet Nhat\" and \"Com Ga Xao Ot.\" They were OK... Not an authentic Vietnamese taste, but ok. Have not tried their Pho yet!"}
{"text":"This place only has one choice for vegetarians- the vegetable pho. But, in this case you only need one choice, because why on earth would you ever order anything else when this is the most delicious dish you could possible get?! Seriously, the pho is so good! 
This place is in an old Taco Bell restaurant, very relaxed setting for casual dining."}
{"text":"(OWNER KEEPS TIPS FROM HELPER(ACTUALLY WAITERS)!!) Hi fellow yelpers and any potential customers of Pho Nhat. I used to work as a server for three hours a night Monday through Friday. The food is good but the cooks are unsanitary and the owners keep all the tips. They reuse the basil, cilantro, sliced limes, and sliced jalapenos that were served to other customers that they did not finish. I don't mean just the plates that were never touched but anything left over after the customer is done. I found this very unsettling and now after working a few weeks and getting let go for accepting tips from customers I feel like I need to say this. They hired me as a helper and told me that I cannot take tips from tables. But, the manager known as \"Happy\" had me waiting tables, serving, cleaning, and prepping. The only thing I did not do was handle cash. She only would help me with one or two tables a night. If their was a cash tip then I would have to leave it on the counter for the owner. I was not allowed to keep the tips that people would physically give me while I was clearing off the table. The one that keeps the tips are the \"house\" basically the restaurant keeps all tips. When they hired me they told me that I will just be assisting his wife with clearing the tables and cleaning and that people just order and leaver quickly and don't tip so it would not make sense for me to get paid in tips, but I was soon doing everything and she was just cooking with three helpers in the back. 

I remember one incident where I had to serve 9 people on a table including prepping the food, take their order, and serve them food and drink for about an hour all by myself along with other customers coming and going. The owner's wife's sister came out to help only when it was time to clean up because they left tips on the table. She took the tips and along with some empty cups and that is all she helped with. So after a few days of thinking about that incident and people telling that I should take the tips left on tables and the tips that were handed to me. Then after adopting what people told me to do and what I felt was the right thing to do I did. 

I was then let go by the owner because his wife \"Happy\" called him and told him that I was taking the tips. Then he fired over the phone after I told him that I am the one serving and seeing the customers at the tables and therefore it is legal for me keep the tips that were given to me even though I was getting paid min wage. He also told me that he could fire me for whatever reason he wanted to and that I can leave for any reason after telling him that are you firing me for accepting tips that were given to me by customers. 

I am making this post two days after. I just want the people to know that Happy and her sister have the flu and are continuing to cook for customers along with many horrific sanitary conditions in the back and that the the people you think you are tipping are not getting the tips, it is all going to the owner who if you look it up on the internet is making an estimated $165 thousand plus in revenue and they still need tips.

Thank you if you got this far and hope that you let others know about what this restaurant is doing to their employees and customers."}
{"text":"The food was really great.  This place was busy and the poor owner needed help!  The Thai tea was really tasty."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with bomb pho. This place is a hole in the wall little family restaurant. The pho is really good-- nice portions, cheap price, and savory broth. 

Sometimes the service is slow since it's just one guy serving and one lady in the back cooking, but they make up for that with how delicious the pho is. Not to mention their spring rolls which are way better and bigger than some at other pho places like da vang and pho thanh."}

That said, there is nothing attractive about the atmosphere or the staff.  They can hardly be said to be friendly, and the place has an almost septic feel.  Either way, everyone I've brought there has loved the food, so the atmosphere probably shouldn't factor in.  

Great for lunch."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have ever had. The coconut is really good too. I get the same thing every time and it's very consistent and Very good!"}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on an off day. Pho broth was bland and so light that I wondered if it was chicken broth. Generous with lime wedges but only one sprig of basil. My takeout order lacked the little condiment container of hoisin and sriracha that other places include. Beef was fresh, but I think I'll try some other pho places in the area next."}

{"text":"Was craving Vietnamese food and still on the hunt for the best Viet food in the Tempe ish area... The place we used to go to closed down...and I've been getting my Viet food fix in Tucson... So decided to try this place.

The parking lot was empty when we got there... Not a very good sign... But after we came in a couple more people went in after us.

The place wasn't dirty but you can tell that it wasn't super clean either.. I was honestly a little nervous trying this place but I wanted to find a good spot to go to when I crave pho...

I got the number 20... It was delicious! 

Pho with well done beef slices and tripe and tendon!
The soup was a little greasy but the taste of it was so good..

My man got a rice plate... And I gotta say not very impressed but thats okay... I'll come back for pho :)"}
{"text":"Tastiest broth in town! 
Very authentic and aromatic! Instant orgasm of the senses as the taste fills your mouth while the vapors of steamy aromatic spices of all that's great  ventilates up your nose!   
The best Pho you will ever have! Cooked in the hottest and most well seasoned wok in town! 
You will be emotional when you start seeing the bottom of the bowl! All good things must come to a end they say!...... I'm fat so I  usually just order another!

 I've  been to almost every Vietnamese restaurant in the valley since 1999 and this place is number one! No matter what you order its the best! I have been eating here since they opened in 2001. I was lucky and blessed enough to almost live behind it a few years while I was a student at PIMA medical institute.
 We would eat there twice a day often... lunch and dinner. I even use to sneak a meal in before my wife got home.... not because I was fat but because she was tired of the same thing everyday and enjoyed my cooking! 

I have brought other Pho connoisseurs here that were visiting me from San Diego, Hilo Hawaii , LA, Las Vegas, Cleveland, and the east coast and all agree it's the some of best!  
The spring rolls and beef rolls are by far the freshest and most tasty you will ever eat. The only thing you will not find here is Banh Mi(sandwiches). They stopped making them about 6 years ago. I think that someone put pressure on them to stop selling them since their is  well know Vietnamese sandwich shop from LA that opened up not to far away (Lee's) about the time they stopped making them! Such a shame because they were the best! Makes me wonder!

The number 9 is my favorite! Rare beef with well cooked beef. 
The stew is mazing but not always available. 
Their pork chop with baked egg and shredded pork is amazing! 
The Imperial rolls outstanding and crunchy! 
Freshest spring rolls in town with the best peanut sauce around! 
House fried rice is full of treasures!

Not the nicest building... it originally was a Taco Bell in the 80s then some dumpy shitty greasy strange mix sorry excuse for Asian food before these brilliant straight off the boat beautiful young Vietnamese family turned it into heaven! 
So though its a old run down restaurant with layer after layer of paint and cracked windows its some of the best food you will ever eat and so darn cheap you can feed the family even in this economy!

Vietnamese coffee. Hot and iced.
Thai tea with or without Boba.
Salted lemonade and sodas.

The water is not the best! Though it's filtered it still taste like it came from canals! Your welcome to bring in your own! 

The small kitchen and tiny beat down walk-in forces them to use fresh ingredients daily!

Since it's located across from Mesa Community college it can be packed during lunch time fall and spring semesters! The seating is always limited anyhow to around 12 tables... only two tables can seat a party of 6 .Most of the tables can seat 2-4 only! 

Don't plan on using the restrooms here since they usually are locked or out of order do to vandalism since they are located in the back of the building! 

Plenty of parking at night but can be tight in mid week during lunch. 

Don't forget to tip them well since they work their asses off 7 days  week only taking vacation every few years!  

If I ever it the lottery I'm going to hire them to be my personal chefs! 
One of the worst things in my life to happen was becoming disabled and losing everything forcing me to move away! The disability part is ok as well as the losing everything I worked for  but the 200 miles distance from me to Pho Nhat has been depressing! We really do miss it and only get to eat here few times a year now! We have even rented a car and got a room to just eat here for lunch then have dinner at Blue Adobe then next day on way home have Pho again! It's that effing good!

Enjoy! I hope to see you there soon!"}
{"text":"Freshest, tastiest, Vietnameesiest food around mesa! :)
I started going there while attending MCC and got hooked. No other Vietnamese joint has tasted as good since. The staff is always courteous and provides good service. The prices are just a nice bonus. Note that this a pleasant, family run dining place, not an upscale restaurant to go for a date or celebrate an event.
Try the Pho (noodle soups), Lemongrass chicken, Mongolian beef and the fresh rolls. Don't forget to top it off with some tapioca drink.
Once you're hooked, they do take out (call in the order and pick up in 10 minutes). Have fun! :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Pho.

Any of the reviews that talk about service are ridiculous.  You don't go to a Pho place for service.  And you all should know that you bring cash to a Vietnamese place (the minimum card charge is $10 at Pho Nhat).  Just get used to these facts.  

I didn't eat Pho (I had a vermicelli dish) so I can't talk about the quality of the Pho.  But there was plenty of beef and shrimp in the food that i ordered.

The creepy Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck paintings are bizzarro.  And most def. a copyright infrigment.   

This is just one stop (in my many) to find quality Vietnamese food in Phoenix.  Final rating: not bad."}
{"text":"I walked in and instantly noticed that aside from the few tables with patrons,  all the other tables were dirty. I then stood at the counter for a few minutes before anyone acknowledged my presence. Once someone finally noticed me he told me to have a seat (not realizing that every table was dirty). Finally he \"cleaned\" a table by moving all the dirty dishes to another table with dirty dishes (see my pictures). I then asked where the bathroom was. It's outside and you need a key to get in. Classy. 

At this point I hadn't even gotten my food yet but I was about ready to walk out. Since most yelp reviews were positive I decided to stay. 

I ordered Number 8 - pho with rare beef. The food was average. Nothing special. The rice noodles were all stuck together which made it hard to eat. The entire time I was eating all I could think about was how dirty the place was. A well timed call to the health department may be needed."}
{"text":"woah woah woah... hold up, what's with the crummy reviews???
fabulous service. it's the same two people always working day in and day out, night and day. even when they have some fresh blood in there, the core team is always not far away. i have been recognized to the point of getting my stuff made before i even order. i've walked from the furthest end of ASU campus to this specific location for the Thai Tea alone, and i would walk two times further for their pho.
i'll admit that the football helmets and the disney montage with an apple thrown in there is NOT posh. but seriously, it's funny as hell and it keeps you coming back, if for nothing else but the \"wtf... but why?\" factor
like i said, good food and great service. not pricey. might i highly recommend the spring rolls? love that peanut sauce."}
{"text":"I'm admittedly not a soup fan (except for Paradise Bakery's fire roasted tomato, but I digress).  So I have no intention of ordering pho when I'm out eating Vietnamese.

With that out of the way, I've had the vermicelli noodle bowls here at Pho Nhat, and of the five Vietnamese places I frequent in the Valley - the portions here are HUGE.  I'm not talking just generous, but freaking HUGE, and a steal at $5 each. 

The bowls they serve this in must be 4 inches deep and 12 inches in diameter.  You can order these bowls in your standard combinations - I usually order barbecue beef and grilled shrimp.  They also go an extra step and throw in an egg roll.

The digs here are pretty modest, but right in line with most Vietnamese places.  Try not to stare at the post-post-modern art of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck on the wall - apparently it was painted for the owner's toddler."}
{"text":"I think it's great and pretty convenient, fast service, prices are not bad! nothing fancy but great for take out or lunch with coworkers"}
{"text":"I feel like I experienced an entirely different place than the majority of these reviews. 

The noodles in the bun were overcooked to the point of being  completely mushy and the dipping sauce was highly questionable. The rice paper wrappers on the gi cun were super rubbery and yet squishy at the same time.The Pho was okay...Nothing to write home about.  I absolutely love Vietnamese food, but I will not come back here."}
{"text":"Bomb Pho. Spring rolls are ok, not as good as Miss Saigon in Tucson. But probably the best Pho on the east side for its price."}
{"text":"Just discovered the wonton soup and I was blown away. Pretty sure they are the tastiest wontons I've ever had! My husband always gets the #1 (\"the super bowl\") which is huuuuge. This place is legit. It's not fancy or even cozy, but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Pho I've had at restaurant. Plus the price. This place is a gold mine of awesomeness. 

I was sick and in town for business. I found this place on Yelp. Got me some green tea and Pho. Felt better."}
{"text":"Interior decor is bland. It looks like a formal burrito joint or some other generic food place. So don't go here for the decor.

The food is AMAZING. Bun Bo Hue one of my favorite dishes, and something that I order at every pho restaurant as a metric for quality. Pho Nhat has the best bun bo hue I've ever tasted. The noodles themselves are packed with flavor, and the soup is tasty without being too salty (a problem with most restaurants). I left feeling very satisfied; not too full and not feeling like I got ripped off. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Hidden and easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. The restaurant seems to be located in a old Taco Bell property. The place is tiny and can seem a bit cramped. However, food was very good and prices are cheap. I enjoy supporting small businesses. Just wished the service was a little better and more noodle would seal the deal."}
{"text":"I happened to be by this part of town around lunch and saw that Pho Nhat had high reviews, so I thought I would swing by and try it.  Granted, I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and not the Pho, so I guess I should not expect too much.  However, their Bun Bo Hue (BBH) was extremely disappointing!  Maybe their Pho is better, but the BBH was not traditional at all.  They use Pho meat for BBH meat, the pig's blood looks and taste like a day old and is reheated, and there is no \"do\" but slices of pork belly instead.  The garnishes were not BBH garnish either.  While I don't know the quality of Vietnamese food in the area (I live on the west side and usually eat in Chandler), the food was average at best.   

Now, it was going to be a 3 star review, but I took off a star because when I went to pay, the person rang up my bill as $7.50.  I paid with a $20 and he gave me $12.00 back.  What the heck.  How can you do business like this?  If it was 5-10 cent sure, but 50 cent??  I usually tip generously for Vietnamese restaurant, however, because of this, I tip but not as generous.  Man, just because I'm Vietnamese too does not give you, a legitimate business, the right to pull crap like this.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"First I'm a n00b to pho, duh right?... So I started a quest to find what in my opinion is \"great\" pho. After 7-8 different places I find myself coming back to this place time after time. 
 If you've looking for ambiance. Perhaps this might not be for you. But holy bowl of heaven! Never been disappointed, quick service with a smile... Great condiments on the tables, siracha, fish sauce, chili oil ect...."}
{"text":"Very good little totally unpretentious Viet restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is no BS. Quick; straight to the point service. Communal style seating, if desired. 

I ordered a number five. Portion was great, although, meat portion is smaller than normal.

the broth has an amazing savory flavor.

You pay at the front. Affordable for anyone. 
I'd say definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've only had Vietnamese food a few times in my life, but when the plate I ordered arrived, I couldn't help but water at the mouth from the deliciousness I was staring at. After I spooned on some chili sauce and poured on the side dish of juice they gave me, I began to dig in. I had a pretty damn large bowl of beef, shrimp and egg rolls bedded on top of noodles and lettuce. I finished the whole bowl and am pleasantly satisfied, everything tasted pretty fresh and tasty; however, I couldn't help but think this is probably what the *average* Vietnamese dish tastes like (in the valley, at least) and there are probably better places. As far as I'm concerned, however, this place gets my seal of approval!

Tl;dr: 4 egg rolls out of 5."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vietnamese Pho Restaurant I have had for a while. The soup is so tasty, fresh, delicious! When I left the Navy I traveled across the country and found this place. PHO is a must! The soup, the meat, noodles and veggies are all fresh. I love their thai tea as well. The service is quick and very friendly! Thank you and I will go back one day soon..."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!

I avoid all chain because they are so noisy and music playing like your at a club. Sometimes, I feel like stuffing a roll in the persons mouth next to me because they wont shut up on their cells. Afterwards, I feel like I need a padded room to recuperate.

Everything at Pho Nhat is wonderful. Great tasting food. Pleasant service. Quiet unless the TV is on or an occasionally loud person.

Visit this place...not fancy inside but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This hole in a wall restaurant was pretty good. 

I got the vegetable pho and was really impressed with the broth taste. It was very good and I enjoyed it. The rice noodles were awesome. The veggies in the pho were all cooked well and had plenty of taste worth he broth. 

The only down side was the shrimp spring rolls. They cost 4.25 for two small rolls. I thought it was overpriced but I was in the mood for them so I got them. I didn't like the cabbage inside was all yellow. I'm more of a fresh cabbage person. the peanut sauce that was given with the rolls was very good. 

Other than that the place looked well kept and I had no issue with the place. I would go back to try another dish."}
{"text":"Decent pho. Good beef, nice sized serving. Local Vietnamese eating here Good sign. Will be back."}
{"text":"I gave this one a three star because coming from a Vietnamese that had a lot of Pho this one is up there for me due to the good prices and lots of option on the menu , but the place doesn't look so sanitary. The portion is great for a broke and hungry college student so I'd say you give this one a try."}
{"text":"What an amazing first Vietnamese food experience I had today!  I stopped by this old Taco Bell-ish building across from MCC on a whim today and told the owner I needed NO WHEAT, and I really don't like meat.  He recommended a rice noodle soup, and I added a young coconut water.  Everything was so REAL!  The \"water\" was an entire young coconut chilled, opened, and brimming with deeply satisfying water.  The enormous soup was full of perfectly softened vegetables, and tasted incredible.  On the side was a plate with a huge sprig of fresh basil leaves, a mound of bean sprouts, some fresh jalapenos, and a creatively sliced lime.  It was a thoroughly delightful experience, and there were plenty of Vietnamese patrons there for me to observe as I tried to figure out my chopsticks.  My bill came to $10.53 including tax."}
{"text":"I was a little intimidated b/c I'm not familiar w/ the VM menu. I ordered the #3 Pho w/ shrimp, to go. Wow! The broth is so different and so good. The amount of food is enough to feed 2 people. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years and it's always been my mothers and I favorite place. When we are craving some great pho we always come here. Plus side everytime we come in they never forget to bring some sugar for my mother and I ! Lol"}
{"text":"My bf and i came here out of random. I got beef pho he got fried rice. His fried rice was really gross it didn't have flavor. My pho was okay. It wasn't as good as unphogettable but it was pretty good. The ingredients are fresh but they need a better cook."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, given my most recent experiences here and my most recent experiences at Khai Hoan (see update), I will have to downgrade my rating for this place.  My basic gripe is that they don't really give you much in terms of noodles or accompaniments (beef, tripe, tendon, etc.).  You get a lot of broth and a decent amount of veggies, but not much of anything else."}
{"text":"omg gotta say the WORSE pho ever, me my fiance were in the  area and feel like some pho, heard this place was great from a few people and friends, decided give it a try... when we get there there were no one to bring us to our table or even greet us, we end up seating our self .there was only one or two other table eating at the time,  takes the owner/waiter  awhile  to bring us the menu and water, we both order pho dac biet , the broth was so plain and barely any meat in it , i cook pho at home every now and then but i can guarantee it taste ten time better,i also ask for some white onion  it never came out , i went up and remind him again, it still didn't came out, we didn't even finish our pho and decided to pay and leave,when we went up to pay the owner looks nervous and shaky i notice this lady with a clapboard looks like a health sanitary inspector writing something looking around the kitchen  . no wonder he wasn't all there with the customer maybe the kitchen is gross or unsanitary that's why he worrying, makes me scare what is going on with the pho if we'll get a stomach ache after eating there."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many pho places in Mesa, but I'm happy at the discovery. Had a great lunch here of rice noodle soup with beef for about $6. Nothing fancy about the place, in fact it *feels* like a fast food joint, but incredible taste and value. I will be back."}
{"text":"WORST SPRING VEGETARIAN ROLLS EVER! I jave had spring rolls at places all over the valley & i have to say this was HANDS DOWN was the worst i have ever had. Super rubbery & so loosely rolled so filling wont stay in.  Only had noodles & iceberg lettuce inside. Are you telling me that a vietnamese restautant can find vehetables, tofu & herbs for their pho soup but can't put any inside a $4.50 spring roll? I was charged the same as the meat versions but only got some iceburg lettuce...the worst kind of lettuce on earth!

The vietnamese coffee was tasty but was only a mouthful of it in the cup. I get vietnamese coffee around tbe valley too & know that it is more than a shot of coffee in a huge cup of ice. 

NEVER GOING BACK!

2 ORDERS OF SPRING ROLLS & A SHOT OF COFFEE OVER $13! I could have bought 6 packs of spring roll papers & about 3 pounds of herbs & veggiesfor that price!"}
{"text":"If you're in need of pho in Tempe and can't make it to Khai Hoan, Pho Nhat isn't bad. Now, it's definitely not the best pho that I've ever had, but it does the trick. One thing I find very interesting is the sauce that is served with the spring rolls. I've had a lot of different variations of peanut sauce, but Nhat's is pretty different. It's almost like a peanut/bbq sauce. I liked it. So again, if you're by ASU, like pho and don't really have transportation to other Vietnamese spot, you may enjoy Pho Nhat."}
{"text":"Got the veggie pho.  Broth, veggies and noodles were great.  Prices were good too.  My friend and I were the only gringos in the place.  Will go back!  Cruddy ambiance, but we went for lunch... not for a date ;o)  My friend loved her food too.  She had the beef with eggrolls.  MMMM  Great place to experience Pho for the first time.  Everything comes with a description on the menu ;o)  No alcohol.."}
{"text":"I liked this place! It's just really good authentic Vietnamese food !  If you are looking for fabulous decor and outrageous prices \"Fugetaboutit\"  It's a simple place with really good food . There were only two people working and one man was waiter, chef, and cashier!  The Pho was outstanding l. We shared the vermicelli and shrimp which was so fresh and delicious.! Going back very soon . Like Friday!!! Just don't expect flash . Just a simple good meal"}
{"text":"Great food...but I do agree with other reviewers, not the cleanest dining area, and you won't find the owners welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"This place looks like an Old Taco Bell and the inside is clean but, unremarkable.
However, we had several different dishes and I have to say all were A+.
The Pho veggie soup was hearty and divine.  My friend had the soup with all the meat (tripe) ugh.. but, she devoured it and said it was the best she has had.   I had the Mongollon beef..  wow.. was unexpectedly yummy..  The service was fast and the price was fair..."}
{"text":"Wow! My new favorite Pho in Arizona! I love Pho43, and its reign was nearly eternal. This broth was second to none! The beef was the most tender. I was initially skeptical, college area & all. But Dayyyuuum! Previously, I never got past the Indian place in this lot. So glad I did. 18 years delivering authentic Viet-fusion & perfect Pho. Such a considerate & efficient people, never-mind the #SilentRacism in my bowl. Lol"}
{"text":"This place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor. 

My family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane. I wasn't too hungry, so I got spring rolls, which were alright. Not great, but good. My mom and dad had a bowl of pho, and both said they weren't great. Which is pretty bad since they're not really ones to give negative feedback. 

There's better pho out there."}
{"text":"Very rude and unprofessional owner, I came in for an order through Postmates a delivery service app that Postmates customer service called to place the order over the phone. I come to the restaurant and the owner says he is refusing to make the food for the customer because he hates the \"you guys\" mind you I am just a sub contractor and also a business owner myself so I politely asked what his bad experience was so that I could communicate it to Corperate and he said I don't have to explain to you I hate you guys get out of here so I said \"sir please I'm not trying to be rude I'm a business owner myself I'm glad your speaking up I just want to know so it doesn't occur with other restaurants\" he said get out of my restaurant and walked out from behind the counter and touched my shoulder as his 2 children where standing right there. The unprofessionalism of the owner is a complete turn off! Furthermore, Postmates increases many small business owners like him by 10-15% statistically, why anyone would turn down money is beyond me!"}
{"text":"I love their pho. I brought every one of my family member and friends to this restaurant because I always love their food. Its little sweeter than other pho restaurant but that is the why I love here. There is no nice server or a fancy interior but very familiar and nice owner."}
{"text":"I love the pho here because it switches it up a bit. I feel the broth may be chicken based because of the color and texture but either way it is just the right amount of freshness and flavor. The prices are probably the cheapest in the valley. This is definity a hole in the wall kind of place and not ideal during rush hours because of the ten small tables they do have. They have no inside bathroom which is a bit of an inconvenience. I've tried their rice dishes and sandwiches but nothing to really talk about. The thai iced tea is good will make you diabetic!"}
{"text":"Looks a little dodgy from the street, but I have to say the pho here is awesome!  Could not have asked for more.  I'm thinking about stopping in tomorrow as I write this.  Great meal!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Pho in Arizona.  Do I dare say that it's better than my mom's???? (dodging lightning strikes now)

My friends and I call it Taco Bell Pho, since it looks like an old taco bell.  The food is amazing, the service is horrible, and the prices are awesome.  I've been going here, since I moved from Chicago ten years ago.  

What to order?  Look at the Pho list and pick the most expensive thing, and you'll know your pho will have every thing and more in it.  If you're afraid of tripe or some other ingredients, go with the Bo Vien.

The true test was when my parents came here to visit me, and she also told me this was the best pho she's had in AZ."}
{"text":"This pho place is quiet and small.  The broth is a little lighter than most but its inexpensive and still very tatsy.  The staff is friendly and helpful, have been and will be back for times to come!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for at least 3 years now.  I typically always get the Vermecilli noodle, #42 to be exact, and am never disappointed.  Be careful with the fish sauce you get on the side, though.  You can really overdo it if carelessly dump it into your bowl.  
When I'm sick, I'll change it up and go with a beef combination Pho.  The food here is always fresh, and the family who owns the place is very friendly and remembers me (and my order) every time I come back. 
If you're new to Vietnamese, just ask the waitress what she recommends for you. She'll help you pick out dishes that don't have strange parts of beef, tripe, or other things that the average cheeseburger eater would be grossed out by. 
Every other Pho restaurant I've tried hasn't compared in the slightest to my favorite Pho Nhat in University and Rural!"}
{"text":"I WISH I COULD GIVE 10/5 stars!! By far my favorite place to eat. So goodddd!! I have eaten at so many pho places and this is by far the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm a bit of a Pho amateur. I've had it once or twice, but never really developed a passion for it...I think that may be changed now.

A friend who knows her Pho (one could call her a PHO-natic...hehehe yeah? no? ok nevermind...) suggested that we try this place because of the stellar reviews here on Yelp. The place doesn't look like anything special from the outside. It very clearly was a Taco Bell somewhere in its past. Walking in, again...nothing special going on. I dont mind that, though. If the food is what you do best and you're not much for decoration and ambiance, its fine with me.

I ordered the chicken pho and my lady friend ordered the lamb (**CORRECTION**: It was apparently some sort of beef. There's like 80 beef options, though...so it was probably the number 9), I think. Both were absolutely delicious in my book. I like how with Pho, the broth is very flavorful, yet very basic and not spicy or anything to start but that you have to make your own flavor additives with hoisin, chili paste, sriracha, etc to bring it to your preferred taste and heat.

The bowls were huge, as they often are with Pho, but despite the fact that I was really not that hungry going in, I managed to eat the entire thing. It was seriously delicious. My Pho expert felt that it was very good, but not exceptional. I thought it was just awesome.

So I have to take off a star for the complete lack of environmental consideration of the eaters. But will I be back? Pho sure."}
{"text":"Used to think this place was good but now that i have expanded my horizons I have come to realize it is not. I came back recently on my lunch break because this is close to campus and felt like a good idea on a cold day. I was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places. Got my standard which is a pho with rare beef. The beef was not rare nor was it plentiful in the bowl as i have come to expect other places. The broth seemed to lack flavor and the basil I was given just didn't look good along with the lime. 

Another knock is that they have a $10 minimum charge for a credit or debit card but a bowl of soup is $6 (pretty standard price so no gripe there) so you almost have to get an app and soup or bring a friend. Even a drink brings you just shy which means have cash which I rarely have.

With unPhogettable, Khai Hoan, Pho ao sen and others in the area this should be left as a strictly a choice for convince sake and not on taste."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here. Decor is simplistic. I like how it feels very simple and unpretentious in here. Prices seem fair as well. I ordered a Thai iced tea and thought it was perfect--just the way I like it. I ordered number 58: lemongrass hot & spicy chicken w steamed rice & a fried egg. Yummy!!! I would have liked it a little spicier though, but that's just cuz I love spicy food! The flavor of the chicken was delicious and was perfect with the rice. My boyfriend ordered Mongolian beef w steamed rice and it came w onions and broccoli too. I enjoyed it as well and he did too. My boyfriend's parents ordered the pho but I'm not that big of a fan of pho so didn't think it was too much to shout about. In general to me, the broth was just average and not as flavorful as I'd like it to be. Portions were quite large for the prices too, which was nice. Service was good and the owners seemed friendly. I would definitely come back and try their other rice dishes!"}
{"text":"Pho was pretty decent. Everthing else sucked! The restaurant itself was odd, it still had the taco bell menu above the cash register."}
{"text":"I salivate every time I think about this place. I now live almost 3000 miles away, but there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about making the drive for dinner.

Pho Nhat is quite simply the perfect Vietnamese restaurant. It is run down and dingy, but it is extremely cheap and the food is to die for. I could eat their Pho Ga for every meal if I had to.

Don't expect good service or a clean bathroom because neither are there, but what you CAN expect is to fall in love with the food every time you go.

WARNING: Do not order a drink other than water here. There is nothing wrong with the beverages, but you will not get a refill because no one will bring it to you so it will be a waste of your money. I can forgive this because the food is so good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for years and it's good every time. I especially love the shrimp spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce and the pho with BBQ pork, chargrilled shrimp, and egg rolls. Yes, it's just a very quiet man who waits tables and cleans while his wife cooks, and yes it gets busy. It's always delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef and shrimp noodle plate because it sounded good. Instead got a plate consisting almost entirely of noodles. The lack of actual beef and shrimp was shocking. Skimping on shrimp is understandable, but the  lack of beef for a beef plate is inexcusable. I asked why there was so little beef and the cashier said that the cook counts each individual piece of beef -- and they were small pieces. The flavor was average for a Vietnamese place and it is not worth the abnormally high price. Don't think this is normal for a Vietnamese restaurant!"}
{"text":"First off going into the restaurant its your typical hole in the wall small Pho shop. Greasy floors, funky lighting, and the TV on some random channel that no one but the owners are watching. It's to be expected and only adds to the experience.

Price of the bowls was cheaper than I expected so that makes up for the pricey sides. Now here is my biggest gripe with most pho restaurants in Arizona and for the price of the bowl you don't get the quantity that makes California a haven for pho. Especially since Arizona is competing with those half off pho specials in Garden Grove. However, I was pleasantly surprised when my Pho Xe Lua was actually a train. Most other places in Arizona I'm usually not full after one bowl but here I was starting struggle near the end. A bittersweet surprise at best. 

With the exception of the meatballs, the rest of the pho bowl was bland. The broth was a little too \"mn\" as they say in the Vietnamese language. The beef was a little too rough for me and wasn't as flavorful and the rest of the bowl seemed out of balance too much tripe or too little meatballs, my OCD self had problems trying to get even proportions of meat throughout the meal. 


Tl;dr

Quantity greater than Quality at Pho Nhat"}
{"text":"Good pho

We ordered the $8 #1 pho Nhat to share after a breakfast smoothie earlier... It had a good broth good noodles and definitely a solid 3.75 out of five stars for quality and flavor. My mind was not blown but it was good food.

Tucked in the back of this strip mall is a quiet little Vietnamese food spot.... Staff seemed friendly.

Definitely worth stopping by to have a taste."}
{"text":"OK, I'm spoiled since I work next to China Town. Saying that, both pho dishes we tried had excellent broth but the vermicelli was a little different. The noodles where served cold and the presentation wasn't all that impressive. The taste of the vermicelli dishes was rather bland. Overall. I'm just giving them an overall three star rating since I think the experience was just average. If 2.5 stars was available on Yelp, that's what I would have given them. The bathrooms were some of the dirtiest I've ever seen. If I would have gone into the bathroom first, I may have left before I ate there."}
{"text":"Awesome pho here.  I usually get the #7 (Rice noodles with fresh chickens.)  Although the shrimp Pho is pretty good too.  Honestly, I have not been disappointed an anything I've had from there.  The Thai iced tea is really good, too.  When you first walk in to the place, you may think twice - it is an old taco bell converted to vietnamese restaurant.  But don't let that stop you - the food is excellent.  I've gotten a lot of people hooked on the place - even people who are picky eaters and won't try anything \"non-american.\""}
{"text":"This Pho location is cheaper than the one located on University and Rural. I came here with a friend and the food was great. Our bill was around $24 for two Thai teas and an order for Pho, a rice dish, and spring rolls. My parents drive an extra 5 miles to eat here too.

The place would be near perfect if the man at the counter would smile once in a while."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to live in the dorms and apartments nearby campus. This allowed me to walk to this restaurant 2-3 times per semester for four years.

The owner of the restaurant is very friendly and their little daughter is really adorable. I think this is one of the very few Pho restaurants in the Tempe/Mesa area with a friendly owner.

They have a Mickey Mouse mural on the wall. It's extremely random, but it's a good conversation starter when you are with friends.

The food is good too. People say the Pho on Apache is better, but I can't tell the difference."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in Phoenix! The most bang for your buck by far, at any rate. Their Pho is \"pho-nomenal\" (ha!) with every kind of authentic ingredient you can imagine! It's a great place to get a great meal for about the price of a McDonald's value meal, and the food is 100 times better and better for you! The fried rice is great, I'm partial to the beef and pork. The barbequed pork and shrimp rice combos are pretty darn good too. Try the addition of the vietnamese shrimp paste. There's a very decent vegetarian selection too, for all you non-meat-eaters out there. 

To drink, try the Thai iced tea with tapioca (boba). I'm a fan of Thai iced tea and a fan of boba and it's one of the few restaurants in town that combines the two!"}
{"text":"Super good! Family owned. I have not be disappointed once! The Mickey mouse is gone now but it seems that they are going to be painting something new on the wall soon."}
{"text":"Dont go for the ambience, but the Pho is excellent! Enjoyed the spring rolls as well. I will return."}
{"text":"The pho is great and and the prices are reasonable. I'm never disappointed with the food. It's always fast and on the table before you know it. Staff is also really friendly."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Worth the trip where ever you are in the Valley!! The Mekong Special was amazing, light, extremely fresh with a baguette, try the Yuca to bring down the heat of the spice gets to be too much."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Pho restaurants and this one is by far the WORST. Spring rolls tasted like burnt meat . Both dinners had horrible flavor. Did not taste anything like what we have had at other place. Service was the most pathetic service as it seemed like we was not welcome there at all. One of us Asian other White. Will never return to such low quality food establishment again. I hardly ever give bad reviews but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"The delicacy is located right in the heart of a Vietnamese grocery store. We had an absolute fantastic time. We went for a 6pm dinner. Total 3 guests - massive amounts of food. 

Pho was perfection. It was not too spicy. You can have them add this or take away that.. you can add spice or not too much. It's just great on a lot of levels.

Ribs were incredibly cooked. Fell right off the bones. The wrap or rolls or whatever they are called we're just perfect little appetizers. Bring an appetite- your going to need it. We tried the desert and we had mixed feelings, 2 liked it , 1 didn't. 

Over all I recommend trying this place. It was clean, the staff was nice, the price was good, and the food was delicious. Win win win :)"}
{"text":"Never went to Vietnam so I'm not too sure how authentic the food here are but I just love the Pork Chop Rice with Fried Eggs. Pure amazing."}
{"text":"It was OK. I got Pho to-go. It came out quickly and I was glad to be on my way. I got the Chicken soup (Pho Ga). The chicken was in huge chunks (good for some, but I'm used to smaller pieces) and it was a bit rubbery (as if it was previously frozen). It came with one slice of jalapeno, no basil, and no sauces. 

I drove up at 8pm and the place looked closed. The \"Open\" sign wasn't on and it looked dark inside. I thought maybe the windows were tinted (they weren't), but I saw people inside and the hours said they were open til 9 so I went in. It's a little sparse and gloomy. I'd go back if I don't find a place that's better."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago. Pho tasted bland. Just came back recently because a bunch of people were going... still tasted the same bland flavor. Seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it. It's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in Tempe.

There's Pho Cao (good) and Khai Hoan (very good). Try those places in Tempe. Better pho places are even better in Mesa. Strong broth. Lots of meat."}
{"text":"A hidden gem buried in the the hustle and bustle of Rural and University. Go for any of their traditional Pho, Or live a little, and just pick a random number on the menu and see what you get! Chances are it's going to rock you socks."}
{"text":"Really good pho! Random mickey mouse paintings on the wall. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant in 2008 when I first move to AZ. I ate here a few time as well with my friends. Although the service is slow since only one guy waits the table (I don't see anyone else so I don't know and off one star for it), the food is not bad at all. However I order anything else beside the pho (yes, it is their main dish). The pho doesn't as flavorful as I expect. Off one star for that since it is your main dish. So thump down for that. Otherwise it is the closest place to MCC. One star for convenience. I don't know if they have a bathroom? Never see one so no comment. The table is clean on season. Sometimes it is clean, other time really lost my appetite. Off one star for that.
Overall: 3 star.
Food: good
Cleanliness: bad
Service: bad"}
{"text":"The food is good. But the service and the atmosphere take everything away. The table doesn't wipe clean. There is spot of oil or fat where my friend sit. I feel bad to take him to this place. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in the east valley. I've been going here when they first opened a few years back. My family and I frequent this restaurant and highly recommend it to family and friends.

Their bun and pho noodle soups are the best. You get a lot of food for a reasonable about of money. This is a true hole in the wall restaurant.

Be warned though, the inside aesthetics is very outdated, but it is clean. The service isn't warm and friendly but they're also not rude. It's just a place that you go to eat and mind your own business."}
{"text":"Super small portions. This is hands down the smallest bowl of pho I have ever had ($6.25). The pho came out in the standard size bowl. When it arrives you can see only broth... which can be normal. Many places you have to get your chopsticks in there to fluff up and separate the noodles. When I dipped my chopsticks in, I found myself stirring about a few pieces of noodles and no joke, 3 pieces of beef, 2 pieces of tripe, and 3 small pieces of tendon. I am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point. But wait, what about the broth. The broth was was too sweet which masked any depth of flavor. There are many better options in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"I meant go be going to the other Pho place on Southern but I overshot and missed it and found myself here instead, so I figured, what the heck.  It looks like maybe a former Taco Bell building.  As soon as I walked in I was enveloped by wonderful aromas of pho broth but in the AZ hot weather I opted for a cooler dish, the #45, Vermicelli with Charbroiled Shrimp and BBQ Pork.  It wasn't a large amount of food but it was delicious.  I ate it all, no leftovers.

Just about everything on the menu was between $6.25 to $6.75.  Can't get much more reasonably priced than that.

There are mostly Asian people in here, always a good sign the food is authentic.  The servers were very nice.

I hope I get back here to try another meal before I have to leave town."}
{"text":"So far, not impressed. I was really hoping to find another great Pho place, but alas. We tried the \"Nhat Special\" sandwiches for lunch and they were definitely NOT special. What they were was thinly sliced pork and cucumbers -- no cilantro, no pickled carrots or radish. Pretty blah... 

On the other hand, the Pho was OK. Kind of flavorless and tepid, but OK."}
{"text":"I'm no Pho expert but this place is pretty good- I've gotten Pho to go a few times from here and they are very quick, but they don't give you as many add-ins as some other Pho places.. Bean sprouts, some cilantro, and lime are all I've ever gotten along with whatever meat options you get (I like raw meat and cooked meat- not much of a tripe fan).. But then again perhaps that's because I got it to-go. The decor of the place is really odd.. It's basically barren besides tables, chairs, and a weird mickey mouse mural."}
{"text":"Best pho in Tempe! Happy is the sweetest woman that always treats us like family whenever we come to visit. An absolute must have every week. Can't get enough of the broth!"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely wonderful HUGE bowls of Pho accompanied by good condiments, basil, bean sprouts and sliced jalapenos. They never charge me for the many extra limes I request.
The SMALL rare beef Pho is a huge meal in itself.
Easily the best Pho anywhere, and a great value at just about six bucks for a small.
The Summer rolls and fresh-made lime-aid are also especially good.

This was my go-to spot for an affordable meal in this neighborhood before I moved.

It is a family place, and small, and the low prices don't afford them a separate serving staff, so wait times for food can vary."}
{"text":"The decor of the place is -- (could be better). But aren't the most delicious food found in the weirdest places? Awesome Vietnamese food. I have been here many many times and have tried almost everything on their menu. Had the wonton with noodle soup today. So delicious I might have to come back for seconds."}
{"text":"One day I was about to break because I was in need of some Pho, and happened to have a pretty bad sore throat. After finding this place on Yelp I walked over from my dorm and ordered #6 and #46. 

I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was served and how quickly I got my food. I couldn't help but inhale the rolls, they were just so tasty! And the Pho was so soothing. It came out steaming and was full of flavor. The pho comes with a large plate of greens to add on which I appreciate a lot. 

One thing that keeps me coming back is the service. I absolutely adore the staff here. The lady in charge even remembers my face and what I like to get. 

Protip, asking for extra meat is a great choice. I got extra meatballs in my pho and was extremely pleased."}
{"text":"A little on the pricy side for soup but the ingredient are fresh and it's not overly salty. The service is minimal and I like that. They ask what you want, they bring it to you and unless your cup is empty you won't need to interact with the staff until you go to the register to pay. 

*the spring rolls are worth ordering for the dipping sauce alone."}
{"text":"You will get super delicious Pho. Don't expect too much for the service. They don't speak very much.. but you will have yummy Pho in your tummy."}
{"text":"Went for early dinner today and I ordered combination fried rice. It was tasty! The service was okay but everything is made to order. I would definitely recommend this place to try. Everyone was eating soup."}
{"text":"V is for very, very, extra ordinary.  Not extraordinary, kids - just ordinary.  Prices are in line with most pho joints, but they are a little sneaky and cut corners with the servings.  The portions are large, however they majorly skimp on the rice noodles and meat - it's mostly broth and whatever greenery you choose to add.  In a large bowl of raw beef with meatballs, I had 3 meatballs and 4 thin slices of beef, and the equivalent of three mouthfuls of noodles.  PLUS I have to take away a star for a lack of mint - we had cilantro and basil but no mint.  It made me sad almost.

Cha gio (crispy spring rolls) were nearly devoid of filling, like mini cigarettes rather than the fat cigars you'd expect them to be.  Despite being tasty, they didn't com with any lettuce or greens to wrap them in to dip in the nuoc mam.  This also made me frown a bit.

Young coconut juice was delicious and fun, and left me scraping out the coconut for the tender flesh long after my soup and spring rolls were over.

I'm not at all pressed to go back - it was so ho hum for the cost, and there are so many places in the area that are much more generous with their dishes."}
{"text":"Pho #1 is a large bowl of fun meaty bits. Lots of fresh veggies on the side. The broth was tasty and with a splash of hot sauce it hit the spot. I like that you add the vegetables. Lots of folks don't like cilantro so they can avoid putting it in."}
{"text":"I love this spot. They are friendly and take very good care of their patrons. This is a must stop in when near."}
{"text":"Really good Pho and other noodle soups. Fast and friendly service. I even over heard the waiter remembering the order of a customer. It was also super affordable! I got better quality soup for half the price. My garish was a little wilted (the basil) and the jalapeños were cut very large."}
{"text":"Visited Arizona to see my daughter and I was craving Vietnamese food. This restaurant was the right choice. Yummy. My kids ordered Pho--beef meatballs were so delicious--you cannot find this quality and taste from any other restaurant. I ordered #41 bún tht nng, my husband ordered com suon nuong. We had an overall great dinner at Pho Nhat!"}
{"text":"For the most part, their food is amazing. They use fresh ingredients and the quantity is easily two of my meals, so the price is nominal. Their service can be a little off, but that doesn't really bother me."}
{"text":"Let's get the negative out of the way- it's not the cleanest place in the world. When the only two employees are the husband & wife team, they're often too busy to clear out the tables. 

With that said, their pho is consistent and they don't skimp on the servings. On a cold wintery day, there's nothing better than a nice large bowl of pho. It's still my favorite hangover cure.

The price point is great for the amount of bean sprouts and meat with your meal. 
You'll see an eclectic lunch crowd here- from the Banner Health workers to Mesa Community College students, this is a local gem hidden in plain sight."}
{"text":"Totally delicious pho in a very informal atmosphere. The combination spring roll was very good. Prices are excellent! I would go back!"}
{"text":"Pho and spring rolls were very good. Service was poor. Not very many vegetarian options e.g. No tofu."}
{"text":"Great food, nice staff, fair prices!
Can't want anything more from this place!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Pho Nhat four whole stars because I know what to order when I'm there. 

Service: Nicer to non-Viet -why is that? When I say nicer- I don't mean provide good customer service. Don't expect that either.

What to eat?
When I still hung around the Tempe campus it was Bún Bò Hu or BBH for short- it was bomb diggity!  I had it recently- it lost that flava flav
Cm Chiên Gà (Chicken fried rice) - The best!!! this is what I always order- how does PN make their rice soooo good!!!!  I have tried all their fried rice except the seafood ones due to my preference- all has been tasty.
Another thing I like here is their Thai Tea- odd huh? since it's a Viet restaurant. 

Pho Nhat, I miss you! I will come by to visit the next time I'm on the east side! Until then, stay good!

Strange that I don't order the Pho there- but I've never liked the Pho."}
{"text":"I drove from chandler. And it's 8:45pm

They closed closed early and there are people sitting inside. 

The door says 9pm 

Don't advertise you close at 9 PM and you decide to close early"}
{"text":"Like another reviewer said \"Don't freak out\" when you walk in. You may get the feeling that you should walk right back out. You shouldn't.

We have been eating here for many years. The small restaurant is the owner and his wife. They may not speak the best English, but they know who we are and what our usual is when we walk in, or even call for takeout!

The Pho is tasty, with a quality base. Our fave though is the bun. The #41 with extra egg rolls! This place is one of only a few that serve shrimp paste. As opposed to the foul condiment you may get from restaurants of other regions, this is a ground, seasoned shrimp, steamed around sugar cane. It is to die for. I always get a Thai iced tea as well, done to precision. The shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce are fantastic.

Pho Nhat is worth a try. Don't be dissuaded by the look of the place or them raising the kids in the kitchen. The only turn off is a nasty exterior access bathroom. Just eat and then go over at subway next door!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time. I'm glad they're still around. Service is always great! Family business but Mom seems to be the only one working. Today I had the bun and goi cuon. Portion was plentiful. Would've liked mint and more veg (carrots, pickled diakon) other than iceberg and a few (literally) cilantro leaves in there but still delicious. I think that fish sauce makes everything delicious! I'll have to have the pho again next time I go, that was probably my go-to back the day when an unlicensed image of Mickey Mouse graced the wall."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho here. No frills straight to the point....moderately priced but the service, quantity and QUALITY of the food is top notch. I highly highly recommend this place if you're in need of a big hot bowl :)"}
{"text":"The quality and taste is good. The service could be much better. Service was too busy watching tv."}
{"text":"Pho for a student budget!! what else can you ask? Good taste, I've tried different numbers (can't recall all of them), but always a lot to finish alone, so come hungry and leave happy."}
{"text":"I went here when I had the flu because I needed take out. I ordered it before I left the house late and took much longer than I had anticipated to get there. I got there and they were super friendly, and the food was still piping hot! I got the chicken pho and it was delicious. My only complaint is that they should use white meat in it rather than dark meat, but it was still yummy. I'll be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I'm with Megan's review below - must have entered the Bizarro version of Pho Nhat, because I will never come back here.  Between the very dirty conditions and the flavorless pho, I was not able to finish my pho (an extremely rare feat, mind you!).  Add on to that the fact there is one cook and one other person responsible for waiting, busing and being cashier.  This results in extremely slow service with a single person handling food, trash and money without ever stopping to wash their hands."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Located at a ancient Taco Bell and family run. Not in the nicest part of town but it was during the day so it seemed OK.  

My order the Bun Bo Hue. Reasonable at only $6.95 and was a large bowl. Instead of pork blood they gave me additional meat and the broth was yummy too. The staff here is generous with the cabbage, mints, Jalapenos and lime which also added flavor.

Check this place out you won't be disappointed with the Bun Bo Hue! They accept credit cards here also."}
{"text":"Used to be our go to place in Tempe because of the location and seemingly good pho. However, as time went on we realized it wasn't consistent. The past few times we've gone, the soup has been murky and just kind of funky. Because Vietnamese restaurants are in abundance in Phoenix, I hope that the competition is encouragement to improve. I'm kind of disappointed that the quality is going down because this location was one of the closest to us. Won't say that we're never coming back, but we will have to check out some new places before we do."}
{"text":"Normal food, the bun bo hue is too oily and it is not even close with the original one. However the biggest minus point for this place was the waiter and also owner of the restaurant I guess. He was weird and slow and didnt understand me even I speak the same language with him. Bad experience everytime I come here !!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here around 7p on a Friday night. The place was very busy for that time in the later afternoon I thought. I always think that's a good sign. The pho was pretty bland in my opinion. Pho is better than no pho... I guess. I've definitely had better pho in the valley. Pho Chandler is my spot, love that place. All in all, this place isn't bad for a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST PHO IN THE WORLD. Not an exaggeration. I eat here three times a week and have for the past four years. Best, most amazing, authentic Vietnamese food out there. This is the place. Eat her. Go here. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by appearance. Sure, the place could use some upgrading and the owner could smile once in awhile, but the food makes up for it. When you need good Pho, go here."}
{"text":"Great Pho, that's what this place is all about. The atmosphere and service is good. The place is clean. But the real reason that you are there is the food.  And it is very good. No restrooms is a negative."}
{"text":"This place is a little sketchy looking at first. The inside still looks pretty out of date and ghetto. However, the pho is amazingly close to homemade. I've been to about every pho joint in Arizona and the soup here is the closest to home. The spring rolls are also big portions but they are not the best because it is served cold. I like my spring rolls to be warm to the touch since I don't like cold food. The peanut sauce was okay, I could make better at home but it wasn't bad to the point where I wouldn't eat it. Overall, the place have decent prices, great pho and okay customer service which is good enough for me to say I would totally come back here."}
{"text":"This place is nothing fancy but it's a great Vietnamese lunch spot with good spring rolls.  The lemon grass chicken, chicken curry and vegetable curry are all excellent.  Very affordable."}
{"text":"I was surprised about this place. I would highly recommend it! Coming from Seattle and the Bay Area, I know good pho! The broth was not greasy, but super flavorful. The beef and noodles  were good too. We also had the veggie stir fry w beef, chicken and shrimp. Very tasty sauce!"}
{"text":"Pho was pretty salty.. I felt like pouring in my ice water to even it out.. Maybe its done that way to please the non -asian crowd. The waiter was pretty funny tho, mexican fella totally spoke vietnamese to me (extra star for that!)."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced pho, noodle, and rice dishes.  The bun bo hue was delicious, with a spicy hot broth, and a huge portion of meat in the soup.  The noodles were a bit strange to me; I'm not sure if they're supposed to taste like there's starchy powder coming off them onto your tongue when you are eating?  I've never really had that happen before when eating Vietnamese noodle soups (Maybe they used tapioca noodles instead of the rice noodles that are usually in bun bo hue?).  The soup was in a very generously sized bowl, and I was full after having about half of it.  The soup comes with your requisite sides:  basil, limes, sprouts, jalapeno.  

One thing to take note of is that they can't open the second door of the double doors that you enter the restaurant to, so those that are in wheelchairs will have some difficulty getting inside.  I saw this happen when we ate here, and while the person did manage to get inside, he had to actually get out of the wheelchair, aided by one of his friends, to enter the door, while his other friend folded up the wheelchair to bring it inside.

Our total with the bun bo hue and a bun vermicelli noodle dish: ~$15 with tax."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, I wish I could transplant it to our new digs in Seattle. We just returned for a visit in Feb 2015, and I was delighted to find the lemongrass chicken is just as delish. Sadly, it looked like all the display fish had died, though!

We found this place because our local friend recommended it. He grew up in Hong Kong and has some pretty non-white boy American eating habits - tripe? Yum! Entrails? Hand them over! Weird sweetmeats that can't quite be translated on the menu? Pile them on! I'm not quite that adventurous, but I'll eat the lemongrass chicken with a side of pho greens (basil, sprouts, etc) any day. I still haven't found anything like it up here, though we have a TON more Vietnamese restaurants, food trucks, and pho joints than there are in the entire state of AZ combined.

Next door, there's even a See's Candies. Best of both worlds?!?

PS: We were extremely disappointed when they installed the TV, but just turn it off when we sit to eat."}
{"text":"Sweet memories from the past. Used to go here every week. Love love love the deep fried shrimp, chicken fried rice and kung pao chicken"}
{"text":"Pho is a tricky dish. It's hard to get it really 'wrong', and very easy to skate by with a mediocre product. By the time you're face-down in a bowl, you're usually too hungry to really care if it isn't top-notch. We stopped by today for a couple of bowls, and were really pleasantly surprised. When we walked in, the first thing that we noticed was the smell. This place smells *RIGHT*. It smells like vats of broth that have been cooking for ages. Pho seeps through the walls here, and it's obvious that they've got some good stuff cooking away. 

They have everything that I want here- salty plum soda, great pho, and good grilled pork rolls. Our lunch was excellent. The first sip of broth put a huge smile on my face- it tasted *RIGHT*. That's the best way that I can explain it- it just tastes right. Proper. There's nothing adventurous, nothing audacious, and nothing crazy. It's just good food, at a good price. The salty plum soda was spot-on. The rolls were outstanding. It made me realize how mediocre some of my recent meals at other Vietnamese restaurants have been, and makes me want to come running back very soon."}
{"text":"SPEEDY SERVICE!!! 

I ordered, stepped away to powder my nose, and my food was already on the table when I got back. I enjoyed the pho. It was very tasty. 

I attached a picture of the infamous Mickey Mouse wall. It's pretty funny."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town. For me, It's between this restaurant and Da Vang 19th avenue in Phoenix. Both have great prices and EXCELLENT Pho. This location is closest to me, so I eat here frequently.  DV has exceptional vietnamese food. Pho nah has exceptional pho."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Arizona. Coming from someone who has ate Pho at least 100 times. They put Bok choy in and onions on top. Service is ok but Pho makes it great!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. It was okay. I ate Pho Ga (rice noodles with chicken). It was okay. It was not that authentic thought. There were things like carrots and broccoli in it. Maybe this exists now in modern Vietnam, but I don't know. It was not authentic to me. It was still pretty good, however. Some complaints that I have are that the owner has kids roaming around there, the service isn't that good (aside from the Vietnamese-American waiter) and the overuse of MSG, amongst other things. 

I'll go back if I want Vietnamese food and I'm near ASU. But other than that reason, I won't come back if I'm merely hungry. 

Two stars for the semi-decent food."}
{"text":"Never. Again. My husband and I decided to try this place because we were in the area and wanted hot pho on a cold night. My pho was terrible. The broth tasted like it was ramen noodle broth, which if you've had good pho, you know should never be the case. And then, to make the experience even worst, a cockroach started to crawl on our table and almost into our food. The server, who I believe is also the owner, came to check on what was wrong, and when we told her there was a cockroach, her suggestion was we move to another table. But at that point, we had already lost our appetites. We paid and left. The server/owner apologized again as we were leaving, but I was surprised she didn't comp our meal being that we didn't really eat. If you want pho, I suggest you go somewhere else where there is some attempt in making it taste authentic. As for the cockroach, well...I know Vietnamese restaurants are kind of notorious for being dirty so that should be your call if it's a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Hair in my pho, husband of the owner is rude and on the phone while wife serves 15+ customers. The two children were being scolded by the dad, as he is spontaneously on the phone."}
{"text":"It's such a shame this place is not good, because the service was great and the pho broth was delicious. However, the beef stew was not good. It was too watery and the beef chucks were hard and rubbery. The spring rolls were skinny and lacked flavor. Additionally, the bo vien tasted odd and spongy. The only thing that tasted good here was the pho broth. Which is such a shame because damn is it good broth."}
{"text":"I ordered #25 mi dac biet which was decent. Thankfully I didn't order pho because the bowl my buddy got looked terrible. Greasy layer of fatty broth.  I think she was by herself Saturday morning so it was a little slow at service. Pretty much a hole in the wall status but it wasn't good. I don't plan to come back here anytime soon unless I'm starving and this was the only place open."}
{"text":"I am visiting Tempe Arizona from Seattle WA. I had a taste for pho. I recalled seeing this place one evening as I was coming back to my hotel. There do not appear to be very many pho restaurants in Tempe. The parking is scarce, the food was delicious. The service was very prompt and friendly. I had the pho soap with beef brisket and shank steak. The vegetables we're very fresh, the meet tender. There was a flavor in the soap that I was not able to identify. Never the less it was delicious. The bowl was huge, the price was more than resonable. I have a favorite Pho restaurant not too far from my home. Back there it would have been $10. $11 with tax. Here it was $9.67 with tax."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, for the ASU community, it serves pho that will suffice and pass for pho but if you have a car and can go elsewhere, go elsewhere.  Don't get this place mixed up with the OTHER Pho Nhat located on Southern and Dobson across the street from MCC.  That other place is AWESOME.

THIS  place is all about mis-hits and complete misses.  I've come here and have had pho which is ok and other times when the broth is so laden with salt and msg that I feel suicidal 4 hours later.  I really hate giving out 2 stars to an establishment but the pho I tried here recently really made me feel ill hours after I ate it and I would be doing all my fellow Yelpers a disservice if I didn't say anything.  

The good: clean establishment, close to ASU, huge playful Disney characters painted on the wall that reference BBQ even though it's a pho house, lots of parking, tall ceiling and you don't feel claustrophobic inside.

The bad: somewhat salty/msg laden broth, small basil leaves.

There aren't many \"bads\" but that broth was so bad it almost had me sawing away at my wrists with anything that was sharp.  I felt bloated yet dehydrated at the same time.  My eyes were super dry, the joints in my hands swollen, my mouth parched...  this place unfortunately deserves the 2 star rating of \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  I almost gave it a one star rating but I've had stuff in the past that was decent so it gets another star.

If you're feeling lucky, go check it out.  If you have the best pho of your life, try to extend that luck and buy a lottery ticket."}
{"text":"This place is the Wal-Mart of pho!! (but thankfully you don't see any www.peopleofwalmart.com customers)  Believe me.  You get a big sized bowl of Pho at a bargain price.  

I live near Desert Ridge in north Phoenix and I don't even think twice about driving down to Mesa to eat at Pho Nhat.  

The experience: 

Like other pho places, they don't pride themselves on interior design, street appeal, etc... they just do what they do best, make great pho.  The building  used to be an old Taco Bell shop and inside, they serve great tasting broth, your body doesn't feel like crap after eating there or even drinking all of the broth, and you come out of there with almost enough savings to go out and buy yourself some boba drinks or at least pay for extra fuel it takes to get there from north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Never disappoints.  Kind of small restaurant, definitely has that hole in the wall feel. There is a Quiet staff, but that's okay, they aren't rude or anything, I much rather be busy eating my yummers! Pho beef, so delish. No complaints from me!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, easy five stars on that. The service however is horrible. Have went here about 10 times, and never been asked for a refill on my soda or anything. When you approach him about it, he just mumbles and gives you one. The food is spicy, so refills are needed."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try and what you get is the average run of the mill pho joint.

The servings of meat are on the low side though...

My pho with rare beef seemed mostly soup, luckily one of my friends only finished a quarter of their fried rice 

Service: average
Food: average
Prices; average"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, only thing was their spring rolls were really summer rolls."}
{"text":"All the yelping convinced me to come try this place, which was less than a 5 minute drive from my hotel. I walked in incredibly hungry..ordered the #1 super beef with rice noodle bowl from the nice older gentleman who was constantly moving expediting aromatic orders of pho that were being churned out of the kitchen.

  I sat down and patiently waited while the intoxicating smell of fresh broth filled the small dining room. Shortly thereafter the nice old gentleman brought out a gigantic bowl of pho, a glass of ice water, and a plate with optional additives such as cut lime, sprouts, sliced spicy peppers, and fresh basil.

  With a thank you and a quick exchange of smiles I proceeded to devour the entire bowl - catching my posture melting into a slump a few times as I took in the sheer flavor of the broth, the delicious texture of the clumped tender rice noodles, and variety of beef parts (cheek, tripe, thin sliced meat, etc). A gulp of refreshing water later and I was considering ordering something else (Warning: normal people stop eating at this point).

  I caved and went to thank the owner for the great meal - before ordering a second bowl: The seafood egg noodle. A few minutes time and another aromatic bowl was set before me - this time with a wonderful array of seafood (shrimp, krabstick, dumpling) amidst a hefty portion of delicious egg noodles. I had to muster up the willpower to stop eating this halfway through and to get a to-go container so I can relive the dream tomorrow morning for breakfast :)

  tl;dr: Amazing food, very affordable at ~$7 for a gigantic bowl. Easy going atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had my usual dish here again today.  Lemongrass chicken doused heavily with chili paste.  

I was the only one in the restaurant due to spring break at the university.

The owner was there doing it all:  Cooking, taking orders, watching her kids, and refilling my iced tea.  She is nice and attentive, and the food is good.  Not the best Vietnamese I have ever had, but there is absolutly nothing wrong with it.  Tasty!

Besides the Pho and the lemongrass chicken, I haven't been too impressed with the other menu items.  Pretty run of the mill chinese food mixed in with the Vietnamese delights.  I prefer to stick with the Lemongrass chicken and Pho at this spot."}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix enough that I've become a regular at this Pho-king resturaunt! Everything I've ordered here is awesome. This is not the sort of place you bring a date, unless they are serious about good and inexpensive Vietnamese food. I can stuff myself here for less than $12 with tip.

I will drive out of my way while I stay in Phoenix to eat here. I love it and my accounting/expense department love it too!

Yum."}
{"text":"Zero ambiance... do not, I REPEAT, do not take a date here that you want to impress...even if it's with your openness to global cuisine.


100% tasty Vietnamese food- Priced just right for the budget conscious or cheap date who doesn't care about impressing the \"other\" person with them.

If you are in the area I would recommend it... even if their daughter who I've sort of watched grow up is crying in the corner because her dad won't let her watch what she wants on the iPad... I never leave hungry!

I do really like this spot though, don't get me wrong."}
{"text":"Very good! First time coming here and the pho was delicious. Plenty of it in the bowl too."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken pho (Pho- Ga). The portion size is huge for someone with a medium appetite like mine. The restaurant is really pocket friendly. Its stands at some 3.5/5 for me just for the reason that I have had better chicken broth.
The service is good enough dont expect them to engage with you too much! Overall not one of my favorite Phos till date but decent whatsoever."}
{"text":"I love this place.. The lady is always super nice. Service is fast and she always remembers my order. If you're into spicy food I would highly recommend for you to order a spicy pho (:"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place.  I've been coming here for probably 7  years and can't get enough of this place.  The portions are huge so I usually split it with a co-worker.  The best shrimp spring rolls and peanut sauce hands down!  I havent found anywhere else that makes them as good."}
{"text":"I've been to this family owed and run restaurant more than a hand full of times. I looked it up on yelp this last time to give my review on it, as a foodie. I was blown away on the small negative marks that it was given. Trust me when I say this this is a gem of a place in all of AZ. There food is authentic fresh and a steel of a deal in price. I had to laugher the person that said the spring rolls were bad. I guess you can have an opinion and rate them against frozen ones you get at most restaurants and the market lol stupid does as stupid is. Every thing here is crazy fresh and hand made. Also the fabrication of the workers don't get tip is fakes they are all family members that help the families business."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers...in Arizona on a trip; the pho was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came in here for my first time after a co-worker recommended you. I got the number 8#. There wait time was impeccable, I would say no longer then 6min. There wear a few other customers what you would expect on a lunch brake. The broth was amazing, had a nice savory flavors. The lime, jalapeno, basil and side condiments gave it the nice touch. I like mine really spicy. Know time for the nor do good. I was not a fan of the beef. The meat was tuff and really had no flavor. I will definitely be back in.  perhaps i will try the sea food next time. Ps there portions are very generous definitely will have enuff for two meals."}
{"text":"Really dingy joint ran by a woman in the back cooking and a man in the front cleaning and taking money. Everything that comes out of the kitchen looks extremely professional and full of goodness. The Bun Bo Hue as recommended by fellow yelpers lived up to  every expectation. It was fragrant, sweet and spicy (a spicy hot broth with pig's feet (boneless), beef, and pig's blood). The bowl was gigantic for about $7.

There's a huge sign on Southern Ave, so you can't miss it despite its dinginess."}
{"text":"I won't go into the whole story about what first brought me here, but I'm glad I did.  I'm not pho expert, so I'm basing this review off of my general impression - not for comparison.

Great portions for the price.  Broth is good, good amount of ingredients, and plenty of add-ins to customize the dish to your liking.  I can confirm this place isn't fancy, but I'm typically in and out on my lunch break.  I've been back numerous times since and always get good food, quick, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time today since I love Pho. I thought that the food was very bland and didn't stand out at all. The only plus was that the service was decent. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Hidden pho restaurant in Tempe.

The building was a little out dated, but the food was good.

We ordered the #1 pho combination. The broth had lots of flavor like normal pho!

You can always tell by the flavor of the broth its its good or not!

Not a bad spot to try.."}
{"text":"Haven't been in years because I moved out of the valley. Recently moved back and came because this place was one of my delivered to hit (Dobson and southern location) 
I got the wonton pho, which again was a special thing I always really liked because I'd never seen it at other pho locations. 
The wontons were good, but the broth really wasn't. It had a very sour taste that no amount of hoisin or sriracha could cover up. Maybe it came from the random vegetables that didn't belong there. I mean, I've never gone to a pho place that had broccoli, carrots and cabbage in the soup. 
Their fresh rolls weren't really great either. Lettuce was sad and brown. Meat was over cooked by a large margin and over all it was super bland. 
I may try the place on Dobson again once more, but probably not this one on university. 
Thai tea was really good tho. Really sweet comparatively"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Pho Nhat on my lunch break, it's good, great price and great service. 
If you come, try eating Pho- Rice noodles with vegetables. I just wish it came with fried tofu as well."}
{"text":"this place should serve as your \"fast food\" vietnamese stop. i like the fried rice and my husband always orders the pho. it's not spectacular, but you expect it. it hits the spot when you've got a craving, though and that's what matters. i like the guy who runs the shop, he's really friendly and always recognizes us when we come in. i don't know how the rest of the food is, but the pho seems to deliver. the interior is horrid, but it goes with the character of the place. actually, i think they've replaced the furniture and perhaps painted a wall since the last time i've been. i agree, the mickey mouse painting's a tad odd, but whatever. i won't hold it against them."}
{"text":"Just got off the plane and needed some lunch. Heard this was a pretty good spot. NOT!  Maybe because I'm spoiled from the Bay, cuz this right here is nothing good aside from the AC. 

The egg noodle seafood was a mere two bites. The so-called seafood was a few cuts of the fake crab meat, 2 shrimps, and 1 shrimp cake ball. The broth was subpar. 

The worst was the lemon-grass chicken. It's not the chicken steak or thigh that I'm used to that is grilled. This was all chopped up in pieces and it tasted and looked more like Kung Pow chicken than the real deal. 

Bottom line: disappointed! Not returning even if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall establishment gets 3.5 stars.  Only one staff waiting table and the wifey cooking all the meals.  I had hu tieu special, really enjoyed the home made shrimp cakes in it, didnt care for the imitation crab and wontons.  

Pho was above average in my opinion, although portions were on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Really flavourful and light  phos/soups  made here. This is the reason that I like Mom and pop stores. They don't leave you feeling like a greasy  over stuffed cow. I keep ordering the tapioca noodle soup as I haven't seen many places that offer that on the menu.

Next time I'll try the rice dishes. They looked yummy when the next couple ordered it."}
{"text":"We recently moved to AZ from San Jose, CA where you could easily find a Pho house on every corner.  Needless to say, we've been on the hunt for a place to find some decent Pho to remind us of home.  We were not disappointed when we found this place, thanks to Yelp reviews.  We were a little leery with the Taco Bell facade, but with the flavorful broth and menu selection, our doubts were laid to rest.  It was pretty busy for dinner and we had to wait a little as it seemed to be run by only two people: one cook and one server/cashier.  We had no problem with the wait since the server was helpful and the food was delish!"}
{"text":"My go to place for pho when I have a craving. Sort of hole-in-the-wallish but very tasty. Good portion sizes for the money and everything tastes fresh and wonderful. Even better, the prices are lower than most of the places I've been to in the area. I've been to the one closer to ASU and I think the prices here are better than that one too."}
{"text":"I did a \"to-go\" order at Pho Nhat last week and thought it was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. It's not my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Valley, but I'll probably go back again to give it a second opinion. I wasn't a huge fan of the peanut sauce since it was more spice and less sweet.

The Bun was tasty, but didn't seem as fresh as some of the other places I've eat at. This could have been because I got it to go, so I'll give it another chance sometime. 

The restaurant seemed clean and bright and it was packed at lunchtime, which is usually a good sign."}
{"text":"This place is by far way superior for their Bun Bo Hue than anywhere in the USA.  I have traveled all over the world (including Little Saigon in Westminister) and this place is still by far THE BEST (I have eaten at thousands of restaurants all over the world).  Can't say the same for their Pho (Da Vang and Phu Thanh has better Pho in my opinion in PHX).  It has been over there for 10 years now and it has endured the test of time.  No one that I know have complained about the quality of food there that I know of and I know Asian clients are the most difficult to please.  Lightening fast service no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since 2000. The food is always great. I've never had bad service. Sure, the ambiance may be basic but that doesn't bother me. I'll be back"}
{"text":"My Asian friends swear by this food as a hang-over cure.  I think it's pretty tasty for lunch any day of the week.  They've got fried rice dishes, soup dishes and some yummy appetizers.  I personally love the Seafood Maloney noodles.  The shrimp rolls for an appetizer hit the spot too.  I'd also recommend their Thai iced tea too, if you like the sweet stuff.  Quick, cheap, nutritious."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of their lemongrass chicken and rice (this is not the actual name of the meal) - it was tasty. I've asked for a side of soup for 50c, it was a perfect meal combo for me. It's amazing and kinda not, that this place is employed by a family. When we were there, the kid helps out in cleaning the table, the husband takes and delivers the food on the table and the wife cooks. That's prob the reason why service is kinda slow. When you order your food, also ask for water/soda, and dessert at the same time."}
{"text":"The reason for the 3 stars is I dint like what I ordered. It was beef and egg rolls with noodles. The noodles was dry, but they gave me a sauce on the side in which I dont know if that has to be mixed in the noodles or  it has to be the sauce for eggrolls. I have been to their Mesa location though, it was a great experience. I'm gonna make a review on that one separately :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Pho and this place was horrific! I was craving a loaded Pho soup and decided to try this place for takeout on my way home from the airport. Everything was aweful. The soup base was a thin salty chicken stock, no fresh basil (parsley instead!), the spring rolls were stuffed with browned lettuce and as thin as a hot dog, and the egg rolls were stuffed with something unrecognizable (and tasted like they were frozen packaged). The sauces were also inedible. I was starving and ended up throwing it away and eating a PB&J. What a disappointment. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money at this place."}
{"text":"Always consistent!!!
I've been coming here off & on for 9 years now.
The cheapest pho places I've been in AZ.
Large pho & spring roll for$12.17.
Price is great & the food is good.
Small little restaurant operated by husband & wife. Love supporting small businesses!!!"}
{"text":"We found Pho Nhat while on the highway and asking for Pho nearby. We expected the soup to be fresh, hot, and with amazing delicious broth. We were not disappointed with the our food. The  service was prompt. I recommend this place to anyone looking for fair priced delicious pho and is not looking for a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for Phoenix Pho. 

While they may be closed on Sundays and during the holidays (check ahead), you can satisfy your Pho craving here. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Service is incredible and fast. The prices are great and the serving sizes are HUGE. 

Pho Nhat is Pho-tastic!"}
{"text":"Nhat or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Lemongrass Chicken

A friend of mine loves this place for their lemongrass chicken. When I tried it the first time, I was a little turned off. The chicken had the texture of... not chicken and the dish was soaked in chili oil.

Now, a year later, I'm hooked on the stuff. The dish is perfectly spicy and even the diced onions it's cooked with are delicious. Once you get over the chicken, it's a winner."}
{"text":"Actually the worst Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to. I can't say how the other dishes were but their noodle salad (#42 bun with shrimp and egg roll) shrimp not really grilled (bland). No mint in the salad but parsley!! Used what appeared to be iceberg. No Vietnamese pickled veggies.  Just really bland and not good. 

Service was great."}
{"text":"I love their beef stew.  #28 is absolutely yummy. :) close to ASU right off of the highway."}
{"text":"Dee-lish! This is hands down one of the best places for Phó. It's a hole-in-the-wall place (I think an old Taco Bell) the guy who runs the place works his tail off as hostess,  server and cashier. The Phó here has such fresh ingredients and is to your table in no time! Pretty  fast service especially considering how busy they get.

  If you're looking for a fancy place with friendly service then go elsewhere. If you want some fresh,  delicious, fast Phó then this is your place Phó sho!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I love this place! Seriously the broth is what we can't get anywhere else. Would love to have more variety to put into my pho(like egg or sea weed) but that's the only downside. Your missing out if you haven't checked them out yet!"}
{"text":"Ok, don't freak out when you first walk in. This is what one might call a \"hole in the wall\" sort of place, however it carries the fame of hole-in-the-wall places - FABULOUS FOOD.

There is just something magical about this place.....every dish is just so flavorful, it's insane. The best pho and bun I've had in phx is definitely here! Now, please, when you go, do not expect the best of service. There is only ever one person cooking and one person serving. This place get's PACKED and he (the server/owner) often get's behind. Usually there are several tables full people or the dirty dishes they leave behind. You may have to wait a bit for a clean table, however once you order, the food comes fairly fast.

Number 42 is AWESOME if you are in the mood for Bun, and for Pho, you must try the rare beef. Remember, come for the food, not the service!"}
