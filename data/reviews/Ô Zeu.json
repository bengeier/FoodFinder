{"text":"It is a great environment place. The staff is amazingly friendly it makes everyone being friendly among eachother. As for the food it is a Delish! Its tasty fresh and just well made food is GOOD."}
{"text":"Service rapide, amical. Une belle assiette copieuse. Servi avec accompagnement de pommes au four, très bon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there 2 weeks ago for breakfast because he's not a really big fan of Cora and we wanted somewhere close.   DELICIOUS ! I was not disappointed ! They gave us a table near the kitchen and we could see the chefs making our food (: Staff was really friendly, smoothies were good and my breakfast was yummy and filling ! Inexpensive and totally worth the stop."}
{"text":"Malgré une apparence peu invitante vu de l'extérieur, le restaurant à déjeuners Ô Zeu est devenu mon favori depuis que j'ai découvert leur variété d'oeufs bénédictines et de leur choix parmi cinq sauces hollandaises divines. Je craque pour celle à l'aneth, juste d'y penser j'ai faim! Le personnel est toujours sympathique, la nourriture fraîche et le rapport qualité/prix, excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ozeu many times, I always enjoyed the familial atmosphere and their food, but for some reason although my overall experience hasn't really change, I feel that their food has a bit changed and not in a good way. They do have a lot of choices and could be considered cheap, but hey aren't we all going there to enjoy the food? I ordered a smoothie (which is probably the worst I ever had in a while) with their asparagus and ham Benedictine which was served with the traditional potatoes (in this case uncooked not so brown ones). The four stars are because of my past experiences at this spot, but this time was a no-no."}
{"text":"Horrible service, can take 3 hours to have breakfast. Have to constantly ask for refills and the bill has taken 30-45 minutes to come to us. YET, it's so worth going!! The egg Benedict are amazing!!!! Best around town by far!!!"}
{"text":"I'm just trying to keep my tears ahah cause I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I'm okay to spend an hour to reach to the restaurant just for a breakfast! I live in New York City and I wish we had this place here! I went there 2 times and every time I'm in Montreal this is going to be my first place to visit! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not amazing. As far as breakfast goes, 20$ per person is ok but surely not cheap. I would recommend trying it at least once if youre thinking about it"}
{"text":"Great place, the decor is dated but what's in the plate is fresh and plentiful.  I've been a couple of time in this spot and I'm always amazed by the price/quality.  Sure that place is old and nothing Instagram worthy. But the priciest plate is like 15$ you can get steak and egg for 15$. That's ridiculous.   The different plates are consistently good and well balanced. It's a place I know I can order the less typical breakfast club and be wow by it."}
{"text":"Endroit sans prétention qui est maintenant une habitude! Je déplore qu'ils aient changé le chef (les pommes de terres n'ont plus exactement le même goût qu'elles avaient), mais les oeufs bénédictines sont toujours appréciés. Les assiettes sont copieuses, la sauce est bonne, le service est rapide. N'y cherchez pas une découverte culinaire, mais c'est toujours une valeur sûre. Je recommande sans hésiter"}
{"text":"Depuis que j'habite l'est de l'île, je recherche un endroit pour déjeuner autre que le Cora de PAT. Je fondais probablement beaucoup d'espoir sur le Ozeu. Bref, j'ai été déçue. La bouffe était pas trop mal, pas extraordinaire non plus, mais la propreté des salles de bain laissait à désirer."}
{"text":"Wow! Go here. Order anything. If you can't decide get the Eggs Benedict. Pancakes are great. Omelette safe delicious. Yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Service ordinaire, pas de sucre ni crème à la table. Serveuse na rien apporté même après m'avoir servit le café. Tasse de café n'était pas propre. Ma servi de l'eau tiède sans glace. Était plus occupé à parler avec des amis a un autre table... Mauvaise serveuse, probablement. J'ai pas vraiment le gout de ressayer."}
{"text":"Great little brunch place I accidentally discovered on my way. What a pleasant surprise. There is a nice spacious terrace with a glass wall to isolate the feeling ur not on Sherbrooke. Music outdoor is a nice touch. Indoor also looks very warm and comfortable and blocks the wind (great design). I'd come back in the winter. The food was amazing lots of flavor, but Not over whelming.  I ordered the omelette with Portobello and Brie. It was delicious, I wolfed it down!  It's not often I get to have this omelette and taste the Brie and mushrooms. What made this place unique was the cinnamon apples, fantastic. Once again not overwhelming or too sweat, I can almost say they were perfect. I'd take this over ape sauce or backed beans any day . While looking around I have to say if you have a sweet tooth on the morning, don't hesitate to try the waffles. They looked tasteful and it's my next choice!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to brunch in the East End.  I was a bit surprised at my last visit because the prices went up on the menu. That's what made me put a 4 stars instead of a 5, because I would recommend this place !   It used to be very affordable (it still is!!) for very generous portions.  For an example, I have a hard time finished the whole serving of benedict eggs by myself.  I love their potatoes / crispy !  The staff is always nice. In the summer you can eat outside.  You should get there before 10h on the week-ends, it gets busy quickly. Easy parking around."}
{"text":"Restaurant à déjeuner intéressant par la qualité de sa nourriture, les portions sont généreuses et tout est bon et frais du cretons fait maison au pain qui est de bonne qualité.  Par contre l'endroit était rempli et très bruyant. Une petite radio derrière le comptoir montée au maximum crachait des sons aigües pour mieux agresser nos oreilles. J'y retournerait pour la nourriture mais je leur demanderait de fermer la radio."}
{"text":"Un incontournable quand on veut des oeufs bénédictines! Service généralement très rapide et courtois, avec exceptions peut-être si c'est l'heure de pointe. Très achalandé les weekends entre 10 et midi.   Les prix ont monté récemment et c'est un peu plus cher que les petites places indépendantes. Sinon, je le recommande pour ceux qui en ont marre des chaines de restaurants à déjeuner, essayez-le."}
{"text":"Ok. Let me just start by saying there are absolutely no other good breakfast restaurant in this neck of the woods so this 4 star review could easily be a 5 star one if you consider this.   Food: The menu is huge and the prices are pretty low. I usually take 2 eggs with one meat for like 8$ w/ taxes. I however tried to derive from my basicness once and ordered eggs benedict... Bad call. The hollandaise sauce is pretty bad. Nonetheless, the eggs are always cooked perfectly and the potatoes are on point so it's no surprise I keep coming back  Service: The young servers are super nice and the service is always quick. There are a few (older) female servers that will still give you a decent service but minus the smile on their faces (I usually prefer friendliness on a Saturday morning hungover but maybe that just me).  Extra info: -They don't serve mimosas... *sad face* -Do not go there on weekends between 10-12:30...pure chaos"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Friendly staff! Clean! Huge menu to choose from! Very fresh !! This place was the best breakfast I've had in years! The fruit tasted like it was just picked from a plant and washed and cut for my plate! The eggs tasted like they were just picked from a farm! The bread was just perfect! All I can say is go see for yourself.  PERFECTO!"}
