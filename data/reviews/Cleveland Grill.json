{"text":"This place was awesome.  My fiance found it on the internet.  We had friends in town from Chicago and decided to go.  The food was amazing!!!!  The price was just right.  It was one of the top three meals I have ever had in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Be Warned: The Cleveland Grill is easy to miss as you drive down W117th. To be honest, it the type of drive where you would expect to find a stylish, romantic restaraunt that I would recommend to out of town friends. Perhaps that is why I do recommend it. It is unique and unpretentious at the same time. The food (Mediterranean themed) is tasty and well-priced. You will love the selection and variety the menu offers. You feel like you are getting a bargain and have discovered a diamond in the rough when you leave the Cleveland Grill....check it out if you haven't. It is easily accessible from I-90 and I-71, as well as sides of town."}
