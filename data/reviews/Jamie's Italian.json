{"text":"The only star I give this place is for the atmosphere and decor. The food was completely bland and of mediocre quality. A friend and I ordered prawn linguine which tasted as though a child could have made it using boiled spaghetti and jarred marinara sauce. The prawns were of frozen store quality, and even then I've had better. Completely disappointed as the  name and price range of this restaurant lead to much higher expectations. Don't waste your money, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service is quite an issue here , it seems that they are missing staff or there's some organizational problems. The food was pretty good, we had the Italian nachos and superfood salad as starters , the salad is delicious! For the main courses we orders the steak and fries and the chicken puttanesca, the steak was not warm at all unfortunately. The manager approached us and he was very nice and insisted on remaking the steak for us , he was very professional. The ricotta cheesecake was also delicious.  It was delicious, I just wouldn't go there during their busiest times."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but service was horrible. Sat at the bar around 9pm on weeknight. I was ignored the entire time while the bartenders cleaned and completed nightly tasks. Had to ask for each and everything I ordered. So disappointing! Way too expensive of a meal (entree, wine, dessert) to be ignored."}
{"text":"So decided to make a trip to Jamie's restaurant for some good food and ambience. Eight weeks after opening, its now a first come first serve, no reservations.  Waited 3 hours for a table of five. Does that make sense? Why? Noticed a party of 6 who waited less time and were seated ahead of us, hmm. Another table of 12 is seated ahead of us. Manager, told they don't seat a party of 5 in a table of 6. Why would they lose that one seat. Really? Translation/interpretation, if u don't like it u can leave. Not a good start, and the attitude from the Manager, was astonishing. Once I complained further, got a table of 4 in which they seated 5. So ambience was missing...and accommodation.   The food, ordered the garlic bread and ravioli fritti's. Ravioli frittis were very good. Garlic bread was a Naan (homemade pizza dough) with garlic bread and rosemary, really? Main course, salmon and the 10oz ribeye, both were very good.  The ribeye was very thin for a steak, but was tasty. No time for dessert as we were very tired. The waiter was very accommodating and friendly, a positive.  Overall, my experience at Jaime's: money over customer experience, food was nothing special or different then other similar type restaurants. Two words, very disappointed."}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely here, very nice interior. The food is pretty good but nothing exceptional. I had their super salad which did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Hostesses were polite. Tried to make conversation on the way to table. Service was timely. Bruschetta was $10 per slice. My burger with no bun at my request was tasty but a little dry. I told the waiter politely to tell the chef just a minute or two less on cooking. My 8 oz glass of Sauvignon blanc was $20+  Phew!! Music was too loud. Couldn't have conversation. Even the waiter agreed it was too loud when I asked him to lower volume. It's ok. I have another reservation coming up. Hopefully I have a better follow up review."}
{"text":"Delisious food and great prices, plus a cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. Will definitely come back for another dinner."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Our waiter really did try his hardest to make our evening great but unfortunately, the food really wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped. First of all, the portions are really small. For $19.00 for a plate of pasta, I was expecting a huge plate. Sadly, the restaurant had other plans. I guess I just had really high expectations.  When your significant other looks at you and says \"You can make better pasta than this\" and you're not Italian... then you know its not so great. Sorry, Jamie!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, mixed between a 3 & 4 Star rating. I feel that it will easily be a 3.5/4 Star rating but the service was slow. Not overly slow but enough that  we (3) questioned whether they forgot our order. We had a pizza, Caprese salad, ravioli, fries & a few drinks. The quality of the food was good but nothing spectacular that we ordered. The little ravioli were quite good and the mozzarella cheeze in the pizza was good but the caprese salad was swimming in half an inch or more of olive oil.   On the other hand the service we did get was really good! She knew everything, was kind,and  descriptive. Unfortunately slow though...  Sort of disappointed but I'll chalk this up to being a new restaurant and March break. I'll   hopefully be back though as other dishes looked great :)"}
{"text":"Had a lunch there when shopping at YD. overall it is an Italian style of JOey. The appetizer taste ok but the portion was smaller than other Italian places such as Terroni, same goes with pasta. The pizza was horrible, burnt and the bottom and veggie still raw on the topping.   Food: 2.5/5 Service:3/5 Value:1/5"}
{"text":"Sorry Jamie love your shows and books but this restaurant is not up to standard.  Mediocre service.   Had reservation but still had to wait almost 25 mins. Menu was dirty and sticky with food.  Food took almost 45 mins to come First were told as the server flitted past our table \"food should be right out...\".  Yet we continued to wait.  She then came by to say kitchen was backed with a large party and could she offer us a complimentary bread basket. Really? How about a round of drinks instead. Any case we took the bread. One friend then discovered her cloth napkin was dirty.  Yuck   Next we noticed that a table that ordered well after us git their food.  When we flagged down server to comment on this she said was because they ordered pasta. And the grill was being occupied by large orders of fish.  Meanwhile none of our food was grilled!  Finally got our food.  Food was fine but nothing special that would make us want to return."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. Will not go back ever.  We've eaten several times at Jamie's Italian in the UK- fabulous food and value. As always, when something arrives in TO, the food and value never follow.  First of all, I ordered  the half  portion of tagliatelle - shocked to get the bill and find that the tiny half  portion they gave me was only reduced to $13.95 from the full portion price of $17.95. We were expecting $10.95 or $11.95 at most. TOTAL RIPOFF.  Also, no basket of bread served with the meal.  The spinach Ravioli had about 5 pieces of sad spinach floating in a very very bland white sauce-$19.95!!!  No spinach inside the ravioli either.  Tea was $3.50.  Overall - very overpriced and not one bit worth it.  I miss Famoso upstairs where the food was awesome and lunch for 2 was under $30.  Service was also bad. Our server was nowhere to be found and other servers kept coming by to tell us he'd be there soon to get our order. He also never brought the bill, another server showed up and apologized for him.  Do not go here ( but try his places in the UK if you ever get there)."}
{"text":"Greeting staff is pleasant and friendly.  Waiters and servers are a different story. We were sitting for well over 20 minutes before we were finally able to wave someone down.  We got the arugula salad, the garlic bread, the burger and the steak.  The arugula salad was nothing special. It was seasoned with vinaigrette and Parmesan cheese. The order was decent for the smaller size we ordered.  The garlic bread was delicious. We got it with the sun dried tomato and black olives.  The steak was very juicy and tender. It was very good, but nothing that couldn't be made at home.   The burger was very dry and the patty was burned. Upon informing the waiter this, he merely said \"oh...\" and walked away.  The fries paired with both main courses were well seasoned and delicious.  Overall, I was unimpressed with the restaurant staff and food. I expected the food to taste better than it did. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Discovered this place after Yorkdale close. Great atmosphere. We ordered a drink and charcuterie plank, outstanding flavours in your palate.  After we share a caprese salad. Do not expect typical Italian salad. Amazing salad with different kinds of roasted tomatoes, cheese melting in your mouth.  Service was excellent. We cannot wait to go back and try mains and pastas.  Lovely experience overall."}
{"text":"Ordered the special - Lobster Ravioli.  Food was very good,  however,  very pricey. If they had a printed specials menu,  I probably wouldn't have ordered it.  Overall ambiance was exceptional. Service was very good."}
{"text":"OVER PRICED!!! Ordered a Margarita Pizza and that was a disappointment, the pizza was so thin, ive seen construction paper thicker then that. Felt like a flattened flatbread. One small piece of Basil, not enough cheese or sauce overall was a disappointment, would not recommend ever, non alcoholic drinks were good tho"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried turkey - simply a turkey breast deep fried with bread crumbs, a bit too greedy for me, nothing special in terms of tasting, a bit disappointed for the price.  Mushroom Pasta was okay, but the portion keeps getting smaller compared to when it first opened.   Service was soooooo slow, I understand I came in Friday for dinner after shopping, but I waited 20 min in between courses, way too slow.  In all, if you want to spent $30 per person and (pay for your own bread) to eat something more decent than food court, this place is one of the options.  Happy to know Eataly is coming to Toronto soon at more convenient location (Loblaws) with more open dining concept (pick your own and watch it cooked)."}
{"text":"This place is great, after another adventure with my friend we ended up at Jamie's because it closed late even on weekdays. When we arrived I was starving like really really really hungry so there might be a bias that everything tasted like I was in heaven. Our waitress for for the most part was very cheerful and attentive. My partner had the crab pasta which tasted alright, but it felt a bit lacklustre since I felt like eating lobster e-fu noodles. The crab bruschetta was great especially the hot peppers that added the extra kick. As for my pappardelle, it tasted awesome, simply awesome. Desert was affogato  which was a first time for me. The bitterness of the espresso and the sweetness of ice cream was truly a unique taste. All in all I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Before giving this place a try I hopped onto YELP to brief and prepare myself.  I was quite surprised that a restaurant branded by renown chef, Jamie Oliver has a 3 star average rating.  With absolutely zero expectations, I gave the restaurant the benefit of a doubt.  If the food was that mediocre then at least I wouldn't leave with a worse impression.  I was actually much more impressed after the meal was done.  My wife ordered the Porcini Fettuccini and the Carne pizza for myself.  The pasta dish had the perfect amount of mushrooms to the buttery sauce.  The toasted garlic added a nice crunch to the hand made al dente pasta.    Now the pizza at an Italian restaurant are usually hits or misses.  Typically, the crust is extra thick and the middle is as thin as paper.  Good luck trying to pick up a slice without the centre dropping and having all the toppings and cheese slide off.  Here's the secret to turn a pizza into an exceptional pizza.  You ask for it to be well-done.  The server mentioned that the pizza's were all made well-done.  Well dear, then keep it in the oven a few more minutes.  Let's just say the bottom of my well-done pizza was crispy.  My toppings were pipping hot.  The center, more-or-less held itself without dropping.  The crust had some smokey charred bits, but it was a beautiful blended flavor from a true wood burning oven.  I give this place a 3.5 stars.  If I didn't custom order my pizza, I would have had a disappointing wet pizza.  The decor doesn't really fit the \"Italian\" theme which doesn't reflect what is served on a plate."}
{"text":"This was my first time going out to Jamie's Italian restaurant. Went with a couple of friends for 7:30p.m. but told it was a 45 minute wait. This was fine because the hostess said we could sit and wait in the lounge area by the windows in the mean time.   We had quick service in the lounge area and we ordered an appetizer to split, which was easily transferred over to our final bill when we got to the dining room.   I ordered the burger italiano for my main dish. It was cooked well and all of the flavours complimented each other. The only downside to that meal was the wait time, which ended up being approximately 54 minutes.  Tonight I did not mind the wait because I was catching up with some old friends, but on any other day I would not enjoy waiting this long for a burger.   For dessert, my friends and I split the tiramisu and the epic brownie. The tiramisu was moist and had a good flavour to it, but the brownie trumped it by far; it was indeed EPIC! The popcorn was a little strange to go along with a brownie and vanilla gelato, but overall the brownie was the highlight of the night.   Overall good experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"FOOD:  We ordered pastas (crab, Jamie's sausage and Bolognese) and artisan breads and crispy squid.  All dishes were tasty and well done.  Pasta was a little bit on the salty side but delicious none the less (all 3 dishes).  The portions were large and appetizers very shareable.  The coffee was also very good! We had espresso based drinks.    SERVICE:  We made a reservation but came way too early.  They were polite and told us they will try their best to accommodate us.  We walked around the mall for about 40 minutes before they texted us that our table was ready (about 40 minutes before our reservation time).  They accommodated us with a stroller and it was very comfortable at the table. The hostess addressed us by name and was very nice.  Staff was friendly.    ATMOSPHERE:  Very nice ambiance,  not too hot, comfortable seating. It's a nice mixed crowd, families, couples,  groups etc.  I didn't feel awkward nursing my baby right at the table.  Music was good too.    CLEANLINESS:  Overall restaurant was very clean,  tables were clean and tableware nicely polished.  The only complaint I have would be the restrooms were not very clean.  Especially the family restroom,  the baby change table was a sesspool. I suppose that's the fault of people who have no hygiene, but the management could keep a better eye on the cleanliness of the restrooms as the last thing I want is to lose my appetite or have my meal ruined due to an unsanitary restroom.    OVERALL:  Worth the price,  could use a little improvement here and there but overall satisfactory meals, nice experience and would recommend it.  I would return with my family again or have it as a nice date spot for me and my husband."}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected of something with Jamie Oliver's name attached to it. What a disappointment. We went with 5 people. A couple of our dishes were basically inedible and the others were nothing to write home about. Plus, it's pricey. If you're at Yorkdale, save your money and eat at the food court then go to one of the amazing Italian restaurants 416 has to offer."}
{"text":"Food was generally good, however it was quite disorganized as it took a long time for the food to arrive. Mains were arriving before apps and even then it took 45-50 min for the first app. One of the managers noticed how long our group had waited and offered us a misc bread basket and advised our food would arrive shortly.   Being that the restaurant is pretty new they definitely have some issues to work out, however servers were friendly and knowledgeable with the menu.   We ordered the Ravioli Frittati and Mushroom flat bread -which was very small about the size of a cell phone. For mains we had the Prawn linguini, Rabbit Pasta, and Prosciutto arugula Pizza. All of them were tasty, pasta are generally not  large portions. For dessert we had the lemon meringue cheesecake with raspberry. All in all a good meal aside from the long wait for the food."}
{"text":"This is the worst Italian Restaurant I've ever been in GTA area,the servers don't know why they're doing. And the food just not presentable AT ALL.the worst part is the dishes are DIRTY. I don't not recommend people to come into this restaurant,I rather to make the lineup for Cheesecake Factory. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Had the gnocchi and a pizza. Appetizers were small for the price. House Wine was pretty good. Ordered some garlic and rosemary fries that were undercooked and underwhelming. They were so disappointing that we had it taken off our bill. Not impressed with a place that has \"Jamie Oliver\" on it. Expected much better. Won't waste my money again"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I read about Jamie's Italian opening in Toronto we were super excited:D  We could not wait because we love Italian food.  My first visit to Jamie's Italian was in the spring and it was amazing!  I had the famous prawn linguine, the pasta was fresh, tomato sauce was to die for, the garlicky giant prawns were tender & delicious! My bf had the porcini fettuccine and he loved it.  The price was on the high side but we didn't mind because the pasta was delicious.  The cocktail drinks were good but we were disappointed with the serving size, too small:(  Service was great, attentive staff and we felt important.  The food was so good we went back two days later for lunch.  Again really good pasta, this time we skipped the drinks.  Service 2nd time around was okay not the same as the first time.  A few months later, we went back, this was our 3rd time and this was NOT the 3rd time's the charm one may think:/  I ordered the same famous prawn linguine (I love seafood!) I noticed something odd.  O M G, the prawns were now tiny shrimps.  AND they no longer offered complimentary house-baked focaccia, ciabatta bread!  You now pay, if you want carbs.  Cheap! Not nice.  This past weekend, I was weak, I confess, I made a mistake, went to Jamie Italian hoping that they may have gone back to how they were, when they first opened.  Nope, I was WRONG.  The pasta was bland, tomato sauce was lacking, the garlicky prawns were long gone, it was still the tiny shrimps & they weren't even deveined!  Pasta lacked the rich fresh garlicky tomato sauce that made us fall in love with Jamie's Italian.  We also noticed the portion size of the crispy squids keeps shrinking in size.  They should rename it \"a one two bite size crispy squids\".  This was our 4th time dining at Jamie's Italian.  Not impressed.  The service was average like every where else.  The special feeling we had disappeared.  We noticed a lot of changes in the food and service and we will not be returning unfortunately.  We had high hopes for Jamie's Italian, thought we found our favourite Italian restaurant to dine weekly. Would have rated it 5/5 if standard was kept high.  We are very disappointed and would not recommend.  Arrivederci Jamie's Italian.  Gordon Ramsay would be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had really high hopes but disappointing. Food is too salty and not impressive at all. All hype but no substance, unfortunately. Would not recommend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my boyfriend and will not recommend to others. Atmosphere is great but food was not the greatest. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer which was ok, the mushroom pizza was good but the meatball pasta was the worst. It was bland, the pasta was hard and the meatball was salty."}
{"text":"The service was amazing but the food was awful! We got appetizers that were supposed to be warm but were cold. The portions were very small and tasteless. We stopped after a few bites and ended up going to another restaurant. Definitely will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. My 12 year old son said his sliders were good, but he didn't care much for the sides (salad and baby potatoes with sour cream). My wife and I had bruschetta appetizer for 10. It was tasty and fresh, but quite small. She liked her burger fine and it had nice grilled flavour with tasty toppings, especially the onions. I had the  bolognese pasta which tasted good as well. No sides come with the lunches, except the kids lunch.  Overall the food was good, but the kids sides could have been better choices (they do prefer fries or kettle chips rather than boiled potatoes). We also felt the prices were rather steep for what we had. We headed over to a food court to fill up my son directly afterwards. We spent $90 with the 15% tip, and I was the only one who ordered a drink. I guess you have to pay for Jamie Oliver food, and my wife is a fan. However, even she says that it will be her one and only visit."}
{"text":"I heard great things about the restaurant, so we decided to try it.  We went on a Sunday, and found it suprisingly busy.. We were seated very fast which was great. We started with the a crab lemon appetizer it came out on a very hard and burned bread same as the eggplant appetizer we got. It was the hardest thing to eat!!!! I ordered the creamy mushroom pasta..which for the price was a very small portion. I wouldn't go back again ."}
{"text":"I'll give it two stars because the food was edible and our server was nice but beyond that it was grossly overpriced ($10 for a tiny bruschetta, $3.50 for a 4oz americano coffee and $18 for a bland, not very big salad with chicken on it, for examples) kids meals were a ripoff, flavours were mostly bland, timing was terrible (kids were finished eating before our mains even showed up) etc.   Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was only mediocre but I've definitely had better Italian food around the city. The most disappointing part was the service, we waited almost an hour for our appetizers to which the waitress got both orders wrong. The mains came only minutes after the appetizers, it just felt very disorganized and chaotic. I had expected more from Jamie Oliver's restaurants..."}
{"text":"I would normally give a food review but that would be impossible given my experience. I stopped by the restaurant after shopping and I asked to do takeout. The so called hostess told me that \"we do not do takeaway as takeaway is not considered Italian !\"  As someone who is Italian (abruzzo and Calabria) I take personal offence to that. Further, i have been to Italy a number of times and I can tell you that \"takeaway\" is done all the time. How ironic this coming from such a \"mangiacake\" like Jamie a Oliver. In addition, I decided to book a table. They told me it was a 1 hour wait and they would text me. I received a text almost 2 hours later. Whoever they hire at the front needs to be replaced ASAP and Jamie needs to visit Rome to experience the \"takeaway\" experience"}
{"text":"Service = bad.  Food = meh.   We were going to go to Joey's but decided to try Jamie's just for kicks and boy were we disappointed! We had the nachos for appetizer which was just like eating a bag of combos. I ordered the Meatball Parpadelle and it was the blandest pasta I have ever had! There was absolutely no taste to it whatsoever.  The service was so bad, I don't even want to talk about him!"}
{"text":"Jamie Oliver is one of my favourite chefs and I was really excited to hear he was partnering up and opening a restaurant in Toronto. So I was looking forward to trying out this restaurant but it turned out to be a bit underwhelming. First I made a reservation and when we arrived the hostess seated us promptly. I had hoped for a seat in the center of the restaurant instead I got a seat near the pasta station so I felt like we were stuck in a corner. We ordered the arancini, the fresh crab spaghetti and the honeycomb cannelloni. The arancini came with 3 and one was cut in half. So the half one was already on the warm side by the time it came. It was good but not the best I've had. The fresh crab spaghetti was very salty. Not sure why maybe the artichokes or the capers but it was salty. Then the honeycomb cannelloni was bland. Seemed like they put the salt in my spaghetti instead of the cannelloni. The cannelloni filling was good and quite rich and heavy. The service was good but it would have been nice if she came and asked us how the food was after we tasted the food not when we just got served the food. The only way I could respond was to say it LOOKS good. Overall everything seemed to be just good, the food was good not great not amazing, service was also good. I would definitely give this place a second chance but if I still have the same experience I will not come back especially since this is on the pricey side. I came for lunch and just those items came to a $50. Maybe next time I'll come during dinner."}
{"text":"I am BIG fun of Jamie Oliver's shows,so today was my 4th ani of moving to Toronto. so we picked this place to try something new. the guy who was hosting,he did amazing job  care about staff who works there and taking care of line,and greeting to new customer. and girls who works at bar are so friendly,they asked as drink right timing and chatting little bit with customers but working so hard.the speed they provide to make drink is amazing. so we didn't mind at all for waiting time with great service.  we got a small table nice and cozy,decided what to order... my husband picked pork chop grill,and i ordered shrimp pasta. sold out the pasta. its ok busy night 9;30pm i gonna pick something else. and picked other things, yes sold out ummm ok ordered other pasta which i don't even wanted,  appetizer ; garlic bread and fried squid. both of them taste really great!! just problem was waited 30min to get them.  and ok waiting waiting for main dishes for extra 40 min here its the guy brought looking yummy main dishes for us and also spilled my drink on me. thanks god it make things more funny.  and tried pasta right away cause i was so hungry!!! Pasta was so dried due to sitting on the counter 10 min and a chef was adding more and more olive oil during waiting pork chop.  yes,now you can guess,my pasta was SUPER DRY and SUPER SALTY. and my pants was soaking wet.  This has to be a joke.and it was actually fun experience.thanks for making my day guys."}
{"text":"Overpriced food & small portions. What kind of a restaurant doesn't provide complimentary bread?! As for the quality of the food itself, very mediocre. Save your money and go somewhere else, don't be fooled by the \"Jamie Oliver\" name."}
{"text":"For a Jamie Oliver restaurant i had much higher expectations. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but nothing out of this world. The prices are higher than other places for the portion, but then i wouldn't expect it to be less for a Jamie's Italian.   The mushroom pasta was a bit bland. I enjoyed the mojito and the lemon cheesecake."}
{"text":"I wanted pasta and was on my way to Joey's when I noticed Jamie's, I obviously had to try it! I sat at the bar, everyone was very friendly and knowledgable plus the bar was a gorgeous white marble. Almost the entire menu has small or large portions. which is great for sharing and sampling lots of things. I wanted to try the Caesar but they ran out of mix so had a daily cocktail Blue Valentine which was amazing, perfect balance of sweet and acidic.  For an appetizer I had the caprese salad, it was very good, lots of herbs. I had the porcini fettucini as an entree, it was great but I'm a big eater and the small portion left me hungry still. The wine by the glass is a little pricy as well but had a glass of Pinot Grigio with my entree. Since I was still hungry I ordered the tiramisu after recommendation from both bar tenders, it was very pretty, lots of layers and and pretty big size. The orange zest was a little bit overpowering for me but very good still. Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"My sister and I took my my sister and my brother in law to Jaime's for their  birthdays. We were very excited given the name attached to the restaurant. It was one of the worst dining experiences. When I walked in they had seated my 3 relatives at a table by the door where the cold air came in. My sister was not well.I asked to  move immediately since there were many empty tables inside. This has happened to me many times which leads me to think that this is systemic racism in the restaurant industry. As visible minorities we get the worst seating available. The food was so awful we skipped dessert and went to Nadege café in the mall to have dessert. My brother in law had to look for food in the fridge when he got home. Jamie should be ashamed of himself to attach his name to this place. Save your $ and eat at home."}
{"text":"We went here on Sun Dec 20 for lunch.  Arrived at 1pm.  We didn't have reservations but we were seated quickly.  It was my husband me and my two kids.  Age 2 and 4.   When we got to the table it was rather crowded for us to park our stroller so we moved it to the side.  I appreciate the fact that they did accomidated the kids.  There was crayons, colouring page and a binocular for them to keep themselves occupied while we ordered.    I ordered the small Porcini Fettuccine to share with my kids.  My husband ordered the Prosciutto and arugula salad.  For appetizer we also ordered the large size My caprese salad and Fresh crab bruschetta.  When the crab bruschetta arrived we were shocked to see how tiny it was.  For $10 it was a big rip off.  We even mentioned it to the waiter.  The table seated next to us told us they ordered the same thing and was surprised at the size of it.  The next thing that came out was the caprese salad.  Again portions are so tiny.  My husband ask the waiter is he sure thats a large size.  I can't imagine what a small size would look like.  My husband knew this wouldn't be filling so he ordered the wild mushroom bruschetta and the sicilian caponata bruschetta.  We gave the crab and sicilian bruschetta to my kids to try.  They spit it out and started crying.  They said it was spicy.  No where on the menu said that it was spicy.  As you can see from the pictures it was garnished with hot pepper.    The next thing that came out was the pasta and the pizza.  The pasta had red pepper throughout.  I tasted it.  It was spicy.  So I couldn't share with my kids.  I was so disappointed.  No where on the menu said this dish was spicy.  We mentioned this to the waiter.  He offered to have it replaced but we declined.  Few minutes later a manager came out and said she apologized. She said that all the wait staff will be informed to mention that the pasta is spicy. When the bill came the waiter told us the pasta was taken care off.  With tax and tip and for the food we ordered along with two glasses of house wine, it was $100.  It wasn't worth the money.  I will not be coming back here again.    Next time I will be going back to Moxie's or Milestones when I'm shopping at Yorkdale mall."}
{"text":"Place looks good, atmosphere is good and service was good but the food... pizza Margarita very low on cheese  fungi  pizza was better the pasta was over cooked sauce was ok ( porcini fettuccine and crab spaghetti) . Caprese salad was nothing special didn't feel like buffalo. Food was not bad but i was  disappointed"}
{"text":"So we tried again. This time,  better food! We had the eggplant pizza (special of the day), meatball paparadelle, polenta fries.  To start, we shared bruschetta of the day (zucchini). All was tasty although we had to add salt to everything.   Our real shocker came with the bill when we saw that hot sauce was $1.00.  Really Jamie?  We've had much better homemade hot sauces elsewhere... For free.  So save yourselves a loonie and ask for Tabasco or Frank's.   Other than the hot sauce surprise our meal went very well."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday or Friday night around 8PM and was seated immediately.  It wasn't very busy and the upstairs area was already closed off for the night.  Great ambiance, clean, great service and very friendly and helpful waitstaff, but despite the waiter's enthusiastic recommendations, I found my food was mediocre at best (even without taking into consideration the celebrity chef name - which is what I imagine draws a large # of diners).  Found my pork chop and salad to be very bland, boring and a bit on the dry side... :(  The \"world's best olives\" were really nothing special. I've had better olives from the grocery store at a fraction of the price... No, not the gross soggy ones in the jars.  Maybe I'll give the other menu items a shot... Maybe not.  Mehh..."}
{"text":"Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has opened his first restaurant in North America at Yorkdale Mall and I had a chance to eat there this evening (which happened to be opening night) after doing some Christmas shopping. Overall, the dining experience was quite good.  The restaurant is fairly spacious and has a relaxed and laid-back feel to it.  It wasn't too busy tonight and the overall noise level was quite acceptable as it allowed you to carry on a conversation without having to raise your voice or shout. Both the hostess and the waiter were very friendly and knowledgable about the establishment and the Jamie Oliver brand.  More importantly, they also had a good knowledge of the menu.  One minor oversight was the fact that the waiter made no mention of the specials which we only discovered by accident on a chalkboard as we were ending our meal. As far as the food is concerned, everything was quite excellent with just a couple of missteps which may have simply been due to the fact that this was their first official day in business and it would expected that there might be a couple of bumps.  We started with the mushroom fritti and the arugula salad.  The mushroom dish was excellent.  The mushrooms were expertly breaded and flavourful and the garlic mayo was fantastic.  However, the arugula salad seemed to be missing the aged balsamic dressing as there was little evidence of balsamic on the plate or on our tastebuds.  The arugula and radicchio was very fresh.  We also had the funky chips (garlic and herbed fries) which were also very good. For our main entrees, we had the bag-of-fish and the rabbit casarecce (originally, I had wanted the sausage pappardelle, but they ran out of this dish).  The rabbit pasta was quite good with excellent flavours however, I felt the past was just a little too al dente as I found it slightly too firm.  The bag-of-fish was terrific with good flavours and a little bit of kick given that there was a chili thrown in the mix. For dessert, we had the lemon meringue cheesecake.  I'm not one who really enjoys desserts so I will reserve making any comments, however, my wife certainly seemed to like the dish and felt the berry compote was a great compliment to the dessert. For the quality of the food and experience, the prices are very reasonable and there is little to fault or complain about when it comes to assessing the value of the meal. Overall, the dining experience at Jamie's Italian was quite positive and with a little more time, I believe the very minor missteps we experienced today will be a thing of the past.  I will definitely be returning in the future and would also recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a good, somewhat rustic, Italian meal in a comfortable setting and at a price that represents reasonable value."}
{"text":"Love the decor and vibe of this place, perfectly executed. The wait staff are professional and address the chefs as their proper titles. Our server knew the menu and made great recommendations. Calamari for an app was the right choice, sprinkled with chille peppers and a chille mayo, perfectly cooked and seasoned. We ordered the ravioli which was on a special and the meatball pepperdelle. Both which were delicious but very much on the salty side. Good size proportions, wish there was room for dessert! Families, girls night out..this place is perfect for any occassion."}
{"text":"Went to check it out a week ago. Ambiance and service are both quite nice and convenient. Main courses were good but not anything special.   Food -4/5 Service -5/5 Ambience - 5/5 Price to Value -4/5  Yes I would go back - and do recommend for a nice meal."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a sucker for anything Jamie Oliver.   I've been twice and both times were great. The atmosphere is nice and cozy, and the restaurant is done up well. The bar area in the middle on one side and the meats section on the other is a cool visual.   The food has been great both times. Special mention to the burger and polenta chips, which were delicious and mouth watering. The fried ravioli was a bit of a miss, though.   Service was great the first time, a little awkward the next, but not enough to put off the experience. Price points, while a bit above normal, are worth it for the experience of Jamie Oliver."}
{"text":"Wait staff did a very poor job of actually seating us. We opted for the lounge and was told to sit wherever.   Our waiter served table say after us before us and the food portions were very small for the price.   Taste of food was just ok but the food did arrive quickly.   Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Good Day! Make a reservation or you will scratching your fandangos..waiting for a table.  An Italian joint ...no VEAL?? Come On Man...what too plain to serve or it is \"meat\" dish...please you have \"rabbit\" on the menu right? Busy Place...ambiance A-OK...waiters, front door polite and courteous though I did find the waiter \"disappears\" once in a while...come on customer service means I should NOT have to look for my waiter over a street block right?  Where is the Manager? You think with a new jig he/she should be making some rounds...greeting..etc?? No? My wife's birthday...they told the cake is ON DA HOUSE...when I got home, checked the bill, \"che stupido!\"...was tagged $10.00 for a cheesy slice of cake...goodness. Check your bill! Normally I would give this experience a 2 star but you know what? New jig...growing pains and all that stuff within a grand opening...but please J.O (Jamie Oliver)...get some real veal on the menu?? COME ON MAN...not meat hiding in my pasta I have to find with a magnifying glass. I'll be back...give ya another chance.  Please adjust....top dollar, top restaurant...earn it. Your first one in the GTA I had heard?  Okay....COME ON MAN."}
{"text":"Pasta was tasty but that's about it. The arugula salad was just arugula. When we looked hard, we found a teeny little drop of dressing at the bottom of the bowl. Also a bit chintzy to charge extra for bread."}
{"text":"The 3 star review is perfectly accurate. This place was good but it was not great. My husband and I have been to a lot of Italian restaurants and considering this place is by Jamie Oliver we had high expectations.  We had 3 items pictured below. The bruschetta was the best thing we had but unfortunately was very small. The salmon was salmon you cannot really go wrong. The margarita pizza wasn't the best. I definitely have had better."}
{"text":"I came here last week, the ambiance was really nice and rustic. However, the food did not live up to the decor. I like that you can order half portion though so you can get a variety. I ordered the Porcini Fettuccine (def not on par with Gusto101 mushroom pasta), Jamie's Sausage Papperdelle (was good- had flavour but it was so dry). I was quite disappointed with the pasta because those were our entrees and they both came out warmish cold- who would want to eat that? Although, the crispy squid was delicious came out pipping hot and was delicious.   Service was great too, but I unfortunately I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We had dinner there. I saw some previous reviews saying that the service was bad. But the service there was wonderful. The server was nice and friendly. The hostess was fast, and quickly understand our preference. Finally, the food was tasty! I will go back there if I was in Yorkdale for shopping."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Our party of 7 were seated quickly and drink orders taken and delivered with accuracy.  The menu was not very innovative which was a little surprising since Jamie Oliver likes to take a twist on the traditional. No problem, traditional food done well means frequent visits. We ordered a few appetizers to start. The meat plank was meagre.  One slice of each meat per person and one thin slice of cheese. Taste was good but it might be better to combine the meat and veg plank to create a better anti-pasti. The biggest portion on that board was the coleslaw.  Is coleslaw Italian? We tried the fish special, the Parma pizza, Italian steak, the porchetta and one of the pastas. Porchetta, fish and pasta portions were good but no free bread for the table so no carb with the porchetta or fish.  $22 for porchetta so put some polenta on the plate. The steak was like a pancake and the Parma pizza was thin and crispy but little cheese and definitely not worth the $20. Overall, the food was okay taste wise but prices are way too high for what is being served.  Better to befriend an Italian and get invited to their house for dinner.  You'll never complain of leaving hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Our pasta was clumpy and our pizza was burned! We had high hopes as we love watching Jamie's cooking shows but we were very very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service from our waitress which was refreshingly lovely, but the seat I was at by the window did have a draft which made it kind of cold and cooled down our food! Ordered were the Italian sausage pizza (white base), Bolognese pasta and calamari. The calamari unfortunately came a bit cold (likely because we asked for everything to just come at once they took it totally to heart and brought all 3 at once while we really meant bring on the mains when they are ready), but the calamari was very fragrant, great texture and delicious so I can only imagine how tasty it must be while hot.   The bolognese pasta was rich and hearty, while the pizza was while fragrant and cheesy, had a lighter taste in comparison."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of jamie oliver's, and when I found myself in toronto on a trip, I had to go try jamie's italian despite all the bad reviews. Well turns out I really shouldn't have ignored the reviews... As much as I love and admire jamie, this restaurant is worse than my cooking... In particular, my prawn pasta was made with very fishy and un-fresh dead prawns and overcooked spaghetti, I really couldn't bring myself to eat more than half the plate. Everything else was just mediocre, and service wasn't horrible, but I can't bring myself to say any good things about my waitress either.  Oh jamie... I think this restaurant is better off closed."}
{"text":"Overall our experience here is good. We came here at around 3PM not so many people there, and our waitress is very friendly. Both of us had their lunch special, $19.99 for a starter and a main course. $5 for an extra dessert. For starter, I had beef carpaccio, it was not full of flavor, added pepper. My friend had tomato bruschetta, and I tried one. Personally I think that one is better than mine. Had tagliatelle bolognese as main course which is okay and nothing special, just like what you can have from other pasta restaurants."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Over priced food that was average at best.  Burger was simple.  Pizza was light on the toppings."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Jamie's Italian but it didn't meet the expectations. The staff were great and very friendly, we went around 8:30 pm on a week day and got a table quickly, we requested a booth and the staff promptly accommodated. Our server was very friendly but kept trying to rush us to order. The menu had lots of selections, I had the prawn linguine and my fiancé had the cod fish special. Both items were below average. Scaddabush has way better pasta in my opinion. The cod was a bit burt and very small in portion. We also ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was basically one piece on a slice of bread the size of my hand, basically it was enough for one person but cost as much as a proper appetizer. The waiter did warn us about the size but we really didn't expect it to be that small. Overall it was an okay experience but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had ordered the spaghetti carbonara and a pizza. The pasta was bland and the pizza wasn't anything special. The waiter kept forgetting about us from bringing our water to bringing our bill. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were greeted by the hostess and were seated right away. We sat down and was ready to order. We only see one server on the patio and was never greeted by our server. We waited for 15 minutes and saw a new table come in, they were greeted after 5 minutes. We waited for an other 10 minutes then left. Informed the hostess about the absence of service and now we are at joeys."}
{"text":"From out of town ..Just happen to drive  by Yorkdale mall and saw the restaurant ..watch lots of his shows so had to go in and give it a try..clean place and service was good ..menu was kid friendly ..but portions was a bit small for the price...everything was good and I will recommend  people to give it a try..."}
{"text":"I love Jamie Oliver  so I thought I would give this place a try.   Here is a breakdown of the dishes I've tried:  Famous prawn linguine pasta - the pasta was not al dente, i find this rather disappointing as this is a celebrity chef restaurant and cooking al dente pasta should be a simple standard. Secondly this is titled \"famous linguine pasta\" but the sauce is nothing but an average tomato sauce..  Italian farm sausage - I enjoyed the sweet and sour pepper more than the sausage itself.   Arancini margherita (rice balls) - this was recommended to us by the waitress, however this was simply rice balls in a simple tomato sauce. i dont really understand the dish  Lemon meringue cheesecake - I enjoyed the cake. the only con is the price. $12 for a slice of cake.   Overall, I was not very pleased with the dishes I've tried. They seem very average dishes and not much to be excited about."}
{"text":"As a Jamie Oliver fan, i was of course excited to visit his new restaurant. What i should have realized is that it is just another chain restaurant in a mall, with overworked, cranky employees. The only reason im giving 2 stars is because of the Jamie Oliver name. -first our waitress was either ditzy or very tired. Waited about 20 minutes just for water. Ordered the bread basket with tapenade, oil and balsamic to share. She eventually came with a plate and 3 small pieces of bread , no dips. Did not bring the table any plates or cutlery. By the time we could find her our pizza came. We asked her \"does the bread not come with dips\" she replied \"do you want me to get you some\" um well the menu states it comes with them. We asked another waiter, who brought us a small condiment cup of oil....... But were still charged for it anyways. -the pizza was terrible, ordered 3 different kinds, it was basically some thin dough with tasteless sauce on it.    Dont waste your time going here!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not one to review very often, and when I ever have its been because of exceptional service that deserved recognition... but as an avid reader of these reviews, and the awful taste that is figuratively and literally still in my mouth from last nights dinner, I had to come on here and express myself.   On January 18th, 2018 I called this restaurant to inquire about making a reservation for my birthday, which was yesterday. I was told that my party of 12 guests including myself, were subjected to a SET menu and a 18% mandatory gratuity. As a person saving up for a wedding, and a person who has friends with very diverse pallets, (veg, vegan, no pork etc.) I didn't want to make those decisions. In order to avoid this, I was told I could have two tables, side by side, but with *possibly* different servers and I had to make it under a separate reservation under my fiancees name, which is fine. So we show up right at 5:00 and I am told that they were able to seat 10 of us at one long table at the back of the restaurant, but the other 2 people were going to be near the front, no where near us. I was then told not to forget that they said it wasn't a guarantee that they could fulfill my request...ummm except no one told me that. I said that if someone HAD told me that, I would have just booked a different place for dinner. I was also reminded about 238191 times by different people that we had a two hour window and then we had to leave after that because it would be 'busy'. (Super bowl sunday...doubtful)   after nearly 20 minutes of trying to figure things out, 8 of us sat at the table and 4 sat kind of close, in the booth section. (awkward)   After finally settling in, we are approached by the most unfriendly waiter I've ever encountered. He seemed annoyed with how large the party was, and it was so obvious that he really didn't want to be there.   Most of my friends ordered wine, I ordered an iced tea and my fiancee ordered a craft beer. A few got apps and I ordered that 12.00 meat plank. When it came it was literally 2 of the thinnest pieces of salami I had ever seen, a piece of cheese and some olives. I asked if it came with bread, and he looked at me like I was a crazy person.   Our meals came and they were mediocre at best. The pizza was dry and barely had cheese, the pasta was peppered as if the black pepper was meant to be the sauce, and our waiter didn't even come by to check on us.   When he finally did show up, I managed to ask for another iced tea.  We ate and then my one friend offered to buy me a dessert of my choice since it was my birthday. My fav dessert is definitely creme brûlée and she knows that, so she turned to him politely and asked \"Excuse me, do you have creme brûlée?\"  He looked at her like she was born yesterday and laughed while shaking his head saying \"No, this is an ITALIAN restaurant.\" (condescending emphasis on ITALIAN) she was shocked and at that point I was embarrassed for having picked this place and wanted to leave.   some of my friends were inquiring about their bills, as they had super bowl commitments, and he basically said that we couldn't order anything else if we wanted the bills at that point in time. FINE BY ME BUDDY!  So he brings over the bills and I notice I have a charge for $9.00....FOR ICED TEA.  Shocked, I said \"You could have told me that it wasn't free refills here.\" He, again condescendingly said, \"Most restaurants don't have free refills\"and i said \"Actually, most DO. and the places that don't, warn you before you order a second one. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known.\" THEN he says \"Okay ill take it off the bill but for next time its not free\" and I said \"Don't worry, there won't be a next time\"  At that point I asked to speak to a manager and I was nearly in tears because my birthday which I had been excited about for weeks, felt like it was totally ruined and no one was happy about having to pay for their meals. I felt silly for choosing this place and wasting my time and money there. The manager ( I didn't get her name ) was even worse than the waiter. Literally a huge smile on her face that was the fakest thing I've ever seen and later she was found giggling with the waiter about what had happened. She didn't even offer to do anything when my fiancee was like we want the gratuity off.  Enter Christina, the only saving grace in this place. I didn't realize she was a manager and I was venting to her about what had just happened and visibly upset about the entire situation, she offered to take care of my $63.00 bill and promised to look after us if we ever choose to go back there, which isn't likely, but still very nice of her to sympathize and make an effort to care.   Restaurants cater to the CUSTOMER. I realize the customer isn't always right but in this case, it was just such an awful experience. If not for Christina and people like her, places like this would go down. if you don't like the job you have, then QUIT!"}
{"text":"So this Italian Restaurant was on my to do wish list so I finally gave it a try and I was dissapointed !.  First we ordered appetizers  1. meatball brushetta **and it was cold **. Then 2. The side plate my wife received was chipped and the waiter told us that the plates are rustic ... I laughed and told him the plate is chipped and get me a new one !  So we ordered the main meals My son's rigatoni had a bit of sauce but was warm and tasted ok hence the 1 star   the other was for my wife's salad hence why stars.  My meal was laughable. I Ordered the parpadella with meatball. 1. Cold  2. 3 to 4 strands of pasta and even.  No sauce pasta looked white but was supposed to be Arribiata.  This is the kicker now as I told the waiter he said he would take back and the other server came over when I got the new plate and gave me cheese !  I made a comment that the pasta in new plate which is not paprpadella but ( mafalda or mini lasagne) looked like it had more sauce and was temperature hotter and the other server says to me \" usually pasta jot served with this much sauce better with less but this one needs it \"   Classic line love it ....lol...  PS  the manager came by and after all said and done was good about it and took care of us but  safe to say  I don't want to go to a restaurant and think that a chip plate is rustic or pasta should have sauce and also should be hotter than cold temperatures... is that too much to ask from a adult Italian male who can cook   lol   too much !"}
{"text":"Food: 7.5/10 Atmosphere: 7.5/10  Service: 7.5/10 Overall experience: 7.5/10  Jamie's Italian for me, was a collection of hit and misses.   POINT 1: Some of the food is quite excellent. The mushroom fritti AKA deep fried portobello mushrooms is delicious and a must-try. The funghi pasta was also good, as was the rigatoni pomodoro (essentially a plain red sauce pasta). Flavours were simple, but full.   On the other hand, some of the food was extremely lackluster. The \"chips\" (UK for fries) were average, and the crab bruschetta lacked depth.  POINT 2: The menu is very large so there are lot of options. Good for large groups. I really liked that you could order a half portion of pasta, which allows you to try 2 different pastas in one meal if you like.   The menu is split across two actual pages - the main menu, and then the food in the \"bar\" section of the drink menu. Confusing!  POINT 3: Service was okay - the waiter seemed to take himself extremely seriously. But overall nothing bad happened.   The atmosphere is very rustic as well - but the way the place is laid out, where you sit can definitely have a large impact on your experience. We were sat near the pasta-making station, more to the side, whereas I prefer to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle.  THE BOTTOM LINE: if you get it right, it's great, if you get it wrong, basic and forgettable."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Jamie's Italian with our 2 younger kids. You pay for good food ($90 lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids under 5) and it is good food - fresh and flavourful. The waitstaff were friendly and attentive. Service was quick."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and i would say it's OK. In general, I find the food lacks flavour. But I think this is a result of Jamie and his focus on nutrition (aka not using a lot of fat/salt in his creations). For example, I had the mushroom fettuccine and I needed to add salt. I had a bite of my friend's pizza crust and it tasted like cardboard. The mushroom fritti are by far the best thing on the menu here.   Wouldn't be tempted to come back."}
{"text":"I went to the Yorkdale location on a Saturday evening. The place was busy good thing we booked a reservation. We got the Italian nachos for appetizer. It was deep fried ravioli with parmesan cheese on top with marinara sauce to dip.  My wife ordered the squid and mussel spaghetti Nero. The noodles were cooked Al dente and were black colour most likely from the squid. The plate presentation was very appealing and taste was on point. I ordered the our famous prawn linguine. The shrimps were cooked to perfection and had a nice crispy texture. Noodles were Al dente and the  arugula went well with the sauce and pasta. Great balance for the taste pallette.  For dessert we had tiramisu cake and it was also delish. Not too sweet and slice was good to share  for 2 people.  Overall, I really enjoyed the ambience, food and drinks but I really wished the server paid more attention to us. He never checked up on us to see if the food tasted good. He didn't refill our bottle  water when it was empty. He didn't really earn his tip. The food was great and I'm sure the servers share tips with kitchen staff so I tipped 15%. I would suggest training the staff on customer service and treat every customer the same. I will come back but will avoid this particular server."}
{"text":"It was a nice surprise after a day of shopping. The bar area is the best area to sit in the restaurant. It is very bright and the vibe is good.   The food are great and changes my opinions on celebrity chefs since the price is very reasonable as well.   We ordered Arancini for appetizer, it is not traditional but has a very nice spice on it. I ordered the turkey milanese and it was fantastic! I end up my meal with a cup of cappuccino and that was one of the best cappuccino I have had.   Finally, I don't know why it has such a low rating... I love it and definitely will go back. It is a italian  food with a modern spin."}
{"text":"This place was alright or whatever. It's the only place that isn't busy at Yorkdale and you can get a table right away since barely anyone goes here. The food is not good nor are the drinks.   They don't have good customer service and they have way more staff than actual customers that need to be served. Most of the staff spend time socializing than paying attention to the customers.   The bartender made a drink for me and left it on the counter near the dirty sink for a good 15 mins before serving it to me but I requested a fresh drink."}
{"text":"Taste: Not as great as I expected. I tasted the Mushroom Fritti, Ravioli Fritti, and the Sausage Pappardelle. I enjoyed the appetizers as they were good snack foods, but they weren't elevated in any way. As for the pappardelle, it was nothing special. I'm not usually picky with the type of pasta shape, but I ordered it because I love Pappardelle pasta when its a long flat ribbon, but this \"pappardelle\" was more like malfada. I thought that was weird.   Service: I asked the server if Jamie actually ever came into the restaurant and he commented that Jamie was probably somewhere in Italy right now, and insinuated that he was Italian... which he is not. Not a big deal, but maybe the staff should be educated on who Jamie Oliver is at least? Just a suggestion.  Value: The prices were good and not too expensive for what you get. Mushroom Fritti - $8.95, Ravioli Fritti - $6.95, and Sausage Pappardelle Small - $11.50 (Large - $17.95). I think it's good that they have the options for small or large plates.  Ambiance: Rustic and relaxing. Nice decor and not too loud."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the picture of the \"fried squid\". The paper holds up the calamari so it looks like a big portion. It is not. Not that crispy either.   Pasta is decent but flavours is pretty much just salt. Service not that great either."}
{"text":"Just came back from the dinner at Jamie's with friends and the experience was very underwhelming. We had high expectations as Jamie Oliver's name was associated with it and we expected much better.  Food - We were a party of 4 and we tried their garlic bread and mushroom fritti for starters. garlic bread was flavorful. It was topped with thinly sliced fresh garlic and fresh rosemary. The mushroom fritti was pretty unremarkable. For mains, I had Prawn linguine which was okay. Wife had Rigatoni Pomodoro which was just salty and flavorless(just fiddling on the line between edibility and in-edibility). Our friends had Spaghetti Carbonara and a Italian Hot pizza. They thought both were just okay. We had a litre of house wine. It was good. And we had an Epic chocolate brownie for dessert. And trust me this was the best part of the meal.  Service - was okay. No complaints but nothing to write home about too. The server provided some suggestions about the choices from the menu but only came in once between to check on us.  Prices - Very expensive for what it is worth. You may find better tasting pasta at at least 5 restaurants in 2 km radius of wherever you live in Toronto. We are pretty lucky to have so many good restaurants. I wouldn't go here again.    Verdict - The food was high-priced and visually appealing, but fails to charm the palate. Visit them only if you desperately want to eat at one of Jamie Oliver's to mark an item off your bucket list."}
{"text":"I went in with an open mind, knowing this is a chain restaurant in a mall, no matter whose name is on the sign. I had a pleasant time and I was not too disappointed.   We had the roasted squash and ricotta bruschetta to start. It was quite good, with just a hint of sweetness that's perfectly cut with the lemon ricotta and aged balsamic. The ingredients were fresh. I'd order this again.  The carbonara was good, but not amazing. It was creamy but there was not enough sauce. There was one small slice of bacon at the top. I'll try something else if there's a next time.  The host and server were friendly. The decor is modern yet cozy. This place isn't a must try, but a decent option when you're peckish after shopping."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly though this might be because of the time of day.  Had the Aranchini Margaritas which were delicious. Followed with the tag Bolognese, coming from an Italian family am usually not impressed with pasta in restaurants, but this was good, .the pasta was al dente, and the sauce flavorful without being overwhelming. I had a cocktail they call La Dolce Vita, a touch on the sweet side but thoroughly enjoyable. The service was quick and very attentive without being annoying or obtrusive"}
{"text":"After a full day of shopping and want to dine somewhere nice but bored of going to chains like Joey's?  This could be an option for you. Staffs here were very helpful and nice.   While the food aren't exceptional but it does the job.  Being a Jamie's restaurant you can't go too wrong with it.    Will I come all the way here just for dinner?  Not really.  Will I come here after a long day of shopping at Yorkdale with my friend?  The answer is yes."}
{"text":"Update: Perhaps the magic isn't there anymore or I just thought it was there when it wasn't.. Came back for a friend's bday yesterday and the service was great, nothing bad to say about that. They seemed to remove their bruschetta (super sad) from the menu because I couldn't find it, but I didn't ask the waitress either so they might have it somewhere.   Is it just me or are their appetizer portions very small compared to literally anywhere else? Maybe we just didn't order enough appetizers (2) for the seven of us, idk.. Suffice to say, I was gravely disappointed. We all enjoyed our mains, so there was that.   Not sure when/if I'll be back.. I enjoyed most of my meal, but I never feel satisfied after.  - - - - - I was pretty darn excited when I passed by Jamie's Italian while at Yorkdale one day. I knew I had to give it a try because it's Jamie Oliver (duh!).   I returned a few days later with a friend for dinner and I had their gnocchi which was really good. There's nothing quite like Italian comfort food when you're hungry. Perhaps my Italian food palette isn't as diverse as others, but I've thoroughly enjoyed their food most of the times I've went.   Their ambience is great and it sets quite the mood.  I can't complain about their service at all; it was terrific."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come and try this place since they opened at the end of last year in the Yorkdale mall. Jamie's Italian it's a popular brand for restaurants in the UK and Europe created by Jamie Olliver, the famous UK's chef. I heard about it when I was going dining at another very famous and reputable Italian restaurant on King St, the manager there works for the same company who brought Jamie's in Toronto. The ambiance is very welcoming and love the wine bottles display and the wood walls. The noise level is moderate but not to loud to have a clear conversation. I've started with the Fried Ravioli, very interesting as in Italy the south region fries more than the north one and in fact my pairing wine on the wine list was Sicilian. Simply delicious. Not too spicy, not much oil, crunchy enough and with a nice taste of light cheese inside. I then had tagliatelle ai funghi: simply to dye for. I didn't even had to put the side smashed croutons on them, just till the end when I wanted to try them. Very different. The waiter was pleasant and she sounded like she knew what she was talking about while taking the order. Definitely a come back. My friend has cannelloni, which I had to steal two from his plate: I could just not resists the smell and the way they looked: eat me. I love that you have to go upstairs for the washrooms and you get to see everything from above. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place for a meal when shopping at Yorkdale Mall.  Food:  - mushroom pizza was great, has a mushroom sauce as rge nase and topped with ample mushroom and cheese.  Great flavour and big portion, great for sharing. - fried squid.  This was a disappointing calamari dish.  Decided to order this after reading yelp reviews, but instead of juicy big pieces of squid, it seemed more like dried from frozen little rings of squid. Not worth tge price for this portion size. - funky fries lacked tge garlic flavour, not a wow side and needs improvement.  Service was courteous and good, place is nice and casual.  Overall, would return for pizza and try pasta instead of apps next time."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the food and service. The carbonara had 2 pieces of pancetta ($20) and they seem to be very inflexible with client requests. Needed special permission to put cheese on the mini burgers.    On the plus side the shrimp linguine was good.  Poor Jamie. Wish he could control the quality and service from LA."}
{"text":"I've been here three times already and each time is more amazing than the last.  Food: I always start my meal off with Polenta fries and aracini balls - simply delicious! Their burger italiano isn't anything major and I didn't really like the turkey milanese (really dry) but their pastas are absolutely to die for! I really enjoyed all their pastas as it never cease to disappoint.  Drink: I've had their bellini before (nope) but they make a super yummy old fashioned with marker's mark!  Atmosphere: really enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. I've sat at the bar before (and witnessed a female diner tried so hard picking up the male bartender and failed) and sat in the back near the kitchen. I really liked that they had a food runner dedicated to JUST THAT JOB to ensure every plate that goes out is perfect.  Service: Every time I've been, the servers has been super attentive and made sure everything was perfect.  Try and get a reservation ahead of time (I waited an hour once but so worth it). Clearly I am in love with this place. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food and service was mediocre. To be honest, I haven't heard about this place but was a place convenient for our group to meet (since it's at Yorkdale). First, the restaurant wasn't packed on a Saturday night. A sign that maybe it's not a good place to go to. We were a bit late, but for some odd reason, the waitress kept on saying how we had until 8 PM for the table. Looking around I couldn't understand why she would keep reminding us this fact. Until the end, the whole restaurant had spaces (even for our group size).  We ordered a whole array of dishes and pasta. To say the least, the portion size was smaller than expected and the pasta was DRY! I'm not that picky with pasta but c'mon, at least have a standard. The worst thing is the food came out warm to cool. There was very little taste in any of the pasta. Honestly, I'd rather save money and buy some chef boyardee from the local supermarket LOL.  I would not recommend this place at all. I can't think of any reason for you to go. Nothing special here.   Finally, a rating from Yelp that closely resembles the actual place. (should be closer to 1 than 3)"}
{"text":"2.5* + 0.5* for solid service  Had a quick dinner here recently. Tried to get their two specials, a prawn & mussel risotto and mussels in tomato sauce, but they had run out of the risotto. Ended up getting a Gennaro's Sausage Pizza.  The mussels were a surprisingly small portion for the cost ($16.95) and it came with two thin slices of toasted bread to soak up the sauce. I find it weird when I can go somewhere like Rodney's, Town Crier, etc. and they pretty much just hand out the bread for you. I understand saving on costs, but even just a couple more pieces of bread would have gone a long way when I'm paying $17 for an app. It tasted alright and I've had better for less price.   The Pizza was fairly tasty, but unfortunately very very oily to the point where it lost the crisp crust all around the bottom. It was so bad it looked like my nails had been painted over with gloss.   It was Sunday so we indulged in their $5 caesars. Not bad! Probably my favourite part of the meal.   Good to try once but I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Definitely had high hopes for this place- it is Jamie Oliver after all. Went with friends, we all got different dishes. The pork chops were delicious but their pastas were dishes anyone could make at home. They made one of our pastas extremely salty. The waiter did apologize and didn't charge us for it. He explained that all the dishes were made on the spot separately in different pans. So the chef adding an extra pinch of salt wasn't unlikely. Although the food was mediocre, the people there were really friendly. Overall, an average place to eat."}
{"text":"popped in here after shopping and I have to say it's more hyped up that it actually is.  service: sucked. from the time we walked in; we got attitude - yet the customers in front of us were spoken too so nicely. Not sure if it's because I was super dressed up, I came from work, it's okay for us to wear jeans to work. i don't care that I'm at Yorkdale I'm at a chain restaurant after work. we were told to wait at the side but the others who took our place weren't asked to move.  we said we would take any seat available whether the patio or dining room. we overhead the people who came in after us (table for 2 as well) being seating on the patio. after already being pushed to the side I spoke up and said we were waiting for any available seat. I got a displeasing look and we were taken outside.   after a while of waiting we finally have our waitress come around, but she was very disorganized. she was bringing the wrong tables the wrong items and it was just unpleasant - it took us over 20 minutes to the bill.  food: I give this restaurant 2 stars for the sole purpose of how good the mushroom pizza was. if I could order it to go that would be my only reason to return, or perhaps check another location out. the dessert was dry, and the portion of the app was really small."}
{"text":"A bit delayed because of the holidays, but better late than never!  Met some friends there for our Christmas brunch in Dec 2015.  The restaurant was packed--definitely the hippest place to eat at Yorkdale.  It was clean and our server kept checking on us regularly.   We sat near the kitchen.  Washrooms are upstairs which may be cumbersome to get to but there is an accessible facility on the main level.  I liked that you could order a regular or smaller sized portion.  I ordered the rigitoni pomodoro with an arugula side salad.  The food was ok; it was homemade and was tasty but didn't blow my hair back.  I am lactose-intolerant and while I was able to find something to eat (with some alterations), I hope that they will eventually have some lactose-free options.  If I could purchase lactose-free cheese and other options at my local grocery store, I don't understand why restaurants can't.   Overall I had a good experience and I will go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not much to choose from in terms of \"healthy options\" I had the turkey entree (fried) and the Polenta chips (fried). Both tasty but did not feel so good after eating....and the next day too.... Will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by for a late lunch after a good shopping session with a friend. At first glance, the restaurant is very well decorated; beautiful chandeliers and an overall great set up. You really feel like Jamie Oliver could appear at any moment.  The hostess first seated us on the first floor, so I asked if we could sit upstairs, and she managed to do that without any problems. The view from upstairs is great!  I had greater expectations for the food. It's good quality (fresh made pasta) but the portions were ridiculously small, especially since we're technically eating at a mall, and not some high end restaurant downtown.  We ordered the Caprese Salad to start; I must say it was an interesting take on the traditional version. However, it was a very small tasting portion including one ball of bocconcini, half a tomato, and cherry tomatoes.   I, myself ordered the Vongole Tagliolini, which was a light clam pasta. The pasta was fresh but it was VERY spicy. I expected the chili in there, but was not expecting my mouth to be on fire. Again the portion wasn't enough to feed a small child.  My friend ordered the Porcini Fettucine, which I tried. Very light and creamy, but missing flavour. When I brought this up to my friend, she said the flavours were present in some parts of the dish, and missing in others. Her food was also very spicy.  Overall, it was an interesting experience. Definitely a nice restaurant but lacking a few things, like sides; light salad options (caesar?), and even a bread basket. So it's not your typical Italian restaurant, but an interpretation of one.   We didn't stay for dessert to save ourselves from further disappointment. Beautiful restaurant but too much hype."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the Nice dine out with couple & family, it's going to be fun. Staff are knowledge enough to explain about the foods and same time matching wines."}
{"text":"From what I heard, they leave 20% of the tables for reservations while 80% is for drop ins. So I went on a Wednesday night without a reservation and I had no problem getting a table.  My party started off with crispy squid, cured meat plank, and mushroom fritti. The cured meat plank had an assortment of meats and two types of cheese. It didn't disappoint as it was the best appetizer that we tried. The crispy squid seasoning was pretty good but it had a lot of batter. The mushroom fritti was a complete let down as it was cold and you definitely needed to dip it in the sauce in order for it to taste ok.  For my main, I got a small portion of the vongole pasta and the pizza special. I liked that they have two prices for the pastas so you can go for the smaller (appetizer) portion or the big meal portion. I found that the pasta was too spicy for me and when I kept eating it, I just couldn't taste the pasta and clams anymore. The pizza was just ok as it seems like it was lacking toppings.  For the dessert, my party ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake and the epic brownie. The lemon meringue cheesecake felt more of a key lime pie instead of a cheesecake as it was light. The epic brownie was rich in chocolate and very sweet.  As of service, our waitress was great. However, she left out an order of a main dish that we ordered. She told us it was completely her fault and she followed it up. She was really apologetic.    Overall, the restaurant was not as busy as I thought it would be. It was definitely hyped up and there is a 50/50 chance that I will come back in the future."}
{"text":"3.5  I liked this place and I think it has potential.  Pros: Service: My waiter (a tall English (?) guy was very attentive and nice. The food was really good. I had broccoli with garlic and Seafood Risotto. I t was tasty without being fussy and pretentious and covered in sauce and crap like you find in other (chain) restaurants. Atmosphere is nice and I like that you can look into the kitchen.  Cons The portions and price. I normally think chain restaurant portion sizes are obscenely large and off putting but here, I found myself still hungry. For the price, I think the portions should be a little bit bigger, or at least offer bread to the table or something. I think that if you were enjoying multiple courses, the portions would be fine, but when that portion is your main meal, you might be left wanting more. Granted, I am a big eater so maybe I'm biased but I've seen this complaint a lot so I don't think it's just me. Also, there was no Wi-fi (wouldn't even connect to Yorkdale wi-fi) or reception for my phone. This wouldn't be a big deal if i was on a date or having a party here, but I was by myself and needed my phone to check my voicemails and make some quick calls on my lunch. And it's apparently like this all the time.  When I told the server I was still a little hungry, he offered me a free dessert which was very kind of the restaurant, but I had to decline as I needed to make a call.  Overall, I would give this place a try again as there are multiple things on the menu that looked good."}
{"text":"Waiter was excellent and attentive. Hostesses at the front though were confused and left us waiting five minutes when there were dozens of empty tables that afternoon. Appetizers (octopus and aranciata) were good, with a different and inventive sauce for the aranciata. The mussel and octopus spaghetti was delicious. The polenta cake for dessert was excellent and a good way to finish off the meal."}
{"text":"The service was lovely. The food wasn't. I had the gnocchi with pesto; it tasted like low-end grocery store pesto with rubbery gnocchi. The \"Italian nachos\", fried ravioli with marinara sauce, were okay but nothing special.   For the same food cost, you can go to a real Italian restaurant pretty much anywhere in the city and have a MUCH better meal. If you need to be at the Eaton Centre, go to Joey instead. Or d3. Anywhere but here, really."}
{"text":"I went with my elderly parents on a Saturday afternoon. I have never seen them complain in all of my life and we eat out frequently. Here were some of the issues:  1. It smelt like burnt bread and there was a haze of smoke. The manager said they were trying to work out \"the kinks\" still. Literally, we observed a smoky haze below the lights of the cold kitchen. I assume it was smoke from the hot kitchen.  2. Loud music. Loud open kitchen.  3. Very oily food. We suspected that their frying oil -- a mix of canola and olive oil -- wasn't hot enough. I recommend avoiding the calamari and potato appetizers.  4. The wild salmon that I got on the side of a salad was shreded and very dry at the edges. It looked like it was left under a hot plate for a long time but oddly it was not hot.  5. The pasta was the clincher. It was SUPER salty and I write this as a person that loves salty food. We guessed that the cook had let the salted water boil down without adding more.   We told the manager about the issues. They handled it like pros. Well done. Also, their phone service is exceptional. Unlike some places, a person picked up right away for the reservation I made and then to give me directions in the mall on how to navigate my way there, which is a bit confusing because there is no direct, inside mall access. Also, our server was excellent. I can't remember a waitress who so eloquently and genuinely expressed how good they thought the food was. I understand that we tipped her well. It wasn't her fault that other things weren't to our liking. Overall, my step-father described the experience as a -5 and he's known for never complaining or making a fuss.   A perplexing point -- why were two staff members huddled on the floor in conversation at the cold bar for a long time? I saw them when I went up the stairs to go to the washroom. They were still under the bar when I returned."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere, very family and kid friendly but not boring at all. It is like a family pub if I have to describe it lol! The food was made reall fresh and tasty, although quite salty to my taste, especially the crab bruschetta. I felt like the crab had been soaked in salt water for a while. The mushroom pasta is a MUST TRY! Extremely fragrant and delicious  The tiramisu was a let down for me since it didn't have the consistency and the flavour I was looking for, as the sponge cakes tasted like it was soaked in water"}
{"text":"Our waiter was super great but the food itself was alright. The ambiance and restaurant layout was nicely designed, high ceilings and comfy seats. We were sat at the back near the kitchen. I ordered the Jamie's Italian Burger and my friend ordered the Prawn Linguine. The burger was nothing super special, the meat itself was a little dry. The portion size was filling. As for the side, I chose the spicy fries. The fries were soggy and limp with too much salt which I didn't bother to finish. Overall, it was alright, I would go back if someone wanted to go but wouldn't go again on my own wanting to."}
{"text":"I was dining at Hong Kong's Jamie's Italian a few months ago and I loved their dishes, so I decided to try this new restaurant at Yorkdale. My friend ordered the shrimp pasta and it was delicious! (I wish I ordered that instead) I usually don't like eating pastas with tomatoes in it, but this one was pretty good! I ordered the sausage pappardelle and it was average. I most likely won't be ordering this again next time. As for the appetizer we ordered the meat plank. I would say it's nothing special especially for the price. The server was really nice! 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends - didn't really go for the whole \"Italian style dining experience\" (we each ordered individually instead of the big plates).  The roast tomatoes in the Caprese salad were tasty, the rest of the salad was over oiled and the heritage tomatoes tasted like they were previously frozen (that's a faux pas Jamie!).  Had the mushroom pasta, it was decent but not out of this world (no Terroni's funghi pasta comparison if you know what I'm talking about).  Service was good, place was packed, don't know why.   Also- came with higher expectations, have eaten at Jaime's in the UK and it was a great experience, so maybe this was tainted by that."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try Jamie Oliver's restaurant but I will NOT be going back.   The food was just okay - the dish was very salty.  As soon as we ordered dessert, the waiter brought out our bills as there was a shift change which is totally fine.  After finishing our full meals and 3 desserts, the manager came over and pretty much told us to leave as there was a line-up.  Are you kidding me?!  I have never been told to leave a restaurant.  That is the biggest turn off.  This restaurant doesn't care about their customers - they just want to rush you out of there and make the table available.  Will definitely NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Came here after a movie since it was conveniently located nearby, had no idea Jamie Oliver had a restaurant with his name on it in Toronto. A Wednesday evening after 8:30pm, the place was still quite full of patrons in both the louvre and dining area. My walk-in party of five was seated in about 10-15min. The ambiance is casual but it's Yorkdale, so do expect to see well-put-together patrons. The waitress greeted us without a self introduction, but was otherwise nice. The menu is casual and heavily promoted Jamie's inspiration in every dish, including fanciful words and attention to detail with respect to ingredients. There's a chalkboard with specials, so be sure to look when you're browsing the menu.  After much debate my party settled on a few pastas, the turkey Milanese, rice balls, and polenta chips. As promised the pasta was fresh - they smelled and looked great upon arrival. I got the mushroom fettuccini and it smelled of a great combination of mushrooms. A spoon of breadcrumbs came along to be sprinkled atop for some texture. As I mixed it altogether I notice that there isn't enough sauce to go over all my pasta - very disappointing. The main size looked to just be enough for my dinner, but given the dryness I could only finish about half. The taste was also a disappointment - I tasted pasta, breadcrumbs, and the occasional mushroom kick where I actually found a piece of mushroom. I understand this wasn't a pasta with a lot of toppings, but it just was too dry to the point that twirling the fettuccini on my fork would just break the strands as opposed to separate them. Around the table the same comment was made about the bolognese and the other pasta - dry and not very interesting. **Next Day Update - something about the pasta upset my stomach. I thought the night after dinner it was just due to a late meal disrupting my daily routine, but the next day I had my leftovers and it didn't settle well at all. Maybe it was the mushroom, maybe something in their fresh pasta...**  The turkey Milanese was alright - on the dry side once again, and the same dry comment went over to the rice balls and polenta chips. The turkey Milanese was a thin turkey cutlet that was breaded, topped with an egg and served with a small side of arugula. If you're hungry you'll need to order another side - the polenta chips did the trick and were flavourful, though $6.95 for a small portion would make me hesitate.  The rice balls...were as expected said my friend. Nothing special.  For all the hype of it being Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurant...not impressed. For a casual Italian restaurant at the price point it's at...I'll go again if it's convenient and I'm choosing over other large chain restaurants."}
{"text":"We love Italian food and Jamie Oliver's products so we were pretty excited to try this place. I ordered the salmon- was overdone and dry. My friends ordered a magherita pizza which we found very bland. How do you get a magherita pizza wrong?! We've had better ones at at every other Toronto restaurant we ever ordered that at, even a couple of generic franchises.   Also, a couple people ordered pastas and everybody was underwhelmed. No fresh Parmesan or pepper was offered. Prices were comparable to king st restaurants downtown, but the food and service were not. Will not be back. Disappointed,,, I think Jamie Oliver just sold his name to be slapped on the restaurant because the food served doesn't reflect his talent/recipes."}
{"text":"went 4 times l great decor but not  excellent in terms of food expected  from jamie Oliver and service isn't great"}
{"text":"My friend and I went on Saturday around 7pm.  After an hour wait, we were shown our seats at 8pm.  They do take your mobile number so you do have the freedom to kill time in the mall while you wait and get buzzed when your table is available (perk).  The downside was upon arriving at 7pm to get put on the wait list.   When we entered, we walked by a couple who made mention that the restaurant appears busy near the entrance but in reality had a lot of empty tables in the back.  When we sat down, we noticed the same.    Felt like they were trying to make themselves look busy than they really were.  In reality, this was a disappointment as they didn't appear understaffed either.  Overall, the food was amazing and the pasta is a must try.  My friend and I would definitely said we'll come back but probably never again during the weekend.  I'd rather book a reservation during a weeknight than wait for a partially empty restaurant.   I give this restaurant a three for the fact that they were trying to hype up the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Jamie's on a Sunday afternoon and overall really enjoyed it. I sat on the first floor close to the pasta making station and I did find the two person table rather small and the space between the table beside us was rather narrow. I ordered a bellini and it was tasty, a bit strong but good. I had the lunch portion of the  vongole tagliolini (pasta with clams), it was a small portion but the pasta tasted so fresh and delicious. My partner had the streak with a side of grilled vegetables instead of fries and he said it was a good cut and really flavorful.  The service was prompt but perhaps it's because we went in the early afternoon before it got busy."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are too small, pasta was undercooked and too \"el Dante\". not flavourful at all. waitress didn't come to check on us after the first few bites, which was annoying because i wanted to complain."}
{"text":"Jamie's Italian was amazing!! I got their prawn linguine and it was garlicy, seafoody, and spicy. Honestly couldn't ask for a better combo. It tasted amazing, but I couldn't tell if the pasta was made IN-HOUSE, but that's okay.   I was seated at the bar with my brother and his GF. We got there on a Saturday evening at 6:15 without reservations and there weren't any seats available for another half-hour/hour, but the bar. Let me tell you! Those boys at the bar were so cool and friendly and seemed to be having a blast. We didn't mind at all, and I think watching them and seeing them in their element was worth it.   We all shared the berry blast drink and it was super sweet. Probably wouldn't order that again or maybe I'd dilute it with some water. My brother and his GF shared the bolognese and they said the sauce was really good! I think the vibe, the atmosphere and the food definitely deserves these 4 stars. The price wasn't super hefty either, especially since the pasta was a pretty good portion.   Would come back again!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day-we made reservations so we didn't have any wait time-it was an afternoon visit. We ordered the bread with tapenade and olive oil/balsamic vinegar, the tagliatelle bolognese, and the brownie for dessert.  Food was average to be honest. I've been to many restaurants where bread, tapenade etc is free. Our server was nice enough, though sometimes kind of intrusive to be honest. She meant well. One of my pet peeves is when you order an appetizer from a restaurant and you can't get half way through it before they bring out your entree. Now you have a table full of food. A good restaurant lets you finish or at least come close to finishing your app before bringing plates and plates of food.  My friend and I were busy catching up, so we take our responsibility where this matter is concerned. Our server charged someone else's meal to our bill, and it wasn't until we got home that we realized. I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager-I believe his name was Henry. He was kind and helpful. He had offered to give us a gift card or take the overcharged amount off of our next bill, as processing refunds were complicated on their end. In the end though, with us not knowing how soon we will return, if ever, we did insist on the refund. He spoke to the general manager who agreed to refund the amount, but we would have to go back to present the payment credit card before a refund could be done.  I had high expectations for this restaurant, but I wasn't at all wow'd. Everyone was really friendly...but the food wasn't that special. Sorry Jamie."}
{"text":"Definitely my kind of place. I've watched Jamies shows for years and the atmosphere in this restaurant is very fitting with his professional persona.   The food is very good and very well priced. After reading the menu I felt as if I could return many times and have a different and satisfying meal each time. The drinks are overpriced but everything else was perfect. Welcoming, quick and attentive waitstaff, several food options, comfortable and inviting design, and good pricing. I had the pork meatballs, garlic flatbread, porkchop main and tasted the crab pasta...all delicious. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We visited to celebrate a birthday for our six year old daughter. There were four children in our party of eight.   Service was slow to take our order and then we waited a while for the (juice and soft drink) beverages to arrive. When the food was served, the children's' meals were last to come (who does that?).  Out of four children two meals (chicken 'lollypops') arrived badly overcooked and over-spiced; inedible for children. We asked for them to be replaced with less dry and less spicy chicken. First the waiter argued with us that the food was fine; it was not. Finally he agreed to to replace the meals but it took more than 20 minutes and the rest of the party was finished before the replacements came. Even then, the chicken was still dry and overcooked. We had to take the children for a proper meal after the restaurant as those two didn't get a proper supper here.   The other meals were adequate but not as good as expected. Pizza was over cooked and the pasta was stale and all stuck in a single blob.   There was no effort made to apologize nor any consideration given. One of our party had ordered a soft drink (at over $3 for a smallish glass) and was informed (despite all the other issues) that refills were not offered. Fine.   The piece de resistance: an 18% (after tax) tip was added to the bill without our consent.   A return visit is unlikely in this lifetime.  NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent! We ordered the Italian nachos, crispy squid, and carne pizza for appetizers. The many types of fettuccine for entree, tiramisu and affogato for dessert, which were all so delicious. The food was rustic Italian with a modern twist. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"The food are amazing here, great flavors, reasonably priced and decent portions. Came in with high expectation and they were met. Service is good but not great, room for improvement."}
{"text":"The reviews for this new restaurant are quite odd. Star ratings on either end of the spectrum causes for concern and a restaurant with Jamie Oliver's name garners some form of expectation, but I was quite pleasantly surprised with the overall experience.   Came by after work with a friend, so we were pretty hungry. Parked underground at the mall, and then tried to find the restaurant. We didn't realize there was no entrance from inside the mall, so we ended up having to walk outside in t-shirts just to get in.   The space was very modern, with a high-end vibe without it being to uptight. Definitely a place you can go casually with a couple friends. Almost seemed like the whole concept was taken right out of pinterest!  Food choses were very unique and we decided to give a couple things a try. First, the Arancini Margherita were amazing. Soft, melty cheese on the inside was complimented textually from the crispy outside. Definitely recommended. I then had the Sausage Pappardelle and my friend got the Honeycomb Cannelloni. Both were very good with fresh pasta, and the flavours were on point. The cannelloni ended being a bit on the creamier and heavier side for me personally, as we had to share to finish it.   Service was amazing in my opinion, as they gave you a little jug of water to refill, but cane by to refill it for us. That just shows the detail and attention the server had for each table.   Overall, a little pricier for a meal every so often, but a good choice when you are already at the mall. Make sure to check it out!!"}
{"text":"Ordered calamari to share among three people as an app. I would recommend sharing something bigger if you have 3 or more people. Had the burger  as an entrée and it was deliciously cooked. It was a decent meal, but the price and portions for everything we tried were only mediocre."}
{"text":"More ginger mojitos and more food...loved all of them. Servings were tiny but enough for a small  tummy!"}
{"text":"Jamie's is a casual spot to grab a bite to eat after a successful or, in my case, an unsuccessful shopping spree at Yorkdale mall. Although the wine is limited to a young and unexciting selection, the pasta was great!  I had Jamie's Sausage Pappardelle; it was delicious! The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce had the perfect amount of fennel and spice! Mmmmm....comfort food!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Customer service from the manager was horrible. Wait staff was great though... But the manager really just left a bad taste in my mouth. Won't be returning. Not a family oriented restaurant apparently."}
{"text":"Easy to make reservations, restaurant fills up quickly.  However, I was not notified (once I mentioned that our resos were for a birthday) that there would be a $3.50 service fee per person (we were a party of 4) to have my own cookie cake served.  Pretty pathetic and sad.  This threw me off completely.  Food is mediocre; I guess the inflated prices are due to the Jamie Oliver name.  Won't be coming back any time soon...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after finishing up some shopping at the mall. Waited only 5 minutes before we were seated and ordered the 2 most popular dishes: shrimp linguine and sausage pappardelle pasta which did not disappoint. The pasta is all made fresh every morning and I was pleasantly surprised to see that small and large portions are available for all pastas. We will definitely be returning, likely with a large group of friends."}
{"text":"This can't be Jamie's recipes!? I love his work but this kitchen seems like he's going down the Emeril  or Guy Fieri garbage food chain route. To start when you ask for a pint of beer, you get a half pint. Weird considering where Jamie is from the standard pint is even larger than a regular pint in North America. Caesar's are garnished with old crusty 30 second bacon crisps and come with no citrus. The garlic 'bread' is a pita warmed up with a little oil and herbs. Couldn't taste any garlic or butter. The bread is 10$ per order when you should just have some to use for your antipasto. It's also stale and comes in massive chunks. Then we go for pasta dishes as our main considering it's supposed to be an Italian restaurant. They are very stingy with the sauce so my meatball pappardelle was dry and bland. Ive tasted more flavour from frozen no name meatballs then the kind I got. My other guests got a mushroom pasta dish that barely had any chunks of mushroom in it. One dessert felt like a frozen and heated up brownie. The cheesecake was supposed to have a thick graham cracker crust like the server stated but it was a thin piece of shortbread crust. It was peach flavoured but lacked the compote like described. Really sad to see Jamie's name get slapped around now. I'll have to just wait and visit his real managed spots in England."}
{"text":"Food is just okay but quite pricy. This place is not for those who are budget conscious. It feels like a high end family restaurant. Steak was good but appetizers and pizza we ordered were not so great."}
{"text":"Came to the highly anticipated Jamie Oliver. It sure was a disappointing experience from the very beginning.  To reserve a table over 9 people, we need to call. However, it's always voice mail. After finally making a table for 10, we called to increase it to 12. Voice mail and never a reply. We wanted to make sure the gathering runs smoothly, so we dropped by in person. They casually said \"oh, it was already changed to 12\".  No apology or explanation.  Definitely not a good start.  We were celebrating for a birthday and was told that to bring your own cake, each person pays $3 extra. (Outrageously priced, most Toronto restaurants that charges \"cake-fee\" is around $2 max)  We arrived promptly at our reserved time. The hosts informed that the table was being setup. Our friends wanted to tell them that we have a cake, but it was difficult because the host avoided any eye contact. She glued herself to her computer screen for the entire time.   After being seated, we waited a long time before anyone came to take our orders. (This was Thursday at 8pm)  Our server came to take orders, but insisted he had to take appetizer orders first. The first person to order mentioned that we waited for a long time already and would like to just order entree. After my friend explained the pasta she wanted, the server completely ignored her and said \"I still need to take appetizer order first\". Everyone was baffled.   The appetizers ordered by two people were: Music bread, crab meat bruschetta and crispy squid.  Crispy squid was flavourful, very similar to asian dimsum fried squids. The crab meat bruschetta was really blend. It was two completely two different food items in your mouth, didnt feel like it melted together as one. The music bread was probably the worst appetizer we have ever seen/ate. 3 dry pieces of nacho with a piece of cheese. Please don't waste any penny on this.  The hot italian pizza we ordered was only warm and nothing special. The seafood clam pasta was okay, but nothing that would blow your mind away. The best plate that night was probably their famous prawn pasta.  Midway, the fire alarm came on and right above our table. The manager came by and said it's just the mall's first stage alarm, and we dont need to leave unless it enters 3 stage...  Then the server came by after 10min (still ringing), when we asked him how long these alarms would continue, he said he has no idea. THEN! he said these alarms happens every morning, and told us to try to imagine working with that alarm.   We have never heard of any customer service that involves having the customers to put themselves into the company's shoe in regards to coping with negative experiences.   What a huge disappointment. Bad reservation system, unfriendly hosts, and a server with an attitude."}
{"text":"Very over hyped, i would compare this place to a east side Mario's but elevated look. The food is horrible and the service is very average or below. I didn't not enjoy the food and my friends didn't either. This was my second time here and still very disappointed. I asked for a salad with not tomatoes and it came with tomatoes, then they brought back the same dish with tomatoes removed and I found a tomato on the bottom of the salad."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday lunch on the weekend and it was my first time here.  We were seated in a nice quiet table at the back, near the kitchen.  Expectations were high for me although a family member already warned for me to tone it down a few notches as she had been here twice and was left a little underwhelmed.  Unfortunately, she was right.  Menu is quite pricey but because it had 'Jamie's' sign-off, that was to be expected.  Food quality did not live up to his reputation though.  I had the zucchini pomodoro pizza; I literally could have had more satisfaction at a walk-in pizza chain. Crust was funky and quite burnt, toppings were sparingly placed, it was really just average.  Hubby had a fresh crab spaghetti and was really let down.  He found it too salty (and yes, he was warned adding Parmesan cheese may make it saltier) and spicy (yes, entree description did note some spice).  One family member uncovered a hair in his pasta dish - how lovely!  Half-eaten dish was returned and he did not request a replacement or compensation.  When the bill came, we were surprised that a goodwill gesture was not at least extended for the extra pasta ingredient.  Not very classy.  Only thing that was worth applauding was the customer service - we were promptly greeted with the inner door opened for us, seated and tended to.  Too bad you don't just pay for service but food as well."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch today while doing some Christmas shopping.   When you first walk in the ambience is really nice.   Rustic look and staff is very friendly.  Got a table relatively quickly (table for 2), accidentally we were assigned a bigger table, and front of the house had to tell us to to go back to the front so they can move us to a smaller table.   They were apologetic, mistakes happen.  We waited a good 10 minutes before a server arrived with menus.    We ordered one of the $24.95 daily meals.   Chose the roasted squat and ricotta  bruschetta, the mushroom pasta and for desert the orange blossom polenta cake.   Also ordered the Parma pizza.  Order of things must have gotten mixed up, cause a table in our section got their apps before us but we ordered first.   The main came for us before them (our app came after the main so might have been forgotten).   The bruschetta was the highlight of the meal.   Flavour was delicious and so creative.  Lots of different elements in it.   The fungi pasta had great flavour but didn't find it to have much mushroom variety and was on the small size, pizza was nice as well.  My only problem with the mains was the serving temperature.   Everything came out lukewarm at best.   I noticed a hamburger that was put on the warmers and must have sat there for a good 8 min before being taken to its table (only item so not like they were waiting for the rest of the table to get theirs).  Plates were hot but pizza was a bit on the cold side.    Pasta sauce already settled when it came to our table.  Polenta cake was nice.  Nice hints of orange in the cake and the pomegranate was a nice compliment.  Overall for the price I expected more.   After tip lunch was about $65 (no alcohol) , I expected more.   Would probably not be visiting again"}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant and was greeted by a friendly host. Sat down and I can tell they really tried to put a lot of effort into the interior design to make it appear a bit more cozy and upscale. There was a section by the bar where it looked like they were hanging cured meat like a street market, which was pretty cool looking. Think it was fake though.  Started off with the appetizer of calamari for everyone to share. Nice and crispy, made well.   Here's the part where things start going down. After ordering for our main course, it took them  about 35-40mins to serve 5 of us our food. We had all ordered pasta, steak and fish cakes but the time to prepare all that should not have taken so long. We arrived before rush hour and it still took that long.  I ordered the Jamie's Sausage Pappardelle and it was delicious. The pasta wasn't overly or undercooked, the sausage and sauce was a little sweet. What I found interesting was how the pasta was a extremely long ribbed piece of flat noodle, which I had never seen before.  For the price, it was what I expected for a Italian restaurant with a famous chef name slapped on it. Food was good, but the time it took for us to get served was a turn off. Won't be coming back here any time soon, but don't let that discourage you from at least trying out this place."}
{"text":"The day my friend and I found out Jamie's was in Toronto, our first thought was that we had to go! My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon at 4pm. She had the Tagliatelle Bolognese and I had Jamie's Sausage Pappardelle. We both had the small portion of the pasta and we had the Artisan Bread appetizer. Our server's name was Marie. The bread was good but it was not Jamie's bread. It was ACE Bakery. I can get that from Shoppers Drug Mart. We were not warned about this until the bread came that it was not made in house. The Tagliatelle was very good except a baby would eat this dish and still be hungry. The Sausage Pappardelle was okay, nothing very special about it - but it was also very small portioned. We were not warned about the portion size. We wouldn't of minded paying more if we would of known how small the portion would of been. We both finished our meal in a blink of an eye. We paid for our food, left and went to the Yorkdale food court. My friend got a shawarma and I got a poutine."}
{"text":"I've never been written a bad review before, but I had to make sure no one has to experience what we did. This is one of the worst restaurants I've been to in recent memory.  Do not, under any circumstances, eat here.  If you're at Yorkdale, you're better off at Joeys or even the food court.  Let's start from the beginning:  We called the restaurant 3 times, before leaving home and got no answer. It was Thursday night and we wanted to make sure we could get a table.  We decided to take a chance and go anyway.  When we got there and asked why they didn't answer the phone, they said they don't answer the phone in the evenings because they only have one phone line and needed to keep it open; for what, I don't know.    We sat at the table and no one came to get our drink order for 10 minutes.  The restaurant was only moderately busy.  We tried to look online to see what dishes people recommended but there was no cell reception.  So we waited.  When the server finally came he was pleasant but offered no apology for the wait.  After we got our drinks we placed our order.  Because it was our first time there, we decided to share our items to see how we liked the food, rather than ordering a lot and having it go to waste. We got the calamari and the Italian burger.  Some might fault us for getting a burger at an Italian restaurant, but there was a lot attention given to it in local media and there was even a video online showing how it's made.  When we got the calamari, the portion was tiny in comparison to the price.  It was too salty, rubbery, and there was no heat or chilli flavour, even though the waiter made mention there was.  The burger was absolutely awful.  We told them we were sharing but they didn't split it, even thought every other restaurant we've ever shared a burger at has done so.  When we asked for a knife to split it, they didn't offer to take it back and cut it, they just dropped a knife off at the table. There were no distinct or discernible flavours. The textures and toppings were bizarre.  The tartness of the gherkin was missing, there was no heat from the chillies and the \"salsa\" was just cherry tomato halves that only watered down the burger. Although there were numerous toppings, the burger had no taste; not even smoked/Bbq/grilled taste to the meat. It was not worth being on any menu at any restaurant.  A fast food burger has more flavour.  When we got our bill, we thought the nightmare was over. It was not.  Because of the aforementioned lack of reception, the credit/debit machine could not connect to receive the payment.  We waited as the server went back and forth getting new machines, and each would fail.  On the fourth try it finally worked, and we got out of there as quickly as possible.  Jamie Oliver should be embarrassed to have his name on this restaurant. It's a total dud."}
{"text":"Went here after shopping and surprised there was no wait! Remember the wait was crazy when it first opened. Great fresh choice of pasta! Thursdays are half off mojitos - my favorite! Overall great service and food - will come back"}
{"text":"Pros: great ambience, nice restaurant layout  Cons: the food is expensive for what you get. Portions are very small and nothing special. Most dishes are spicy so if you can't handle spice you should ask them to dial down spice.   Dishes: garlic bread- 1 star, basically hard flat bread Porchetta - mostly fat and lots of garnish and very small portion Seafood sphaghetti special- came with 3 mussels and 2 small scallops.  The drinks are expensive and served in very small glasses and small portions. It's seems like they want to be in New York but they aren't.  Overall, you are paying for the name and the location but the food and drinks are less than average. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place is a \"meh\" in my books and there is a reason why the reviews are so mixed on Yelp. I came here after work and I can say that the set up, location, and decor are all beautiful as you would expect for any establishment in Poshy Yorkdale.  The service we had was good and they had some pretty good specials on their board as well.  I opted to order the Burger and got a side of veggies to compliment it. The burger was nothing special and full of sauce and tasteless bread.  The patty was decent but you can tell it was not fresh.  The best part of this dish was the veggies because they grilled it with some magic or something. Haha!  Anyways, I wont be coming back here anytime soon and there are a lot better options around."}
{"text":"It's alright, nothing too special.   Considered going for Summerlicious but didn't end up having time. Visited on a Saturday at 7:45 and had reservations for 5. Thought we'd get a six seater but ended up with a 4 table + 1 (on the second floor!!) - oh well. The location is right beside one of the Yorkdale entrances facing North and was easy to find.   Ordered the Porcini Fettucine, and maybe it was the way it was presented or something, but it looked the smallest amongst the other pasta dishes that my group ordered (Prawn linguine and Gennaro's Tagliatelle Bolognese). The taste was alright, if anything a bit on the salty side. It came with a side of breadcrumbs and gave the dish a little bit of variety. It felt like the toppings were lacking and that I was just eating straight pasta. My party also ordered Funky Chips to share and they were quite nice, with the hint of garlic and parsley. Not too salty and freshly fried.   I found service to be a bit sloppy when it came to taking orders and clearing. The server needed to repeat our orders a few times to make sure they memorized it correctly, and luckily everything came without issue. Clearing, even the server admitted it was an \"unprofessional clear\", as some cutlery was falling out of the dishes. Water was always filled and the menu items were explained to us well, so thats something.  At 18.95 for the pasta, I thought it was a bit expensive relative to the portion. The experience was alright and it was nice to be so close to the mall (pre or post-shopping meal) I would be inclined to try the weekday lunch specials if returning in the future. That being said, don't just look at the name of the restaurant and be expecting to be blown away."}
{"text":"I went to Jamie's Italian with very high expectations, since I enjoyed the same restaurant in London city few years ago. Compared to London, this restaurant is massive with two floors.   The service was simply ok. We told our waiter, that we are ready to order drinks and our meals. He took my wine order then ran away to bring water, without letting us finish the order. Then he pours into three glasses out of four and takes our order. So I poured my sister's glass with water. I had to ask him what the special of the day; usually they let you know about that before the order.  Meal:  My dad got the burger and fries: burger over cooked, and the bun broke apart. Fries was good. My sister Simran got Margherita pizza, the crust was hard, like it was stale. My sister Jaan got Parma pizza, she liked her pizza I got the squid salad (the special menu of the day) with polenta chips. My salad was very bland. I had the polenta chips in London (loved there), but here the chips here were under cooked.   Overall, we were so disappointed that we didn't even want to order any desert.   I need go back to London city, England!"}
{"text":"The food was at part at best , maybe it just me but the service he was bad for a major chef restaurant. I had to wait 20 minutes for service then I had to call for other wait staff for service. The forgot an item on my daughter manure we order . For me , now that I know I rather go to other restaurants for same foods and price but better service .. it was a bad experience for me ."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto right now! Their food is out of this world - especially their seasonal specials! I love love love their famous prawn linguine! You can't go wrong at Jamie's! They also have the best non-alcoholic drinks ever! A lot of the times, I find restaurants don't have enough good non-alcoholic options. I would definitely recommend the refresher or lemon Ricky (seasonal). The service is amazing - their people really know what they are talking about! Good wait time management as well - they just text you when you're table is ready so you can maximize your time at Yorkdale Mall! For the quality and brand as well as the location, it's really good value! Never been disappointed here and I have recommended many friends and family who have also enjoyed their time here very much. Don't hesitate - guarantee you will have a great time!!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  They have a number of gluten-free options on the menu including all of their pastas except the gnocchi. You have to actually ask the waiter for this information though since they don't specify on the menu what items are gluten-free. I ended up getting a small size of the porcini fettuccine pasta and the classic super food salad on the side. The combined portions was the perfect amount for me, but the prices of the smaller sizes are barely cheaper than the full sized versions so I basically paid for two meals. Given the size of the portions, it was not worth paying two meals for. The menu also only lists the prices for the full sizes so you don't know how much you're spending if you get the smaller size.   For dessert the gluten-free options are gelato, sorbet or the orange blossom polenta cake. I went with the cake, which was refreshing and delicious.  Overall the food was good. I found the prices too high for what you're getting though. You're definitely paying for location and the brand name here. For the same price that I spent here I could have gone to a more upscale restaurant in downtown Toronto that had amazing food and a good atmosphere. Our waiter was helpful and pleasant, but the restaurant was loud and didn't match the price point of the food. It's comparable to a Kelsey's or Applebee's but here they charge you at least 20% more.    My last gripe was accessing this restaurant. If you're coming by TTC or park on the other side of the mall, good luck finding this place. The mall directory is completely useless and when you do finally find the out of place side hallway next to the Forever 21 leading to the restaurant, you notice a terrible sign for the restaurant. It's black with black font by a black background. You also can't access the restaurant from inside the mall. You have to exit the mall and enter in from the sidewalk. WTF!   TL;DR good food but overpriced; hard to find from inside the mall"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place solely because of the poor service.  It was during the holidays. I was with my mom and 4 of my (elderly) aunts--we were a party of 6. We came in during the afternoon.   My family was not crazy hungry. We came in to nibble on some food. We figured since we were all there, it was an ideal time to check out the restaurant after a morning of shopping.   I ordered for the table. We decided to share a few dishes, but our server advised me that my order would not be sufficient enough for my party. Three times he told me (in a condescending manner) that I did not order enough food. Three times I explained to him that my party doesn't eat large servings and it would be enough. He suggested we order appetizers. I ordered one appetizer. He informed me that it was small and insufficient for our table. I told him it was okay and we only wanted to try it.  My family preferred not to drink alcohol. They all wanted water. His response before taking the menus back to punch in the order was kind of a scoff/sneer/half laugh.   Our water took forever to come to us. There was no quality check after 2 bites. Our appetizer came after our main dishes. We were still waiting on cheese and pepper.   My aunt, who really wanted cheese, flagged down a fellow who sort of looked like a manager. His response was, \"What do you want?\"  I am very flexible when it comes to restaurant service, as I've been a server for several years at various establishments. This experience, however, will not be forgiven. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Thank you thank you thank you for removing rabbit off your menu!!!! :) came back for the 2nd time this week.  Love the ginger mojito!"}
{"text":"After we were finished the appetizer, our mains arrived shortly.  The Parma pizza was a classic Margherita pizza (crushed potatoes, basil, fior di latte, with extra virgin olive oil) topped with prosciutto, arugula, and Parmigiano Reggiano (hard, granular cheese).  This was really, really good!  The pizza was thin crust and it was so thin that when you held it up, it was like holding a cracker.  The ingredients just melded together so well and it was really delicious.  The prosciutto was really good -- sliced thiny, too!  I could have eaten another half of this pizza if there were more."}
{"text":"Hmmmm... I really wanted to love this place. The decor was nice and the service was fantastic. I am giving this place a 4 instead of 3 is because of the service. The food is really just a 3.   I ordered the classic burger, which was way too salty and greasy. The waiter recommended an appetizer which he was really fond of (deep fried cheese balls). So I took him up on it. When it came - it was nicely displayed so I took my first bite to realize it was really really mushy. It looks crunchy but it was pretty bad.   My husband ordered the pasta which was decent. Nothing to rave about.   When the waiter came back and asked how was everything, I said well - everything is good except for the deep fried cheese balls you recommended. He apologized and then the manager came and said he will just take it off our bill. I was pretty surprised! Most restaurant would have said suck it up - you ordered it.   So I was pleasantly surprised, but they really need to work on the food. I'm pretty disappointed since it's a Jamie Oliver resto!"}
{"text":"Ambiance and food all exceeded our expectations. My husband and I are big fans of Jamie Oliver, so it was no surprise that we were extremely excited to try out his restaurant after hearing a lot about it. To start, we ordered the ravioli bites and the artisan bread plate. The ravioli bites were absolutely exceptional and we wish that we ordered more. The artisan bread platter was very nice, as we had a variety of breads and were served balsamic vinegar, olive oil and a really nice tomato and olive spread. My only complaint about any of our appetizers was that our server cut the bread with his hands and I'm not sure how sanitary that in fact is, as we didn't see him wash his hands etc.   For our mains, my husband ordered the shrimp linguine and I ordered the mushroom pasta. I can't recall the name off the top of my head. I had ordered the Bolognese, but it was sold out. This did not bother me at all because I know that the pasta is made fresh every day in the restaurant. It is not microwavable garbage that you get at subpar Italian restaurants.  We ordered the epic brownie for dessert, and it truly lives up to its name. Epic. We are coming back for more.  Hats off to everyone at Jamie's, our server was fantastic and the food was incredibly delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"We went to Jamie's Italian after a day of shopping at Yorkdale Mall. There were plenty of tables available on a Sunday night.   We ordered the fried squid to start, and found the portion very small for the price. We then asked the server what pastas to order, so we ended up getting the bolognese and the porcini fettuccine. Both pastas were bland and under seasoned. Overall, we were not pleased by their quality of food."}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner as I'm such a fan of Jamie Oliver. Food: 2/5 The hits: cherry cheesecake, sauce on the prawn pasta, Italian nachos, pizza dough. The misses: undercooked pasta, bland beef carpaccio resembling deli roast beef, sour low alcohol sangria Ambiance: 3/5 pretty renovations, Italian rustic hipster vibes, no where to hang jackets for bar stools without backs! Jackets all over the floor Service: 2/5 my server was not very attentive and jammed/folded my left over pizza in a small takeout container"}
{"text":"I loved it here and think it's a great addition to Yorkdale. The food was excellent, a great atmosphere and its super family friendly.  We came on a Thursday afternoon a few days after opening. You can make reservations online, but this time we just walked in. Around 12:30pm, there were lots of people, mostly mom's having lunch. I really appreciate the consideration for kids - high chairs, cool toys for toddlers and menus, a family washroom on the main floor with automatic doors, space for strollers.   Service was great, and servers friendly.   We ordered two appetizers to start. The Mushroom Fritti - deep friend king oyster mushrooms with an aioli dipping sauce. It was really good - the breading wasn't thick and the juicy mushroom was right underneath and full of flavour. The mushroom bruschetta was good, but only one large piece for $8 seems a bit pricey. We actually wanted the fried ravioli but they had run out (or but didn't make it yet....)  We got 2 small size pastas for mains. My friend ordered the Bolognese. I had a taste and I have to say it was the best I've ever tasted. Full of flavour. Its not just your regular meat sauce. i might get this next time. I got the Porcini Mushroom Fettucini. So much flavour, so many mushrooms. Came with breadcrumbs to sprinkle over so it doesn't get soggy.  The small pasta size was a good portion although it comes and seems small. Pasta is heavy. And you'll have room for dessert. I would say get a larger size if you didn't have appetizers.   For dessert I got the lemon meringue cheesecake. A lemony cheesecake topped with a sweet marshmellowy meringue. My friend who said he'd only have 1 bite, ended up eating half of it. It was so good.   Meal with 2 non alcoholic drinks, 2 apps, 2 mains and 2 desserts came out to be about $35 per person not including tip.   I loved it so much, I'm looking for an excuse to go back again. Love this new addition, and I hope that service and quality of food will just continue to get better."}
{"text":"Jamie's Italian Location: Yorkdale Shopping Center (3401 Dufferin St.) Access: TTC Subway, Bus, Free Parking available Price: $25 per person Blogsters` Rating: 4/5   Came here with my boyfriend on a late Friday night to celebrate my birthday. Surprisingly, this place is not packed and we got seated right away. I love the venue, it has a rustic English / Italian feel with a modern twist. The front area has extremely high ceilings with big windows. If you're lucky enough to be seated in the front area, you'll be able to watch the sunset.   Cured meats are hang along the bar area, which gives a raw feeling to the whole decor and setting.  The service was great. Our server was very friendly and always smiling. She actually recommended all the dishes that we ordered that night - two pastas, a pizza, and a drink.  Squid & Mussel Spaghetti | flash-fried squid & mussels with white wine, parsley & lemon | This was awesome! Pasta was cooked to perfection - Al Dente! A very aromatic dish yet no fishy smell from the seafood at all. However, if you don't like garlic, you might want to look into some other dishes. This was perfect for me; from the presentation to the aroma to the taste, everything was spot on! They were very generous with the portion as well, I wasn't able to finish the pasta.  Spicy Sausage Cassarecce | pork & fennel ragù with chilli, rapini, herby breadcrumbs & parmigiano reggiano | You can tell the chef did put a thought into the presentation of the cassarecce. It was presented with lots of different kind of colours and texture from the vegetables. However, it was a little bit too spicy for me. Also, the pasta was overcooked and the texture was too soft. This dish was not as exciting as the seafood pasta, but it still have it's own place.  The Carne | crushed tomatoes, finocchiona, smoky pancetta & spicy salami with fior di latte & oregano | The pizza was a disappointment. Both my boyfriend and I loved it on our first bite, but as soon as we realized that they were using nann bread (or something similar to that texture and taste) as the pizza dough, everything about that pizza just went downhill. The nann bread ruined the authenticity of the pizza. It also got harder as it got colder. It was actually good that the pizza base was thin, so that it was easier for us to bite into it after it got hardened. Yet I have to admit, the salami on the pizza was amazing, very flavourful.   Ginger Mohito | mint, lime, sugar & ginger beer | My very first sip of the Ginger Mohito was \"WOW!\" The ginger gives a very strong kick, and because of that your palette is asking for more and more. I love this drink. You can taste all the ingredients that the bartender has put it. The mint, lime, and ginger, they all compliment each other very well.  I enjoyed my visit at Jamie's Italian very much. I was skeptical about this restaurant at first because their reviews are not that great. I guess people have a higher expectation from this restaurant because it is operated by one of the world's most famous chef - Jamie Oliver. Anyhow, I couldn't mind coming back and enjoy another visit."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch (Tuesday) they were not busy at all, and I love Jamie Oliver so I was very excited! The service (the waiters) were great, however for one appetizer and two entrees it took THREE HOURS. The crab bruschetta sounded delicious, yet we were so disappointed to find that it was 99% anything other than crab. Entrees were average - I got the honeycomb cannelloni, my friend had the superfoods salad, both very average yet presentation was great.  Maybe I'll go back if they speed up meal time! But for now I'll stick to the moxies in Yorkdale!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today with my friend, the decor was great, staff friendly.  The food was good but I was not blown away.  I love Jamie Oliver but with those high menu prices, the portion sizes need to go way up.  We ordered the crispy squid to start - it came with a tasty, tangy mayo on the side and covered in chillies and fried garlic - the flavours were there but for $9.95 it was an appallingly small portion.    We got the half sized pasta dishes as our mains (RIGATONI POMODORO & PORCINI FETTUCCINE) and again, for like, $9.00 a bowl (one of the cheaper options too), they were ridiculously small amounts, was tasty but I did not feel like it was worth that amount ($7.95 maybe?).]  We also ordered the polenta chips which were a stand-out - however, we found it a bit dry so asked for the same mayo dip we got with the squid which evened the dish out more.  But they were beautiful, golden & crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  All in all, I will give this restaurant another try becuase I'm curious about the desserts and a few other dishes but I'm not in love with the place at the moment."}
{"text":"High price tags for mediocre food.  Atmosphere: Great Noise: High Food: Meh + Salty Portion: Small $$$ Service: Great Note: No wifi, No data signal, no service.   Where I was sitting, I barely got any phone or LTE signal. They need to provide WIFI at least.   My expectation was high entering this place. The atmosphere was great and servers were friendly, but you need more than that to have returning customers.  First of all, I felt the menu choices were very limited, and not very \"Italian\".  You can tell by its Crispy Squid. When's the last time you saw \"squid\" in an Italian menu instead of \"Calamari\"? And who charges this cheap dried fried cuttlefish for $11 and serves only a handful. Three of us only had a couple of bites each and it was done.   The crab pasta was very salty, the sausage was salty as well. The pork belly (pancetta) pieces that came with were extremely salty, it wasn't edible. I think it came with some kind of a bread(focaccia ) but it was mostly burnt, so we couldn't have it. Margherita pizza wasn't salty but it was nothing special.   Everything looks fantastic but that's what you pay for.  If you want to enjoy good Italian food, there are tons of better places in the GTA."}
{"text":"New restaurant....then we must try so since we are celebrating a birthday, we went there on a Saturday to try the place. We called ahead and they said they do not  have reservations for party of 8. Ok we got that and we know it's going to be busy so off we go...Once we got to the resto the host ask us if we have a reservation and we said no since they said they don't take any when we called then she said ok and it will be 3 1/2 hours wait so we were told to go walk in the mall and they will call us when the table is ready and since we were there at 6, we still agreed to wait since we are eager to try the resto.  3 1/2hrs have passed and still didnt received any call then we went back to the resto and ask the host when our table is ready and she said at 8:45...of course some of us were really hungry at that time and then we had to wait another 15mins...we were told what is 15mins if we already waited for so long then they had an impression that we are already seated and so we found out that our supposed to be table are given to another party of 8 that's why we had to wait again and of course we are all pissed at that time..:  Once we were seated and given a menu, the manager went to our table saying something like: \"I heard that somebody is upset\" and so we said that we are because of the situation that happened..and instead of apologizing, he went on and on as to why we are upset if we only had to wait another 15minutes more...so we told them if he cant even apologized, just leave us so we can order since we were starving at that time but instead he went and said: \"why should I leave, it is my building\"....Seriously!!!! And still arguing with my cousin....and we were told we dont have to be there....  I have tried so many restaurants all over and so far, this is the worst...so instead of us thinking as to what they will do to our food, we just walked out and eat in the restaurant close by even though we waited for nothing.  For a new restaurant with very rude and have some attitude problem employees....This restaurant won't last. If I can give it 0 stars I would. Not recommended to anyone and definitely won't go back to try it."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've written a review without having dined at the restaurant. In fact, I haven't even stepped foot onto the premises. I didn't even venture as far as into viewing pictures online. I don't even know what's on the menu and not a clue on costs. I was game to visit for my first time because of positive word of mouth reviews.  I am giving Jamie an utterly dismal mark because I wanted to make a dinner reservation on a Friday evening. Knowing that the restaurant is popular, and could be very busy, I figured planning ahead like I always do, I figured making a reservation for 28 days from now isn't terribly aggressive, nor at all close to last minute.  I was surprised to hear that on Friday's after 5:00 p.m., it is a walk-in only establishment, and that I should arrive 30 minutes in advance to get a table for our group of four.  Excuse me, but I do not want to wait like a dirty animal outside, be your marketing puppet, to create the illusion that the establishment is busier than it is. I'll take my appetite elsewhere as there are plenty of better restaurants in Toronto who would be happy to take my reservation [In fact, I've been given direct contact numbers by restaurant owners who wants to make my experience special every time I visit. Granted, this is in the extreme in customer service, and would never expect this at Jamie Oliver's; esp. after my experience with reservations this afternoon.]."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Jamie's at Yorkdale. Loved the decor! Decided to try the Prawn linguine and I loved it. The pasta was perfectly cooked, as was the shrimp. The arugula added a nice spicy taste that also helped make the dish lighter. The sauce was amazing, I sopped it all up with the Polenta chips.  The polenta chips were a little on the salty side and could have used with some sort of dipping sauce.   I enjoyed my dinner but I feel that the pasta could be replicated at home."}
{"text":"Really nicely decorated restaurant. Staff was friendly (although the communication between the staff was not very good. They brought out the same food twice for our table and for the table next to us.), the food was delicious and the service was fast.   We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good stuff: the food is fresh and tasty. There isn't as much variety as you might expect, but I admire the use of simple fresh ingredients to create delicious meals. The garlic bread with lemon ricotta was absolutely to die for. 3 of the 4 people in my group got the tagliatelle bolognese and were raving about it. I got the meatball pappardelle which was tasty, but much spicier than expected, and ultimately I wish I had ordered what everyone else had. Having said that, considering the amount of time we spent waiting for a table, and for our food to arrive, I expected the food to be much better than it was. It was good, but not *great*.  Also, the cocktails were really tasty. I enjoyed a \"La Dolce Vita\" which was really, really tasty.  I also like that when you come to get a table and you have to wait (no reservations on Fridays through Sundays and the wait was 45 minutes to an hour) they'll take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, meaning you can go and do your shopping around the mall.  But, the service: wow. This is where it all falls apart for me. It is tremendously slow - even just waiting for someone to take our drink order in the bar was something like a 10-15 minute wait. The wait staff was friendly enough, but slow. And we were shocked at the number of times our waiter didn't know who ordered what drink, or what appetizer, or what meal (especially when 3 out of the four people ordered the same meal). If it was a particularly busy night it would be a bit more understandable but it didn't seem any busier than your average Saturday night at any other restaurant and I've never had service this slow before.  I won't be hurrying back to Jamie's Italian. Perhaps when it's been around a bit longer, and they sort out their staffing issues, and the waits die down it'll be worth revisiting. In the mean time though there are plenty of other better options near by."}
{"text":"Food is good and hot,I have the Carbonara and I was pleasantly surprise, really creamy. The staff was friendly and helpfull with the menu and wine selection . It was a little bit more expensive then what I was thinking but worth it. Had a good time with friends"}
{"text":"I came here during Summerlicious 2017, saw it had some availability and I figured why not? Ever since I saw the restaurant being constructed, I wanted to go.   The decor inside of the restaurant is very nice. Very rustic Italian vibe- true to the Jamie Oliver I know. In the front, there was a few items you can purchase that belong to the Jamie Oliver brand (obviously). When it came to the service it was friendly, everyone was very smiley even for what seemed to be a busy Thursday night. Our server was super friendly and was good at what he did.   On to the food! My husband ended up doing the summerlicious menu however I didn't see an appy that tickled my fancy. So I ended up just doing my own app and entree. My husband ended up enjoying everything he ordered. The appetizer was a crab arancini and Chicken Al mattone. From the little tastes he would allow me to have (he really did enjoy it) it was pretty yummy. When it came to my food I ordered the garlic bread and the Gennaro's Tagliatelle Bolognese. The garlic bread was delicious and the pasta was alright. It was fresh so that's a bonus but whoever was on pasta duty, loves salt! I mean really loves salt. It was so salty and add that on top of the salt in the meat sauce, you got yourself craving water like your in the desert.   The service was good and the experience was fun! I would try again and hope that the Salt lover is not making my pasta again. Give it the ol' college try."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and we ordered the following based on our waiter's recommendations: - crispy calamari  - chicken puttanesca  - tagliatelle bolognese  - brownie dessert  Overall the food was okay. The portion of the calamari was little. There was probably like 10 small pieces and it was $13. Didn't think it was anything special and not worth the money. I've been to places where you get a mountain of calamari for the same price. Maybe the waiter ate some of it on the way to our table.   The pasta was good. They make fresh pasta which is expected for an Italian restaurant. The chicken puttanesca was good as well. Good portions for you to be relatively full. But I came hungry.   The brownie was probably the best part. Again, small portion for the price but I didn't mind it since it was warm and had a nice gooey texture topped with ice cream and caramel popcorn as garnish.   The atmosphere was very nice but I felt some tables were too close. When the waiter was speaking to the table beside us, his butt was inches away from touching my arm."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place and see what it was like.  Made a reservation and was taken immediately to our table.  Server was very nice.  We ordered rice balls and two pastas.  First thing, the small size really is small!  Order the large.  This was lunch, but still it was too small.  I had the mushroom fettuccine.  Very good.  Atmosphere wasn't too noisy.  We sat up on the balcony.  There were a lot of families eating.  All in all we enjoyed it.  Would love to try the pizzas next time..."}
{"text":"Prosciutto Pear Salad was pretty great. Lots of prosciutto was presented on the perimeter of the plate which justified its price. Could have used more pear to balance off the saltiness of the prosciutto.   Mojito was very fresh! It's a bit of a small glass though because there's a lot of limes and such to give it that great refreshing taste.   Only thing that's weird is that you can't get into the restaurant from the mall. You have to exit the mall to find the entrance of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Has the superfood salad and thought it was amazing. Quinoa, half avocado, broccoli, pomegranate, etc.   Large was $15. Maybe a bit more than I would have liked to pay but fair enough. It's sort of an upscale place so figured that's how much it would cost.   We had the garlic bread too which was very nice.   Service was really great too"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. It's not a good day to come on a Saturday. We had our name down at 7:30 and didn't get a table till almost 9:30pm. Good thing we were able to walk around the mall. But 2 hours isn't a good way to start especially they tell you about an hour wait.  We then order the appetizer and drinks. The drinks didn't come until we finished the appetizer. There was a mistake somewhere. At the end of the dinner the manager gave use a free dessert which was very nice of him. But it really didn't do much because the damage was done. I would recommend anyone want to get a table should do a reservation days before.  The food was pretty good and the service was good too. Too bad the wait of everything else was a thumbs down."}
{"text":"Tucked in a mall, found out they have 3 course for $25 at lunch. Homemade lemonade was bit tart. Meal was on the spot. Bruschetta was divine with right amount of toasted bread seasoning cheese and fresh tomato. Interesting tomatoes were cold yet cheese was warm and melting. Simple tomato pasta dish came with bread crumbs which ended up absorbing most of tomato sauce. Polenta cake was a nice touch. Had an espresso which was also very good. All in all great taste and even better prices. Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered the prawn pasta and mushroom pizza. The pasta was nice and fresh, but other than that, there was nothing special about it. The pizza is decent, but a little on the salty side. Portions of the pasta was on the smaller size. Overall, not a bad place to stop and grab a bit while shopping at the mall. I wouldn't purposely make a trip to Yorkdale just to have this, though."}
{"text":"The food here is good although I feel like the prices are a bit higher than I expected. I wish they had more selection on their menu and I'm sure the food on the menu is good but every time I have visited I have felt that there are a few things that I can eat on the menu most things have pork or sausage or just not the type of things that appealed to me. I wish the prices were lower and there were more options available. I was able to eat the mushroom fettuccine which was delicious but I wished there was an option to add chicken or meat to this"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the low average rating. I think maybe people aren't ordering the right things. I had a couple appy before and was slightly disappointed, the salad in particular was very uninspired. But the pasta is unreal. You want really really good pasta, this is the place. I give it 5 stars because besides pasta, the service is excellent. Everyone is very accommodating and friendly. I was comped a meal by the host for a very very minor inconvenience and simple misunderstanding. He went above and beyond my expectations."}
{"text":"Came in on a friday night.  We had the barasa sausage and the prawn linguine.  For appetizer we had the Arugula salad.  The salad had a pinch of salt which made it just perfect.  The sausage and linguine was really good.  Service was impeccable (rivals that of a high end restaurant) as they would occassionaly check in with us and ensured water was filled.  They were well staffed and hopefully this service continues as the restaurant continues to operate.  5 star based on this visit!"}
{"text":"Food was ok... cold pizza.. terrible service. We literally waited 50 minutes on a not so busy Sunday night for our server to bring us water. They forgot to take the pine nuts off of the ravioli as we had an allergy at our table. They also forgot the caramel corn on our epic brownie. Terrible service, step up your game!!  UPDATE: They charged us for 2 pastas instead of 1, just saw the bill when i got home! Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Very unfortunate that we weren't able to meet Gordon Ramsay, but I knew he was there in spirit. I knew he was somewhere yelling at someone who cooked the food raw. But the food at this place was pretty good, not terrible. The flavor was there, but there are definitely better Italian restaurants out in Italy. One of the better restaurants at Yorkdale I must say. The crunchy Italian nachos were really good tho, we almost had a food-orgasm. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We first came to Jamie's Italian about a year ago and had a fantastic experience. The waiter - an older gentleman with an Italian accent - was attentive and helped us pick absolutely delicious vegetarian items. We got a salad, some flat bread and a side of the tomato sauce, and everything was just perfect. That mouth-watering, satisfying yet unassuming food I dream of when I think of Jamie Oliver and Italy.   So, we were quite excited to be back today and wow, what a disappointment. The food was edible, at best, and it takes me a lot to say this since I am not picky and tend to enjoy the atmosphere and focus on the positive even at ok restaurants. But this was really not good.  We got the quinoa-lentil salad, the pomodoro pasta, a Margarita pizza and some fries. I tried really hard to find something that was good but I really couldn't.   To top it all off, the waitress, though kind, was constantly running to and from our table as if she was in the middle of something very important that couldn't wait and we were interrupting. There were only 3 or 4 tables of people in the whole restaurant, so there really was no need for that rush. I felt like a nuisance.   Bottom line: I felt very disappointed tonight but because of my fabulous experience the first time around, I wanted to take my time and spell out all this so that you can perhaps improve and get back to where used to be a year ago. All the best!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check out Jamie's for dinner. For a Wednesday night, we didn't think that it would be too busy. My first mistake : driving to Yorkdale post-Boxing Day. Thank goodness that I didn't get into a fender bender that night. The next morning I actually did a walk about to see if my car was okay. My second mistake: not making a reservation early enough. We ended up waiting for two hours (literally).   I love the ambiance here; the lights are dimmed and there's a lot of character here (different types of tables within the resto, marble bread cutting counter). We were seated at the back closer to the kitchen in a two-seater booth. The napkins here are made out of cloth and it says, 'Jamie's Italian.' I found it cute.   The food was great. I had the Jamie's Mojito, which had just the right amount of sweetness. By no means was it the best that I've ever had, but it was pretty good. As an appetizer, my friend and I shared the calamari - a good choice as it was the perfect portion to carry us over until our mains came. The garlic bread was quite good as well. Thin like naan bread with big pieces of thinly sliced garlic was delicious. Our mains were - porcini fettuccini (me) and arugula + prosciutto pizza (friend). I didn't have a bite of the pizza, but my pal said that she enjoyed it. I found the pasta to be yummy (hand and in house made). As dessert, we ordered the key lime meringue cheesecake and the tiramisu. The former was much better than the latter.   I'll definitely never wait two hours to dine here, but if I have a reso then I'll definitely be back.  Good for: pizza, pasta"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 8 PM, they let the table before us take their time paying the bill while we waited for 20mins. After waiting for a while someone comes to us with the decency to say the table is about to pay now and will be ready in another 10-15mins!!! WTF right? Total wait time was 25mins. This review was based on the reservation service and not their food. Update: food was salty and tasteless, order pizza and seafood pasta!"}
{"text":"I love the place! Even though normally I don't like chain restaurants, but this one is an exception. The food is great and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"For my friend's birthday, I wanted to take her to a upper class restaurant. Both she and I love Italian food, so we thought we should try Jamie's Italian. What a disappointment! I've got the prawn linguine. Very salty, the pasta wasn't cooked enough, a few prawns. $25! I have tasted something tastier at Scaddabush in downtown for $16. I think this restaurant is overpriced and the food is not even good. I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Food (7/10)  Value (3/10) Service (5/10)  Very overpriced for average tasting food and poor service. ~$30 for pasta Server was slow to take our order.  Table and seats  had crumbs and black pepper flakes all over."}
{"text":"I don't usually comment on a bad experience but I do have to rate this restaurant.  It was my wife birthday and the staff failed in service and the food was just ok.  My son informed the unobservant waitress that it was my wife birthday and noticed when the bill was delivered that a charge for 9.99 for a small brownie appeared. It would be fine if the waitress informed us of the charge. We also were charged for items on the bill that were not delivered and as we complained it seemed to be impossible to reverse.  The Manager provided a gift card for compensation although not even the same value as the charges, since the service charge is 18%.  Jamie- sorry to say not impressed, with so many other choices will not recommend or visit your restaurants. Yorkdale restaurant is affecting your Brand. Visit 06/10/17."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been to this location many times before and we really enjoy our meals. Last night we went for my birthday and we were completely blown away by the meals we had.  We had the Buffalo Bocconcini salad for appetizer which was so fresh and light - it was amazing.  We also had The Parma pizza and the Bolognese Pasta. Both were simply amazing! At first I was a little apprehensive about ordering the bolognese as each time we come I get the mushroom fettucine (which is amazing as well!), however, it was fantastic! The flavours of the wine and the sauce paired so well with the fresh pasta served.   Overall, the food was spectacular - my fiance is Italian and he was blown away too. We also expressed our delight for the meals with the brand manager who was so kind in listening to our praises. I would highly recommend coming here, each time we have come the food has been great, the atmosphere is lovely, and overall a great experience. :)"}
{"text":"The service and environment is great. Ordered their prawn pasta, the pasta itself tastes very fresh and you can tell it was made in house. The sauce was tasty and with a hint of spicy. Overall, it tastes good but not amazing. Check our instagram for more original food photos : excited2eat"}
{"text":"Way overrated!   The food was not great, expensive, so-so service (she was not rude but we had to hunt her down many times including trying to pay the bill.   Also they charged us 18% because we had 10 people WITHOUT telling us or we would have paid double tip (bad etiquette).     The $14 kids meal could have easily been mistaken for meal they get at school including an uncut apple, burnt and cold chicken.   The portions were so small that it did not even half fill up a 8 year old girl (who ended up having to eat two slices of our pizza)  The pasta was nothing special and the portions were small.   It tastes ok but for $20????      The pitcher of Sangria is FULL OF ICE!   It did not even fill up four glasses.  When we commented about the ice to the server she did not acknowledge and we stupidly ordered a second pitcher-what did get?   The same thing with lots of ice.  Another rip off!  Is it all bad?  The ambiance and pizza is good but that's about it.  There are much better choices in the city!   The name is not a reflection of the experience at all!"}
{"text":"Great food, but so disappointed about the service. We were 5 and gave us a table for 4, and constantly came to see if we were ok, they added a table and then took it away. Then the waiter was evasive and with kind of attitude. Second time I go and found waiters with bad attitude. Please coaching on customer service is really needed."}
{"text":"Sigh took me awhile to go back and write this review.   My best friend celebrated her 30th birthday here 2 weeks ago and although it started off rocky, it got worse and worse as the night went on. So reservations were made for 14 and she needed to change it to accommodate a few late rsvps, the answer was simply no because they reserve a large portion of their tables for walk ins. So instead on her birthday she had to go with her husband 2 hours before her party and wait for another table. They not only didn't try to accommodate, they put the other table physically as far as possible from the other one... i mean front of upstairs and back of downstairs far.  Either way, that didn't sour her mood even with the back and forth. We sat upstairs in a lovely side room that had a nice view of the lively crowd down below.   Our servers came in (a very eccentric mad and his quieter partner who barely ever spoke) We got there and seated around 8:30pm and didn't leave until 3 hours later. The downstairs table was seated around 910pm and finished around 11pm. The reason being is that we as a group of adults were being told how to eat and order our meal from this waiter. Who started off by telling us about Jamie Oliver and that he is just the face of the restaurants but the real man behind everything is this other guy.   Then he told us \"first you're going to order drinks, then appetizers, then I'll take your entree orders and you should order the large portions because in true Italian styles you order more to share with everyone at the table.\"   So true to his word, he would only take our drink order and when someone tried to order an app.,.. nope. Gotta wait.   By the time the downstairs table got their entrees we were just starting to get our apps.   All this besides the point, when we first got there my best friend's cousin and I asked this waiter to do something special for her and he pointedly said we don't give out free desserts. We never asked for one, so we told him we would like to order one.   So we finish eating and waiting around, while some people asked for their bill. The dessert never came, we asked her husband to check in with the waiter who then proceeded to tell him a bunch of lies.   1. She was taking too long to finish her pasta so he couldn't do the dessert. 2. Other people asked for their bills so he had to close the whole account and wasn't able to charge the dessert to any bill and he can't reopen a table or create a new tab.  ...-_-  Understandably he was upset because he was just downstairs where half the table got dessert and the other half got their bills at the same time. As patrons I didn't appreciate the behind the scene excuses he was giving us, I never heard of a restaurant not being able to put an order through for any reason.   To add salt to the wound, he came up to me after and yelled at me about how he didn't appreciate the way my friend, who he doesn't care who he is, spoke to him and he shouldn't be disrespected in that way. He was doing us a favor and he ended up bringing out the dessert and reminding me 3 times he is paying for the dessert out of his own pocket. At which point he disappeared and never came back to the table.  I found this really upsetting, he treated us like a bunch of teenagers, talked down to us and was condescending, and this was through out the entire experience.  Food: Shrimp linguine was under cooked, and I like my pasta al dente. There wasn't enough sauce on the pasta, but the shrimp was cooked nicely.  We had the arancini balls for appetizers and they were okay, not the best I've had. I liked the tomato sauce on the plate more, fresh and zesty,   The calamari was delicious, the batter was light but super crispy and nicely seasoned.  My bf had their burger and a side of polenta fries. They were a bit salty but still crispy and good! After the first 3 I needed water.   No one tried the pizza but the rabbit dish was pretty good.   Overall I won't be coming back here again, sub par food and horrible service. After reading other reviews I'm sure my decision to not take it up with a manager was a good one.   Yorkdale isn't my place already because of the attitude in the air when I pull in, which I'm sure the staff has to deal with some horrible people themselves but we definitely didn't do anything remotely wrong in this situation.  We were also told Jamie Oliver sits and watched all his restaurants though cameras at each location all sent to one computer... yea okay!"}
{"text":"This place is over ratted and overpriced. Is just like a regular Italian restaurant. Service was decent but food was slow. We sat next to the open kitchen and we could see that the food runner cannot handle the rush hour. We ordered a fried turkey for one of the main course and it was dried and hard like a rock. We wanted to order the most basic garlic bread but the server told us it was sold out. How that even possible."}
{"text":"Very overpriced, and everything tastes like they \"think\" they know what Italian food is supposed to taste like. Most of the items we had tasted greasy, or overly salted. The polenta chips were ok, if you eat them hot, and the staff was very friendly. But avoid this restaurant if what you're looking for is a good Italian meal."}
{"text":"It was a shopping day and we decided to try the Jamie's Italian in Yorkdale. Service was good, food was adequate and nothing to write home about.  The super-fresh combination of avocado, roasted beets, mixed pulses & grains, sprouting broccoli, fennel, pomegranate & spicy seeds with harissa & cottage cheese. It was slightly overpowering on the spicing.  The Caesar salad was ok. Too much tanginess in the sauce.  The Italian prosciutto with endive, arugula, pear, pine nuts, honey & balsamic was good   And the Grilled chicken breast, crispy pancetta, hard-boiled egg, avocado, crunchy romaine lettuce, sweet cherry tomatoes. The sauce was overwhelming that it was hard to eat. The romaine lettuce was not crispy. The sangria was very well presented and it tasted delicious.   It's definitely worth trying for yourself at least once and is kids friendly."}
{"text":"The first North American location of Jamie's Italian opening at Yorkdale? Well done Toronto. Celebrity chef crush aside, I was so stoked for this highly anticipated new Italian resto.   Located on the north side of the mall beside Indigo and banana republic there's no direct entrance from inside the mall - we made the mistake of looking for one.   Causal atmosphere and dimmed lighting, it's quite spacious with seating on 2 floors, large bar area, a cured meat counter and semi open kitchen at the back. Nice and relaxed layout.  Food highlights  - World's best olives on ice: I love olives but normally find the sodium levels insanely over the top and fortunately the saltiness of the ones here were perfect. Not sure if they are the 'worlds best' but they were very plump and delish.  - Crispy squid: Crowd pleaser app to try, very light, crispy and flavourful. We devoured this in seconds. - Funghi misti pizza: Yum! My fav item that night. The pizza was so fragrant and full of mushroomy deliciousness with a perfectly baked thin crust. - Pastas: We got Jamie's sausage paradelle and the pasta of the day with mussels and shrimp. Both pastas were a tad too al dente but the most disappointing were the sauces. Flavours were overly plain and kind of forgettable..  Overall, I was expecting the place to be more family style in terms of the decor and food but it had more of a chain restaurant vibe which may be what they are going for since more locations will be opening up in the near future. However, still had a positive experience and with better managed expectations I'll be back for another shot!"}
{"text":"atmosphere: 4/5 Went there on Saturday night and it was surprisingly not busy. Got sat on the patio right away and there were a few open tables around us. I didn't really like that the patio was right next to the main entrance, lots of people walking by as you're trying to eat and no view. However, the inside is very nicely done up and the bar looked amazing.   service: 5/5 Our server was very nice, gave us lots of time to look at the menu and even got me a rubber band because my hair was blowing everywhere.   drinks: 3.5/5 The bar tender had a heavy hand (which I guess is a good thing!!) I started with Jamie's mojito which I didn't think was sweet enough, but i also tend to like very sweet things. Afterwards I got the sangria (which is new to their menu) and it was ok. You have a choice of having it made with a white, red or rose wine. I got the rose and I was pretty disappointed. The glass is very small and it just didn't taste the way I thought it would. I always get sangria everywhere I go and this was probably my least favourite. My boyfriend got the Toronto and he liked it a lot.   food: 3.5/5 We started with the calamari, which was a very small portion for the price. Then I got the crab spaghetti which i found a tad too salty, dry and plain. My boyfriend got the gnocchi, which I normally don't like but I found it was very well done. The pesto was very fresh and I loved the purple and green colouring. We shared the affogato for dessert which was ok, good but not amazing.       Overall there was nothing wrong but I had had very high expectations for Jamie's kitchen and they just weren't met. Everything was just \"fine\"."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a meal here with my Mom for a girls night out recently.  We ordered the fried ravioli as a starter to share along with the grains salad (I forget the actual name) and both apps were so good! We split the mushroom pizza and the spaghetti bolognese. The pizza was very good as was the pasta, good portion sizes and tasted delicious.  We were too stuffed to try dessert, but we will next time!  Would return again if shopping at Yorkdale :)"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a group of about 15 work colleagues. The service was excellent but the food was so-so. A menu was pre-arranged - we had assorted apps served family-style, a few main entrees to select from, and then we could pick the dessert from the regular menu.   The margherita pizza didn't have much flavour.   The linguine pomodoro was decent - I had read complaints about the pasta not having enough sauce and didn't feel that way at all about the dish.   For dessert I had the chocolate brownie with vanilla bean gelato & carmelized popcorn - delicious :)"}
{"text":"All of the other reviewers are right, this place is just okay.  I'd say it's a more expensive version of Milestones with less quality control.  To start we had:  - \"World's best olives\".  There was nothing special about them. - Fried calamari.  Delicious. - Artisinal breads.  Good.  Mains (that I tried):  - Gnocci.  Too salty. - Salmon.  Undercooked veg.  Dessert:  - Gelato.  Delicious.   Overall, nothing special here."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was extremely keen to have a meal at Jamie's for as long as I knew about it's anticipated opening.  They don't take reservations on weekends so we showed up at around 6:30 to be told that there was a 1.5 hours waiting. So we walked a bit in the mall. We were a party of 5, our assigned table was at a far corner in the restaurant with my view to kitchen pipes and cables on the side.  Nothing eventful or worth to mention about my meal. I ordered the burger and it was ok, again, just ok.  However, our waiter attitude was appalling! He wasn't the happiest chap around! He was not rude to us but rather his tone, his moves, his way of talking not the best customer service and the feeling was shared by all of us.  At some point we asked for Tabasco sauce and he offered us chilli paste instead, so we said fine. I stepped up and walked behind him to go to the loo and I I heard him storming another young waitress about our request and the fact that they were apparently out of it.   I didn't enjoy my culinary experience at Jamie's, there was no phone reception and that made it hard to pay with cards as well so common!   I'll be at Jamie's Covent Garden in London this summer (and yes I was able to make a reservation on a weekend, unlike here in Toronto) so we'll see how it compares."}
{"text":"FOOD: Everything I ever tried from here has been delicious with the exception of the pizza. I personally like thin crust better. However, the pizza from Jamie's is way too thin.. I wouldn't even call it pizza anymore. The taste isn't bad, it is still decent but i wouldn't call it pizza. For appetizers, I always get the ravioli fritti and the crispy squid. Very good. The fresh crab bruschetta is OK. You're not missing much if you don't order it. The dry aged rib eye steak was very juicy and tender. I like my steak cooked in between medium rare and rare. The waiter suggested that I order it medium rare and it will be cooked the way i like it. He was right. The steak was perfect. i love mushrooms so mushrooms topped on the steak was perfect for me and very satisfying. The tagliatelle bolognese was delicious. I like how it comes in a lunch portion and a dinner portion. The lunch portion is perfect to share with another girlfriend with bigger main dish.  ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant isn't too loud. I find that the seating is a tad too close to each other though. I prefer sitting in the lounge area, which is a good atmosphere and vibe. There are high tables and a t.v with a full bar.  PRICING: The pricing is quite reasonable for the quality of the food. The lunch portion pasta is $10.. that is about the same price as a meal in the food court, except quality will be much better at Jamie's. The ravioli fritti was $6.95 and the crispy squid was $10.95. Pretty reasonable for appetizers. Portions are big enough to share between two girls. Maybe even three if you're ordering a main dish each.  Jamie's Italian is now my go-to restaurant whenever I am in the mall or near Yorkdale. Sorry Joey!"}
{"text":"Ordered the porcini fettucini and it was pretty decent. It did taste like the cream of mushroom soup you get in a can but the fettucini was cooked perfectly. Their sangria's are also amazing. The waitress did seem a bit grumpy and wasn't as welcoming as I would've liked but it could be because s he had a long day as we came in at 8. I wouldn't say this place is my favourite, I would much rather have gone to Joey's but it's a decent place to grab some Italian food"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it!  Nothing bad to say really, other than it was a 45 minute wait on a Monday night for a table for 8.  The atmosphere was nice, hostess and servers were super friendly.  Food was delicious, drinks were good as well, dessert was great!  We ordered calamari and bruschetta to start.  The calamari was definitely the better app choice IMO.  To drink I got one of their mocktails, which I found to be a bit too sweet.  My husband got the mojito, and he liked it.  For my main course I got the Porcini Fettuccine and it was delicious!  It came with a spoon with crispy bread crumbs to put on the pasta, which gave it a nice crunch.  My husband got the Pappardelle pasta which is slow cooked pork sausage with these long lasagna type noodles (their most popular dish) and it was great as well.  The only thing was he thought the portion could have been a bit larger.  Pasta was cooked perfectly.  I like my all dente (hate mushy pasta).  For dessert we tried the epic brownie which melted in my mouth.  It was super rich tasting, so if you are a chocolate lover, you must try.  We also tried the meringue cheesecake and it was very light and amazing as well.  Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed in myself for treating myself to this kind of food. From the moment you walk in you are greeted with attitude. We asked the waiter about what is popular pasta and he said idk it's all pasta handmade so that was very upsetting as a first time there. It was my first and last time to ever go there my husband even apologized for taking me to such place !!! How bad does a place have to be for someone to be embarrassed to take you?"}
{"text":"Went to dinner to Jamie's last night...was really happy with the general experience...beautiful restaurant, staff is amazing, we were a group of 5 were told 2 hrs wait and we got a table within 45 minutes! On a Saturday, that's pretty good!! The mojito was really good not too sweet not too dry...the bruschetta were yummmmmy!! My fave wild mushroom...the crispy squid....so fresh....the pasta were really good and fresh...a little too much salt but I'm salty person so was happy but some other people were a little disappointed, we didn't ask to change it but always after the fact that they would have made it over...service was great..."}
{"text":"We had lunch here after some morning shopping at Yorkdale.  It was a Saturday and was actually less busy than expected, likely due to the Canada Day long weekend.  My brother and I shared the Crab Spagetthi and Prawn Linguine.  Both were tasty and had a bit of kick of them.  ~$20 per entree.  My wife ordered the pizza special they had for the day -- which was a pesto-base topped with prosciutto and arugula.  The crust was nice and thin.  The kids' meal options were also pretty good - albeit a bit on the pricier side ($12.95 for the smaller kid portion).  Our daughter had the 7 cheese curly pasta which she really enjoyed.  Our son enjoyed the chicken lollipops (unbreaded chicken tenders).  They were served with a little bit of salad in plastic mason jars that you mix with a light, yogurt salad dressing.  Overall this was a good experience, comparable with Scaddabush or Alice Fazooli's."}
{"text":"I'm actually very surprised that this restaurant is rated 3 stars on Yelp.  The food, service, and atmosphere were absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"The porcini fettuccine and prawn linguini were both very good and the ravioli fritti was decent. Not impressed with the garlic bread and the kids cheesy pasta bake was dry and ridiculously small. Service was fast and friendly and ambiance had a cool rustic industrial vibe."}
{"text":"For a Thursday night, the place wasn't as busy like most people have been saying in their reviews. We were seated right away which was great.   The service was excellent. The food was super tasty. The prices are a little steep, but luckily they have special offers every now and then, and I ordered their margarita pizza for half the price. My friend got the bolognese pasta dish with garlic bread as an appetizer (good idea to scoop your leftover tomato sauce). Everything was super fresh. The only thing I would say is that the pizza had a lot of oil on it, which felt very heavy. But, it was still very good!  I will be coming again."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out as it is Jamie Oliver's first Toronto restaurant, and they did not disappoint. I did see many Yelpers complain about their waittimes and service, but we had no problem when we came in and our server was a sweetheart. On to the food - must-order items are their mushroom fritti, mushroom pizza, tiramisu and lemon merginue cheesecake. The mushroom items were really delicious and the desserts are wonderful. All four of us enjoyed those items alot!! I also had their rabbit casarecce (no longer on the menu), and that was just alright. I do understand people come having very high expectations (because its a Jamie Oliver restaurant), and left somewhat disappointed . But considering their pricing (similiar to Moxies), their food really is quite good among other similiarly priced restaurants in Yorkdale. I would definitely come back to try their other items."}
{"text":"loved the appetizers here, they always have a pizza on special for sharing. the arincinis and calamari were fantastic, think i had a flat bread too but it wasn't anything crazy. the pastas however were a bit disappointing. nothing spectacular, considering it's Jamie's and it's Buca's kitchen - i was expecting more. the first time i came, i was super excited for the mushroom pasta, but it was a bit cold and dry. the server was very nice and offered to remake it but i said it was okay. the rabbit pasta. i had the second time wasn't my kind of pasta but worth trying. all in all its good, i would definitely come back for some apps! i have been told their ravioli is very savoury and just the right amount."}
{"text":"It may have the name of an international celebrity chef in its name, but a mall restaurant is still a mall restaurant.  Technically speaking, Jamie's Italian is a franchise chain, and the first North American location ever inside Toronto's Yorkdale Shopping Centre is owned by the same people behind other popular upscale Toronto eateries like Buca. But technically speaking also, the entrance to the restaurant cannot be reached inside the mall; one needs to step out of the mall and swing around to find the door.  I hear it is busy enough that reservations are a smart move, but I merely just walked in to a slow evening and snagged a table. A blend of mall restaurant vibe with a countryside farmhouse chic decor, clearly designed to evoke a feeling of Jamie Oliver wholesomeness. Our server was overly full of extroverted energy and passion for making you feel at home.  The food, not so passionate though. I am not quite wowed by the small okay-okay menu selection, a mix of mostly Italian and Italian-inspired dishes meant to evoke yes, that wholesomeness of a proper Italian traditional family dinner or something like that. It's a small quirk compared to the quality of the food. Salty was what stood out to my sister, but it was the weak sauciness of their meals that made me sad. For my main I had a pork sausage served on a skewer. It was alright, kinda dry and overgrilled in some bits but not something I'd recommend. Nothing funky about their 'Funky Fries;' dressed in rosemary is something I can do at home. They do have a kids menu though.  Pricey and not any more different an experience than your average Moxies or other such chain mall restaurant. Did I mention already how awesomely enthusiastic our server was though? Or the personalized cloth napkins that looks like an underwear band? Frankly there are a lot that don't make sense to me about what I expected versus what was reality about Jamie's; worth checking out just for the sake of checking out."}
{"text":"I can see why it this place does not  have a 4 star rating.  It's just okay food. I am not even setting my expectations high.  I've been here 3 times and as someone who eats a lot of salt - everytime I eat here I always think to myself \"this is way too salty\".   We did not like the fresh crab pasta, it had a certain flavour too it that overpowered the entire dish and of course wayyy too salty   My meatball pappardelle was better but would have been a more stand out dish with less salt.   I don't think I'll be back tbh. Sorry guys.   Service - top notch  Atmosphere & decor - 5/5 Food - fell short."}
{"text":"Good service. Pasta was mediocre and so was the beef carpaccio and salad. Nothing great to come back to."}
{"text":"Okay food but terrible service. I want to start by saying the food was actually decent, and even though it did not blow my mind it was decent (except over salted fries). The butter chicken salad  was large (love it) and tasted good.  The service on the other hand was bad. The waiter definitely had some issues as she was giving us attitude. The service was slow... actually very slow) it took them almost an hour to bring out food and thank god we weren't too hungry or in a rush.  I had pretty high expectations for this place because it's Jamie Oliver's baby but it just wasn't up to standards."}
{"text":"I think some people's expectations are a little too high just because of the name Jamie Oliver. Yeah he's a celebrity chef but if you watched the Naked Chef, it's obvious his target demographic isn't the hardcore foodies, it's causal dining for everyday people. You have to compare this to other mid-level establishments like Moxie's, Milestones, O&B and Joey's. I thought overall, it's on par with these chains, although I personally prefer the Joey's next door over Jamie's.  The one thing no one can really deny is that the decor of the place is pretty nice. It has a bit of that Crate and Barrel feel, a little rustic mixed with modern. Usually you never notice these sorts of things at chain restaurants but it stood out to me, and so there was a good first impression.   Food-wise, I personally prefer subtle flavours so I thought the food was alright. I ordered a crab meat pasta and I could tell it was bland, the crab pieces were small, but it was alright after I added some pepper. The meat board looked pretty impressive, and I would recommend that, although it is odd to me that they wouldn't give you a few pieces of bread with it, you actually have to pay for it. Regardless, they actually ran out of bread that night anyway so maybe their bread is really good.  Unfortunately for me though, what really killed the rating was my server. I know he was probably the exception as the lady at the restaurant front was A LOT better but there were a number of things that bothered me. We waited for about 15 minutes and the server never came to take our order. In fact he never even came to greet us until I flagged down the lady at the front counter who later apologized on his behalf. What I found particularly irritating was that while he was taking down our order, he would upsell as if he was selling a car. When my friend ordered wine, he just asked if he wanted the 8oz, without mentioning the other sizes (I assume it was probably the larger glass). When my other friend ordered his turkey, the server asked if he wanted fries on the side or a salad, and failed to mention that he would be charged extra for those. I had to mention to my friend that it would cost $5 extra, cause I knew he wouldn't want to pay for an extra side. That felt like a really sleazy move from the server to make a bigger tip - it's misleading and dishonest. On top of that, he even forgot to put in our appetizers before our entree so we waited a little longer then all of a sudden everything came out at the same time. If it wasn't for the great service from the front staff, I definitely would have left a smaller tip.  Even though I had an awful experience with the service, I would still return in the future knowing that the other servers are likely much more competent. Perhaps he just had an off night considering we came later in the evening after the mall closed; I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. As someone who frequents Yorkdale, I appreciate the variety of dining options, and I think Jamie's is a good addition to that."}
{"text":"I am giving this one star because the server was nice. Went here for dinner as a group of 3 last night and was extremely disappointed. Upon arrival we were told the wait would be about an hour, we had no reservation so we waited. When we were finally seated, there was no server for at least 15 minutes. Do not sit upstairs if possible, yes it's much quieter but they only have one server for about 10 smaller tables. The server is always MIA so ordering or making any request is a bit difficult. The food was also mediocre at most. We had the funghi pizza, garlic bread with add ons, funghi pasta, sausage pasta and their supposedly famous prawn pasta. Nothing special about any of them, I went to the bathroom right after the prawn pasta arrived and it had coagulated into one solid mass. Not the most appetizing. Either way, if you go, go knowing that there isn't a single thing on the menu that stands out and the quality is just okay. I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying something from Jamie Oliver and it was mediocre (at best). My family and I started out with some appetizers (the fried calamari and fried mushrooms) and they were the highlight of my meal. I am very hesitant with fish, but to my surprise, the calamari was good and enjoyable. However, for my entrée, I ordered the porcini fettuccine and I was throughly disappointed. Fettuccine is one of my favourite pastas no matter what sauce it comes with, but this was embarrassing. I don't know what Italians Jamie Oliver is speaking with, but why would you serve a pasta with a spoonful of breadcrumbs? Besides the point. The pasta was bland and was definitely not worth the $17 you have to spend for the regular size. Aside from the food, the bathrooms are upstairs, which is extremely inconvenient for patrons with a physical disability or anything that limits their mobility. However, the bathrooms are extremely nice and clean. All and all, I wasn't completely satisfied with my first Jamie Oliver experience"}
{"text":"Pros: Great decor, rustic ambiance, scrumptious butternut squash gnocchi.   Cons: curt service by waitress, we felt like we were being rushed and it was not busy at all. We were asked if we'd like anything else, numerous times... hinting us to ask for our bill and to leave. We each ordered a main entree, we shouldn't have been rushed! Especially because there was AMPLE seating available. This was a disappointment! Prob won't return due to unwelcome service!"}
{"text":"I read some other reviews and I'm not the only one that thinks management and service is an issue here. For me, the server was great. I liked her a lot. The manager and host however, were another story. Below is my email to the \"real\" manager of the location. This manager called me 3 full days after, telling me SC told her a different story and she was going to assume the truth is somewhere in between. No, I was pretty objective in my email. Anyway, she asked what they can do for me to come back. I told her my wife doesn't like al dente, she told me that's the only way most of their pastas can be prepared. I told her other restaurants offer me gift certificates, she told me she \"doesn't believe in buying customers back\". By the time of this review, I've been around Yorkdale a couple times and haven't thought to visit.   \"My wife and I arrived at 11:30am, after calling ahead around 11:15am to make a reservation. The two of us were seated at a small table for two, up against a small partition wall. At this point it would help if I add some context; my wife is pregnant in her second trimester, and is uncomfortable most of the time. I had to be seated for a minute before I could observe that this partition wall was cramming her arm. Being 11:30, there weren't many people, and there was a table for four right next to us that was open. We decided to move and didn't bother telling anyone. For the next 45 minutes or so, our server happily answered our many questions on the menu and our pasta dishes were delicious. Our only feedback there is that not everyone likes al dente (I like it more than my wife does).   So by about 12:20 or so, someone who I thought was a hostess, identified herself as the manager (later I found her name was S**** C****?) asked if a hostess seated us at this table for four. We explained that is wasn't the hostess' fault and it was our own decision to just move. She then told us \"she's gonna need the table\". We were apologetic at first and told her we were finishing up and was on a time schedule anyway. I was in a bit of disarray that we were being talked to in this manner at an establishment with Jamie Oliver's brand. So I had to confirm Shannon's urgency. \"Now?!\" I asked? Her response was \"Yes, I'm gonna need these tables. I'll bring you your bill.\" We got the bill, and my wife couldn't eat any faster than she already was. At that point, I looked around. The attached image shows what I saw in terms of seating availability for a party of four. Our server came by to ask what happened. She might have been puzzled that we were provided with the bill in the middle of the meal. We explained what happened, and she didn't know either what the urgency was about. She told us that Shannon was not the manager, and assured us that we could take our time. I asked for your business card knowing I'd just reach out to you anyway. So we finished the meal, and kept to our time schedule and was on our way.   Before we consider returning to your restaurant, we need to feel that our business was appreciated and that this treatment was an anomaly. Your response on how you'll be rectifying this situation would be greatly appreciated.\""}
{"text":"The food took way too long, the bread was burnt and pasta was flavourless. I would not recommend going here at all. It is sad it has Jamie's name attached to it."}
{"text":"Came here 2nd day it opened for a late dinner. Love the atmosphere and decor! Music on a tad loud side.  The menu is the same for lunch or dinner, they do not offer a brunch menu.  Love that all their pastas have half-size orders. The rabbit casarecce and crabmeat linguini was packed with flavor for a very decent sized half order. If you order some appetizers, maybe a salad then half-size is the way to go! Also enjoyed their polenta chips, cubed instead of cut into French fries was interesting. Maybe a bit too much batter but overall, loved the fresh parmasan and herb on top. Another good try is the deep fried king oyster mushroom. If you love garlic, the mayo will be your new favorite dip!"}
{"text":"I was sooo excited when Jamie's opened up at Yorkdale.  I really liked the Jamie's restaurants in the UK - now they finally have it in Toronto! Unfortunately, it was nothing like my experience back in England..  Service was excellent but the food quality wasn't good. I give this place 2.5 stars.  CRAB & AVOCADO BRUSCHETTA (3/5) (Fresh crab, crunchy fennel, smashed avocado, yogurt & chili) This was a good start to our meal. I liked this because they have avocado in it! Note that the portion is very small. There's only one bruschetta.  MEATBALL PAPPARDELLE (2/5) (Pork & fennel meatballs in tomato sauce with pangrattato & Parmigiano Reggiano) We didn't like this at all. The meatballs are supposed to be pork but for some reason, it tasted and smelt like lamb..? I'm okay with lamb but the smell was off from what we expected. The pasta wasn't hot enough, and it lacks flavour. We were pretty disappointed in the quality of the pasta!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a coworker here and we both chose the 2-course 'super' lunch. For appetizers, I had the Italian nachos and my friend had the bruschetta. Both were very good. Our mains were the spaghetti carbonara for her and I had the mushroom pasta. I wasn't overly impressed with the pasta, but it wasn't bad.   Service was ok, but I had to ask for a glass of water three times. The third time, the server had kind of an attitude and said, \"Yes, I know. It's coming.\" I could've given her attitude back, but instead, I tipped her less than I'd planned. I can't stand attitude when someone clearly messes up. I got my appetizer before my damn glass of water!   I may still go back, though. Decent place for lunch."}
{"text":"My group of 3 ordered different dishes and they all came out on the salty side. The waitress was hard to find and we had trouble getting her attention to proceed with the dining process. No free Wi-Fi was provided. Other than that, things were unremarkable and as expected."}
{"text":"This is a review for a Winterlicious 2018 lunch on February 5th 2018.  I came here with my mom for their lunch menu -- it was the first time we both came here.  I had the following:  DAILY SOUP (LEEK/FENNEL) Served with house made focaccia  LINGUINE POMODORO (VEGETARIAN) Sweet tomato sauce with garlic, basil, mascarpone, fior di latte, pangrattato & Parmigiano Reggiano  GELATO TRIO served with crumbled biscotti and seasonal fruit compote  My mom picked the following:  PORCINI ARANCINI (VEGETARIAN) Fried balls of mushroom risotto with mozzarella & fiery tomato sauce  SILKY SPAGHETTI CARBONARA Sweet tender leeks with golden smoky pancetta, cracked black pepper & Parmigiano Reggiano  ORANGE BLOSSOM POLENTA CAKE Served with whipped crème fraîche, fresh orange & pomegranate  Sad to say the mains were so-so -- pasta was al dente but the sauces for the dishes were kind of lacking, but the appetizers and desserts were great.  The wait staff was a combination of a waitress and a new employee who was shadowing her for that day (first day of work) -- both were very attentive and sent out our courses when they noticed we were done with one and ready for the other.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is pretty cozy -- the interior is definitely really interesting with the cheese boards on the wall and the whole deli section inside near the kitchen.  Overall, the food was satisfactory -- nothing too amazing, but a safe choice if I ever need to pick a place near Yorkdale for a meal."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch on Boxing Day. Service was attentive and the food tasted great with good portion made three of us very full."}
{"text":"Love the decor, atmosphere, food and service here. I always come here before or after shopping at Yorkdale. The pizza and pastas are amazing and the desserts are on point. My favourite so far are the meatballs or salad to start, and a pizza or pasta for the main. For dessert, I strongly recommend the brownie! So soft, warm and moist. It was everything I had wanted in my dessert."}
{"text":"I can here on second day after the opening. All i can say it's amazing. Great atmosphere, great service, great food. Servers , waitresses are so kind and nice. They are really proud of their job, help us to pick the food and explain Jamie  food ideal. I suggest to try Oliver house wine selection. They are fruity with fine after taste. Food portion is about right. All you need just some pinch of salt and pepper will make it more perfect. I got the Fish in a bag and beside baking, chef also grill it before to make sure the fish has some smoke. Fantastic experience! I will comeback for more ;)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Just another below average mall chain restaurant headlined by a celebrity chef charging outrageous prices for dishes that my Italian neighbour could make better. We only came here as a backup bc joey's yorkdale could not accommodate a group larger than 10. Beware - they also take your credit card for reservations and state that they will charge you $20 per person for no shows... Who the heck does that?!   I ended up ordering a bunch of sharables w my friends.  Crispy squid and mushrooms fritti aka battered mushroom spears. They were average... Not very many pieces. We were going to order the tomatoe bruschetta until the server told us it was only 1 piece of bread and not very sharable ($10 for 1 slice of bread - wtf?!). So we resorted to the garlic bread w sundried tomatoe and olive tapenade.. It was ok. Then we ordered the fungi, Margherita, and Parma pizza. They were the size of a small pizza.. Cut into 4. Honestly, you're better off going to Pizzaville and ordering their Margherita pizza and paying 4 bucks compared to this place. Or if you want great pizza.. Go to libretto downtown.   Overall, this place doesn't deserve to be a part of yorkdale. The food is not flavourful, expensive, small portions. It looks nice, wooden decor, legs of Proscuitto hanging from the ceiling of the bar. Looks rustic, but everything else is a disappointment. Could not pay me to ever come back and eat here and would not recommend to anyone... Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I brought a friend here lunch yesterday. We decided to sit outside since it was a sunny day and that they had many beach umbrellas along the patio. I found it interesting that they grew thyme  in the patio area to keep insects away.   We ordered the garlic bread as the appetizer, meatball pappardelle and their chef's special, seafood risotto. The garlic bread was great! It looked like a naan and it was very chewy and fresh. However, their meatball pappardelle had these meatballs that tasted really weird. We both didn't like it. The seafood risotto was not bad. I liked how they had a nice piece of fish (sea bass?), mussels and other seafood items in that dish.   Overall it was okay. Our highlight was the garlic bread which was different and tasted good."}
{"text":"Tried this place out two times. During my first visit, the food was good but the service wasn't. Second time was a similar experience."}
{"text":"The decor here is best described as sports bar with the TVs removed and replaced by hanging hams. Brown and black are the main design elements. I ordered the \"famous\" prawn linguine as an appetizer. Another diner was hesitant because it was maybe too spicy. The waiter said it could not be served any other way, then returned to say the chef would make a special sauce, so she ordered it as a main. When it arrived I got a small appetizer portion that was totally bland and my companion got a large portion that was way too spicy for her. Due to the different sizes, the plates could not be simply switched. When the waitress put my pasta in front of me, she quickly grabbed it away again. A small pause before I heard her say behind me, \"Oh, I am just too confused now.\" And having given up, just plonked the same plate back down in front of me and walked away. I also ordered a pizza as a main, but it came at the exact same time as the appetizer. Worse, it was already cool and cold by the time I got to eating it. Hardly mattered, one of the worst pizza crusts I have tasted. It was hard and dry. Another diner ordered two different pastas and they were put in front of her at the same time. She liked the bolognese, but did not eat the crab, saying it tasted like shredded, canned crab. The lemon cheesecake is heavily touted, but at opening time on a busy Sunday afternoon, they were \"all out\".  I heard that later in the afternoon the restaurant closed its doors. I wonder why. (Edit: found out later that the restaurant filled with smoke).   Unless they make some changes fast, they might as well rename the place Oliver Garden."}
{"text":"3.5  I was very skeptical to try this place and had low expectations, but it turned out decent. We sat at the bar/lounge to avoid an hour wait.   Starter: Arancini - pretty good, kind of tastes like meatballs, only serving of 3 though  Main: Flatiron Steak & Frites - default cooked to Medium. A very thin steak topped with arugula & cherry tomato salad. To my surprise, it was quite tasty! Very flavourful and I love the salad on top. The thick cut fries were delicious as well.   There was also Winterlicious going on at the time, and for $33 I think it was good value, compared to a regular main already costing $25+. Beef Carpaccio, Prawn Linguine (hand-made pasta, the tomato sauce was a tad too spicy, but still ok), Brownie & Vanilla Gelato. Large portions and tasted good.   Service: The server didn't smile once and looked like he didn't want to be there at all. When we asked for fresh ground pepper, he pointed out that it's on the table, and they also don't offer condiments for the fries, so I had to ask myself -- No big deal but don't expect extra fancy service here.  Overall, a safe spot to check out after shopping at Yorkdale as an alternative to Joey."}
{"text":"Ok so the service at this place is great top notch.  if i was to review based on that a full 4 star easily.  Why we didn't like it and rated at 2: Ordered there special drink of the day, it was not that great.  BUT being that said, that is not the reason of the low review.  Its not there fault we didn't like the drink (even though the ingredients sounded amazing)  I ordered the chicken catchatorie....way to salty, and for the price not filling.  A salty tomato chicken on some toast....not impressed.  And defn not filling.  My friend had pasta, and it was sorta bland.  The pasta didn't even taste fresh...if i wouldn't know better i would say it was store bought (but assuming its a Jaime restaurant i would assume they make there pasta in-house)  The only things that was on point was the Sangria, and my beer lol.  For the price of this place, the portions was not filling, and not that tasty.  From my salty chicken to my friends bland pasta....i would have enjoyed my self at alice fazooli's or the food court. a lot more."}
{"text":"As many have said, much better than any mall restaurant has a right to be - but not without its flaws.   We tried: the arancini; the raviolo friti; the charcuterie plate; the pork chop; the pizza fioerentina; sage and braised prosciutto pasta; the burger.   The food was essentially good, but not great.   The pizza was excellent, with a great crust and the toppings of anchovies, lemon ricotta, rapini and eggs were a nice combination. Dip the crust in the egg yolks! Inexplicably, though, the pizza came to the table uncut and proved almost impossible to cut with the knife provided.  The pork chop was tender and flavourful, but the accompaniments were a little lifeless.  The burger was bland and dry.   The arancini were delicious, but the ravioloi fritti were a little bland. The cured meat plate isn't worth it at all. It's not bad ad $11, but you can get far better elsewhere.  From 3-5pm, you can get a pint of Peronni or a glass of house wine for $5 which is a great deal and a great way to burn away an afternoon if you're taking transit rather than driving!    Three stars because of inconsistent quality between differing menu items, but worth a visit, especially after a day of trudging through a mall."}
{"text":"I've been twice here, once with my boyfriend and once with my parents for my dads 50th. My mom loves Jamie Oliver and is a big fan. She got the salmon and she said it was really good, and that she HATES beets but according to her it was just really fresh. I'm not a fan of there pasta, I've been to other Italian restaurants and I don't know how I feel about it. Though try there margarita pizza and there cheesecake !"}
{"text":"Hubby wanted to check this place out. It's totally underwhelming and they nickel and dime you to death. It doesn't feel like a master chef's restaurant, but more like a commercial, overrated chain. I knew we were in trouble when the wine was a standard 5 oz pour instead of 6, and it was $13 for sangria. We ordered the Italian nachos, which were tasty and unique. Frustratingly, they took it away, along with our marinara sauce, and then when we wanted marinara to go with the polenta chips, they informed us it would be $2. Paid it, as they were inedible on their own. Also, there are no free refills on pop, even though it comes from a fountain. Paid $20 for a pizza that was middle of the road, and wished we'd gone to Scaddabush instead.  The server also had obvious aspirations toward becoming a drill sergeant."}
{"text":"\"Great decor, atmosphere and menu selection and I expect no less from Jamie Oliver\" 4.5/5.0  This was my first time here. Was going to take a business lunch at Joey but walked by this and couldn't turn down the opportunity to eat at one of The UK's favourite franchises.   Atmosphere:  Walking in, you're immediately impressed by the decor and the design. A combination of modern, classic and contemporary finishes with lots of rustic elements like the tables, frames, and chairs. Great vibe from the bar and dining room on the upper level  Food & Menu:  This location features a lot of Italian classics as well as a long list of creative dishes. Lots of items to choose from, but only one page on the menu so both very easy to navigate and lots of choice. I ordered the steak frites, coworkers had the Pizza and Canneloni. All 3 looks delicious though I only had the steak frites. We all shared the meat/cheese plate (essentially a charcouterie) and it was delicious selection of meats and cheeses that paired well with the olives, capers, and other items. A must order app if you're feeling like treating your mouth to a multitude of different flavours. It's served on a wood plank, raised on two rustic tomato sauce cans which the server claims are actually used in the recipes.  Steak was good, frities were hand made and seasoned, and not too salty either. Very good choice and also gluten-free friendly.  Service:  We were served by a nice girl named Jessica, who was amazing from start to finish. Great with the menu description as well as instructing us on the history of the restaurant chain (open about 2 months prior to our visit) and very helpful on the meat/cheese plate. Also informed us that Jamie Oliver himself approves and designs dishes on the menu and this location has a lot of unique items you won't find at other locations in the UK.   Very happy. It's a 4.5/5.0 for me. I'll round that up in stars. Looking forward to coming back. Good date night spot."}
{"text":"Jamie's Italian is inspired by Jamie Oliver. Right off the bat I had high expectations for the quality of Italian food. It was a weekday evening. A friend and I went in and were greeted and seated quickly. I looked around the restaurant, and was immediately impressed with the interior design. I walked to the washroom and absolutely wanted to change our seating to dine in the bar as the ambiance and decor was beautiful. The high ceilings and large area really caught my eye.  As my friend and I were seated we opened the menu and were impressed with the menu item selections that were available. I ended up ordering the Spaghetti Carbonara which consisted of sweet tender leeks with golden smokey pancetta, cracked black pepper and parmigiano reggiano. The pasta was cooked perfectly. It was cooked just past the point of Al Dente. The flavor was on point with its creamy consistency. I was indulging and indulging until I found myself thinking, something was wrong. I was already finished! It could have been that I was hungry, but I felt that the dish could have been a bit bigger in portion size. I ended up trying my friend's Meatball Pappardelle which consisted of pork and fennel meatballs in a fiery tomato sauce with pangrattato and Parmigiano Reggiano. I enjoyed that dish as well but if I had to choose a better dish of the two, I would definitely choose the Spaghetti Carbonara. Jamie's Italian has won me over and I would come back to try different menu items. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"We  to Jamie's with some friends and I would give it a solid 4 stars. The speciality drinks were very well done. It was very busy on a Saturday night. They don't take reservations so it was a little bit of a wait. For apps we had the calamari which were excellent. We also had the ravioli not my favorite. Everyone enjoyed there main meal but the best for me was the polenta fries. We also had a dessert. The brownie with vanilla ice cream and popcorn was very well done. Jamie's Iooks like the are going to expand to a change in Canada. If they keep it up it looks like it will be one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my family, was excited to try the famous Jamie Oliver's restaurant chain. Let me just start by giving the gist of things: (I think a lot of reviewers shared this sentiment,) the food was a little underwhelming given the celebrity chef association but the decor was hip and the service was great. Details to follow.   We had a reservation for 8:15 for 5, the lounge area had space but the dining area seemed full and lively. Our waitress Jessica was enthusiastic and friendly.  Apps: Ravioli Fritti  - Small ravioli which were baked I think, served with a tomato-based sauce. The ravioli themselves weren't that flavourful, and only marginally improved with the sauce. Crispy Squid  - Fried squid pieces served with a mayo-based dip. This was much tastier than the ravioli, with a nice tangy dip. (I thought the raviolis tasted better with this dip too.) A tad small portion-wise.  Pizza: Daily Special  - Jessica introduced a Daily Pasta (which was already sold out) and Pizza, so we thought we'd try the recommendation. It was a thin crust pizza with a garlic spread topped with braised pork, small brussel sprouts, balsamic onions and cheese. I thought this was quite nice, flavours balanced well.  Pastas: Jamie's Sausage Pappardelle  - Long almost thinner lasagna-like noodles in a tomato-based sauce that my mom found overpowered by the fennel seeds.The pasta itself was nice and chewy but the sauce was a bit bland.The crumbled sausage was forgettable. Prawn Linguine:  - I didn't get to try this one but my parents seemed to enjoy it the most. Porcini Fettucine  - Fettucine in a mushroom cream sauce. Sounds simple but this one was actually my favourite of the entrees. Topped with some toasted breadcrumbs, the mushrooms still came through and was quite tasty.  Mains: Pork Chop  - A grilled bone-in pork chop. My mom just likes pork chops. Seemed well prepared, but not what I wanted to try here.  No desserts for us. Plus one Peroni, tips and tax the bill came to ~$160  Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Overall: 3.5/5 It was a fun place to try out, and the service was excellent. Might try again if I was at the mall or with different people."}
{"text":"High expectations, mediocre results.   The restaurant and the ambience were nice. The waiter was nice as well but super *not* attentive. We ordered sparkling water and a Pepsi. The tap water arrived in a timely matter. The sparkling water, maybe 5 minutes after he had an, 'Oh!' moment. The Pepsi hadn't arrived and we were about 25 minutes into having been seated. It was only after we flagged him down (what a task that was) did we get the drink and he did apologize.   The food was meh. We ordered the burger and two pastas (see pictures). The dessert however, is the highlight of the meal. The brownie and gelato were amazing.   Overall, 3.5 out of 5.   3.5 for the ambience and dessert. That's all."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a spot for a bigger group dinner, this is a good option. Large space (they can put bigger groups on the 2nd floor, overlooking the main dining area), with a very laid-back, homestyle, casual, relaxing vibe. As Jamie Oliver-esque as it gets given its location, but still together with a hint of an I'm-still-a-restaurant-in-a-suburban-mall feel. Decent food (although a bit pricey for what you get), but above-average space and service.  First, location. It's located right at Yorkdale Mall, facing the 401, right by the Milestones, Forever 21, and Indigo Bookstore.   Second, the service. Very friendly and personable. The manager even came out to greet us personally when one of our party's pizzas arrived late, letting them know that he requested the cook to re-do the pizza because he wasn't happy with how it looked. Attentive, polite, and very sweet service - no complaints here.  Third, the food. As others have said before - it's good enough, but don't expect an eyebrow raising food experience. It's tasty enough, ingredients are pretty fresh, but it isn't very exciting and blends into your past run of the mill Moxie's/Joey's/Earl's type meal experiences. We ordered the Polenta Fries, the Spicy Meatball Pizza, and the Vegetable Bruschetta. Not bad, not excellent. Just decent. Out of everything, we enjoyed the Polenta Fries best - if you like deep fried crunchy goodness, you might want to check this out.  Overall, a pretty decent experience, and Jamie Italian Yorkdale worked out to be a great location for our party of 8 people. If you need a central spot in Toronto for a bigger group meal, just off the 401, and where the food isn't half bad, this is certainly an option to explore, and one we would come back to."}
{"text":"I can here for lunch one day! Love the set up of the resto.I got the squid ink pasta and a lovely drink the bartender picked out for me. The service was great however the pasta was just ok. If I come back I would try one of there creamier pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Jamie Oliver's cooking, so I was understandably quite excited to give Jamie's Italian a try. We showed up before 11:30 on a Saturday and the place was already filling up, but we were shown to a comfortable booth right by the kitchen almost immediately.  I knew what I was going to order before I had even arrived, but we also wanted to try an appetizer. We noticed four different kinds of bruschetta on the menu, so we figured that would be the best bet. We ordered the Tomato & Ricotta Bruschetta, which is advertised as coming with \"artisanal ricotta, basil & tomatoes on garlicky-rubbed ciabatta.\"  When it arrived about ten minutes later, we were shocked at how small it was. Once we cut it in half, we both received about two (small) bites. Aside from that, the dish simply wasn't that great. The ricotta was fine, but I didn't taste any basil or garlic and the tomatoes were just cherry tomatoes that had been cut in half. An extremely lazy effort that's disastrously overpriced at $9.95.  For the main, I ordered Tagliatelle Bolognese, described as \"Gennaro's original pork & beef Bolognese recipe, slow cooked & served with pangrattato & Parmigiano Reggiano.\" While we were waiting, I had my eye on the kitchen and I noticed two bowls of pasta sitting there for quite some time and I was silently praying to myself, \"please don't be our food, please don't be our food, please don't be our food...\"  It was our food.  It was served almost 10 minutes after it had been prepared and the dish suffered because of it. The Bolognese sauce itself was pretty tasty, though it was way, way too salty. But the pasta, because the dish had been sitting out so long, had essentially all clumped together and become one big piece. This was especially evident towards the bottom of the bowl, where the pasta had become one oversized chunk of mush. Oh, and the dish wasn't even remotely hot, of course.  I'm not sure I understand how it's considered acceptable to serve food that's been sitting out like that. Both dishes should have been scrapped and made over again. A seriously disappointing experience."}
{"text":"As much as I love watching Jamie on TV, his restaurant is quite the disappointment. I did indeed drive all the way to Yorkdale for this restaurant, on a weekend at one of the most terrifying battlegrounds for Christmas shopping. Perhaps that set me up for high expectations but considering that this restaurant was delayed for several months, would one not expect perfected high end casual dining as advertised by their site? Instead, the restaurant feels like it is in the soft opening stages with experimental cooking on customers who pay close to $20 for heavily salted crab spaghetti (the cooks didn't know how to manage the capers). I'm not mad, mind you. Merely disappointed that one of my favourite celebrity chefs could open a restaurant in his name to deliver such terrible food. I also tried the sausage pappardelle and that one was even more salty than the crab spaghetti. I did like the taste overall, minus the heavy salt.  In terms of the service, I'm not quite sure how to rate it. There was a wait to be seated at the opening time of 11:30am even though more than half the tables were not filled. The wait was for the servers to deliver a \"Jamie's experience\". I don't really understand - is the restaurant not meant to be filled? The staff seemed quite relaxed and I'm not sure I understand what the experience I was supposed to have. The staff seemed friendly once we were seated and remade the pasta after we complained about it being salty. However, I was told they had to remake it several times because they couldn't get it right (red flag here). In the end, one was still a bit salty but it was a long wait for the food and I was tired. I really hope this restaurant succeeds as I love Jamie's shows but my tastebuds don't agree."}
{"text":"The place serves up somewhat rustic, homestyle Italian fare. It's quite a bit of a difference from your Americanized Italian joints/chains, while also not quite what you'd expect at the fancier Italian restaurants in downtown Toronto. The decor and ambience are both reflective of this. It feels very much like what Jamie Oliver's current public persona is.  As such, the food is rather simple, presented in a non-pretentious manner, and focuses more on the natural flavours of the ingredients. Don't expect any heavy sauces or seasoning here. I tried the gnocchi, which was cooked very nicely but rather light on the seasoning/flavour. One of my companions tried the steak and fries, which was unique, with the steak being very thinly cut, not like your standard steak. She thought it was quite unique and delicious. My other companion opted for the fish of the day, which was decent, but nothing special. We also tried the superfood salad which was quite unique and tasty.  Deserving of commendation is the service. Our waitress was very pleasant and when ordering, took the initiative of explaining some points that we otherwise wouldn't have known (e.g., that an order of bruschetta is just one piece, and that the steak is a thin steak). Terrific heads-up play to otherwise prevent any potential customer disappointment or confusion.  Prices are definitely on the higher end and much of it is that you are simply paying for the Jamie Oliver name. This is unfortunate, because considering the overall quality of the food from a taste/flavour perspective, the value just doesn't quite cut it for me. I understand that Jamie has had more of a focus on healthy eating and nutrition, and that may be reflected in the food here, but ultimately I just found it lacking in satisfaction. All in all, I'd give this place a passable rating, but it's not an establishment that I'd be rushing to revisit again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night and was pleased with the experience. With any newly opened restaurant I generally anticipate there may be kinks to be ironed out. Jamie's ran smooth and efficiently from start to finish.  The staff who welcomed us at the entrance were very friendly and our server was also pleasant and quick with our orders and service.   My order started with the ravioli fritti - not bad but didn't have an exceptional amount of flavour. Next time I would try a different appetizer.  For the main I had the tagliatelle bolognese which was terrific. Good portion size, nice flavour, would definitely order this again.  My first experience with Jamie's Italian came in Cardiff, UK a few years ago and I'm thrilled to have them here in Toronto as well. Look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"For the money I'd say it's ... okay. Service was nice but the pastas we had seemed kind of dull. Considering the money involved I'm going to have to suggest one simply visit the food court."}
{"text":"Disappointment? Yes! The menu is kinda confusing.  Cured meat is priced per person which I don't quite understand.  Usually I go to other restaurant, I would order a plank of cured meat at a fix price and we would share.  Not priced per person.  I didn't order this because it was pretty expensive if it was per person.  Instead we got the ARANCINI MARGHERITA.  It came in 3 pieces with tomato sauce.  I was hoping they came out in 4 total so that we can share but instead one was cut in half to make it like 4.....Seriously....The dish was quite blend and lack seasoning even with the tomato sauce.  For the main, we had OUR FAMOUS PRAWN LINGUINE and JAMIE'S SAUSAGE PAPPARDELLE.  The offer in small or large portion.  Let me first tell you about the portion.  Small is about the size of a kids meal and large is probably regular small size.  At a price like this it wasn't worth it at all.  The prawn in the llinguine is rather a small size.  At this price point, I would expect larger prawn and there weren't many to begin with.  The dish was blend and lack seasoning.  The pappardelle pasta was cooked nicely but again the sauce lack any seasoning and tasted rather blend.  I think I would make the same better and a lot cheaper price.  Overall the price point vs the portion size was a missed for me.  I know the name Jamie comes with a premium but at least give me something that would worth the price.  The worst part was the dish lack seasoning.  I understand his concept of serving homie meal but this was just bad."}
{"text":"I'm slightly disappointed with this restaurant. Jamie needs to immediately oversee the kitchen staff. My pasta was under aldente which is a shame cause the taste was immaculate, the burger was mediocre I could have spent less at burger priest, the calamari was cold when it arrived to me, I ordered a rose sangria because it was half price (thank God because it was not worth $12.95...the one at Scaddabush is way better), the polenta chips however were BOMB. Like. Wow.  I would have gave them 2 stars but the FOH staff was amazing so I'll be generous. I had such high hopes for this place. Kitchen staff please step up."}
{"text":"Our recent feast here was excellent -- great food, wine, and especially amazing service, which made a huge difference. Our waitress was confident in her recommendations and just all-around cheery on a night that was clearly insanely busy. We had planned to do the Winterlicious menu, but went rogue and started ordering from their regular menu as well. Absolutely no disappointments.   We ordered one of their massive share platters -- the various meats, cheeses, and other offerings on the board were great but the star of the show was the fresh buffala mozzarella with some sort of spicy garnish on top. Was a nice kickoff to the meal, which included beef carpaccio, arancini, and prawn linguine from the Winterlicious menu, and a pizza with some heat to it from the regular menu. Ingredients seemed fresh, and the flavours were bold.   Finally for dessert, our party tried the brownie, which was so decadent I couldn't finish it after our huge meal, even though I really wanted to. On the other end of the dessert spectrum was the refreshing orange polenta cake -- perfectly balanced in its sweetness and lightness.  All in all, we left sated and satisfied. Can't wait to swing by this place again sometime."}
{"text":"I guess first impressions are done and over with, and Jamie's Italian has settled into their routine. The second time around, everything seems a little less...shiny. The food was about the same, but the service has certainly suffered. It took a long time to get water, much less anything else. Our server had a knack for disappearing for long periods of time. Our food arrived before our drinks, and when it came time to pay, she was nowhere to be found.   This time, food wise, got the prosciutto & pear salad which, to be honest, should be called prosciutto and arugula salad as there was hardly any pear in the salad at all. And though I was told it was large, it wasn't entirely filling as an entree... I would have maybe ordered an app had I known. It's a good size to share for 2, however, and actually really good. Just a LITTLE more pear would be an improvement.  Also had the brownie dessert - good, but nothing to write home about. Perhaps will try the tiramisu next time."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a day of shopping! The restaurant decor and atmosphere gives off a relaxed feeling. We sat at the bar area since the dining area was full. The bar stools would be comfortable if you were having a drink or two to relax but after a long day of shopping I would prefer a seat with back support. The waitress was friendly and took our orders quickly. We ordered a salad to start and our mains were a pasta and pizza. The salad was simple and delicious. We enjoyed the pizza a lot. The texture of the dough was amazing. Overall taste and texture of the pizza was great but the dough was what made the pizza amazing. The famous shrimp pasta turned out to be average.Tasted like any pasta you can order at an Italian restaurant so we didn't feel it was as famous as the name implied. Overall, the food was still enjoyable. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is \"Jamie's\" Italian so it may not be everyone else's idea of \"Italian\".  There are many reviews that would be similar to what I would write. Yes, the expectations are high and the food quality doesn't quite deliver. The service is just OK and if you get stuck at a table at the Antipasti bar you'll have a 20 pound prosciutto about 10 inches from your head.  If you want a good experience at Jamie's Italian, this would be my advice:  1. Call ahead and make a reservation at a table near the open kitchen 2. If you are a single and want to sit at the bar, sit at the front of the bar 3. If you have to sit in the \"lounge\" area ask for a bench seat. 4. Order the smaller portion of pasta 5. Forget the Fresh Crab Bruschetta 6. If you don't like \"spicy\" foods read the description closely....a lot of dishes have \"chillis\".  Our experience........  1. Hostess was nice but only seating available was at the bar or a \"yeah there's a table for two left that no one esle wants to sit at\". 2. The chairs at the bar are great if you're solo but hard to manoeuvre if you're with someone. 3. The Arancini are just ok. They spilt a couple of them in half which turns them cold in about 10 seconds. The Fresh Crab bruschetta is underwhelming but spicy 4. It took a waiter 15 minutes to approach us after we sat down 5. The Rigatoni were al \"molar\" dente.....I think they would have been softer before cooking  The ambiance is nice if you're in the main part of the restaurant and there are some private rooms upstairs. It's a bit loud but has a nice vibe. It tries to be a \"modern\" restaurant with a bit of everything (I think too much) like \"nibbles\", a \"diner feel menu\", Italian salumi slicers, trays of peppers, a deli, a pizzeria and a number of other things. Overall just OK, but for the love of bar seats, please take down those prosciuttos!"}
{"text":"2 and a half star.  My husband and I went to Jamie's Italian on a weekday during the holidays for lunch. We arrived there around 12:20pm and were told that there is an half hour wait. We got a text when the table was ready.  Very very nice interior. Rustic. Love it.  Server is nice and attentive. Most of pastas come in 2 sizes, the regular and appetizer size. Server recommended a few dishes and we ordered most of what he suggested. We had to return one of the mains because it was too salty. The server apologized but manager didn't come check why or what they can do.  We will not come back for a long while because portion of most items we ordered is very small and the taste is so so. We paid close to $100 including tips and taxes but we were not even full.   We ordered:  Drinks: Some kinda berry mix drink.  Appetizers: Crispy Squid ($11) - delicious but very small portion Fresh Crab Bruschetta ($10) - very fishy taste but I don't mind fishy, very very small portion Fries ($5) - hand cut fries with a mayo based dip. Just normal fries.  Mains: Prawn Linguine ($13 for the appetizer size) - al dente. came with 4 flavorless prawns. Very salty sauce. Small portion. Grilled Chicken Puttanesca ($20) - it first came with a lemon wedge that still has the label sticker on it. Server took the lemon wedge and brought other wedges. He apologized and he said he talked to the chef. VERY salty, the chicken and the sauce. Had 2 bites and I had to return it and I rarely return food. Good portion size. Tagliatelle Bolognese ($18 for the full size) - to replace the chicken. Al dente pasta. Tasted okay. Small portion.  Desserts: Amalfi Lemon Meringue Cheesecake ($10) - decent portion. Sweet. A lot of whipped cream with raspberry sauce. Gelato ($7) - 3 scoops: chocolate, vanilla and pumpkin spice. It says on the menu that it comes with a choice of a couple of toppings but my server didn't ask what toppings I want and it came with no topping."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised on a recent trip. All the pasta's we tried were fresh and very packed with flavor. The daily pasta special with 3 meats was surprisingly balanced and the star of the show. The service was incredible and the chocolate brownie and tiramisu desserts were both great endings.  No complaints here. Big, nice, modern space filled with lovely staff and serving up great food. Will definitely swing by again."}
{"text":"Came to this resto at 2:30pm on a Saturday with my husband. It's not their peak hours. There are a ton of clean empty seats all around. When we first walked in there are three ladies standing at the front. Totally doing nothing. They barely greeted us with a smile. They told me the it will be a few minutes for the table. Waited 8 mins and they didn't even make eye contact with us. They even seated a party of two that came after us. We were the only ones at the front now. The resto is barely at capacity. I'm in the restaurant business so I know. I then went over and asked politely if we can just sit at the bar tables by the windows. There are about five tables available. And the entire bar counter seating is empty. The lady (apparently her name is Renee, the GENERAL MANAGER) rudely said \"sure if u want\". Again barely making eye contact. I'm shocked that at a restaurant of such scale and class, there are such rude hostesses. What a disgrace to Jamie olivers name. Our server was overall okay. But the GM already ruined our mood. Shame.  We ordered an arugula salad, crispy calamari and porcini fettuccine. The calamari had no flavour. The croutons on our salad was CLEARLY stale. I could barely bite through it. You can taste the staleness. We told our server and she asked their head chef to make new ones. 25 mins passed and no croutons in sight. Meanwhile everyone else's food around us was coming out. The fettuccine was okay. A bit salty. Anyway we will never come here again. Once again. Shame."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat dinner while shopping around Yorkdale mall, my friend and I were looking to try out a new restaurant and had hoped to originally go to The Cheesecake Factory, except the line was ridiculous. So we opted out to try Jamie's Italian. The place was rather packed, and it has a rather nice and cozy ambience, the restaurant was also rather spacious with it having two floors. Luckily it wasn't too long of a wait once we entered the restaurant for the hostess to greet us and sit us down at a table.   The server was welcoming and offered us the specials on the menu and drink special of the night. I ended up getting the Tagliatelle Bolognese which was perfectly cooked al dante and was smothered with tender slow cooked pork and beef. My friend got a baked salmon which was rather pricecy for It's portion size but wonderfully cooked medium rare. We also shared arancini as well as the soup of the day (a navy bean soup) which were both pleasantly yummy. It was also a Friday night, so we both got a bottle of Grolsch."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out since it came on my feed a few times. I was in the area doing some shopping, so it was the opportune time to try this place.  Staff: We were greeted at the door and had the option to wait 20 minutes for restaurant seating or be seated in the lounge area immediately. They both had full service so rather than waiting, we opted for the lounge area. The gentleman serving us was nice and helpful but he always seemed MIA when we needed him for something. Food came a little slow but they apologized when it came so that can be forgiven. It was Family Day/Valentine's Day weekend so it was busy.  Ambience: The seating was kind awful. The stools we sat on were cushioned but tiny and I kept sliding off. My life flashed before my eyes a few times. It was all quite harrowing. We were seated on the long table so it was a shared space which we were fine with. Tragically, hooks were only on one of the short side of the table and we happened to be sitting on the side with no hooks. Even the waitress conceded that it was a poor design. Did I mention our waiter's look of fear as he fumbled along the window to serve wine to the party next to me due to the lack of space?  Food: It was all hit and miss. I chose the Sausage Pappardelle which was heavy on the wine in the wine sauce, but tasty nonetheless. The pasta was ridiculously long and thicker than other pappardelle I've had in the past, so I wasn't a huge fan. For dessert we had the Brownie and it was wonderful, but the caramelized popcorn served with it was very hard.  Like I said, it was a hit or miss with food and I'll probably forget this place."}
{"text":"Day 7 into the opening of Jamie's Italian, some wonderful friends and i decided to go check this place out.  The restaurant decor was very nice.  Very rustic.  Resembles Jamie Oliver's style very much.  The atmosphere was great.  Even on a Monday evening this place was busy.  Our waitress greeted us very warmly and gave us the low down on the specials and what she would recommend.  Although she pronounced a lot of the items incorrectly in Italian, she was very nice.   Their little devices that they send our orders thru...she was still learning how to use it so ordering was a little slow.  For starters we ordered arancini in a lightly spiced tomato sauce (pretty good...nice crisp on the outside...sauce was fresh...the rice was a little dense for me though) we also had the crispy squid (they dont call it calamari...the batter was very yummy and the dipping sauce was yummy too)  then came the king mushroom 'fritti' (they looked like sweet potato frites doused with a bit of grated parmesan with a dipping sauce as well...definitely ordering that again!)  For the main course i shared a tagliatelle Bolognese (could've used a little more salt but overall the sauce was well made...lots of meat...the pasta i liked because it was thin and not mushy...also something great is that they have regular portions AS WELL AS smaller portions for pasta! Perfect for a small eater like me that likes to nibble on a lot of variety.)   The pizza i shared was the prosciutto and arugula pizza.  Nice crispy crust.  Flavorful toppings.  One person can eat a whole one.  Was it worth $18?  Maybe not...but i guess you're paying for an experience :)  I recommend going at least once or twice."}
{"text":"I've seen Jamie Oliver's shows on Food Network and he seems to make pretty decent stuff, but I really wonder how well he manages his restaurants.  I was totally not impressed at this place, they seemed to make you \"wait\" and sit at the bar for a bit for a table to be prepared, I went at 11:30 on Saturday morning and the place was mostly empty! (However the online booking showed that there were no spots until Tues!)  We ordered a few small size pastas to eat just to try out the different dishes, these were the most salty pastas I've had in my life. I complained and they remade 2 of them, it was a little better but still very, very salty.  However, nice decor and ok service (minus the unnecessary waiting), but I think they need to hire some cooks that can cook properly if they want to survive."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was disappointing with a such a high price and lack of quality. The interior and decor was interesting but not really authentic. Don't think I would be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.   Hmmm food was nothing special. The service however was wonderful. Our waitress was very enthusiastic and food was served quickly. First we ordered artisan bread as appetizers accompanied with a olive and tomato dip and olive oil and balsamic vinegar this was $6, something that is complimentary in most restaurants.   The good part about the menu is that they have the option of small and large portion sizes. This was ideal for my friend and I since we were able to try and share three small entree dishes. First was the superfood salad with albacore tuna which was good, but similar to grocery store lentil and quinoa salad, but the tuna was seared nicely making the salad a good choice. The salad also came with an avocado with a teaspoon spicy tomato based sauce.  The second entree was a rabbit pasta, which will not be on the menu any more according to our waitress due to free range rabbit sourcing, but in my opinion it was sub par should be taken off the menu because it was a bland lemony pasta with rabbit meat. Third was a traditional red sauce pasta which was ok but nothing special like I mentioned.  Overall, I think this place is over hyped and the food was not that great. This restaurant will not be on my go to list of restaurants."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  Not by the select, not by the server, not by the look and feel of the place.  I was disappointed because the crab bruschetta we ordered did not taste like crab - it would have been better if we'd ordered the tuna version that was a special that day.    The calamari we ordered - I have had larger quantities that were cooked and seasoned better elsewhere.  I was disappointed that the restaurant will not split a meal between two people.  What, can't afford to wash two times the plates?    The pasta was delicious.  However, I feel like its a hyped up restaurant and doesn't have the play on flavors that I was expecting."}
{"text":"Wow, I am so disappointed at this restaurant. The first time I visited I had a great meal, server and time. My partner and I decided to take his parents here after some Christmad shopping and had the worst experience... 1) The hostess would not seat us until our entire party was present. My partner and his father arrived while we were waiting for a table, I told them they should browse the mall while I and his mother waited. Despite the fact that the hostess saw us all together, she refused to seat us until they returned from walking around the mall. 2) Our mains arrived too quickly and were still cold? How does that happen? 3) We were overcharged 4) I have written an email expressing my disappointment and have not recieved a response, it has been a week.  Pick somewhere else to eat, go up to the food court if you have to."}
{"text":"Great restaurant as long as you dont order food. It is an Italian restaurant but the past was so underwhelming... lack flavor and taste! This is my third times here and each time I regret it. Service is also average. Not available usually. The only thing that was good is the Salad!"}
{"text":"The service here is very welcoming, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is quite nice. The server was friendly and helpful, and introduced us to the special of the day. I decided to try the Fresh Crab Bruschetta, Fresh Crab Spaghetti, while my friend decided to try Jamie's Sausage Papperdelle.  One thing that I liked about this restaurant is that the ingredients tasted fresh. The Fresh Crab Bruschetta was topped with crunchy fennel, lemon, and chili and tasted uniquely lemonly, seasoned, and quite healthy. The crab was quite fresh as well, and the small pieces of chili added a nice kick to it. Because it is loaded, it is easy for all the toppings to fall off.  On the other hand, the Fresh Crab Spaghetti did not quite blow my mind. The spaghetti on its own did taste quite fresh. However, it was little too salty, and perhaps there was too much olive oil. I did try my friend's Papperdelle however and that was cooked quite well with the al dante texture. The ragu was tasty as well with a hint of wine, and tasted fresh and meaty. I also liked how the pasta was uniquely shaped (not the typical shapes that you see at the stores) so it makes it interesting to eat.  For dessert we tried the affogato which was vanilla gelato topped with some ground nuts and a shot of espresso. Loved the coffee taste and when it melts into the gelato it tastes pretty amazing.  I probably will not try the Crab Spaghetti again but would probably come back again to try out some of their other fresh pastas or pizzas"}
{"text":"So apparently his food is supposed to be on the healthier side but me and my boyfriend just found it to be lacking in flavour. We wouldn't come back, but we're glad we tried it since it was a bit hyped up. Also I used to watch him on food network, cooking for his little boy, etc. So I'm happy we tried it. We got quite a few things from their menu. I think our favourite was the calamari rings. Expected their pasta to be the best but it wasn't.."}
{"text":"Jamies Italian at Yorkdale Mall  A delicious salad at Jamie's Toronto location.  With all the hype I had to make a stop to take my turn in this famous establishment.   My first take on the place was a very cool atmosphere and great service. The staff were very attentive and helpful.   The menu has a lot of great options from salads to pastas.  I had to try the feature salad.   Super Food Salad is full of goodness, avocado, roasted beets and a mix of grains. A must for any vegetarian looking for a great salad.   Little over priced for the other restaurants in the area.  Lunch salad with no meat was $20 and if I added chicken of fish I would have been over $30 for lunch.   I was the only person there at the time.  I guess it must be fully for dinner or other times.   Considering this place is not fine dining it will be the most expensive place in Yorkdale.    #jamiesitalianca #torontoeats #Toronto #6ix #foodpics #foodreviewca #salad #vegetarian #salad #eat #lunch #yorkdale #gastropost #foodie #foodporn #instafood #instalike"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Table tops a little sticky. Menu items not a big surprise. Friendly service. Clean place."}
{"text":"A warm welcome to Jamie's Italian Yorkdale! I literally grew up in this mall and can recall just about every food served here in the past 50 years. That said, I am really excited about Jamie's!  The decor really is outstanding. The design powerhouse of Martin Brudnizki have managed to create an environment that is warm, elegant and casual all at the same time. The attention to detail is almost overwhelming. My compliments to the design team.  Although I have been here twice since opening, I haven't experienced as much of the menu as I might like, largely due to having ordered a cured meat plank on both occasions. They have done a great job with their planks and I was impressed with the selection and presentation. The polenta is nothing like my northern Italian mothers (or nona's for that matter), in fact, I preferred Jamie's polenta chips over anything I ever ate at home. The arugula and parm salad was like being in Italy, and they were kind enough to double up a large order for me to create a family size salad I could enjoy on my own. Aside from this, the \"Worlds Best Olives on Ice\" might be better named \"Pretty Good Olives on Ice\"   I sat at the bar on my second visit and this may well be my choice moving forward. In closing, the espresso was exceptional, although I did have the advantage of having served only seconds from it being pulled. My compliments to the bar staff and management team as this is now a go-to restaurant for me."}
{"text":"I did not had super high expectations for this restaurant as I knew it was licensed to a big corporation.   The decor is nice and clean but not quite imaginative. Some wood, white tiles, metal and exposed light bulbs. Rather safe and common.   Service was very good. Our waitress was smiling, happy to answer our questions and listen to our feedback.   As for the food, we shared the Italian Nachos to start. 3/5. The raviolis were over fried and we could barely taste the cheese inside as it was too dry and had too little.   We then shared the Patate Pizza. Mascarpone sauce, pancetta bacon, rosemary and sliced potatoes (3/5). The idea is great but it is lacking in execution. They did not chopped the rosemary leaves and wherever it was on the pizza it was overtaking the taste. It was not mixing well with the other ingredients. As for the pancetta, 4 slices is no enough! Especially when the pizza is $19. The dough was good but borderline overcooked.   Last we shared the Gennaro's Tagliatelle Bolognese. The sauce was good and tasty if a tad too liquid for my taste. I was surprised to find that some of the pasta were sticking together. (3/5).   Overall it is a decent option that should please most basic desire of all the family. However, if you wish to have something a bit more interesting I would recommend Scaddabush."}
{"text":"I have been in Jamie Oliver's restaurant in London. That was one of the best food experiences I've ever had so I was excited to find out that he has a restaurant in Toronto. My husband and I came here for Valentine's dinner. The restaurant is nicely decorated and really has an Italian vibe to it. So far so good. But let me tell you about the service. Our waitress immediately approached us and started pouring water in our glasses, which under normal circumstances would have been nice. However, every time she touched the water jug she spilled more than she actually poured into the glasses and she did not react at all. She did not even wipe off the table! This kept happening throughout the evening and at one point she even spilled on my husband, without noticing it at all! How is that even possible? 10-15 min after placing our order, the waitress came back and asked if I could repeat the it. Supposedly they had a new computer system, which happened to lose our order. The problems continued during our romantic evening as we kept getting food items that had been ordered by the tables around us and they were given our orders. The restaurant clearly has a major problem with this and should take care of it as soon as possible! For Valentine's they had a prix fix dinner, but we decided to go for the á la carte menu. We started with the artisan bread which had four different types of bread, whereof one crispy. This was served with a little bowl of olive oil and balsamic. However, this bowl was too small to dip in so we poured it on our plates. Unfortunately the balsamic had sunken to the bottom of the bowl, consequently we only got oil on our plates. On top of that, oil was pouring down the sides of this bowl, making it very messy, leaving fat stains all over our table. I don't know how they thought this would be served?  The main dishes we ordered were the classic pasta carbonara and porcini fettucine, a kind of mushroom pasta. I cannot describe enough how tasty both of these mains were. I've has pasta carbonara in different places and many times left disappointed. This was not one of those cases. It was delicious, but I would have liked to have a little more pancetta as there was very little of it. The mushroom pasta had a really nice flavour, you could tell the person who combined the ingredients knew what he was doing. Mains get 5 stars throughout! Finally we ended our romantic dinner with the cheesecake and warm brownie with vanilla ice cream. Although the dessert was good, it did not wow me. I was expecting a twist or surprise in the flavour but I got nothing. In fact, the cheesecake lacked flavour since both the cake itself and the sauce that it was drizzled with had the exact same flavour. It was supposed to be served with fruit compote but maybe they forgot about it? The flavour would have come out more if it was served with any type of acidic fruit.  Based on this I would definitely recommend take out from Jamie's Italian for the main dish, but anything else and you'll be disappointed! You'd be better off eating the delicious mains at home than getting this confused \"wet\" service. Overall I give it 2.5 stars out of 5 since the service really brought the whole experience down."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite restaurant! Great food and great service. They also change the menu up every now and then which is nice and they always have different specials. Prices are also great for the quality of food you receive."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good service but little pricey for the portions we got. Food was average. Nothing was really standing out.  I am going to give it another try when everything gets settled in."}
{"text":"The hubster and I are foodies and relish almost all varieties of food. So it was with great anticipation that we decided to try Jamie Oliver's foray into the Canadian gastrosphere for our \"cotton\" anniversary.  I have to say that the restaurant, which has partnered with King Street Food Company (think Jacob's Steakhouse and Bucca Toronto) gets top marks for ambience and service. (SIDE NOTE: KSFC really should consider selling their customer service model and best practices to the rest of Canada!)  I can't say the same for the food though. The garlic bread although delicious was pretty much a garlic naan. My husband noted, Jamie likely picked it up from a trip to Southall. I don't mind the plagiarism, but give a former colony it's due and call the damned thing a naan   My husband ordered the steak and fries and I got the burger. If you want fries with your burger, you have order them as a side. That would be ok, except about half of my $4 truffle fries were crispy, and by that I mean burnt.   Also my burger was served with pancetta, despite alerting our server several times that we don't eat pork. That was remedied, but a fresh burger meant an additional 10 minutes wait.  The burger and steak were tender and fresh, but fairly devoid of flavour. When I pulled a desi (South Asian) and asked for hot sauce, I was offered a chilli paste for an additional dollar. I mean come on Jamie, give a desi a break!   For dessert we got the tiramisu. The server had recommended the Epic Brownie, but it sounded super rich. I may have to go back to try that on empty stomach. The tiramisu was drenched in something sickly sweet, and I could barely take two bites before giving up.  Final Verdict: Not worth the hype or the $90 bill.  PS: Gave two stars instead of one, because the service really was great!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I love Jamie Oliver. I was here today for lunch to celebrate my birthday.  The staff were very nice and we didn't have to wait very long. It was busy enough for lunch time. I'd say about a 10 minute wait to be seated. The waiter was also very live and quickly went through some of their specials and even made some suggestions (which I appreciate but some don't). We ordered the crispy squid with garlic aioli as our starter. I ordered the porcini fettucini and my lunch companion ordered the spaghetti carbonara. Everything came in a timely manner. This is where I gave the restaurant a 3. The food was ok considering the prices. I was disappointed with the serving size of the squid. Maybe 4 or 5 pieces each? They were slightly bigger than what you'd get at Jack Astor's or Pickel Barrel. But still for the price I would've expected more. The meals were ok as well, nothing spectacular. The serving sizes were decent as well. It was enough to keep you feeling satisfyingly full. Overall it was a nice experience and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The pasta al dente and the sauce hearty. You can tell that a lot of care went into preparing them. The only downside is the portion - you get so little for what you're paying for, and the pretentious attitude that seeps throughout the restaurant. Our waitress was horrible. Who applies lip balm in front of customers? We even had some random guy probably the chef assistant introduce the food when he brought it out. We had no idea what the hell he said through the mumbling. Overall I wouldn't come back because the people and atmosphere made it an annoying experience. Oh and the chairs are uncomfortable and made for tall models."}
{"text":"My husband and I have seen Jamie's Italian as one of the specialty restaurants on Royal Caribbean cruise. We were excited to see its first location opened in Toronto and invited our family to join us for lunch.   Since we wanted to give the whole menu a try, we agreed on family style. The five of us shared 5 pastas (stuffed cannelloni, porcini fettuccine , tagliatelle bolognese, crab spaghetti, and garlicky shrimp linguine),  arachini, fried calamari, fried ravioli bites, polenta chips. We unanimously agreed the best pasta dish was hands down the porcini fettuccine  - creamy and decadent. The worst was the crab spaghetti - so salty. The arachini and fried calamari were good but nothing to write home about. I would skip the fried ravioli bites - supposed to be stuffed but all ours were empty. Perhaps all the cheese leaked out in the frying process? The polenta chips were pretty much fried grits balls. I love my grits so I particularly enjoyed this side. If only they were served with some type of sauce.   Even for lunch, we went all out and couldn't leave without desserts. We shared their lemon meringue cheesecake, brownie ala mode, and tiramisu. I would recommend skipping them since they all tasted store bought/generic. $10 each - definitely go into the mall and grab a sweet bite there instead.   Service - although our server was charming and very charismatic - he dropped the ball in making sure all our foods were served as we requested or served at all. We asked our foods to be brought to us when ready. Instead everything was brought to our table all at once - half of the foods had been sitting and were already cold. Just as we were wondering why the foods were taking so long! Perhaps it was the expediter's fault, we saw different servers kept bringing untouched dishes back to the kitchen. Maybe to the wrong table? Our ravioli and polenta chips were forgotten (or maybe given away?) We had to follow up on each separately and only received them after we already finished our pastas.   Overall - still a new restaurant so streamlining, expediting, and serving still need training. Foods were half a grade higher than most chain restaurants. Doubt we will ever crave to return."}
{"text":"The single meat board was very small. 1 slice of meat each. Nice selection though.  All pasta menu pretty much.  1/2 price wine menu was a great deal!   It's a shame this place isn't more busy. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ridiculously overhyped , overpriced restaurant! Went for extended celebrations of my birthday, on some friend's recommendation, worst experience! All it added my celebrations is: SALT :) Lol, thats what I remember about their pastas and starters.  Red house wine for fine, not worth 50 bucks for a litre. Definitely not! Other thing edible was brownie.  Rest all food was crap, the garlic bread, mushroom and 3 different pastas that we tried.  There was not enough pasta sauce for any pasta, they were served dry, like homemade macaroni, that even thats has some flavours, mac and cheese could have been better then their pomodoro pasta.  Oh God, how are they still in business, what happens to people's taste buds and senses? How come they throw money on salt?   Seriously neva go there!!!!"}
{"text":"*3.5/5 *Restaurant is owned by the same owners as Buca and Jacob Steak House.  *restaurant was spacious with two dining floors and a small \"market\" where one can buy some Oliver's branded items. *Very children friendly and great for large groups.  *Service was really good.  *You can order a half order of pasta, thus you can try more.  *Most of the food was either too salty or spicy, it didn't blow my mind like my experience at Buca  -Garlic Bread with lemony ricotta  - $8.90  it was quite interesting how they used nann bread instead of the usual chunky slice of bread. Not impressed with the dish. Instead of getting nice chunks of garlic, we were overwhelmed by the amount of rosemary topped on the bread. The ricotta was creamy but the lemon was undetectable.  -Mushroom Fritti (crispy king oyster mushrooms, Parmigiano Reggiano & garlic mayo) - $8.95 The deep fried king oyster mushrooms were expertly breaded and packed with flavors. I liked the slight touch of paprika in the garlic mayo which added just enough heat. Squeeze some lemon for an acidic component to those meaty bites and you are in for a real treat!  -Fresh Crab Bruschetta (fresh white & brown crab, crunchy fennel, lemon, chilli) - $9.95 I love the use of fennel here. It was aromatic with a little-bit-spicy anise flavor that brought out the freshness of the crab. With that said, I found the crab to be too salty because of the capers, which was actually a common theme with some of the dishes throughout our lunch.  -Arancini Margherita (stuffed risotto rice balls with pickled piri piri chillies, mozarella, spicy arrabbiata sauce & Parmigiano Reggiano) - $8.50 The arancini had a thin, crackling-crisp coating that just barely contained the flow of rice suspended in a creamy sauce. In the very middle was a pocket of a slightly melted mozarella cheese. I loved the balance between tartness and spiciness from the margherita sauce which cut down the richness of the risotto rice balls.  -Fresh Crab Spaghetti (with garlic, capers, chilli, fennel, parsley, anchovies, lemon & olive oil) - $10.50 The pasta at the restaurant is handmade daily and they were all consistently al dente in our dishes! Again the chef was too heavy-handed on the capers here, otherwise all of the ingredients in the dish really highlighted the freshness of the perfectly cooked crab.  -Porcini Fettuccine (wild & field mushrooms, mascarpone, garlic, white wine, lemony gremolata, Parmigiano Reggiano & pangrattato) - $9.50 The porcini fettuccine along with the fresh crab spaghetti were easily my favorite pasta of the lunch. The mushrooms in the porcini fettuccine was delectable: still retained the flavors and firm, and not mushy in the creamy sauce. It also came with some breadcrumbs to sprinkle on top for some crunch as well. The sauce was thick and creamy and delicious or as Jamie Oliver would say: beu-a-full!  -Prawn Linguine (Fried garlicky prawns, fennel, tomatoes, chilli, saffron, fish broth & arugula) - $10.50 The prawn linguine is perhaps one of the most famous/known dish from Jamie Oliver, however I was quite disappointed that the tomato sauce was too salty and spicy which really overpowered the delicate flavor of the prawns.  -Tiramisu (Layers of coffee-soaked sponge with orange mascarpone, topped with chocolate & orange zest) - $9.95 The version at Jamie Oliver was a bit different with fresh orange zest being mixed with the mascarpone and garnished on the cake itself. Also, instead of lady fingers, sponge cakes were used and they were drenched in espresso. The sweet and tangy orange flavours brought out the nuttiness in the espresso flavour and also gives the dessert a lightness and playfulness that is so indicative of talented and fun-loving Jamie Oliver.  -Epic Brownie (Warm fudgy brownie with vanilla gelato & caramelised popcorn) - $9.95  I loved the nice contrast of sweet and cold vanilla gelato against the warm and gooey dark chocolate brownie. Epic.  -Affogato (Vanilla gelato with a shot of piping hot espresso & crumbled biscotti) - $5.95  Love the blend of hot and cold elements and I also sort of love how it's a very adult dessert with the addition of espresso and some crunches from the crumbled biscotti. However my friend mentioned that he would have liked it more if the gelato portion was bigger."}
{"text":"A nice central location to meet up with friends, go for a drink with coworkers or take a date. It's decorated nicely so great for those girls night photos. The service was good as well. The only issue was that the food and drinks came out to be a bit overpriced for being very average. We shared the calamari and mushrooms as apps which were decent. The porcini fetuccini was alright but not that memorable. I did like that they had a bevy of non-alcoholic drinks that were actually fun and pretty tasty but I'm unlikely to return just for the drinks."}
{"text":"My first experience of summerlicious ever was at this place. The food was delicious but some dishes were salty. The service was really good, the server always was somewhere around us. No doubt I gonna come back."}
{"text":"Having some amazing girl time at Yorkdale Mall. After a little shopping therapy we decided to recharge our batteries at Jamie Oliver's. Staff were great. Good ambience and we were seated quickly. We shared a salad and each of us had their ravioli special. Could t decide on which red wine to pair our meal with so our server gave us a sample of s red he felt best suited to our meal. We had a glass each and savoured every mouthful.   After great conversation and our bellies well sated we decided to go back to the mall and have a little more therapy.  Didn't quite expect the meal to be so expensive. For 10 ravioli 's times two, a mixed green salad we shared and two glasses of wine our bill was just under $100. I guess I don't go out enough to restaurants to justify those kind of prices. With the increase prices at the grocery store i shouldn't have been so surprised.   I have to say I will go back. It was money well spent."}
{"text":"As soon as I heard that a Jamie's Italian was going into Yorkdale, I was so excited to go.  I'll start this review with saying that the food is very good here. But there are somethings that lack here across all of the typical rating categories.  Food Ordered: Tomato & Ricotta Bruschetta $9.95 Rigatoni Pomadoro - $15.95 Affogato - $5.95 Soda - Sprite - $3.00  Pricing: Pricing is a key point when reviewing a place. A lot of people think that it reflects the value of the food and how good it is. But I've definitely had great food at lower prices. And here at Jamie's Italian, the food was good but I don't think it is worth the money. It was the Buschetta that flagged this to me. I ordered it to split the food with my wife and we only received 1 large slice of Bruschetta. It was great, but it definitely isn't worth $10. I was really turned off by that. If we received 3-4 smaller pieces I could make a case for it but not with what we got. 1 isn't shareable, I mean we cut it in half but it just felt like it wasn't meant to be shared which in my experience, Bruschetta should be. The soda was also priced high too and I'm not sure if it included refills as well.  Food: As I said before, the food was great. Well cooked, pasta was cooked al dente and I really got a great taste for the food. I'm unfortunately still dreaming about that over priced Bruschetta. i guess they have got me there but I can't justify the price. The Affogato was great, a good pick me up at the end of the meal. Can't complain there!  Service: I'll admit that we were a party of 8 and a baby and they don't take reservations on Fridays and Saturday nights, so it was already hard to get a table. I get why they do that but I never really like that policy. Our server was just below the line of OK. She checked in on us infrequently and she got my drink order wrong. Some how a Sprite without ice turned into a Rum and Sprite which \"conveniently\" landed on our bill too. I wasn't too impressed. I thought this would be a different experience.  I probably will make my way here again one day but I just wasn't thrilled with the initial experience. Maybe next time will be different."}
{"text":"Wow...did this place ever fall off a cliff with the new menu.  The first couple of times was great and I would have said 4 stars...but this time the food was straight up East Side Marios.  Portions were smaller and the quality was way off versus before.  The crab spaghetti had marginal amounts of crab and the chicken cacciatore was mediocre at best.  So disappointed...this was quickly becoming a favourite place and now it's chain food at a 30 percent premium."}
{"text":"The dinning room is simple, bright and modern. You have to access the restaurant from the outside of Yorkdale mall. The service was incredible! Our server was lively making sure our glasses of water were always full, and making the best recommendations as to what we should order.  We had the fried ravioli that was wickedly good. It was the perfect appetizer to start with. For our main course we had the linguine with prawns! Such a flavourful dish! For dessert I highly recommend having the Affogato......it's vanilla gelato with a shot of espresso and crumbled biscotti. Very yummy! I can't wait to go back again and again until I eventually taste everything on his menu! (And hopefully run into Jamie one day!)"}
{"text":"Very lively and rustic place. Reminds us a lot of the Jamie we visited in East London. The only disappointment was with our app (mushroom) not arrived for a good 45 minutes. What happened? Some server took our app to some random table who didn't order it and they ate it. All they did for us was a refire, and our server has to come and apologize for someone else's mistake. The mushroom app was good, but slightly underseasoned, but the combination is still enjoyable. Our main course, which arrive in good time, were very tasty, definitely at par with our experience in London. Our desert, while not made in-house, but contracted to a local speciality bakery using Jamie's recipe, was heavenly. The decor was very rustic and homey, so it was lovely and worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for awhile. My friend and I are both huge fans of Jamie and his cooking.  I was pleasantly surprised! We shared a regular portion of the shrimp pasta and a smaller portion of the tubular pasta with the tastiest bread crumbs ever. The wine pairing was delicious, the service was outstanding and I will def be returning! I wish they had a better selection of dessert otherwise my pasta craving was satisfied to its fullest!"}
{"text":"Totally mediocre but yet over priced. I'd be embarrassed to put my name on this restaurant. Apparently Jamie Oliver has no shame."}
{"text":"Agree with Gilbert K's review! Great pasta, but pretty average pizza.  We came here for dinner since the other restaurants at Yorkdale were much busier. The ambience was nice and intimate where we were seated, and service was great. We ordered the Crispy Squid, Parma pizza and the Risotto of the day to share between two people. Since it was a Monday, it was also half off their bottles of wine as well!   The Crispy Squid was actually pretty good! They were lightly fried but it was a small portion and the dipping sauce was average. As for the Parma pizza, it was actually quite large, but I would have liked more cheese on it. Lastly, the Risotto of the day (which was over $30) was delicious! The salmon was cooked well and the skin was quite crispy. I would probably re-order that if they offer it again!"}
{"text":"No!   Just ... NO!!!!   The most authentic Italian thing about this restaurant is the word \"Italian\" in its name!   Hint:   Burger Italiano.  A burger belongs in an Italian restaurant as much as someone called Jamie should have his name on it.  (But \"Jimmy's Italian\" could work ...).  Hint:  Epic Brownie.  As my father would likely have said:  \"Ma che catso e un brownanie??!!\"   Hint:   Amalfi lemon meringue cheesecake.  Putting the word Amalfi in front of meringue and cheesecake ain't gonna change the fact that it's meringue and cheesecake, which no self respecting Italian pastry chef would condone let alone serve.   ALL ITALIANS UNITE AGAINST THIS FALSE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR FOOD!   What's next:  The Riviera Hot Dog??!!   Just ... NO!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation but it might not be needed on a weekday. After getting semi chased by a ridiculous cabby (long story short) I found my way to Jamie's, which was located on the north side of Yorkdale Mall on the outside. The decor was very impressive, spacious and modern. From my first impression, it felt like it was one of those over hyped places with a brand name....which it was.   Service was great and food was just fine. I ordered the Super Food Salad (Grilled avocado, beets, pulses, grains, sprouting broccoli, cottage cheese, pomegranate, mixed seeds & harissa). Wish there was just a little bit more. Otherwise, a lovely salad.   Will probably be back again but I do find the dinner prices high. Hopefully the portions are bigger."}
{"text":"\"do or do not - you will regret both\" - Soren Kierkegaard  Soren Kierkegaard was a Danish philosopher who was interested in the examination of existentialism. One of his main arguments in 'either/or' states that human choices are neither significant nor compelling within the grand scheme of things. Should you sign that prenup to prepare for your inevitable divorce? Doesn't matter, you will regret it. Should you take that job offer? Doesn't matter, you will regret it. He explained that with every choice, there will always be a hint of regret that follows it. This existentialist view and absurdity was the base of his philosophical view. Ultimately, he explains that the only way to really live is to laugh at all of life's event.   Although I believe that Jamie's restaurant can improve on many levels, it does succeed in one aspect - they can certainly bring laughs to life. With this subtle laughter, you will gradually forget guilty life choices. Jamie's restaurant can turn your regret of graduating with fine arts from category five to category two. Jamie's restaurant is equivalent to your friend telling you that \"there is still hope with a fine arts degree in today's changing world.\" But in the end, you realize that this comment was just a tiny bandage over a hemorrhaging wound. Jamie's restaurant reflects this metaphor by having intrinsic flaws that are supplemented by small, pleasant details. They have friendly staffs, relaxing atmosphere and great cocktails. They give attention to detail with dish presentation; even their cheapest appetizer will be served with a garnish. They have homemade pasta which has amazing textures, but the sauces can be quite bland. Their pizzas look great but can taste quite flat as well. Their dessert menu is great, their Tiramisu will certainly pick you up. Their polenta cake is rich, creamy and not overly acidic. Overall, their effort in service and atmosphere balances out their lack in flavour (only some dishes). But either way, in the end, you will still regret coming here.   3/5"}
{"text":"Sat at bar on sunday at 11:30 only 1 other Person At bar. Finally the 3rd bartender that passed greeted me. Chardonnay was ice cold with ice slivers in it,sooooo wrong. I want my wine at the right temperature. The crab bruschetta was terrible. The mushroom fettuccine was incredibly salty. No one asked e how my food was.i will never  go back."}
{"text":"It was good, but not amazing. I expected more from a place like this with the name of Jamie Oliver. The price of the dishes didn't justify the quality of the dish itself - this place has an inflated price for their menu items. The service was okay, not as great as you would expect. It's service is on par with a Boston Pizza or any other large franchised food chain.  The food tasted fine. I got the Meatball Pappardelle, which I liked but for the price was way too much. The pasta was kind of bland, the tomato sauce almost tasted like they just got it out of a can or was made the night before. It didn't taste very fresh to me. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly and the meatballs also were kind of plain. Portions are pretty small too.  Also if you're planning on eating there, I recommend eating in the dining area. The lounge area just doesn't have enough room on the table for you to have dishes placed there as well."}
{"text":"We ordered the margherita pizza, kale salad, and a refresher drink. The lowdown: Good service. Good food. 4 stars."}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner on Saturday night. It's definitely on the fine dining side of the prices. For a special occasion it's totally worth it. I wish I could say the food met my expectations though. It was bland. And spice for the sake of spice. My boyfriend and I both ordered the pasta with mushrooms. For that price point I would expect the pasta to be homemade. If it was it definitely didn't taste like it. My favourite restaurant in London has the best carpaccio. It's never been cooked. It was seared beef that We were served here. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't had the opportunity to dine in many Italian restaurants, and it's a personal goal of mine to try as many as I can in 2018 and beyond. I figured out I would try out Jamie's restaurant because I've been a fan of Jamie Oliver for several years.  3 things I like and don't like  Pizza: I've read some reviews that describe the pizza here as average or subpar, while I don't necessarily disagree I do think the pizza here is definitely worth a try. I ordered the margherita pizza and it was nice and hot, the dough was great, and the tomatoes, fior di latte and olive oil all came together very nicely.  Ambience: Definitely cozy and classy environment, and our server was very kind and described every dish to us in great detail.   Pasta: The highlight of the night. I had never tried tagliatelle before so I ordered the veggie tagliatelle bolognese, and it certainly exceeded my expectations. Sauce was great, pasta was cooked well, and it was quite flavourful."}
{"text":"Wandering around yorkdale and we got hungry. Seeing as Cheesecake Factory and Joeys were busy I figured we would try this place. I've always wanted to go but never had the time.   When we walked through the doors it was not busy at all. Which at 1pm is kind of odd but took it as a good thing. Le boyfriend is celiac and it is usually a hit and miss with pasta - however when we do go to italian places I always ask if they have gluten free and they do. To be honest he wanted to have spaghetti and meat balls, but settled for Penne Bolognese and I had the Parma pizza. We started with Crispy Squid.  Once the crispy squid came to the table it LOOKED delicious. It tasted rather overdone tho, one top of the portion size could've been bigger had they just pushed the paper back. For $13.75 you would think there would be more than what is there.   Le boyfriend enjoyed his pasta, he had stated there was not anything special about it.. However it was extremely basic so it doesn't mean it wasn't good. My pizza was underdone in the middle, it was okay.. nothing special.    All in all for a total of $79 bucks I expected amazing food. BIG let down. They got two stars because the service we received from our waitress was fantastic - Thank you Theressa for the wonderful client service you provided!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert in italian cooking, but this is pretty good for the price. Nice presentation, decor, and prices. Food is not mindblowing but its not offensive. Its not too oily too.   Good place to go if you're already hanging out in York Dale mall."}
{"text":"I came here for the lemon meringue cheesecake. It's no longer there. Also the menu prices have changed. I got the small crab spaghetti for 18.95. don't trust the menu photos. For that price I would have gotten the full for 4 dollars more. There was one inch of crab in it. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  We ordered the pasta with porcini mushrooms and the pasta with prawns.  Both were fine, and nothing really special.  The biggest disappointment was the kid's menu.  We ordered the sliders with potatoes.  For $13, I thought that we would get more than two loonie-sized sliders with two roasted baby potatoes and a \"salad\" that would fit inside a baby food-sized jar.  I have eaten larger portions of food at a cocktail party.  Needless to say we all had a good laugh when the kids' meal came out.  The service was prompt as the food did come out quite quickly after we ordered.  Maybe we'll have better luck with the pizza next time."}
{"text":"About 24 of us decided to check out Jamie's Italian last night and I can safely say that everyone enjoyed their experience thoroughly. The service was terrific and the food was delicious.  Started off with the cured meat plank, and Sicilian Caponata bruschetta. The bruschetta was alright. My husband ordered the arancini, which I thought was a better choice. Ordered the steak frites for my main which was very tasty.  Had three different flavours of gelato for dessert - the pumpkin spice was by far the best! And I also got to sample my husband's brownie. So yummy! Overall, I had a fantastic time and I look forward to going again."}
{"text":"I've only been to one other location, in Sydney, and this was unfortunately not as memorable. The hosts were perfectly friendly, polite, and accommodating. But we were unlucky that we got such a cold and chip on her shoulder type waitress. We felt we were almost bullied, and somewhat neglected by giving us the dessert menu but never actually coming back to ask if we wanted anything, which we did. The food itself was all very well executed, everything cooked perfectly, but the taste of everything did not stand out, or make us say \"yum!!!\" It's disappointing enough that we won't be returning or recommend any friends or family. We also spent 129$ for 2 adults and 2 children."}
{"text":"I took my parents here for dinner for the Christmas holidays. We went on a Sunday and the restaurant was extremely busy. There were constantly people waiting to be seated at the door. So glad I made a reservation on Open Table a week before.   Instead of trying out their appetizers, we decided to order their special pizza of the day to start.   The pizza had a nice thin and crispy crust, topped with potatoes, prosciutto and mozzarella. I'm a huge fan of potato pizzas, but this one is not the best I've ever had. I like how their crust is done, so I'll try another pizza the next time I go.  For the main entrees, we ordered their famous prawn linguine pasta, ribeye steak and turkey milanese. The pasta was quite delicious, but people who like their pasta to be al dente, like my mom, would be disappointed. As for the steak, we asked for medium rare; however, it was way overcooked. The exterior looked charred and it tasted a bit bitter. The turkey milanese didn't look appetizing, but the combination of egg yolk, truffles and turkey was very unique and is worth a try. The portions of the dishes we had were just right. We were able to finish everything, but had no room for desserts.   Overall, I would recommend Jamie's Italian for casual lunches and dinners. It is at a great location and its prices are reasonable. It has a nice ambiance and I really like the decor. However, the chairs are quite uncomfortable. I would go again to try their other pizzas and pastas, but would probably stay away from their meat entrees."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! I had the opportunity to eat here for brunch on its first Saturday trading with a friend & we did not regret it one bit!  Upon entering, we were well-greeted & even had small chit-chat before being seated.   Being a fellow Brit, I never had a chance to eat at any of Jamie's restaurants because you always had to reserve in advance.  The décor & ambiance was amazing and was served by a very friendly server Ron.  Ron really took care of us & was always on hand to make sure we had what we needed. Ron also told us he tasted everything on the menu and could recommend dishes if we wasn't sure what to choose.  Starters was to die for, we shared a cold meat platter which was about $11.95 pp. What I found amazing was that the server who bought this platter out explained everything on this platter & the recommended order to eat it in!  Moving onto mains, I had a 10 oz steak & my friend had a pasta dish. Pasta is fresh and made on the premises - depending where you are seated, you can see the pasta being freshly made (like we did - amazing). The steak was the best I have tasted in a long time...thanks for the recommendation Ron!!!  After starters & mains...we were stuffed BUT managed to cheat and share a slice of cheesecake between us!! Omg, this cheesecake was a combination of a normal cheesecake and a lemon meringue (nom nom).  This restaurant is a nice gem for Yorkdale...I am hoping to come here once a month as a treat!!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my first year marriage anniversary with hubby and we were surprised at the quality of the food!   We came on a late Sunday night so we didn't have to wait to be seated. It took longer for the waitress to clean the table and seat us but overall her service was good because she was very attentive and knew the menu well to recommend some dishes for us.  We ordered the mushroom pasta and the spicy salami pizza as entree, the risotto rice ball for appetizer and a ginger mojito. My husband really enjoyed the pasta as recommended by our waitress and I found my pizza to be a tad spicy. The appetizer was delightful, it was chewy and the tomato sauce that went with it gave it a nice touch. The drink however was too spicy for my liking probably because of the ginger that was inside.    I'm not a fan of the deco of the restaurant and the washrooms were far from the main floor. Other than that it was an enjoyable and delicious experience and evening out!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience.   We're familiar with Jamie's Italian restaurants. We had a phenomenal experience in a royal Caribbean ship a few months back.   The atmosphere was ok.  We ordered the Jamie burger and mushroom pizza.   We asked for the burger to be well done (it's ground beef FFS). It came medium (at best). Took a while for the waitress to come and check on us. They happily made another burger but the wait was crazy. In the end, the burger wasn't good and our bill wasn't adjusted. What a shame.   The mushroom pizza was ok. 7/10. A bit wet but tasty.   Best part of the meal was the funky chips. Garlicy and crispy. I'd come back just for that. No other reason.    We were so disappointed.  We LOVED Jamie's on the ship. But we'd never go back to this location.   I'd be weary if I was you."}
{"text":"Love it place. Italian nachos are something you must try! Every time I go here I usually get the burger or seafood pasta. The burger is amazing. They used to have truffle oil fries but unfortunately they got rid of it. This place is amazing for family dinners."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Jamie's since he was the Naked Chef, so any chance I get to dine at his restaurants, I do - whether it is in Toronto or in London, England.  We came here as a large group of 12 (10 adults).  I called ahead and they were very accommodating and pleasant on the phone.  The hostess did advise that if we had 12 adults that it would have to be a set menu, but luckily, we were below, so we were all able to order our own dishes!  I ordered the mushroom fettucinne, it was delicious!  Lots of mushrooms, and they have a spoonful of breadcrumbs on the side that you can add to add additional texture.  There were thinly sliced peppers that added a gentle kick to the dish.  So delicious!  We share the flatbread and toasts as appetizers, and then individually ordered our own meals.  Everything came out hot and fresh.  Our waiter was super patient and organized."}
{"text":"The food was really really good. My absolute favorite was the cherry tomatoes and ricotta bruschetta. Mhmm mhmm mhmm  yummy.  And I also had the rigatoni pomadaro . Fresh pasta made there daily and you can certainly taste that.  Would love to go back soon with all my friends . I am so glad jamie has a restaurant in toronto now. Would be even better if he did a meet and greet in Yorkdale & or at the restaurant"}
{"text":"So I'm going to be very honest here,   The ambiance is beautiful as you can see from all of the photos. Besides the fact that it is Jamie Oliver's restaurant I really wanted to go because of the ambiance lol. My friends and I really enjoyed the relaxed space, high ceilings and the modern touch of turquoise, yellow and green elements. The high bar chairs were a nice touch and we actually switched from a regular table just to sit there. (It's the area closest to the bar) during the day there wasn't too many people at the bar so it wasn't too rowdy there, I'm sure in the evenings it would be too busy to sit there.    When it came down to ordering, we were told they had just gotten in their new menus as of that morning. So we ordered. I order a classic pizza, truffle fries and a pasta. The pasta was absolutely horrible. I've never said that on a review but I feel like it is so necessary to say. There was no sauce, I am not over exaggerating. It seemed like it was yesterday's pasta, heated up.. minus any flavour. The pizza sauce had zero flavour. The truffle fries were good. Nachos were good. But I was there after work hoping to get a meal. Once I asked the server to get sauce, explaining there was no flavour so I wanted chilli flakes and cheese and whatever they had, he then told me \"oh all of the chefs are new so they may not know what they're doing because it's a new menu\" ...... eeeerrrrmmm????? What?!    THEREFORE, I won't be going to Jamie Oliver's again  #sorryforthebrutalhonesty #notsorry..?"}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a newly opened Jamie Oliver's restaurant chain. Love the interior, vibe and pastas!  Loved the pasta and mains. Disappointed with the pizza as it was served warm, almost as though it's been on a counter top too long waiting to be served to our table. The prosciutto was not aged well enough and not consistent tomato paste with an almost too hard pizza crust.  The dinner waitress also confused us with stating cod fish was the fish used in the specials for the day, instead seabass fish was used when served. It was kinda confusing as we ordered thinking it was cod, but it ended with a different fish served. Having said that, I was there for lunch for the first time and another waiter had the best recommendation and seemed to know the menu well and even able to talk about the food menu in Jamie's other restaurants in the different countries. Good or bad, the service is dependent who ends up being the server at your table when you're there.   Pasta was amazing though. I'm probably just sticking to the pasta's. Finishing off my meal with Tiramisu dessert which was dee- licious. Probably one of my favorites, but it seems the lemon pie has more of a fan club judging by the slices that was served out to the tables."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating  This restaurant was quite hidden in the mall. Took us awhile to find. I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant - the decoration was nice, a vintage kind of look. They have a party room area upstairs open to public for private bookings on weekdays - quite neat I'd say.  To start we ordered the Crispy Squid ($10.95) Essentially it was fried calamari and squid served with garlic, lemon mayo with sprinkled chili in the sauce. It was fried nicely, nice and crispy - but can't really go through with fried squid. Expensive for its portion size though.  Jamie's Sausage pappardelle ($11.50 for the small portion) Slow cooked fennel and pork sauces mixed with red wine, parmigano, and pangrattato. Given this pasta was named after Jamie, I would assume it'd be the house special. However, it wasn't much of my liking. First and for most the presentation was awful. (Not to sound gross but looks like someone puked out ground beef in tomato sauce) In terms of taste I personally did not like the flavor - tasted very herby or peppery. Could also be the taste of the sausages. I like how their Pasta and salad on the menu come in 2 service sizes. This gives you the option to order both and still be able to finish both dishes. I found the small sized pastas rather petit though - probably 6 long strands of pasta and that was it.   Funghi Misti ($16.95) I really enjoyed the pizza! The pizza was filled with wild and field mushrooms, parmigano, and  smoked mozzarella. It was a white creamy sauce instead of the typical tomato pizza sauce. It reminded me of a creamy funghi pasta I've had before, expect in a pizza. Make sure you eat the pizza hot though, didn't taste as good when it got cold."}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews before coming here, else I wouldn't have waited for a table. The pizza was good, as well as the fries and kids Spaghetti and meat balls. The spicy sausage pasta and prawn linguini were both bad, noodles undercooked in both instances 3/4 raw. Anyways maybe they will taste better microwaved tomorrow. The kids cheesy pasta was also very bland, the garlic bread was meh, and the tiramisu was blah...$160 later we were wondering, where should we go to eat now to fill our stomachs?"}
{"text":"We were there for dinner earlier. Finally decent food in the north end. We had the bolognese which was good. Super salad was soggy and bruschetta (both crab and mushroom) were salty. Chardonnay was good. Will return and try different items."}
{"text":"Went to jamies for a ex-worker dinner. Shout out to my elite friend Barbara who recommended.  The atmosphere was pretty good, nice for a group to sit and chat, and seemed nice to go as couple. The layout was pretty nice, and the bar seemed like a place I would like to sit and enjoy a beer with friends. The second floor had an unused section, looked cool since if you had a group up there, looking down had an awesome view.   Had the calamari, and it though the calamari itself was standard, the sauce they used was yummy. I think it had a pepper/cajun seasoning to it. I had the Jamies Burger and it was good.    Cost wise, it was okay. A tiny bit more than what I would say fair, but I kinda expected that with the brand name. Definitely recommend if you are in the area or want to schedule a group event."}
{"text":"Excited that there was now a new place to dine in Yorkdale, my friend and I headed here for lunch. It wasn't too busy yet surprisingly. The upstairs seating area however was pretty cramped. We made our orders and proceeded to wait. Our whole experience there took about two and a half hours for an appetizer and our two entrees. It was brutal. The caprese salad came out and was a bit small for a large plate, and it also lacked balsamic. The entrees took forever and when it came it was just mediocre. The crab spaghetti I got was extremely salty. The server offered to bring the manager to speak to us about our experience but to be honest, we were there for so long already we just wanted to leave. I'm sure they're still working out the kinks of this new establishment but I think I'll wait a while before I return."}
{"text":"We have a wonderful experience in this restaurant. The waiters there explain every course in details. And they serve you so well. Everyone can have a try there, I am sure you will have a nice experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try Jamie Oliver restaurant, buy I have to admit that I was disappointed. The restaurant is really nice and clean. The service was really strange the waiter who served us was so ignorant he would suggest what is the common dish and we should try, we ask questions and he wouldn't give an answer, he leaves and comes back after a while to take an order. We order the crispy squid as an appetizer and it was so chewy we couldn't eat when we complained his reaction was like we are facing it. And he said this is a first time,yet he replaced the dish for us, which was tasting much better. But I have to admit that the main course ws very good I ored the fresh Clams pasta and it is so tasty. Anyway,  I did expect it to be a different experience."}
{"text":"Located in Yorkdake Mall, Jamie's offers a good balance of quality food, intimate atmosphere, and superb service. Their pasta is reasonably priced with some unique selections. However, their pizza is nothing beyond average."}
{"text":"Awful food.  Extremely overpriced. Just make your own pasta at home.  Not worth the money. Service was painfully  slow. Never again"}
{"text":"I have been to Jamie's many times since its opening but find the food had changed tremendously. Usually, I order the Funghi mushroom pizza but today it just didn't taste the same and we had to send it back because the bottom was so soggy. In addition, the calamari was nothing special which was also not crispy and they discounted their best dessert, the lemon merengue. Very disappointed that their food has changed so much - perhaps due to the constant change in cooks."}
{"text":"A great restaurant, great atmosphere and most importantly great food, but unfortunately service could use some improvement. This is my fourth visit to this restaurant and service is always on the slow side regardless on how busy the restaurant is. The open line concept is definitely a trend and a plus to a restaurant, but it's also a major disadvantage if your staff isn't professional. I have just spotted an inappropriate act between two of the line cooks, which is definitely unacceptable at any restaurant standards. The food on the other hand is amazing, superfood salad is my usual pick, along with their pizza, calamari and assorted apps.  Too bad the staff isn't good or professional enough!   Update: I gave this restaurant another chance today since I love the food, and I was at Yorkdale mall already..and I thought they should've improved their staff by now! Unfortunately I was very wrong, the level of customer service has gone down, too bad since the food tastes so good and 'main' portions are pretty big, But service!! Comeone! Food takes long to arrive, staff isn't that friendly or professional, the four or five ladies we dealt with were all on the younger side of age, no experience what so ever.  No wifi at the restaurant, first of all, WHO does not have wifi in 2017?! We had a birthday on the table, one of the group asked the staff for a birthday desert or cake, And the answer was:  \" buy a dessert item from the menu, and we'll put a candle on it \" !!! Top class customer service!!   Sorry Jamie's, never coming back here"}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit Jamie's Italian with my girlfriend but the experience was far from what we had anticipated. It's Jamie Oliver's restaurant! Can't blame us right?  We both had pasta.  My girlfriend had the special. I can't recall the name but it was some sort of bolognese dish in marinara sauce. I'm certain it had chorizo and that's why she ordered it.  It was so bland without any flavour whatsoever so we really needed to work on it once it arrived. We spiced it up by asking for some chilli in oil to give it some life, added some salt, requested a little more parmesan and grated a fair bit of pepper. At this point it was eatable.  Important: Our server was great and she could tell that my girlfriend and I weren't too happy with the food and she kind of shared that look of understanding. I don't know why but I really appreciated that. You know... someone felt our pain. She was super attentive, friendly and on top of her game.  Back to the food.  In order for us to tie it all in, we needed to order some sort of garlic bread and that was actually quite nice. I guess it's hard to go wrong with garlic bread right?  I had the seafood spaghetti with squid and muscles. Couldn't eat it all of it but tried. The spaghetti was literally clumped together and the seafood was extremely dry. They cooked it silly.  Our server tried to steer me towards another seafood pasta selection and I should have listened.  In most scenarios, we would have sent back the food and/or at least addressed the issue(s) but I think we were entertained by how bad it was. It was kind of funny and we spent the hour joking around about the food.  In addition to the garlic bread, my girlfriend's caesar was pretty decent. I had ordered an old fashioned and that didn't work out too well either.  So don't walk the other way, run or if you want to have fun and just have your mind blown by how terrible Jamie Oliver's restaurant is, go in with no expectations."}
{"text":"Went here with two of my friends on recommendation from one of them, who is a frequent customer. Even she was disappointed, deeming our visit \"the worst experience she has had there.\"   We had the two course lunch meal. The appetizers were quite good; we had the bruschetta, soup of the day, and carpaccio. The main course was adequate, so adequate I cannot accurately recall what we had (the bolognese, salad and linguine I believe?)  The food looked nice enough on camera but tasted mediocre at best. Definitely not worth the price. The waitress at our table was apathetic, edging on passive-aggressive.   Overall, I have three words: mediocre, unimpressive, indifferent."}
{"text":"Heard the chef was outstanding so we came here to give it a try. But was a little disappointed by the food and the slow service. Italian food but the pasta was even worse than the ones I made. The interior design was very nice."}
{"text":"This review is based on my Summerlicious 2017 Lunch ($18) experience.  I had been to Jamie's Italian a few times while I was cruising on Royal Caribbean Cruises. The experience always been good as the food served in the \"paid\" specialty dinning venue usually better than the main dining room.   I do love the location of Jamie's inside Yorkdale. The interior decor is well appointed especially the open area at the bar.   Summerlicious Lunch Menu at $18 is decent.   Starter: Crab Arancini - nice presentation, love the pickled fennel! The rice ball was just ok Main: Spicy Sausage Casarecce - a little weak as a main, rapini and herby breadcrumbs were nice addition for taste and texture Desserts: Orange Blossom Polenta Cake - tasty and refreshing! Creme fraiche gave it that rich creamy taste  Ginger Mojoito ($4.95) the ginger beer is spicy! But I love that! I would come back for the half price Mojoito Thursday to try out the real deal next time!  Service was fast though a little impersonal. My water glass was constantly topped up.   Good option if you want to have something to eat or chill with your girlfriends while shopping at Yorkdale. I personally won't make a special trip coming here since the parking is just CRAZY!"}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss. Have been here twice and generally the pasta was great. Service is ok and no complimentary bread at an Italian pasta joint...  With 2 appetizers, 2 pastas and 2 drinks we were well above $100. Would definitely go again but will stick to just the pasta!"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced but delicious. It is a very cool themed restaurant and has a very cool vibe going on. The classic meat plank was very good price for what you got.  You get alot of meats and cheeses and sauces on the board for only $12/person. I really enjoyed how the pastas came in different sizes, which lets you cater your meal to how hungry you are"}
{"text":"A very subpar experience.  Pizza dough was like cardboard, tomato sauce was very sweet.  Ingredients were anything but fresh.  Service was very spotty - took 20+ minutes for them to bring the bill after we asked for it.  There are much better italian restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"So disappointing! FOH was slow to begin with, the service was slow. We ordered the garlic bread and proscuitto to start, it came and it was flat bread drenched in oil, and rosemary all over it. The proscuitto was dry,  and if it was fresh then it shouldn't be hardening.  My gnocchi was flavourless and bland.  I've had better gnocchi elsewhere.  My friends steak was unfulfilling,  she asked for medium well and when she cut into it ti her surprise it's to medium rare, her coleslaw was shredded carrots in lemon juice. We complained to the manager and his management of dissatisfaction was handled so poorly, he advised the chef was gonig to taste our garlic bread and proscuitto.  But how about offering something else or advise it was coming off our bill.  Not coming back here. The food is so mediocre, I've had amazing Italian food elsewhere in the city. By the time we left our heads hurt."}
{"text":"All round a great place to eat. Clean, welcoming and the decor is very cute. The appetisers were amazing, calamari was crispy and the arancini had the best sauce. The mains we had were less impressive. The pappardelle with meatballs was a little bland and my spaghetti with crab was also a on the bland side although quite salty but overall they were okay, not bad but not amazing. I would definitely return but would probably just order a bunch of apps."}
{"text":"Celebrated a friend's birthday lunch here and we were amazed at the interior renovation from a TD bank. I loved it and it reminded me of the distillery district in Toronto. There's an area where they make their own pasta.  Also, an area where the servers prep the bread basket which is not free. We sat near the open kitchen surrounded by different settings of tables and decor.  Once you enter, the bar area is very bright since it's two level and there are no curtains. Hostesses and greeters were in navy blue shirt and jeans uniform which actually looked modern and crisp. No need to be sexist. The waiters wore white shirts with an apron.   Happy:  We tried crispy squid as an appetizer which was recommended. It had a nice crunch and I loved the red chilies that came with it. A bit more of the squid would have been nice for the price of $11. I ordered a small portion of their famous prawn linguine pasta which I love the tomato sauce and the arugula on top. However, I was disappointed that the prawns were sliced up to be in smaller size (no tails) and I only got about 4 pieces. It's their famous/known dish from Jamie Oliver, but it could have used some more meat. However, the pasta was chewy and I liked the texture of it in my mouth.   My friends both liked their dish as they ordered larger portion. One pasta dish was the rabbit one, and the other one was a bolognese tomato sauce with it.   Not happy:  Whatever I mentioned above about my own pasta dish.   Verdict:  I would definitely go back and try their own dishes. Due to their atmosphere, I would love to go there once I'm done shopping at Yorkdale.  The bonus part is that the washroom is clean and modernized. It's cool looking with bee-tile on the walls. Upstairs, there is a small seating area where you can look down to the restaurant and to the parking lot. Pretty cool view.   Our waiter was attentive and he was pretty good looking too!! =)"}
{"text":"Maybe I went in with a little too much hype but I'm giving this a 3-star for it being good, but err not great as I was expecting (again, I probably went in expecting a bit more).  Dishes ordered include: Pork and fennel meat balls, Italian 'hot' pizza (that's the one with the schiacciata), and the Porcini fettuccini.  The pork and fennel meatballs were good and i'd order them again. Pizza was just okay and the fettuccini was decent. I'm more into the cream based pastas so this was a food choice for me... i don't think there are any other cream based pastas on the menu. I'd recommend the Porcini (mushroom) fettuccini, if not, then I'd go with the prawn linguine as another solid option on the pasta menu.  Overall the service was great and the ambiance was very nice. The place is well decorated. I'd like to see them refine their menu a bit to justify their prices. No offense to Jamie, he's a great guy... but I am reviewing the restaurant.  Anyway, MAKE A RESERVATION. Opentable is available for this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was good, but if the service could match the food it would have been that much better.  - Server didn't greet us until I actually asked where our server was. - Smiled once when he greeted us but otherwise when taking our order didn't smile or make us feel welcome. - Never checked up to ask how the food was despite the fact that he DID NOT serve us our food. - Hovered over me while I was paying, made me feel pressured to tip more than I would have because of the bad service.  all in all, food was pretty good but I definitely feel the service makes up 50% of the experience at the restaurant. This guys needs more training on how to create a better customer experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing italian food restaurant! The pizzas and pasta are very good but I wish they were bigger. A little bit pricy for the size of the dishes but food is very tasty anyways."}
{"text":"\"Overpriced\", \"Meh\", \"Really?\".   Trust me you've had better Italian food.  This place is really overrated and is extremely packed on a weekend evening.  The flavors were just okay and one of the dishes were extremely salty.  Sodium levels to the absolute roof. I'm definitely no expert on Italian cuisine but for the price, expectation, and so-called in-house pasta ... it was a letdown.  The only thing this place has going is the atmosphere as it's really chill and with good service.  For the price, you can do better and I suggest walking around the mall to find another sit-down restaurant that'll suffice your appetite for a good night out."}
{"text":"Superfood salad is super! Best salad I've ever had at a restaurant. This place is not a true five star restaurant but in competition amongst O&B, Joey's etc... the quality is much better. Friendly staff too. Husband had crab spaghetti which he enjoyed very much. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first time here. The service was great but food was okay. My boyfriend and I both took a bite of our pastas (he had the special and I had porcini fettuccine with shrimp), I asked him how it was and he said it's good but.. and we both said SALTY! Nice looking place on the inside with a friendly environment. I also think that the pastas should be served with a piece of garlic bread. Paying 20+ dollars for pasta deserves some garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Service at 5:30pm was poor. 3 hostesses tryingto figure out a half empty place where to seat you. Server Jonathan was rude... first and probably last time here  The food was only mediocre. All pasta, lack of bolagnese sauce. Arancini was plain and Tiramisu was too citrusy for an \"italian\" restaurant. I wanted the authentic taste.   Overall, better off at Terroni's or Gusto, or even pickelbarrel. Just not worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is rustic, simple and classic. Well done but not exceptional.   Go in expecting classic italian ingredients and a warm lively atmosphere. Definitely not as good as Terroni's but worth a visit. One thing that is kinda inconvenient is that bathroom are all located on the second level. After a long day of shopping last thing I wanted to do was walk up the stairs but hey, good way to burn off some calories.   My friend and I enjoyed the funghi bruschetta - crispy smokey and delicious. We also liked the Italian peppers and put it on our margherita pizza.   I would come back again because it's familiar and cozy. Too bad they don't do brunch!"}
{"text":"Figured we would give this place a second try since the first attempt was shortly after it opened and we weren't very impressed the first time around.  Big mistake.  Although we were seated relatively quickly, the waitress brought us water, mentioned the specials and didn't return for some time.  When she finally did come by to take our order, she wasn't even apologetic.  Two of us ordered the seafood stew special.  It was supposed to be comprised of \"crispy polenta, sea bass, salmon trout and prawns in a tomato broth\".  There was no sea bass, 2 very small shrimp, three small pieces of salmon trout a ton of fried and soggy polenta and no broth.  We sent it back and after 15 minutes received the same dish with some tomato sauce on the bottom.  Although tasty, it was certainly not worth the $28.95 price tag especially since it was 50% polenta.  My husband had the avocado and roasted carrot salad with the addition of chicken.  Even with the entree size portion and added chicken breast, it was so small he was starving which was sad since the dish was $23!  Now that we've given Jamie's Italian two tries and both were a disappointment, we will not be returning.  The value is just not there and the food is subpar.  I highly doubt Jamie is running the show or knows much about the quality of the food being served in an establishment with his name attached.    Hopefully someone will read some of the poor reviews on this restaurant and revamp the menu and service.  Otherwise, I give it about a year until it closes its doors forever.  From now on, we will stick to Joey.  Great food, great service, great prices, great value, great experience."}
{"text":"I tried the restaurant for the first time for lunch with a group of friends early on a Wednesday morning.  There was no wait and the server was very eloquent in rattling off the daily specials. The food was pretty good; probably the pasta was better than the pizza. Portions were on the small side but no unreasonable for a light eater. There was a young boy at the next table and his meal was tiny, probably the children's menu is meant for really small children.  Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"Most expensive Toast I've ever bought!  Bought the meatball bruschetta think the appetizer would be a good size.  I wish I had taken a picture!  It was as literally a small piece of bread with 4 meatballs!  What a joke!  Tasted sub par too.    Main was crab spaghetti, super salty almost no crab.  Just wasted $100 bucks.  Going to go get a Big Mac now, at least I'll get something to eat that's not crap (yes that's how crappy Jamie olivers is)"}
{"text":"I've been two times now and every time I've gone I've been delighted with what I've received. The first time I went I got the pizza special. It was prosciutto cotto with arugula and thinly sliced lemons and asiago cheese - amazing. My girlfriend got the prawn pasta, as promised it was fresh and delicious. On the second run we got fried squid, so good and perfectly cooked. And fresh crab bruschetta with fennel marinated in lemon. I got the special again - rabbit stuffed ravioli in a rich tomato and porcini mushroom sauce it was absolutely perfect. The restaurant itself has a casual rustic feel to it and to be honest for being in Yorkdale the prices are very reasonable. The waitress brought us to the pasta making station to show us where it is made and was very helpful with recommendations. Last but not least the drinks are very refreshing. I recommend the home made lemon aid with mint, slightly tart not overly sweet - I really enjoyed it.  Overall I had an amazing time at Jamie's and will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my mum for lunch on a sunny afternoon and we enjoyed it. The staff was knowledgeable and timely. The noise level was a little loud but the atmosphere was nice. The food was tasty and proportionate! Great place to have a nice sit down meal"}
{"text":"Food was so tasty! The deal they had for lunch was great value and the portion sizes were perfect! The server was also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Jamie's Italian a few times since it opened and I was pleasantly surprised when I went recently for lunch again. Even on a Monday, the restaurant was full of diners due to the fact that it is right at Yorkdale. My brother and I ordered off the super lunch menu which includes an appetizer and main of choice for $19.99 (only available from Mon to Fri)  We ordered the roasted squash and ricotta bruschetta and arugula salad to share as appetizers. The bruschetta was a favourite among us as the sweet roasted squash, lemony ricotta, seasonal greens & aged balsamic worked beautifully together on top of a crispy and crunchy slice of toasted bread. The arugula salad with Bella Lodi & aged balsamic was refreshing and simple.   For the main courses we ordered the spaghetti carbonara (sweet tender leeks with golden smoky pancetta, cracked black pepper & Parmigiano Reggiano) and the porcini fettuccine (with wild & field mushrooms, mascarpone, garlic, white wine, lemony gremolata, Parmigiano Reggiano & pangrattato). Both pasta dishes were flavourful and delicious. Portions were good for lunch and we were but full afterwards.  Service at Jamie's Italian is what you would expect from a chain restaurant. I would come back for more only if I am at Yorkdale"}
{"text":"Average. That is the best and the worst you can say about this kitchen. If this is what they consider authentic Italian then Jamie get back in your VW van and head back to Italy.  Let's start at the beginning...  Long weekend, family in town and wanted a dinner out on a Sunday. Called at 1 pm to get a reservation after seeing on opentable no availability at desired time of 6 pm (senior in tow). The press one to make a reservation seems a bit old school, but fine maybe they have so much call traffic they need this system. Or maybe they have not enough or poorly trained staff. More insights on this later.   Left message as instructed for reso. No call back after two hours so called again and got a live body. Live body says no availability at six but come at five thirty because we're still accepting walk ins. Huh?  So arrived at designated time and saw a resto about two thirds full and I'm not counting the upstairs that was empty. Drink at the bar and spoke to bar mgr who said long weekend, assumed less traffic so less staff hence no upper floor. Okay, it's a business. But the downstairs had twos, fours, and six tops open. And I mean many. Fine.  We were seated before we got our martinis. Took a good 10 min to make the martini. Well done I must say, but interns galore from Italy, local staff who seemed capable but slow made for a comical scene. No problem though just seemed like we were in a training video.   Good wait staff; friendly, energetic, etc.  ordered the cured meat platter, artisan bread, and meatballs as a pre. Cured meat is a (no other way to say it so here it is) a rip off. 12 bucks per person. We ordered for two which gave us two pieces of each cold cut. Decent but not revelatory. The cold cuts I get every Sunday at Fortinos are as good. Nothing to see here, move along.  Mains. Two of the famous prawns and linguine. Tasteless. Prawns (no shells?) were chewy and maybe touched a grill briefly. Doubt it though. We told waitress that our meal was bland and she offered more sauce (actually we suggested). Extra sauce arrived in just short of 10 minutes. Was better tasting than original but could not elevate the dish. If you came home from work and had some bottled no name sauce, frozen shrimp, and linguine (no. 12 if there is such a thing? So thick it dominated) and whipped it together with the help of a microwave this is your dish. Honestly the acclaim that is famous begs for evidence. Where is this famous? With whom is this famous? It simply cannot be true because this is a terrible $20 dish. Four bucks half portion at a strip mall store front okay. But not at Canada's most successful mall.   Offered a dessert platter as a comp. brownie was decadent and delicious. Cake was average.   Overall, seemed like a silly reso game. Just didn't seem honest. Might be wrong but that is the vibe. Ambience is a mall. Food is over priced, underwhelming. This is Italian? Not according to our Italian born guests. Pizza Hut maybe. But more like duping Americans in the fly over states. But this isn't America; it's Canada and the heart of Italian Canadian."}
{"text":"I'm here with my team having a big lunch. I asked for a refill on my 7up and was told that they don't offer free refills. Are you kidding me. Needless to say, we will not be back.  I had a freaking pizza for God sake. The the 7up was $3."}
{"text":"I went to Jamie Oliver's at Yorkdale Mall on Saturday with a group of 8. This place is ideal for big groups and very child friendly. It has a very rustic feel to it and if you know anything about Jamie Oliver, you can totally tell it has his touch in the decor and the food. This place is a level above your franchise restaurant but casual enough to come with your family to have a nice simple meal. And it won't make any more of a dent in your wallet than a visit to Joey's or Milestones.  The food here is really good and flavourful and the prices are definitely reasonable. We had the crunchy Italian nachos to start which are delicious and a unique creative take on the original nachos (just Italian styles). My sister in law had the Meatball Pappardelle and it was really nice. I ordered the Jamie's Italian burger and MAN was it a nice burger. The patty was a nice thick juicy flavourful piece of meat and the buns were perfection. I didn't pay too much attention to everything else in the middle because I literally scarfed down the burger within minutes. My cousin's all ordered a variety of pizzas and they all enjoyed them quite a bit. To sum up, a GREAT place to eat considering it is in a mall and you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience. I actually went here on a date with a girl and it didn't go so hot, so part of my resentment is due to that. But I digress. I had the Margherita pizza paired with...idk, some red wine. The pizza was fine but nothing too special. For dessert we had a dark chocolate ice cream I think? (you can really tell the impact this place had on me haha) Ambience was fine but nothing too special. The service was decent I guess. And overall it was too expensive. Bah. You know what? Jamie Oliver is a hack. He thinks he's like this cool, hip version of Gordon Ramsay but he's...bollocks. Bam! Haha. Take that Jamie. Wait...hold on, that might be someone else's phrase."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner. For antipasta had the Italian nachos and meat platter, and for my main had the turkey milanese+skinny spicy fries with a bottle of big wheel which all came out to $50+tip.  Nachos: 6/10 it was a nice light snack. I expected more for $10. It was about 10 deep fried ravioli shells with sprinkled cheese on top. The dip was a rich tomato paste with a small kick.  Meat tasting platter: 5/10 subpar items. Id rather get even smaller quantities and better quality items than what I got which tasted like came from Loblaws  Turkey milanese: 6/10 It was decent.. I've never had it before but in terms of execution: the breaded coating was a bit soggy and not crispy, probably from the supposed fontina cheese which was more like tasteless goop. I was also looking for the procuitto that was supposed stuffed in this milanese but I could not find. The turkey meat was white breast meat, aka bland. Especially since it wasn't really seasoned. The free range eggs and truffle/truffle oil was the only thing that gave this dish any semblance of flavour.  Skinny spicy fries: 0/10 they look like McDonald's fries but they were mushy, flavourless and not spicy. The waitress warned they were pretty spicy.. I think they used bell peppers to make the spicy seasoning for this.  All in all super expensive and not worth. If like Jack Astor's/Moxie's is a 3-3.5/5 this place is definitely a 2"}
