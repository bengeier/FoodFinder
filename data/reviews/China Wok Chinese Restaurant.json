{"text":"Very good.  A typical buffet. Get there when they are busy for the freshly prepared dishes.   Not the same as Imperial Gardens on University Ave as in the special spices.
Still a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I USED to rave about this place and refer people, BUT the place changed hands...
My old favorite dish was the jumbo shrimp & veggies. That dish, B4 CHANGEOVER were ABOUT 16-20 in quantity, 2.5-3\" in diameter and clean, the veggies were fresh, it was pretty darn good and worth it.
AFTER CHANGEOVER, I ordered the same dish, the shrimp were ABOUT 1 dozen in quantity, maybe 1.5\" in diameter and dirty, veins left in, veggies overcooked, not so good... at a much later date, I was craving Chinese food, decided to give it another shot, only to be so disappointed and come to the sad conclusion of NEVER AGAIN.
For Chinese food cravings, nearby in Deforest there's a Chang Xiang in the strip mall next to Pick&Save. Tiny dining area, mostly takeout. ...NOW I'm craving Chinese food again! I will order THERE and leave an updated review on that place sometime soon!"}
{"text":"This is my, as well as many of my friends', absolute favorite chinese buffet anywhere we've been; the food is always delicious and fresh and the service has *never* been bad in the over 10 years I've been eating here.  A great local, family-owned business that I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our family's favorite carry out dinner. Crab Rangoon is my wife's favorite. I love the spicy wontons in sesame sauce and the Kung Pao pork. The garlic chicken is also delicious. I can't comment on the buffet since we always carry out."}
{"text":"Excellent carry out-always fresh and hot. I appreciate the reusable carry out containers. Family has tried the buffet and gives great reviews."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here about once a month. 

My particular favorites are the Lo Mein noodles topped with black pepper chicken or the seafood delight. Sometimes black pepper chicken has too much black pepper, but I always like it when I eat here.

The steamed dumplings are pretty good. Sometimes they have salt & pepper shrimp which is very good but it isn' a selection at lunch all the time. The stuffed mushrooms are a favorite of mine too. 

Chinese buffets can be an adventure. Often the food is too sweet or too salty for my taste, but I like the China Wok in Waunakee. Usually they are quite busy for lunch, which means the food is replenished often, which is a good thing. Despite the fact that they are often quite busy, I don't think I've ever had to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"Avoid the buffet. Stuff sitting out a long time lacks the freshness and has been poked at by too many people.
This is just a generic american style chinese/cantonese type semi-fast food restaurant. Ordering off the menu provides serviceable but uninspired food. You probably won't find too many Chinese people eating there."}
{"text":"We have gotten food here several times - not because the food is spectacular, but we love Chinese and it's the only option in Waunakee.

We got food on Sunday and I kept finding little black flecks throughout my beef lo mein. It appeared to be pieces of the nonstick coating from a skillet.  I was pretty grossed out, but so hungry that I just picked them out.  That's when I found a small shard of metal.  

Let's just say we will not be returning to China Wok."}
{"text":"Best crabrangoon in the world.  Excellent mushroom chicken and 7 flavor chicken.  Other stuff is good too.

Not sure what the people with low-star reviews are expecting.  For low-cost american style asian food, this is the absolute best.  You want a $50 a plate meal, go someplace else and don't complain about this."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner, on a personal recommendation. I'm giving it two and a half stars but will try to give it a shot during lunchtime. For those familiar with the buffet scene in Dane County, eating here made me nostalgic for Taste of Asia buffet on E. Washington that closed down several years ago. Now that was a buffet. Oysy comes close, but maybe this review isn't the space for me to dwell on other restaurants' quality. 

The mussels with creamy white sauce on it was ok, so was the battered shrimp. Eggs food young was so so.  I liked the chow mein. The egg drop soup was especially yellow.  I didn't eat at the dessert aisle, by then I was just stuffed.  

The wait staff was friendly and so was the youngish looking kid behind the cashier. My fortune cookie was meaningful, so I'll take with me a good memory and the antacid."}
{"text":"Good, reliable Chinese food. I usually order take-out. Nice Chinese family runs the business, but not everyone who answers the phone is a fluent English speaker. No big deal; just order by menu number. Love the General Tso's chicken (mild), the special combination sweet and sour chicken, and the crab fried rice."}
{"text":"Great place. 
Love the new meatballs. 
Very good food   
Good service 
Can't beat the price. 
Big variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped there last night after driving by many times in the past to get some food to go.  Not the best Chinese food I have ever had but it was pretty good!

Seemed to be well organized considering the amount of carry out orders that were picked up while I was there.

Decor isn't the best... wall decor lights not plugged in, burned out light bulbs...yet the place was brightly lit.  

Friendly but I am not a fan of staff wearing jeans at any restaurant but that is just my opinion as is all of this.

Over all I will be stopping back to try many other things on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Since China Wok opened many years ago, I had heard mixed feedback about the food quality from friends and family. Recently, I placed a carryout order and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. When I arrived 35 minutes later, I was informed that my order was not ready and I needed to wait a few minutes. I ended up waiting 30 more minutes. I also was unable to understand the accent of the lady at the counter. Once I returned home, already not in the greatest mood, I first tried the fried rice, which unfortunately was chock full of onions. The orange chicken I ordered with it didn't really taste like orange, and there were a few overripe orange slices on top that ended up worsening the flavor. I did like the variety of menu options. I think I'll stick with King Wok in Lodi as my go-to place."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the buffet many times. Decent enough selection and my kids love it. Good soups. Have not had good experiences with carryout - with large flabby pieces of chicken and bland sauces that vary little whatever you order, fried rice is soggy and pale (tho seems fine on the buffet).. Spicy orders never are. They do not deliver. Will stick with the buffet!"}
{"text":"Stay clear of the buffet. We stopped for lunch and almost everything was cold and rubbery. We also ordered the wonton soup which was salty and we ordered a shrimp dish and some of the shrimps were mushy and others were cooked normal. We would not go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was physically there to order food for carry out. Food was given to her got back to her place to find out the order was wrong. Called to tell them the order was wrong which they agreed they were wrong. They wouldnt deliver the order we had to go to get it...Fine, whatever. I went to get the correct order to which when I got there they told me I needed to bring back the old food. To which I highly disagreed. There was no reason they couldn't just give me the food. It was their mistake to begin with, she was physically there and the only one there, and they gave us the wrong food. Yet still I had to bring back the incorrect order. I sat and argued with them for 5 minutes about how it was their mistake, we had been there twice and still didn't have the problem resolved. Came, picked up the food and went back for a refund. There is no reason it should have resorted to that. They can't sell the food, can't bring it back to the kitchen for sanitary reasons(unless super shady and to which a health inspector would shut them down). Didn't even taste the food but don't need to after the way I and my girlfriend were treated"}
{"text":"The buffet is nothing to write home about overall, but the steamed dumplings are my favorite anywhere. The fact that they have Sriracha at every table in which to dip the dumplings is a plus. The black pepper chicken is solid, although not quite as good as that found at the China Wok in Middleton, which is run by the owner's brother. I also like any of the \"special\" dishes, such as the special pork, and the BBQ chicken is tasty. Historically my main complaint is that their General Tso's chicken is terrible - probably the worst cuts of chicken after preparing the other dishes. Typically grisly and overcooked. Normally that is my favorite dish at most places, but not here.

Service is friendly, and the owner tries to make regulars feel like welcome friends. In short, it's a reasonably priced standard Chinese Buffet. It's one of your better lunch options if you happen to be in Waunakee."}
{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised Takeout
For some reason, we were hesitant to grab takeout from here...we typically go to the Chinese place on N. Sherman. But we were more than happy. Everything tasted great and we didn't get the digestive doomsday that you roll the dice in getting when you try a new Chinese place. 

The Mongolian beef was very peppery but good. We also got the hot and sour soup, Kung Pao chicken, crab rangoon, and they threw in those sweet donuts since we were already $30 deep at that point. 

Overall we're happy with China Wok and we're glad to have it nearby. My only gripe is they have a website but no menu on it"}
