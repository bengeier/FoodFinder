{"text":"I've only gotten take out from this place a couple times, but the pizza was off-the-wall delicious. I personally suggest the Greek Pizza or the deluxe. My girlfriend loves the garlic knots. Way better than any crappy Pizza chain in the area. A little pricey but it's worth it"}
{"text":"I have been to empire pizza a few times they have great service. There food is all good. They are pretty fast too the reason they only receive 3 stars is the restaurant Is split into 2 sides.  A bar side and   A family side. It gets really loud on the family side from all the music being played on the bar side. I have started doing carry out"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Takeout was fast and easy and the personal pizzas are the perfect size! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The girls taking orders decided to play a game where they acted like they couldn't hear us talking on either my phone or my girlfriend's phone.  After four calls, one where we were immediately put on hold for 5 minutes, we gave up.  This after a long day of moving we just weren't in the mood to be toyed with.  I don't think we'll be ordering from Empire again."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon- great service when the bar is staffed properly :) the Balsamic glazed pizza is THE BOMB!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they change the channel without regard to who's watching what......clueless"}
{"text":"I do not often give bad reviews, those have to be really earned. Today and the last couple visits have earned every word of this review. The experience starts with the hostess. The same hostess we had on our last visit. She did not say a single word on either visit. No hello, no welcome to Empire, no how many in your party, no good bye no anything. She didn't lead us to a table, hand us a menu or provide any value. Well there is the constant sour look on her face that our presence is a huge bother to her.   So we take a high top in the bar area. Note it is about 2:30pm and not busy. We wait and wait and wait. Making eye contact with everyone we can that works there only to have them look away. Then the waitress comes to the table next to ours. After taking their order she simply left even after seeing us there. All of this is 10 minutes with no menu, no water, no one giving a crap.   We got up, I asked the waitress who the manager was she asked where we were sitting. I told her the table she just looked at and walked away. She pointed out the manager who had previously  looked at us  and simply walked by. Seriously no one in the dining staff cares at all about the customer.   We normally go here 2 or 3 times a month as the cheese steak is that good but doubtful we will be back. Service has always been poor now it just down right stinks. Note the post above describes today but is similar to our last 2 outings there. Last time we got service but watched another table walk out as they couldn't get anyone on staff to acknowledge they were alive."}
{"text":"To start off, my family and I have been to this location several times. Service is always sub par, but we are pretty forgiving because my husband and I work in the restaurant industry.  We understand that unexpected things can come up and not every server can be on point all of the time.  Our visit this evening, which will be our absolute last to this location, was beyond terrible.  The hostess had an attitude as if she hated that she was even there, which is a normal occurrence here.  She sat us in the loud bar area with our two young children.  Irritating, but I could see past that.  Our waitress, Brittany, took our drink order (4 waters) and returned with them 5 minutes later.  We then ordered a Sicilian Margherita pizza and some garlic cheese bread.  Simple. Someone else brought out our garlic cheese bread, which we ate unhappily with the lack of silverware, napkins, and plates.  By this time, my husband's water and my water were empty and sitting at the edge of the table, clearly visible.  Brittany didn't return until she dropped off our pizza which was actually a 16\" Margherita.  She conveniently picked up one of our empty water cups to take our empty appetizer plate, then set the empty cup back down.  She said, \"I'll be right back with plates.\"  Well, guess what? Those plates never came, nor did napkins or silverware. After quite a long time, I got up, walked to the back of the restaurant, and asked someone else for silverware, napkins, and plates.  She got me silverware (not to our surprise, one of the knives had some sort of sticker/paper crusted to it) and I grabbed my own napkins and plates from their stock.  On my way back to our table, I see Brittany in the server station at the front of the restaurant, ON. HER. PHONE.  Still, she hadn't come by our table since dropping off our pizza.  My daughter needed to use the restroom, so I took her.  We came back and my husband reported that Brittany STILL had not been back to our table.  Wow. She finally stopped back by and quickly asked if we were doing okay, then moved to her next table.  Still, no water or even the promise to get more.  She smoothly came behind me and dropped the check at the table, saying nothing. I have NEVER left a server without a tip, but I did tonight.  We left a note for Brittany as well saying we obviously were not a priority to her and that she had missed almost every step of service.  She never even returned to the table to pick up our check. Good thing we had exact change. On the way out, my husband asked the hostess if they were down a server or two and she said, \"No.\" My husband responded with, \"Really? Our server was killing it, and I mean that in a bad way.\"  Her reply was, \"Well, have a great night.\"  Either she was totally oblivious to what he was saying or she was standing up for the atrocious service we received. I wish I could say we were on Candid Camera, but unfortunately, this was real."}
{"text":"Love this place - Best meatballs I have ever had. Nice atmosphere and great place to watch sports at the bar."}
{"text":"I will never order delivery here again! Rude person answered the phone, I think her name was Cameron. She had an attitude and asked for my credit card number multiple times, which I thought was quite odd. She also put in the wrong address, which delayed the order even longer. When I called back, she denied that she had took my order. Will not order empire again."}
{"text":"We had a coupon from a moving-in mailer for a free one topping  16\" pizza. Fine print read not valid on weekends. They would not honor this coupon on a FRIDAY night. They said the owners consider it a weekend. Needless to say, this restaurant will never earn our business and I will ensure others know about this negative experience."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  I'm waiting there for 40 minutes to pick-up a take-out order I had actually called in (in advance).  While waiting I see a server spill a plate of fires and o-rings onto the dirty dishes counter, then hurriedly sweep them back onto the plate and bring them to a waiting table.  Major code violation, and insanely foolish.  Notwithstanding this, the brat teens running this circus of a restaurant (zero adults to be seen) need a stern lesson in customer service & respect.  My willingness to return is as much a joke as the takeout wait times."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok but not hot, slow and unfriendly service with an attitude... Hostess looked like she was miserable. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I work two jobs throughout the week. After I got off work for my second job, I yelped a place to eat dinner after 11. I'm not sure who manages their hours on here, but they do not close at 2AM. They close as soon as they feel like they need to. They even have a bouncer? (He had a dark shirt that said security - at a pizza place?) Anyways, he will come to the door at 11:30pm and state \"sorry we are closed due to lack of customers\". This has happened twice."}
{"text":"We recently used Empire Pizza in Fort Mill to cater an event we hosted for the Chamber Of Commerce. The food was AMAZING!! Everyone in attendance raved over everything from the pizza to the pasta salads. Not only was the food delicious, but the service we received was beyond measurable. The food was set up on time and display was picture perfect.. We recommend them to everyone and we will definitely be using them again!  Gateway At Rock Hill Apartments"}
{"text":"Excellent specialty pizza! Thin crust with not too crunchy crust. There is a large variety of sauces and such, but the bruschetta is fantastic!! Super tasty and quick. A little pricey, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here. The pizza was great and the service was top notch. Amber was our server and could not have been more friendly and took the time to really interact with our 5 and 2 year old. The kids asked if we could go back, which we absolutely would do, if we didn't live 1,000 miles away."}
{"text":"Would have given it 2.5 stars if Yelp provided as an option. Pizza is generally pretty good, service hit or miss, and the \"Free WiFi\" non-existent. Good TV coverage for sports and generally a diverse crowd where the middle-class Fort Millians and Carolina yokels collide."}
{"text":"I and sick and I cant drive right now bc of the drugs the doctor gave me and I live alone. I wanted to order delivery and the lady was nice-ish on the phone but was kinda snobby as well. anyway I gave them my address waited for about 3 minutes for them to even let me know if they can deliver or not and they said I was almost 6 miles away and they only deliver 5 miles away.. well I was pissed and still hungry so hung up and checked how far away I really was...5.3 miles away... really..... that .3 is probably the road I live on and the is no stop signs or traffic...."}
{"text":"We liked the general vibe and the food at this place . We tried a couple of the burgers and also the raviolis they were both good ..we also had some wings ..will try there pizza next time !!"}
{"text":"I tried Empire for the first time on 4-17-15. I expected it to be a lot like Fuel Pizza...customers walking to a counter, ordering a slice of pre-baked pizza, etc., but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's an actual, normal restaurant.  I ordered two slices of pizza and added two toppings, which ended up being about $3.33 a slice. Normally, I'd say that's a lot, but the slices are so big that it makes up for it. One slice filled me up, and I usually have a voracious appetite. My boyfriend and I got garlic knots as an appetizer and, I must admit... I was a little disappointed. They reminded me of store-bought, bagged rolls with a little garlic slapped on them. Not bad, but not impressive either. Both the pizza and garlic knots were incredibly greasy, so I blotted them with a paper towel. Taste was great, though, and whatever cheese they use on the pizza is fantastic.  Our server was ok, she did her job, but she wasn't very enthusiastic or friendly. Who knows? Maybe it was a rough night.  Would I go back? Definitely. Is it awesome? No, but it tastes good and gets the job done.  EDIT: Went back last night (4-22-15) and ordered a side garden salad and a slice of pizza. The waitress got my salad dressing wrong, the salad was mostly big chunks of iceberg lettuce, and had hardly any toppings in it. My slice of pizza and my boyfriend's slices were cold. Seriously...it was like it had been sitting out for awhile. Our waitress had no personality...Not sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay. I much prefer the plain cheese over their other options. Salads and salad dressings are very good.   On three spaced-apart visits, service has been mediocre at best. We even had to send our pizza back on one occasion because it was completely wrong. Lunch visit and just ordering by the slice was impossibly slow!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out today after working in the area for over 6 months. The salad was pretty fresh with tons of crispy veggies. Also tried the make your own pasta. I preferred the marinara over the meat sauce. All in all decent lunch for the price."}
{"text":"Food just terrible.  Pizza dough had no flavor. Salad was just iceberg lettuce and tasteless dressing. Just horrible. Long wait and crowd on Friday night. Even went so far as to tell some friends I saw standing in line to go home and order dominos."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is consistently great! They have good specials. I have learned to ask for the wings extra saucy or they will be kinda dry but thats easy to address and if I forget upfront the servers have always been kind enough to bring more sauce out. The hot isn't crazy hot which I love. The garlic parm is delicious. The calzone here is my favorite but they really excel at the awesome ranch! They also sell a full cup of ranch to take home for only $3!! Overall this place is the place to go."}
{"text":"Got the chicken Caesar wrap and it was amazing. Bacon, croutons, basically a salad in a spinach wrap.  It was super busy, we went around 6, and service was a bit slow. 3-4 time we've been here, it's always good."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but good once our waitress arrived. Food was good and fresh and jukebox play was amazing!   KISS records on the wall!"}
{"text":"I'm back and forth on if I like this place or not.  I think I will settle on, if you are looking for sublime pizza, it's not the place.  However, if you are looking for good pizza and good deals in the Fort Mill, SC area, then this is a great destination."}
{"text":"Great place and friendly staff. Even though I have been here several time for lunch, I haven't had thier pizza, but those who has, says it's good.  I haven't made it passed thier salads and wings. The salad selection list is not large, but the amout they serve is very generous. The BLT and Chef is my go selection. The few times I had the wings, I wasn't disappointed.  The next time I go and not in the mood for salad/wing, I will give the pizza a try."}
{"text":"We always get their pizza to go and we love it. The atmosphere seems clean and the girls are all pleasant. Couldn't tell you much about their service but it's usually very busy when we come so that's a good thing, food is fresh!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed at the service I have received at this location. The first time I went, I had about ten orders I was picking up for my company. No one offered to help me out to my car when clearly I was having trouble and when I asked, they told me to come back and get the rest. Every time I call to place an order, I always get put on hold for a while and have to sometimes call back again. Today when I tried to place an order for delivery, the lady was being extremely rude with me to the point where I had to end the call. I never complain about customer service but felt like I had to after this happened. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We frequent all three empires regularly and are usually pleased with the food and the service.  Today, however, I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp and was served chicken instead. When I sent it back to be fixed they took the chicken off, put the shrimp on and returned the same salad to me...newly adorned with shrimp. This is unacceptable. With the prevalence of allergies in the world today, you cannot just take an item off of a salad and reserve the same salad. No, I am not allergic to chicken, however, I do not eat chicken because it makes me sick.  This may be a fluke, but I feel that it probably is not. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The Caesar salad and lobster ravioli is to die for! We will definitely be back!! My husband had the chicken parm sub, kids had pizza and pasta. We loved everything! We are new to the area and loved this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Waitress was completely oblivious to my wife and I. All I wanted was a simple sweet tea, what did I get, an unsweetened tea. Simple fix you might say, but when you don't see your server for 15-20 minutes then it becomes a challenge. Music for far too loud, couldn't hold a normal conversation with my wife and we were sitting side by side. Food was decent, but the service really threw me off."}
{"text":"Please don't eat here if you care about your safety. My husband was approached by an aggressive patron in the bathroom and was followed to his table afterwards . The waitress nor management escorted this individual out of the restaurant . While we were eating he continued to walk past our table and give threatening looks and remarks . Still management did nothing. When we were leaving the patron approached a male in our party in an aggressive manner again . The patron was not asked to leave even after this . We paid for our food and left . Please don't eat here"}
{"text":"My first outing here was a disaster & a disappointment so I waited a year and came back. This go round was better. The pizza is oily but it's the style they make. The garlic knots are a must as well as the desserts. If you have children get the personal pizzas and mix and match for fun. They have cool beers on draft and a decent wine selection."}
{"text":"If I had written this review a couple years ago, it would be raving 5 stars. Not anymore. Empire has dwindled down their quality so much to the point that I won't eat there anymore after my latest experience. I've eaten something (not always pizza) from here at least once a month since this location opened and at first I absolutely loved it. But, recently we ordered a 10in pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms and it just wasn't as good as it used to be, not to mention, they have decreased their topping quantity drastically over the years. We also had their \"new\" philly gyro, which is \"steak\", mushrooms, onions and peppers on a pita with 'cucumber sauce'. I wouldn't call this \"steak\". I'd call it \"steak-um\", because it's about as bad or maybe even less flavorful than the frozen steak-um you can buy at a grocery store. It's completely un-seasoned and flavorless. I also ordered their mozzarella sticks. I really don't know who thought it was a good idea to batter these rather than bread them, but they're horrible and again flavorless. I prefer my mozzarella sticks to be breaded with breadcrumbs. These are battered with some kind of thick batter that has no flavor whatsoever. It would be one thing if they used a beer batter or added some type of flavor, but these didn't even taste like salt was added. I opted for the marinara on the side instead of ranch. Their marinara tastes like its the cheapest canned stuff you can get. It's just not good. We also had a small greek salad. This was the best item of everything we ordered. A salad. Sorry Empire, but your quality had taken a nose dive. There's no coming back for me. You can't fix this, because I've given you the chance to improve over the last few months and you've just blown it in every way possible. I'd maybe come in for a beer, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Don't bother sitting at the bar on weekend if you want to eat.  Bartender spends more time on cell phone than helping customers.  You shouldn't have to beg to place an order."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and the non-pizza items like the burgers and wigs are just as good. Great place to go to if you get tired of the typical fast food pizza. Will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Ate dinner there last night, came in 30 minutes before closing (didn't realize) and was never rushed or felt like a inconvenience. We didn't even realize what time they closed until we saw it when walking to our car after the meal. The team was accommodating the food was fresh good strong drinks that were so cheap and the food serving size was huge! Had other half of my meatball sub for lunch and it was so so good even left over! We will make a trip out of our way to eat here for sure now! So glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times......and lately I have had bad experiences with the wings. The last 2 times I called in my orders and the wings were hairy all over. I mean, how could you serve that! There is absolutely no care for your customers to serve chicken like that. The pizza is usually good...but there is always a long wait to get just a slice.......I hope things improve fast. I will give them another chance. .."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here! The crust is not too thick, perfect amount of cheese and toppings, and the sauce is delicious! The garlic knots are just ok, a little on the large size for my taste...like a roll! Personally the atmosphere blew it for me. I came here with my husband and children, and the music was so loud. Are we in a club or a restaurant? Not the best for infant ears. We couldn't enjoy conversation, over the loud music. Probably won't come back to eat inside, will get take out next time."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have had lunch at Empire in Fort Mill.   The first time was wonderful- both the service and the pizza. Unfortunately,  NOT today.   My salad was served and I had to wait for silver ware for 10 minutes.  And that's after I had to ask for it. When I ordered my drink I specifically asked for no ice.   It was served with ice.  I let my server know and got no polite apologies from her.   The pizza was COLD and so was my server. Since I was on my lunch break and  running out of time I had to eat it cold.  Now dealing with indigestion.  Won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Being new to the Fort Mill area and not wanting to cook during the weeks of moving into our new home we decided to eat out. We came across Empire Pizza near Baxter Village and very happy we did. The wait staff is wonderful and attentive, the decor and ambiance is very appropriate for a pizza spot. There is a bar on the other side of the partition and the noise doesn't really carry over to the dining area.  But you want to know about the pizza, right? Well, it's truly an experience. The sauce, crust and ingredients all come together to make a great pie. They've really put time into their recipe for the pies.The buffalo wings are great also.  Empire also serves Gyros, Pitas and other pizzeria items, although I haven't tried them, I've had some friends tell me they're very good. We been going to Empire often over the last 5 months and we've only had one experience where the pizza wasn't cooked all the way through, we didn't mention anything to the staff because it wasn't that bad.  Great location, great wait staff and great food! Stop by."}
{"text":"Average food, good prices, crappy service.  The service used to be much better.  The last two times I visited, I ended up having to wait for so long that I ended up grabbing menus myself.  Then, waiting about 15 minutes for someone to take drink orders.  One of the times I was underserved, there were five parties who seated themselves before anyone came to a table.  We were the second to arrive, but the last to get service.  For the first two years this location was open, I thought they were much better than Beef O'Brady's, but not anymore.  Guess we're heading back to Beef's."}
{"text":"Horrible attitude of Waitress/Bartender today. Attitude right off the bat ordering drinks. She wanted us to have adult drinks expecting bigger tips I could tell. I asked what soft drinks. She sighed ...  Pepsi products and blinked. I don't work for Pepsi so I haven't a clue.  Eventually she rattled them off.  Ordered and when she returned and threw straws on the table ... I knew. We are out!!' Left and didn't look back.  All the reviews said hit or miss on service. It's mostly miss. You've been warned.  (And PS...  Less is more when it comes to make up.)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. Something for everyone. Love this place! Highly recommended for all ages."}
{"text":"I had an experience similar to Jessica Rs this past Sunday. Slow food- over 1 hour to get our food. They were either understaffed or didn't care.  Normally we have had everything on par for what we have expected. It's always been a good place to eat when we have kids to feed."}
{"text":"Food OK. Server might need to consider a new job choice. Serving others not her strong suit. She seemed more concerned with finishing the \"side work\" rather than checking on her tables."}
{"text":"I almost had a bad experience here.  Back in December I called to make sure they accepted the coupons from the Citipass books which we sell for fundraising.  I wanted to make sure because this location opened after the books were published and as such was not listed on the coupon.  They informed me that they did accept the coupons and I had no issues.  Fast forward two months.  I call and placed an order intending to use the other coupon in the book (most businesses have two in there). I get there and they inform me that they don't accept the coupon.  After making a stink due to the inconsistency (I would have been fine had they told me the first time they don't take them), the manager accepted it.  It may have been because the additional pizza was already made, but he gave it to me and apologized.  I would have been on here writing a one star review if he had not, so he was smart in that regard.  Anyway, I have since returned and ordered the \"Siciilan\" deep dish pizza (fwiw, pizza in Sicily is not this style; I have a good friend who was born and spent most of here life there) and it was very good."}
{"text":"Their pizza is overly salty. Like really, really salty. We won't order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. The waitress was very nice and attentive even though they were packed!! The food was brought to us pretty quickly. Although I wasn't a big fan of The wings... Could have cooked another 2 or 3 mins. I gave it 3 stars because you basically sit on top of each other in here. And the wings of course."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great atmosphere and tasty wings.  Beer selection is good, and wait staff is usually attentive.  Pasta dishes are good, as well as calzones.  A good addition to Fort Mill.  I'd prefer the pizza cooked on the deck of the oven rather than a screen - it doesn't get quite as crisp as I like, but otherwise I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Fort Mill, SC. The garlic knots and wings are good too. They have delivery and great service with a full bar if you eat in."}
{"text":"The good; Food is consistently the same and tasty, portions are big, some are huge, they deliver.  The bad; Inside service is a bit slow, not for the regular crowd though, have walked out a few times because no one ever came over for order,  extremely loud after 3pm, they could use some sound deadening material to absorb some of the noise.   My 4 star rating is based more on the food that is delivered, based on inside the restaurant it would be a 2, only because of the loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have found in Fort Mill   Wings are also great. Good choice for the family and reasonable prices, especially at happy hour. Noise level is a bit high"}
{"text":"Good place to watch a ball game. Big TV's everywhere. Cheap beer and good food. Pizza by the slice good wings. America is great."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times for lunch and can't believe how slow it is. I've ordered pizza by the slice at lunch and can see the pizzas from where I sat. 40 minutes to get a slice is a joke when you have only an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"Overall a pleasant experience. Atmosphere was nice, beer selection (and happy hour specials) were good but the pizza was just fair. Crust was kind of bland and there was very little cheese on our cheese-only pizza and very little sauce. They definitely skimped out on ingredients. The taste was ok but because the ingredients lacked, all you could taste was the not-so-good dough. The was service was also very good and the pizza arrived quickly. Overall a good place but if you want better pizza, try Danny's."}
{"text":"Been several dozen times since they opened and finally reviewing.  It's a good sports bar and pizza place.  Prices are very good and their happy hour specials are great.    Generally the food is quite good for the money.  I like their wings and sandwiches, only had a few of the pasta dishes and enjoyed.  Their marinara sauce is very good and a big fan of their calzones.  Service is usually pretty quick, can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights and, so you can expect to wait a little bit.  My only complaint is that the small pizzas have a much thicker crust than the the medium or large.  I'm prefer a thin crust."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring the family. I must admit they do have the best wings around. the pizza was fresh and top notch. And don't forget to finish the meal with a cannoli"}
{"text":"Great pizza! We got the 2 Brothers. Service was great, as well. We didn't wait long for our pizza and it was surprisingly busy."}
{"text":"Solid pizza place - bar seating on one side and restaurant seating on the other. TVs all around the place show sports, news, and trivia. The fella and I visited early on a Sunday evening for dinner, and service was spot on. Unfortunately, they couldn't show us a draft or bottle beer list, so we sorta had to wing our choice.  We started with the pepperoni rolls, which were better than I expected. Then we moved onto spliting a 10\" Maui pizza (which was 6 slices) with bacon, ham, and pineapple. Somehow the marinara sauce that came with the pepperoni rolls tasted a lot better to me than the sauce on the pizza, which sorted tasted like tomato sauce out of a can, but even just okay pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"To me, Empire is just okay. We've been a couple of times since my hubby could live off of pizza.    When you walk in, the dining area is really dark, even if there's light outside. One half of the area has a bar. The other half is regular seating with booths and tables. It always seems noisy when we go so It's not my favorite environment.    The menu has your typical pizzeria options: pizza,  calzones, pasta, sandwiches and wings. We ordered garlic knots to start and those came out before our drinks did so that was fast, but we still had to wait until our drinks came. The knots were just okay. I couldn't taste the garlic at all, but the dipping sauce was good. For the main course, we ordered a pizza. We wanted to do a specialty pizza, but we weren't allowed to substitute toppings, but they could remove a topping. In the end, it was easier for us to create pur own and that was cheaper as well. We ordered a sausage, mushroom and peppers pizza. Honestly, it wasn't great. It seemed a little undercooked. There wasn't enough sauce and after taking one bite, all the cheese just slid off the slice.   Customer service was okay. We had to wait for refills a couple of times.   Maybe we caught them on an off night? But I don't care for the environment and the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and a half for a half hour delivery promise before we finally cancelled. We were staying at a hotel across the parking lot so 90 minutes and 2 calls to the restaurant were enough to ruin any chance for a better review. Never again at Empire Pizza."}
{"text":"UPDATE: no obvious change from previous review;   On a weeknight the service is prompt and attentive. On a weekend, especially Friday nights not so much. The pizza is typical of the area which means it's edible but not something to tell your Nona about. The wings are good and served quickly. We usually have wings and 'za which works well here. A typical 3 star establishment in a Charlotte bedroom community."}
{"text":"Awesome!  I was here early in the week for a meetup group event and had a calzone.  It was easily the best one I've ever had anywhere.  The service was pretty good too.  They have good business here but it's still easy to get in and out.  I went back last night to have a pizza.. it was equally as good and now I'm in love.  I don't live near here but will certainly make an effort to stop by when I'm in Fort Mill visiting family."}
{"text":"I have to start my review by stating that I only ate their gluten free pizza so this review may have been better if I had eaten the regular pizza, which the others in my group said was really good, but I didn't. I tend to order gluten free whenever I can and for the most part I usually have a pretty good experience, but Empire's was just OK. I wouldn't order it again if I had the opportunity, but it wasn't the worst. The rest of my group seemed to really enjoy their regular pizza so that is most likely what I'll have next time we come here."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but the service was beyond slow! It took 5 minutes to be greeted, 10 minutes for our 2 soft drinks (1 was wrong) & 2 kids waters, another 7 minutes until she returned to take our order. We were celebrating a birthday and never been here before today... I thought the gift bag would've sparked a question.   After 22 minutes of sitting there and finally placing our order we of course had to wait about 20 minutes longer for the pizza to cook. It was hard entertaining a 3 year old boy and 1 year old baby girl for 45 minutes until the food arrived.   Very slow service and no connection with the guests."}
{"text":"Service can be spotty at times, but the wings and the calzone are the best ones around. No argument. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"First time here. Lots of food, Pizza is very good.  I am sure We will be back and I'll add more to the review."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and their garlic knots. My husband loves the calzones. Their salads are always fresh. The only thing is their customer service sometimes. They can be a little rude sometimes and we usually are very tolerant and we can understand the pressure of a fast paced restaurant. I wish they would be nicer. A smile and a thank you goes a long way.   I love the fact that you can order a pizza at midnight and pick it up."}
{"text":"Started coming here for pizza about 8 months ago,  at first it was good pizza,  last few weeks, we usually get pizza on fridays, the quality has gone down hill. Now, we don't eat there at all.  Besides the food quality there were some incidents of waitresses padding their tips if you use a credit card. Very disappointed here, don't know what the issue is, it looks like all the same people still working behind the grill.  Time for a new pizza joint."}
{"text":"Making a delivery order is nearly impossible, might be because of the background noise. I repeated the same order maybe over then 5 times and I was literally shouting my order, but the attendant did said she was new and it was too loud for her. I will try this place again and maybe I will take this post down if this incident doesn't occurred  again."}
{"text":"Third location for Empire pizza! Still the same great hand-tossed pizza, excellent wings, fresh pasta dishes, and HOT sandwiches like phillys, Reubens, NY pastrami, Italian subs, Gyros, Tuna melts.   Great place for family outings! Kids eat free on Mondays. If you are kid-free, there are daily drink specials, $1 drafts on Wednesdays.  Happy Hour features 50 cent wings, $5.95 10-inch one topping pizzas, and house drink specials.  They have the NFL package so every game is always on! Trivia on Monday nights, Karaoke during the week, also.-- just check Facebook for weekly events.   And..... they deliver! :)"}
{"text":"Swing by to pick up some wings and fries for my wife and I, and I gotta say it was a little disappointing. The wings were a little over cooked so just adding sauce doesn't help and the fries tasted like they had been sitting for a while. I have been here before and the foods normally good but this was not."}
{"text":"Love this place, and (Trish) is amazing with guests! Y'all awesome thanks for the hospitality"}
{"text":"Friendly waitress, rocky tables, good food, and has a semi-private room.  18\" pizza 1/2 Two brothers deluxe with no ground beef but extra sausage and 1/2 cheese.  2 kids lemonades 2 kid fruit cups Cooper on tap.   Everyone enjoyed the yummy pizza, but the kids did not enjoy the mixed fruit cups or lemonades.   Hubby said Cooper was good; but I wish they had at least one dark porter as advertised.  but if you want pineapple beer or gose or an IPA it's on tap here."}
{"text":"Cool local spot, awesome wings and great food.  Service is also good here, much improved recently from my past visits here.  So if you sit at a table ask for Haley, she's the best server I've had in a long time...we've actually called ahead to make sure it's her shift before going."}
{"text":"The best barbecue cheeseburger I have ever had and I've had many over the years.  I get this for takeout often.  My wife gets calzones,  small pizzas etc and loves them too.  Great food.  Service is good as well.  Patty melt was great too."}
{"text":"We went here on the advice of a fellow New Yorker we met at Trilogy at Lake Norman.    It is hard to find anything like NY pizza.  This was really good !  They were too heavy on the black olives, but otherwise the special pie we got with sausage, ground beef (very little) and some other meats, was good."}
{"text":"This place is obnoxious. Always overcrowded, noisy, staff seems stressed out and not friendly, and the pizza is average at best. The only reason to go is if you have noisy kids."}
{"text":"Another HORRIBLE experience...after a long week it was pizza Friday (supposed to be followed by a !! but tonight is was :(  ) Instead we were delivered the wrong pizza. Called to let them know they got it wrong, but couldn't wait another hour for delivery for our children's pizza...their response \"well what do you want me to do about it?\" Really?!?!?! 1) I want the managers to know how bad they are screwing up, 2) someone to take responsibility for the screw up and 3) do something about it to make the customer feel reassured that the next time (there won't be a next time for us) will definitely be a better experience. Sorry guys, but been in the industry (even pizza) and this is unacceptable...no more business from us and DEFINITELY no recommendations to friends...hard to gain business if you treat customers (especially repeat ones) as badly as you have."}
{"text":"Would have given four stars but the last two times I went here have been horrible. The last time I went on a Friday evening, what a mistake! The place was crowded and the waitresses could clearly not handle it. I saw my waitress twice the whole time, and had to track her down each time. My fiance and I ordered two small pizzas, one was fine and the other had terribly burnt crust. I didn't realize until we got home since we took it to go. The last time I went to Empire, I went at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday, and the place was dead (it was literally me and two other tables in the whole restaurant). When I sat down and told the waitress I was going to do a to go order, she interrupted me and told me to go to the to-go counter to order. I asked her nicely if it was alright if I could sit here and enjoy a beer while waiting for my food (you would think she would want a tip). She took my order without writing it down (big mistake!) Shame on me for not checking my order (it's never appealing when the bag is stapled and you just want to get out of there). She, or the cook, managed to screw up a two salad order. I ordered two garden salads and received one garden salad with no dressing (when I asked for dressing) and a Caesar salad (really?) General incompetence whether busy or slow."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our regular lunch spots. Good food and quick service for lunch.  Solid lunch specials. But last 3 times we have gotten horrible service. Today we left after waiting 36 minutes for our food. Off the the lunch bunch list now."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the place was loud, crowded and needs a new air conditioner. Would order take out, but not eat in."}
{"text":"Great pizza every time we go. Descent priced lunch specials are also available. Service can be hit and miss at times, but generally we are never dissapointed."}
{"text":"Not really worth the stop to be honest. Been a few times.  Pizza is hit or miss, but usually a miss.  Service?  Always a miss.  Best bet is to go with a pasta dish and prepare to wait... A long time.  But the pasta dishes are good and the Ceasar salad is very good. If they can get some actual flavor on their pizzas and fix the awful service..it might be worth it. But I'm not going to hold my breath."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and I love the atmosphere inside the bar area. Fun place to come for lunch after church too."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4 times now. Three for dinner and one time for lunch. Great prices for the lunch menu. I was out the door for under $6 at lunch which included a soda a salad and a large slice of pizza! Very friendly wait staff and everything I've tried has been good!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Empire. After talking to the bartender she said that there were two more other locations in the area. The police came highly recommended from a few friends and everything I had from there it was really good. I got a ham calzone which was pretty generously portioned."}
{"text":"We went to Empire Pizza with about 12 people last night. The service was great and food perfect. For a busy Saturday the handled the chaos well. I got the Buffalo Chicken Philly Roll and it is better than any others like it in town. The need to get a better beer selection though."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best but the best part is you want some entertainment and great people watching is the bar area and not to mention the bar tenders are always amazing and as nice as ever!"}
{"text":"Not sure why Empire is open until 2:00 am if they are only willing to serve employees. Stopped by there at 11:30 tonight and no one even acknowledged us so we left."}
{"text":"so I am a big pizza fan.  Usually Marcos is my go to for their NY style but wanted to try something different.  Saw Empire had a Sicilian pizza and I thought that just sounded amazing!  I was excited to try it.  Called in my order for pickup,  everything went smoothly.  Got home and opened everything up,  at first glance I was amazed how big the slices were (again,  super excited) so I cut them in half.  Then I noticed the edges were completely burnt,  like chard burnt.  A little mad but I was still excited for this \"Sicilian\" style pizza.  Sat down and looked it over,  cheese wasn't even melted. It was more like an old,  dried cheese look.  Took a bite and the cheese didn't even stretch (you know when part of the cheese is still on the pizza but is stretched out on the bite you just took?  Ya,  that didn't happen)  pretty sure it was sitting for a while but they said 30 min,  I got there in 20. I usually can eat 6-8 slices from Marcos (don't judge me,  you don't know),  I was only able to stomach 2.5 (sad face). I wouldn't recommend for future and won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"AMAZING chicken wings. I've actually only ever had their pizza once because their chicken wings are just that good. And their pizza was great too, so thats saying something!   Friendly, cheerful staff most of the times Ive been there. (Usually I order out) Great decor and atmosphere, very organized and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly waitress (Trish).  I ordered spaghetti w/meatballs.  Meat sauce was flavorful and needed nothing else.  Meatballs were to die for!  Wife got lasagna - no disappointment here!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and Lindsay and Laura are awesome. Sit at the bar if you want to have a great time. They always give me the perfect amount of beer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had never been before but had heard good things about Empire. We decided to go last night with our 3 year old. It was after 7:00pm so I wasn't sure about taking him but we thought we'd try it and if it wasn't kid friendly we would try somewhere else. There were several kids there and the place was pretty packed!  We LOVED everything we ordered - lasagna and 5 Boroughs pizza. We also ordered cheesy garlic bread for our son and it was delicious! The staff was very friendly and service was quick!  We would definitely recommend it! :D"}
{"text":"Oh how my family loves Empire Pizza!  My born-in-NYC husband has been dying for good pizza in the Fort Mill area for the past seven years, and when we finally discovered the new Empire Pizza in Fort Mill, he declared it good!  When the kids want pizza, this is what they ask for.  We've been several times over the past few months and each time we order a different kind of pizza - we have yet to be disappointed.  They are all amazingly good.  The last time I went, with my son, I opted to get a sandwich instead, and it was just as good as the pizzas are.  We have tried most of the appetizers (the onion rings are awesome and their pita chips with dip are excellent).  The only thing that we felt was so-so was the zeppoli dessert.  I thought it was good, but my husband didn't think they were as good as \"real\" NYC zeppolis.  I think he's just a food snob. *lol*  We love playing the TV trivia whenever we go, and there are TVs aplenty to watch the games.  The atmosphere is great.  Service staff are diligent if not overly friendly (which we don't mind - when a place is that busy all the time, the staff doesn't have time for chit-chat).  All in all, the best pizza joint in Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today. Unfortunately, their lunch special is a Monday to Friday thing, so I settled for an excellent 10\" personal pizza. For some reason, I've been thinking pineapple lately and so I chose the \"Maui\" which arrived about ten minutes later.  Well topped and cut into six pieces, the pizza was cooked just right for a crunchy bottom and nice melted cheese. Plenty of pineapple bits and ham and bacon. Yum!  Service was great. Who doesn't like being called \"Hun\"?"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing, I am a huge fan of the Stromboli- I get pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers. They also have a phenomenal blt salad. Great food. Delivery. Enough said"}
{"text":"Food is above average . The service not to good. Takes forever to get food . If you call in a order girl working there seems bothered . Also how do you run at of Sicilian pizza . It's dough. Probably just didn't want to make it ."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by last week for lunch because of the great Yelp rating and it was less than a mile from the bf's workplace. I found the place pretty packed for lunch, there weren't any bar tables available but, we were able to score a couple of bar seats. the bartender was nice and attentive. I had a side house salad with grilled chicken and the bf ordered the two slice special, SO WORTH IT. The salad was delicious and huge, the grilled chicken was perfectly seasoned! It didn't feel like a chore eating the salad. The bf also enjoyed the pizza, the slices were really big. Our total came to around $12, score! Drink specials only included drafts and some wine, no hard liquor.   We will be back for sure! Cheers! Someone was eating a calzone next to me, calzone, you are my next victim."}
{"text":"Call a head for quick pick up. $1 draft beer on Wednesday. Look on the website for coupons. We ordered the 18\" monster Pizza with one topping and 12 wings for $18.95. It was plenty to feed 2 hungry kids and 2 hungry adults. I was able to order half the wings naked and half with Hot Buffalo sauce and extra crispy. The Hot is not super hot and has good flavor. The naked wings are perfect for the kids and got eaten up before the pizza. Love the fact they actually came extra crispy!! Pizza was huge and had tons of black olives and cheese. This is our 3rd time doing take out and we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Very good food! Their ranch dressing is so good, the sell it by the bottle! I love the Blackened Pasta. It is an alfredo sauce with a bit if kick to it and garlic knots. The pesto pasta is good too!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. What a nice place. Bartender Lindsay was on point with service. Perfect amount of makeup. Awesome service. Cost was about what I would expect for pizza and drinks.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful local restaurant and bar.  The food, beer and service are very good at reasonable prices.  There is a really good energy to the place which provides a pleasant atmosphere for singles and families.  This is the sort of restaurant and bar where the staff gets to know you.  Thus, you will see several regulars having fun  visiting with each other and the staff.  Plus, a lot of folks love watching sporting events on the TVs.  It is often crowded on Thursday through Saturday nights.  Early Sunday evening is also busy.  In addition, the restaurant does a huge takeout business. So depending on the day and time, you should be prepared for a usually short wait to get a table.  I hope you will enjoy Empire as much as I do."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions on this place. For the most part the food is good, and I've been to the bar area at night and received good food and good service. But stay away at lunch - especially if you are in a hurry.  Today one young lady was trying to wait on the bar and all the tables around the bar. It was obviously too much for her to handle, and the wait was way too long. I may go again one evening for a beer if I have time to kill. But for lunch - it's off my list."}
{"text":"Here we go again, another Italian place and of course this italianmomma1 does give out *** but this is so far THE BEST Italian food by far! The pizza was spot on. Not to greasy, abundance on the sausage and LARGE not what the franchised very state pizza size, super small, this is my MOM'S pizza size.  Oh and really, REALLY right up there with NYC pizza if not better! Oh did I really say that   The wings which I was going to hold of til later to try, but they kept calling me from afar saying please come try use you'll love  is for sure. They were absolutely amazing, a little dry for me as I like moist and juicy, but they are  wings and the were like nothing I've tasted in NY!  The garlic parm were to die for, but then the Carolina Gold just roped it! The desserts will have to wait for later but I have to admit if they are anything like the food or the zeppoli I tasted so far, they I'm sure will meet up to my expectation.  So this ITALIAN NEW YORKER who's mom made Home made pastas, pizza, calzones, and the holiday Home everyone wanted to go to for family meals, I give this place  Need I say more"}
{"text":"I had the worst meatball sub I have ever eaten I could only choke down one third of it before I finally said no more. I brought the rest home to my dog he could barely eat it. He is a pitbull Boxer mix. He will eat anything. And he even barely could eat it. This is very disappointing for a place that supposed to be an Italian eatery. The owner needs to eat his own food. There's no way he's eating the slop and still feeding it to his customers."}
{"text":"Ben & Dora decided they wanted some take out on a Sunday evening so we decided to order order here.  We got pizza, wings & salads.  There was a bit of a mixup with the salad order when we arrived but they got it figured out. It was a good thing we checked the order before leaving.  The greek salad was good enough, I asked they add chicken for an uncharge but there really wasn't a lot of chicken. I also got the dry rub cajun wings...they were OK."}
