{"text":"Kailin was the best waitress! Very attentive and quick for a party of 6! Would highly recommend the kalbi beef with strawberry yogurt Soju."}
{"text":"Took the family here since we loved the Gen in Torrance California. We Went on a Tuesday night and still found a long line. Hostess told us only a 20 minute wait, ended up taking 45 min, I love Korean BBQ so it was worth the wait. The crappy part of waiting was watching parties the same size or with 1 more than our party get seated first. I decided to ask and they said that a table of 5 had to be seated first because the table of 5 was ready (we he 4 in our party) not sure how that worked. Once we were seated we were greeted right away and I was ready to order. I asked for the premium steak, 2 orders of brisket and the marinated steak. They ended up bringing everything except for the second brisket. You are allowed to order 4 meats, every time we asked for more than 1 of a meat they wouldn't bring it. Service was really good at first, It went to a crap after the first 30 min (it's a 2 hour minimum) which is fine but me and the wife didn't leave full at all. Our waiter seemed to try and not make eye contact every time he walked by, we would have to ask the busser or anyone else that walked by for our next meat. Once we were ready to go, I looked over he check and they charged my 4 year old and 2 year old 10$ each for all you can eat. They both only had rice.... Not sure how that works. Definitely won't be returning here."}
{"text":"We went back week later and food was good. Last time they charge for my 10 year old daughter $9.99. And following week they charge adult price. I don't think that is right thing to do. Never going back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and excellent service. Jaenica was our server, she was awesome, very professional and made sure we were always take care of. I will definitely tell all my friends."}
{"text":"I went by myself for lunch and a drink. Lunch was $14.99 and the soju, if I remember correctly, was $10.99. I ordered 6 different meat dishes, a plate of fried calamari, and a plate of tofu so I had quite a bit to eat. My waiter, Seong (maybe Sung?) took my order and came to check up on me several times throughout the meal. He came often enough so I never ran out of food, but not so often to the point that I would feel bothered. During my first round of ordering food, I only ordered one dish but he suggested that I order one more dish since the dishes aren't full sized. That was a definite plus since that allows customers to try a lot of different things, then go back and just keep ordering whatever is best on the menu to their taste (Remember that this is a buffet so you're getting a great deal here). In short the service was excellent. I would say the top pick goes to any of the pork belly dishes and also the spicy squid dish. Both need were cooked at the table, taste great, and the pork belly is just the right thickness and doesn't burn.  It's new, clean, and modern looking. Relative to food, service, price, and decor I think Las Vegas has found a new bidder for best Korean BBQ joint. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fun fun experience. Richard our server is very helpful and friendly even during busy rush dinner hour. Will definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"We came to have dinner here and was waiting for our seat...but my boyfriend went to restroom and he saw one server didn't wash his hands after he used bathroom...we were 3 people and left ...I came here few times before and enjoyed food..but now probably we won't come back again..."}
{"text":"if only i can give \"negative star\" i would do so!  this place is full of crap!  if you have a big group, don't go here. the host won't bother telling you that you will be split in half. (what kind of customer service is that)!  be careful in their prices, coz on weekends its \"all day dinner price\". and of course they won't tell you that.  asian manager cannot do shit to help you.  he even let our whole group go and not try to help us.  never ever again we will go here!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it nice and simple. Order chadol, bulgogi, and beef belly. Top 3 prime meats for you. Eat a lot of rice cause that's you how do it. Fill yourself up with banchan and finish it off with some dank meat. Gen is fire, so happy. very much satisfied. Shout out to Minju, Tommy, and Bo for being awesome."}
{"text":"TAU, JULIAN, JAY, NATASHA, RAISA AND JEREMIAH THE BLACK GUY ALL DESERVE PROMOTIONS!   You made my friends first time having KBBQ AMAZING!   According to my friend Derick, \"I won't come back if you don't give these guys promotions\"  We are DEFINITELY coming back with more people!  But again, shoutout to that kid TAU doe!!!!  Derick: \"The service here was amazing. Everything my friend said was a collection of inputs from all of us. These people deserve a raise. I will be coming back once a week or every other week. It was my first time experiencing Korean BBQ, but I'm sure that the employees made my experience one that I would never forget. They all deserve a raise!\"  I don't know why he used my phone, he could have just used his own phone. But yeah, I stand by what he said!"}
{"text":"Yuhao gave great customer service as our server. I will definitely come back and strongly recommend Gen Korean bbq the go to place."}
{"text":"Decent , not too bad of quality. Always busy in here but the service is attentive almost every visit , which has only been twice. Brought a couple newbies to try Korean AYCE, they were both amazed and full. Only complaint is the tables seem a little high and it's a bit loud for me personally.   Will def be back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Ozzy, was fantastic! Very nice and friendly and the food was great! Spicy baby octopus was delicious!"}
{"text":"Julian was such a great server. Refilled all the side dishes and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went to GEN tonight for my wife's birthday. Got about halfway through the ordering process when the whole area lost power. The way their Team handled everything, you would think they trained for this exact sacenrio for weeks. Within the first 30 minutes, we were approached by at least 4 different servers and 2 managers, letting us know what was going on. We couldn't have been treated better. Well done GEN Teams! We always knew the food was good, but you proved the service and teamwork was remarkable! See you soon!"}
{"text":"First time here at Gen. We're from the Bay Area and have been meaning to go to the San Jose location but made it to this one first. The service was AWESOME! Attentative servers always making sure our table was clear of plates and what not. Food came put quick! And deeeelish!! Our  server Jaenica was super knowledgeable of the history of the restaurant and its roots! Love that!!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun! Great food! Fast service! They give you so many choices for all you can eat. No children's menu , but kids eat for $9.95. Our daughter had a great time cooking . Our server, Kailin, was great!"}
{"text":"The first few months Gen KBBQ opened, it was my top pick. The food and service was great, staff was friendly and on top of things. However nowadays, the staff isn't as friendly or attentive; but the food has remained consistent. Prices are fair but other KBBQ restaurants in the area have better food choices, particularly seafood.   I also bought a gift card here, and when my friend attempted to use it, the staff stated that the balance was $0. This was due to an incompetent staff member who incorrectly rang up the gift card. Good thing I had given my friend the gift receipt because that's the only thing that showed the amount payed. It took them awhile to correct the issue. Thankfully the issue was corrected but it was incredibly inconvenient."}
{"text":"One of the better Korean BBQ places I've been too, especially with all the appetizers included in the price for all you can eat. Had a great server that provided on the spot service when needed too."}
{"text":"Kristina was a great waitress:) Food was great!!! Service overall was great and quick:) will def. come back again:)"}
{"text":"This review is for those of you that want to \"check out\" Korean BBQ...  As you read, know that this lunch on Saturday cost two of us $72 and we did not order any alcohol. It's $25 per person plus around $10 for two Cokes and we left a tip of $10. We did not break any of the rules so no additional charges (yes, you can incur financial penalties...read on). A very, very expensive meal.  Admittedly, I am not a Korean BBQ expert. In fact, I had never had it. I have traveled the world and experienced plenty of unusual food. We hadn't made it to Korea yet. We go to Kabuki all the time and when Gen showed up, we were very curious. We had stopped by this place the week earlier and the wait was just too long. Today, we happened to get there later and the wait was only 15 minutes.   Great atmosphere - very cool physical space. Love the high tech system of texting you when your table is ready. The hostess was really cool and when I told her we had never been, she gave us the run down. The waiter followed with the same run down. Both included the contract we had just entered into (aka \"the rules\").  I'll just cut to the chase. I would sum up this place as dining under an authoritarian regime in a foreign country.  CHICKEN MUST BE COOKED TO 165 DEGREES....  You order food by number from a list of roughly 37 options and they bring you the raw meats to cook at your table. Neat idea but you better have a reasonable understanding of how much meat, chicken, and seafood needs to be cooked to be safe to eat. You know that warning you see everywhere about how eating undercooked meats can cause foodborne illness? Well, this is exactly what they are talking about. I am an adult so I think I can be trusted here. I just quickly recalled what color meat is supposed to be.   As for the shrimp, I'm still not sure. I'm not currently sitting on a toilet so I guess I did it right.  YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A FINANCIAL AGREEMENT...  Ok, so you recall your food safety tips and you are managing to avoid food-borne illness. You better not make any mistakes with the foods you choose because.... get this... they charge you $5 for each plate of unfinished food. We didn't really get a definition of \"unfinished\" but it put this weird, extreme version of \"you better eat your vegetables\" vibe over the entire lunch. In this case, replace the word \"vegetables\" with \"new and foreign types of raw meat combinations.\"  I suddenly understood the strange sign in the lobby that declared everyone who sits at a table will be charged, even vegetarians. I thought it was odd but now I get it. If you are vegetarian... just don't. Don't.  This basically kills the idea of food exploration. If you aren't familiar with Korean BBQ, this place isn't going to let you explore it unless you have a wad of $5 bills. Break the rules, pay the penalty.  The warning on the menu about CCTV cameras in use really gave the big brother (errr... big mother) feeling an extra punch. I've seen CCTV camera notices on wall placards but the menu approach was new. There was one meat-cheese dish that wasn't very appealing and I contemplated wrapping it up in a napkin and hiding it on the seat next to me until we left but it was too dark to see the locations of the cameras. I ate it.  Before you assume I don't get it... Yes, I know why they do this. It's to avoid widespread waste but there has to be a better way.  I SHOULD HAVE READ UP ON BASIC KOREAN COOKING...  There are also six little bowls of stuff at the table which are obviously designed to be used in the cooking process but there is no information about them. Pickled cabbage, what I think was mashed potatoes, etc. We had to ask what they were. I think we just left it at that. It would have helped to know what to do with them or at least which raw meat they are best for. Again, if you know you're Korean BBQ, this is probably awesome. I am pretty sure the other three things on the side were table salt, some sort of other salt, and a vinegar.  SERVICE... IS LACKING? NO... FLEETING...  I'm not sure I can call the service lacking... it was just, in little bursts from at least half a dozen people. After the explanation and disclaimers at the beginning, we saw our waiter very briefly a few more times. He forgot most of the non-food items we requested and had to ask again (e.g. more napkins). Oh, he never brought rice that he promised and we asked a few times. He did keep our drinks filled (or someone did, they swooped in so fast and it's dark, it could have been anyone... and I was concentrating on making sure I cooked things enough and cleaned my plate).  BOTTOM LINE....  I left feeling I wasted a lot of money, didn't get to really explore much of the food, and couldn't really nail down anything that made it worthwhile. I'm glad we tried it and satisfied our curiosity but won't be going back.  Weekend lunch pricing is the same as dinner = $25 per person. It's a little cheaper for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"great food.  nice ambiance.  needs improvement in the wait time getting a table.  I would return again!  Glad they had this quality Korean spot here"}
{"text":"Long overdue review for the restaurant and the server TERRY.  My friends and I are from out of town and were looking for any korean bbq AYCE places in Las Vegas. We came across Gen Korean bbq and we couldn't believe it was only $20 for AYCE because on the east coast, its always $30+.   The menu is very generous and you can choose a lot of different things from the menu. We always get the pork belly because we normally judge the restaurant based on the freshness of the pork belly and the beef. There were different choices for the pork belly and we tried every single one and it was all very delicious. I'm actually use to having lettuce for wraps (to wrap your meat around) for korean bbq so i'm not sure if that salad they give you cuts it...even though it was good as well.  I also wish they had more side dishes and gave you more kimchi initially. I'm assuming thats for costs reasons so they don't waste food so i KIND OF understand why they do that. But AUTHENTIC korean restaurants, gives you about 8 side dishes for your tatsting initially. Happy hour starts at 9:30 and we tried different flavors of soju. The yogurt soju was delicious even though, they water it down A LOT...which is kinda a turn off.   But honestly, the best part of the meal was our server, Terry. I have NEVER met a server that was so down to earth and friendly as Terry. He was SO attentive and quick on everything that me and my friends were very \"wow\" by his performance. We gave more than 25% tip because of his service and friendliness. We even went up to the manager and told him how excellent this server is and how he REALLY deserves a raise. We honestly came back two days after because of Terry and his service (and the food) :)   I highly suggest you request Terry as your server because you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It was fun.  The atmosphere is modern. The food is good.  You cook your own food, which provides a fun activity for the table."}
{"text":"So happy we FINALLY have a good AYCE Korean BBQ place. It is beautiful in there & huge. Service was fast and great here. All the workers were great and definitely good team work. Food was awesome. Definitely will be coming here a lot. Thanks to our waiter Kevin for his great service."}
{"text":"I have been to a KBBQ Restaurant before and understand the entire process, the host lets us know that there will be a 30-45min wait which was fine and asked for our phone number to text us to let us know when our table is ready if we choose to leave. We decided to sit inside and wait until we were called, 30 mins goes by and we notice that people that checked in AFTER us were getting tables while we sat there still waiting. Mind you there was only 2 of us which you would think it would be easier to seat rather than a big group. We decided to approach the host to let her know what is the status about our table and why is everyone else getting seated before us and she turns the iPad to us and says \" I did call you guys and you never came\", usually I can hold my temper but that's when I got pissed and preceded to tell her that,  \"you never called us and we have been sitting inside practically right next to the host booth  and not once did we hear you call our name, you've called every other group that came AFTER and BEFORE us.\" All she does is she quickly grabs menus and motions us to follow her to table. She quietly says sorry under her breathe. All in all the food was good, our server Howard as he also goes by, was sweet and very helpful and helped us choose some great meats. But what really made our visit better than how it started was actually not a worker, but another customer that sat next to us, she was sweet and actually helped us out on how to cook the meats and tips and tricks. I will most likely come back again to give the service another try, but basically the hostess needs to get her act together."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat Korean bbq in town . The food was served just the right amount that will fill you up."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had eaten at Gen Korean BBQ and I'd say its well worth the 20$ ayce. Our server, Kristina was awesome. There were more servers that helped out, too! Their food was amazing. I'd come again."}
{"text":"Service Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!! Got rice at the end of meal, tasted like portage.  Burnt grill, had to ask to get it replaced.  Ordered, waited and had to ask again as orders did not come out.  Tacked on a 18% service charge for a party of six????.  Been to the one in Tustin CA, 100%. Better"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but they really need to work out their service issues. There seems to be varying levels of experience in the waitstaff. I started by ordering some hot tea, and the server tells me they don't have it so I pointed it out on the menu. He says again that they don't have it which I took to mean that they ran out?? I then asked if the green tea is sweetened and he says a little bit but they can always make it sweeter. I said I actually don't want sweetened tea so I ordered an unsweetened ice tea and he proceeds to ask if I want sugar packets. I got the sense he's new to waiting tables and doesn't know how to veer off from script.  He then comes back 5 minutes later and apologizes for forgetting to start up our grill. He walks away and we had to flag him down to take our order. That was the last we saw of him. After that we were waited on by a girl who seemed more comfortable at interacting with people.   I noticed the table next to us was asked whether they wanted their grill changed out while they were still cooking their food. Uh, where are they supposed to put the raw meats in the meantime? We weren't asked whether we wanted our grill changed until we were ready for our check. I think management should work on establishing more consistency.  We quite enjoyed our meal until it came time to pay. I think this restaurant is trying too hard to be hip. Instead of having your server take your payment or going to the front of the restaurant to pay, you have to wait for the designated person to come to you with a handheld card reader. Our server apologized for the wait and said there would be no wait if we paid cash. Doesn't the restaurant realize people don't carry cash anymore? And don't they realize they are a full-service restaurant and not a little food truck or cafe? There were so many irritated people waiting to pay it was unbelievable.   Please invest in a regular cash register. I understand it takes away the coolness factor, but it'll make your customers so much happier. Here's a tip to fellow diners, ask to pay your bill 30 minutes before you're ready to leave."}
{"text":"$20 for all you can eat? You kidding me?????  Can't wait to take the kids here.  This was a great fun experience.  Is the food the best in Vegas? No.  Are the servers/bartenders the best in Vegas? No.  But this isn't some high end Vegas strip joint.  This is a restaurant outside the Galleria mall.  And let me tell you, it's worth every penny.  There is a considerably large selection of meats you can choose from for $20!  We happen to go here by mistake.  We intended to go to the steakhouse next door but this caught our eye and we lucked out.  My wife made me eat the baby octopus.  It did not taste like chicken, I repeat IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE CHICKEN.  Whoever tells you that is full of it.  But it was good.  The meat portions aren't huge, which is good because you'll want to sample a lot of them.  And you really won't be able to try them all in a single visit.  You do all the cooking yourself.  We ended up paying $65 after two dinners, a couple drinks and a 23% gratuity.  The place has casual and open atmosphere.  It would be great to meet up with friends to have a great social time.  Glad we came across this place.  (Try the baby octopus.  Maybe ask for just 1, since 3 come to an order)"}
{"text":"I was finally able to go check this place out with a friend for lunch. I am so happy to have some serious Korean BBQ in Henderson! The spicy bulgogi will have me back very soon. Price was lower than I expected! The staff was right on target, from hostesses to the waiters. Bring a huge appetite!"}
{"text":"First time having Korean bbq. Food was great and our server, Young, helped us pick out food and try new things. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Dope atmosphere. Friendly staff and not 80 degrees like other Korean Bbq places! Mizzo and Lisa were awesome!"}
{"text":"Kailin was probably the best server I've had out of the many times I've visited here. The food was phenomenal and the service was pretty spot on!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at! Costumer service was great, the environment was really nice, and the food was good. Personally like this place more than Tofu Hut because the place looks a lot cleaner, nicer, and bigger."}
{"text":"This place has great value for the price. Very good selections of meat. The manager Richard is awesome and has great customer service. I highly recommend this place if you like Korean!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Ambiance is tops!  But DaJuan made it an amazing experience for our first dinner @ Gen's excellent customer service.  Mahalo DaJuan.  Promotion is surely deserved"}
{"text":"One of the nicest Korean restaurants we've ever been to. Really good food, very decent prices."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb.com.. I like how they play up to date music and the environment is really chill. I've back 3 times already since January 2017"}
{"text":"Ozzy, Luis, and Terry were great! Didn't wait long for our food to come out. Really great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here, we thought we'd try something new on New Years Day! The food was good and we really enjoyed Alodia  and her service. She really made sure we were satisfied and made sure we felt welcomed! We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The quality of meat here is great. I love the decoration inside the store. Good for large groups. The price is inexpensive. Good place for hanging out with your friends."}
{"text":"Coming to GEN for lunch or dinner is an absolute treat! Their service n food quality r always top notch! The waitress n waiters r very attentive. The only reason I gave GEN only three stars this time is because they r missing quite alot of dinner items advertised on their website!! So, U r basically paying dinner price for lunch items. Secondly, the Caucasian lady host has no experience with customer service at all. She looks not very happy or out of place working at this establishment. She was rude when she take me to my table n she was even more nasty when I hand her the bill cause I was interupting her chat with a co-worker. Even with these minor mishap. GEN is still one of my favorite Korean BBQ place to go to in the LV area!"}
{"text":"Best Korean bbq spot in Henderson. Highly recommend the kfc and marinated beef. We got served very well and only waiting less than 20 minutes for a table during a busy night."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything is good and all you can eat Korean BBQ where you cook your own meat etc is fun!!"}
{"text":"Had Seong as a waiter and he was awesome! Went here for lunch with my classmates and everything we tried was pretty on point."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this new ACYE Korean BBQ restaurant in Tempe Marketplace. Went for dinner which had 37 items for $24.99. Keep in mind a lot of the items like the pork belly have different flavors (Cajun, Spicy) that is considered separate items. I've been to a number of ACYE Korean BBQs, but this place has the quickest turnaround for getting the meat.  I loved how quickly the food got delivered to the table."}
{"text":"My real issue is with the hostess.  We had a party size where they charge 18% automatically.  When it came time to pay, she charged another gratuity on top of the one included in the bill.  When I pointed this out to her, all I got was the deer in the headlight look.  I had to go through the math with her to show she charged the gratuity twice.  It ended up being almost a 41% gratuity she tried to charge me.  The manager wasn't any help either and kept making excuses why they couldn't reverse the credit card transaction.  This problem took 20 minutes to sort out because of their incompetency.  The food was good but since the opening a few weeks ago, they have definitely reduced the size of their portions.  I know it is AYCE but some items take awhile to come out. The delay perhaps strategically causes you to eat less.  In summary, if you ever get the hostess (not the asian one) with a party of 6 or more, ask her what the total is BEFORE she runs your card."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and spacious. The price are reasonable. Good are great. Servers are very efficient and friendly especially Kailin.  I wish they do take reservation instead walk in and wait. Especially large group."}
{"text":"The food were great, the service was great. The server called Yuhao was so kind and warm help us to grill the food"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! ive never wrote a yelp review before but i had to just for this occation!i came here with my hubby the other day and we had the pleasure of having OZZY as our server! Not only was he by far one of the best servers ive had IN MY LIFE,,, But the food here is spectacular! I loved the hawaiin chicken and the cheese pork cutlet appitizer! I came from out of town and decided to try something new and this was definalty a new fun experience. Thank goodness we had such a helpful waiter to guide us through all of this ...we are total newbies. I wish there was  a GEN in my home town. i would eat there everyday! But i definatly love this location becuase they have a truly nerturing, gunuine, server nameD ozzy.He is patient, but also quick at getting your orders and checking up on you in a timely manner. I hope he is reading this becuase i want to say thanks again for the GREAT SERVICE!!! We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here! The service was great :) our waiter Luke was awesome! If you go you should request him. :)"}
{"text":"Highly anticipated the opening of this place since I fell in love with it in California! I was nervous if they would have the same amazing consistency with service and quality of meats and I'm pleased to say that they do! All of their staff work really hard to change grills/fill waters/etc (shout out to Luna for always taking care of our table despite the chaos!). Definitely will be coming back for the chadol, spicy chicken, KFC, and pork cheese cutlet!! I am thrilled to finally have a top notch AYCE KBBQ in the valley!"}
{"text":"A review rated right in the middle because we never even got a chance to eat the food! I called to determine the wait for 4 people and got this response:   Girl on the phone: *Some standard greeting thanking us for calling Gen* Me: Hi, I'm just wondering how long the wait is right now for 4 people? Girl: I'm sorry, we don't take reservations over the phone. *Click*  Maybe she misheard me, which is perfectly fine. It happens. But no follow up? No offering to answer other questions? We will be looking for somewhere else to go to dinner, thank you."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and stylish Korean BBQ dining for great prices!! Mizzo was an awesome server. Thanks GEN!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  We had a very rude waitress. The food was not Korean but a poor imitation of it. The meat was very tough & they rated this premium steak & it was the toughest piece of meat I ever had!  The over head music was too loud, we couldn't even hear the waitress!! The food is bad & service is bad!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Korean BBQ in Las Vegas and Henderson. As far as atmosphere and price, nobody else in Vegas compares. Thank you to Mizzo for being especially helpful and taking care of us alongside Howard."}
{"text":"Very nice place with good price and service. Definitely will come over and over again since I'm such a BBQ LOVER."}
{"text":"IMO better value than other korean bbq restaurants I've been to korean garden, tofu hut, kimchi, and sura, because there are more varieties of meat, mushrooms and vegetables, and you have a lot of appetizers to choose from like pork dumplings, edamame, popcorn chicken, popcorn shrimp, spicy miso soup, calamari tentacles, and more. alodia was awesome and others also checked on us often to ask if we wanted anything else and twice if we wanted our grill changed. there's also a full bar. they were playing slow jams which was fine by me but the volume was kind of loud, mixed with the dark interior it felt a little bit like a night club."}
{"text":"Gen Rocks! So happy this is here in Arizona. Great food and staff and definitely my go to Kbbq spot.   They quickly get your food out. The only thing I recommend is somehow to make sure the floors aren't greasy like other kbbq places."}
{"text":"Ozzy has a great personality...over all he has an outstanding service...great job ozzy!!!"}
{"text":"It's very nice decor inside and we were hoping for a great meal but the lack of service was a great disappointment.  It was like we were a inconvenience to our \"server\".  The food was decent but overall there are better choices for Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"My server, Ozzy, was a great guy. Always checked in on us and made sure we had everything we need at a quickness. Best waiter I've seen in a while hands down! He deserved every bit of the tip."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The service was friendly, although the first couple times I went there I had trouble figuring out how to turn the stove on, and it took a little bit of time to flag someone down to help. However, with that exception I had no issues and got to try a lot of delicious foods I'd never had before. I'm glad we finally have a decent Korean restaurant in Henderson."}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue and choice of meats. I love their salad dish but their kimchi stew is lacking and not good. You cook the bbq yourself but they should really consider switching out or using a different grill top for certain meats since certain ones just burn and stick which seems like a waste. The chadol kept sticking and got ruined but meats that are marinated cooked well and was delicious. Some of their side dishes were pretty good and during busy times it can be hard to get good service. Overall food is good and service can be good depending on what time you get in."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Excellent service, thank you Richard. Food recommendation were superb. We saw the grand opening ad and thought we'd try it... we will definitely put Gen on out list of favorite restaurants!  My favorite was the spicy pork. My husband enjoyed the steak"}
{"text":"This place is Bomb.com!  The service is great and food is delish.  Probably the nicest KBBQ I've been to.  KRISTINA IS SUPER COOL."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ! Nothing beats Gen! The food and the waitress Jaenica was awesome! #anotherone I never had a waitress/waiter as outgoing  and funny as her. For now on I want her as my waitress"}
{"text":"I am dining right now with a party of 4. I'm not expecting 5 Star service but this service has to be the worst I've ever had. We told our server, Tao, that we've never been here before and he didn't really explain the process of service, the food or anything. We've been sitting at the table for a LONG time and this server just ignores us. We've asked for items that he simply forgets. He shows up at our table again without any of the items we asked for. The food is really good but if you're waiting 15-20 minutes between each dish being served it kills the entire experience. We regret coming here and will never return."}
{"text":"Good food. Ayce for only $20. Fast and friendly crews..We will come again for sure. Kevin is awesome. The only reason that i did not give them 5-star was the restroom. It was not properly maintain. No napkins, no tissue, wet floor. This resto is busy but they need to managed all stations including the restroom."}
{"text":"Good meat quality! Good service! Fast service and everything is on point! Yuhao is very helpful. My favorite is brisket."}
{"text":"FINALLY.   I'm so happy that Gen made its way to Vegas because I go to the one in Tustin ALL THE TIME since I go to school in Irvine. For $20, you really can't complain. They have a fantastic selection of good quality meats, along with some other goodies like fries, fried chicken, etc.  I went with a group of friends the night after they opened and we were a party of 9. They ended up splitting us up into two booths, which was understandable since we were a large group, but we saw that there were tables on the bar side of the restaurant that looked like they could've seated us. We figured they must've been reserved or something, but it sucked that we couldn't sit together and it felt awkward screaming across the aisle to the group at the other table.   If you're used to more traditional KBBQ, you may not enjoy Gen. I'm Korean so I've had my fair share of KBBQ and Gen definitely keeps it simple. I was a little disappointed because they don't serve the steamed egg (gyeran jim) or the soybean soup (doenjang jigae) here. I also asked for rice paper, which I assumed they had since the Gens in CA have them, but the server told me that they don't serve that and he offered me tortilla wraps (?!)  in lieu of the rice paper. That was interesting. They were also sold out of a LOT of the appetizers when I went, but I guess that was understandable since they opened the day before.   Service was eh. It was difficult to flag down a server at times, but the meats came out fairly quickly. The servings of meat was pretty inconsistent though. We ordered the steak multiple times and a couple were paper thin while a couple were thick slabs. When we ordered chadol, the first plate was full, but the next plate we got literally had 8 pieces.   TL;DR: Good KBBQ place that was definitely much needed in Vegas. Don't expect traditional KBBQ here, but it'll definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This place has good food and great service. Easily one of the best kbbq places I've been to. I had a server named Eugene who provided not just the best service I've had at a restaurant in Henderson nv. But all of Vegas. Props to him and gen for a great meal and evening."}
{"text":"We had excellent service from our waiter Blake. Overall I would go there again. The food was reallt good the meat was very flavorful."}
{"text":"Huge thank you to our waitress Alodia. She was super helpful with my first time here. Very nice and friendly. Will be back.  Everyone is super nice and helpful. Food is great, and tasy. Great pricing too."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere and excellent service!   Many Korean bbq places around the Vegas area tend to be small and always packed, but this place looked high-end and had very affordable prices. All of the food was delicious and the servers were very attentive. The only thing that I would recommend for improvement is that the meat sticks very easily to the grill making everything burn very quickly."}
{"text":"The food was great! I enjoyed everything!! And our table sever yuhao was really nice and kind! My friends and I had a good time!"}
{"text":"$19.99 for all you can eat in a fancy restaurant ? YES!   Two of us came in on Saturday late afternoon. Our service by Keyi was awesome and beyond expectation. As this was the first time at Gen, she gave us helpful suggestion on food selection. We were supper happy with what we had. She was so friendly and efficient. Thanks Keyi . The great food and great services made our first experience at Gen wonderful.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Celebrated my boyfriend's bday here at Gen, food was GREAT! Love love love the salad and squid leg! Service was awesome! Raymond took good care of us, provide us with everything we ask! Awesome experience! I would go back here. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"The food here was good, the atmosphere was fun, but I do have to say one thing...it was too LOUD. The music was so loud I couldn't hear my dad talking, we were practically yelling at each other, same goes for the server. All the servers were yelling at random times and it was confusing. Over all it made the experience slightly unpleasant. But the food and the fact that I could have unlimited Shirley temples made up for it. Would I go back? Sure. Would I bring my mom here? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"This place is good. First time here. Alodia was our server. She was very nice and explained how the menu works. She recommended some items which were delicious. No room in my tummy for dessert unfortunately. I like how they give small portions of meat that way you can try a little of everything on the menu.  We ordered rice but it didnt come during our meal, they were having issues with that probably.  Despite not having rice, we ate the ban chan as substitute and all was fine.  I would definitely come here again. :)"}
{"text":"Their appetizer list is waaay more than any other KBBQ I've been to. I especially love their cow tongue and brisket. I always order #10 on their dinner menu, and it is amazing. Their staff is really nice and helpful. When things get busy, of course you get slower service, but that's just normal."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ place I've been to so far. I've heard a lot of great things about the Cali locations so I had to give it a try.  From what I heard, the portions are smaller here in Vegas but it's AYCE, just keep ordering.   Just driving up to Gen I knew the wait was a little long and surely it was. definitely worth the wait. (Waited 1hr 30min on a busy night but didn't mind because we walked around the mall) Waiting area was pretty small but The texting feature they have was awesome. Better than waiting outside, not hearing your name get called & losing your spot in line.  Glad this location is far from the other KBBQ spots because if they opened up in Chinatown, they'd put the other KBBQ spots to shame. Ha. Service was great && Pork belly . beef tongue. On point! ((4 star because we did go most of the night without water refill))"}
{"text":"Julian was a great server. Food came out fast and delicious. Always have such a great time coming here! I love eating the KFC chicken"}
{"text":"I've had A LOT of KBBQ in my life (I lived in Korea Town in LA) but Gen is definitely one of my favorites! The food is delicious, I personally like the Galbi, beef bulgogi, spicy pork, KFC chicken, japchae and squid legs  The service is also really amazing, i have to give a special shout out to Ozzy and Richard, thank you so much for making our dining experience the BEST! Ozzy was super fast and attentive, and we loved his positive personality. Richard ALWAYS takes care of us! we love that he actually remembers us and makes sure we're having a good meal. thank you also for treating us to your specialty cocktail. it was DELISH'  Thanks! we'll be back soon"}
{"text":"went to vegas with the family for SuperBowl weekend and had dinner here on our last night in town. other family members who live in vegas recommended it and it was really really good. i was amazed that it was all you can eat for only $19.99!!  the quality of the food was really good. i loved the sides they gave, the potato salad, kim chee, onion etc..sooo good. we ordered alot of the kal bi, premium steak, squid legs, miso pork belly, and shrimp to name a few. we had so much food. there were 6 of us at the table.  one thing i would say that was a bad thing about this place is at one point, we were slowing down a bit but we were still eating and drinking. then someone from the staff comes over to our table and asks if we could move to another table because there was a big party coming in and they were waiting for the table we were on. although we had a 2hour limit, we were there for only almost an hour at that time. my aunty then told them that we were still eating and we werent done. i could understand if we were just drinking and talking stories with each other, then yes, we could move to another table because we werent using the burners. but we were. anyway, the staff was a little rude at first, but they realized we were still eating and they apologized and moved the big party to another table.  other than that, it was a really good meal for a really good price. i will go back and eat there again on my next trip to las vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love all the decors. Staffs are nice and professional. I have 2 boys that are 7 and they always charge me half price which is a bonus because my kids don't really eat that much. I love how I can take the whole family here for dinner"}
{"text":"Atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, modern, spacious, and clean. Service was awesome with multiple servers and our main server, Julian, checking in on us frequently.  As for the food, it is more Americanized compared to other kbbq places but it's still good! My favorite would definitely be the beef bulgogi. Least favorite would be the pork steak (it was dry and it kind of had a weird taste to it). I also ordered the lychee soju cocktail since happy hour is 9:30 to closing every day. It's $11 instead of $15 for a 32 oz drink and it's so good!!!  AYCE dinner is only $20.99 which is cheaper than most kbbqs around Vegas and it includes appetizers as well!"}
{"text":"Love the meats and the atmosphere. Great value for the price. My wife, who is a little leery of foods she is not familiar with, loved it. We will definitely be bringing our friends back. Our server Kristina was great!"}
{"text":"Food is always great here but it all comes down to service which can be hit or miss here. Last time I ate we had James who was the first server in a long while who gave amazing service. He explained the sauces/seasonings, made suggestions, and even offered to refill our appetizers without asking. It was like arriving at a new place and getting top notch service. He was also present for whenever we wanted to order more and that's amazing because the usual problem here is that servers can disappear forever or forget to bring things you ask for. The service from him was so exceptional it got to the point we were sad when he had to go on break. James definitely makes me want to return back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have BBQ and hang out with friends. They are very busy though. The first time we were there we had to wait for 2 hrs, but it was worth the wait. And This is my 2nd time in two weeks at this place. They do not over charge like some other places that i went to and i love their food collections. They have so many choices of meats to grill. And all of the meats are very good. My favorites are spicy octopus, cajun squid, spicy chicken and pork belly. And macaroon ice cream is a must for desert :)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and service for a great price. Jaenica was a wonderful server. She was super nice and made sure we were taken care of. I would highly recommend this place to a friend :)"}
{"text":"Meh....  Asked for cajun fries,they were out. I asked for chicken dishes with white meat....none Beef quality was average Went for $14.99 lunch,after we sit down they tell us $19.99 on weekends. Decent food but not anything spectacular here,and lack of choices for me. $53.00+ for lunch for 2 is no bargain. (with tax and tip)  Kimchi was awesome though."}
{"text":"before 11pm lest seating is too terrible...I never hear like that at any restaurant in Vegas"}
{"text":"OMG Luke was the best server EVER! On top of everything. Made sure we were taken care of. He made us feel welcome when other staff didn't. His service picked up the slack for our first impression. He was super engaging and made us laugh. The only reason they get 5 stars is because of his good service. The 5 stars is for Luke himself, NOT the resturant! Otherwise I would give 2 stars....high prices for not great food and everything else and everyone else seemed unorganized. Management has some work to do! Thank you Luke for making our experience worth while!! They should move you up!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday yesterday and Alohdia, our server, made our experience here that much greater! She was attentive and full of positive energy which is something not common especially when handling a party of 12. Amazing experience!!"}
{"text":"The wait here is ridiculous despite there being several open tables. We were told the wait would only be an hour and when we checked thirty minutes later, they told us the wait would be another hour. The staff here are incompetent and slow especially with seating people at open tables. There isn't an efficient system running the place. There are lots of better AYCE Korean bbq places in Vegas.   Nice decor though."}
{"text":"This place has easily become one of my favorite places to get Korean food!! The staff is super sweet! And they are good about handling crowds and long wait times. Kevin and Yuhao are extremely helpful! Definitely will be back with friends and family again!"}
{"text":"My family and I came in on a Friday night and had to wait more than an hour.  However, the quality of the food was great which made up for the long  wait. The Red Wine Pork Belly, Spicy Pork, and Beef Bulgogi were among our favorites. We really appreciated our servers Ozzy and Alodia alongside the crew member Adrien. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The place looks great. The staff is welcoming and kind. They apologized for being understaffed before we ordered. Still wonderful service! The miso soup was delicious. Thank you Lisa, raymond, Christina, and blake."}
{"text":"Maybe they should change their online closing time to 11pm instead of 12am.. since getting in the door at 11:01 is unacceptable to get seated since their last seating is at 11pm. I told the lady that we already knew what we wanted to order and she said sorry... the kitchen is closing and we can't take any more seatings...  I was waiting outside for my guest who I wanted to try this place and that had driven from across town to get told we couldn't dine it... Shame!"}
{"text":"Came out for the grand opening of Gen and I was not disappointed! The wait was about 30 min for a party of 4 but I gave my phone number and waited for a text while I wandered through the mall. When we were seated the service was great and prompt. The ayce dinner was $19.99 the cuts of meat were flavorful and they changed the grill often so the meat did not stick. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I saw some bad reviews about this place. However, I have to say something about it. I have worked in restaurants for couple years and I definitely know how hard a AYCE restaurant can survive in Las Vegas. I have been here over 5 times and have seen it's growth week after week. Some people compare this GEN to the GEN in LA. However, it is a whole different thing. The ingredients prices are much higher than in LA. With $20 bucks to eat lots of choices of meat and other side dishes, you can't get it anywhere in Las Vegas. This place was a little mess at the beginning before its grand opening. However, it's getting better and better now. Also, I really want to recommend the server Howard I was served twice by him and he definitely elevates my experience at GEN. Also, Julian as a food runner, delivered my food really fast. He is cute!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome, our server had speedy service on our food and drinks. Price was very very reasonable. Place was clean. Finally food was delicious. I only wish they had bigger tables to hold all the stuff we ordered, lol."}
{"text":"Came here after work today. This place was so spacious and the ambiance was so fun. We were seated promptly and greeted by our server Kailin. Very welcoming and genuine with how busy the place was. Kailin was spot on with our meat and multiple grill changes. She also recommended the soju to us. It was soooo good!!!! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing and our server Mizzo was awesome! Great service! The meats were EXTREMELY satisfying, if you know what I mean ;)  Edit: An update to our first visit. So my friend went to their opening week where they offered the free dinner voucher. My friend being the total noob that he was dropped his voucher in between the cracks of the seat and the wall. While looking for the voucher in between the cracks, he also dropped my iphone in there as well :/ What happened next was just pure history textbook. 4-5 of the servers did everything they could to salvage my phone using utensils, sticks, utensils taped to sticks, etc etc. They probably spent 30 minutes digging around in the tiny cracks, as if they were digging trenches on D Day to save their lives. In the end, the assistant manager Bryan (with a y) was the hero, but I definitely want to give a shout-out to all those brave souls who risked themselves to come onto the front lines and gave it a shot! So I would just like to take this opportunity to salute the fine men and women serving this fine establishment. Without the courageous men and women of Gen, I would never have gotten my iphone back! And for that I salute you, especially you Bryan with a y. 20 stars."}
{"text":"$20 for Korean BBQ all you can eat includes appetizers too and more that 20 of meat to choice. I like roast beef,beef tongue,beef short plate,spicy baby octopus,red wine pork belly."}
{"text":"Request Mizzo & Lisa! Food is great & location is ideal! Atmosphere is amazing. Love it."}
{"text":"Food was good but there were multiple problems with this place. One the server was being a petty ass bitch who was rude as shit. I asked for a water and she decided to give me lemonade and when she was corrected, never came back with my cup of water. I would understand if it was busy but the lack of customers in here along with the amount of workers definitely does not reflect their customer service. Another thing, I asked for rice yet they decided to give us rice paper due to their rice cooker being broken. The rice paper was not only oily but had the consistency of raw squid skin. The rice paper looked like baby wipes and tasted like I decided to drink some crisco oil. The only positive thing about this place was the price. It was cheaper then the other Korean joints out here but I guess the price reflects its service. Most likely won't want to drive down to this side of town just to eat here."}
{"text":"This place was excellent for korean bbq. We were here from IN on vacation & wanted to try something different & it was a hit w all 4 family members- 2 teens & 2 adults. Ozzy was our server & he was also excellent. Very attentive & knowledgable about the menu- made some wonderful recommendations! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. A little slow service wise with our server. But overall it was fine and I'd go back. We went at 3pm on Saturday. And waited an hour. But that went by quickly as we had a beer at thirsty lion.  Gen located near them and Barnes and Noble."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food but this experience was horrible. It was my second time here. The first time being the soft opening so I excused the service a little bit. After being seated, we ordered the dishes and the food came out pretty fast. We soon ran out of side dishes and the dipping sauce. Our server was no where to be found. After about 10 minutes of looking around, someone came to change our grill and I asked for assistance. The person said he would inform our server. After about another 5 minutes, a different server helped, but he came back with half of what I asked for. By then I'm over this experience. I didn't even wait for the check. We went to the front and paid. I complained about the service to the front and the girl shrugged it off and asked if we wanted to speak to the manager and I asked what would be done and she said she didn't know with a giggle. I wish I didn't tip, but being from the service industry, I couldn't get myself to do that. I am highly disappointed. I only saw my server one time throughout the whole meal. I didn't enjoy dinner because I didn't have what I wanted to compliment my dishes. Plus, we didn't even get everything we ordered. Horrible. This is my first review ever. I was so upset, I had to share."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and while the ambience was great, they really need to work on customer service. The night started out great, but 20 minutes into our dinner, our waitress disappeared. She never came back to tell us she left for the night and that another person was going to wait her tables. This particular waiter was nice, but not very attentive. Our food came out really slow at this point, and then they forgot one order and got another one wrong.  Terrible.  We've been to a handful of other AYCE Korean BBQ places, and while the food here wasn't bad, it wasn't the greatest either. The portions were smaller and the appetizers not very appetizing. May be if the waiters were more attentive at helping customers, I would have had a better experience.  In fact, there were more workers cleaning tables and changing grills than there were employees waiting tables.  I sure as hell ain't hard to please. Great customer service goes a long way for me and I was sorely disappointed with the service and the night overall. My wife wasn't as critical of this place as I am, but she also wasn't happy."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and of course the wait was an hour and a half. The wait wasn't so bad because it's at Sunset Galleria mall so we were able to do some shopping. They texted us when our table was ready.  I've been to the Gen in San Jose and in Torrance and this one has about half the items on the menu.   I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the Hawaiian steak on the menu and the steamed egg. The kalbi meat was a little tough something that I'm not used to. Otherwise, the brisket and the Gen steak was really good.  Service was good, our waitress Janecia was really personable and talked quite a bit to us.  Julius was great, he came by and changed out the grill and restarted the fire for us after I turned it off."}
{"text":"I've eaten at all all kbbq in Vegas and gen by far is the best.  Shout out to our server Raymond. Very friendly, attentive, overall great server. Come see him when you stop by."}
{"text":"Can't best it 20 bucks all you can cook meat. The service is amazing. To seams the second you ask for more meat. There is one right there with it. The meat quality is great and the appetizers are wonderful"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I recommend asking for more of the green tea salt. The atmosphere was fairly good. The cuts of meats were really good I recommend the beef tongue and the spicy pork. This would be a great place bring kids.  I would like to rate Gen Korea bow, but I couldn't really do it due to the lack of the front of the house hospitality.    I'd rate the food being 5/5 great marinated meats and good selection of cuts.   Service is what really dropped my rating to a 3 star due to:   The service really lacked took 20 mins just for a drink and wasn't really that busy at considering they have 2 servers per area it seems like.  Hostess was talking way to soft way to soft could t hear her over the crowds of people or music that's with leaning in really close.   It really just seemed like there was a lack of leadership on the FOH."}
{"text":"Ozzy was by far my favorite server and I will definitely come to see him again. The service is always great and the wait time isn't bad because you can always go shopping while you wait since they send you a text when your table is ready. This my favorite Korean BBQ place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place has a more hip vibe than the traditional Thai BBQ's. Vaulted ceilings, bright colors and lots of natural light. The service was friendly and fast. The food was good and it's ALL YOU CAN EAT! If you like beef or pork, this will surely satisfy your hunger. They also have side dishes/appetizers like seaweed salad (YUM!), kimchi and popcorn style shrimp- to name a few. They have a full bar so that, if you wanted, you could pull up to it and have a few cocktails, or you could have them served to your table. The drinks are not included in the all you can eat price of $14.95 for lunch, but you really cannot beat that price. Give them a try, especially if you have never experienced Thai BBQ before!"}
{"text":"Our original waitress took our very first order and that was it! I then asked the waiter Joe if he could take our next order and he very gladly helped us out for the rest of the night while the other waitress didn't even show back up once! We have been here a few times and Joe is by far the best waiter we have had! The food is amazing as well! And Joe was outstanding"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding kilian  and bo are the servers you want to get. The food was delicious.  The meats were fresh tender and easy to grill. The appetizers we had were very good as well. Get there early. We had to wait but was well worth it."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss here. I frequent this place often usually 1-2 times a month. You'll either have an amazing server that checks on you every few minutes or you'll get one of those that checks on you every 30 minutes and and forgets 1/2 of what you asked for. The food is good for the price, it's comparable to some of the more expensive Korean bbq places I have been to in my life. Definitely not the best quality but hey it's $20 for all you can eat. I'm not really expecting all the top cuts of meat"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was fast and friendly. can't wait to come back, maybe for happy hour"}
{"text":"Great upscale decor. Large variety of food choices for AYCE at a great price. Delicious! And our server Blake was awesome! Two thumbs up for him. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30 for a party of 6 and we waited an hour to be seated. It was worth it though."}
{"text":"So delicious! I've been to China town for Korean bbq and this place blows away the competition. The food is delicious, the service excellent and kind, the atmosphere is fantastic with great music and everything is awesome. My go to spot for Korean bbq. Yuhao and Kevin were extremely nice and helpful with choices on the meat. They really know how to take care of you. Highly recommend to come here"}
{"text":"I've had GEN in Orange County and this place is just as good. Our server Seong was excellent. He took good care of us. GEN is definitely the best place to get Korean BBQ. Get the red wine pork belly."}
{"text":"A few days ago I came to here for the first time, and I really like this restaurant! Cause I barely eat red meat, the food here give me much more choices than other BBQ restaurants. The tofu and potato salad are reaaaaaally great. Our server Yuhao is really nice and helpful! I will come here again when drop by Henderson!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite places for KBBQ  ~$15 for lunch and $20 for dinner,and they have 32 items on their AYCE menu. When I go for AYCE I stay clear of the fluffy stuff and go straight for the meat!!   On my most recent trip I tried 8 meats: [1] Beef Brisket, [2] Beef Tongue, [3] Beef Bulgogi, [4] popcorn shrimp [5] Smoked Garlic Pork Belly,  [6] Pork cutlet , [7] Gen Signature Prime Steak, and [8] Marinated Prime rib meat  My favorites are always the , Beef Tongue, and Miso soup. The table is equipped with five side dishes which are bottomless of course. I think what makes this Gen location stand out is their outstanding service. Regardless of how busy the restaurant is, I feel like they are always well staffed and the employees are very quick and helpful. I can't wait until my next visit, so I can stuff my face with more prime meat!"}
{"text":"Ozzy is the best server ever he need a raise Gotta try the strawberry yogurt Soju Definitely coming back soon"}
{"text":"Gen is my favorite ayce place, always visit it every time i am in California and it s finally here. I went early around 4:30pm on monday for dinner so there is no wait. When i left at 6pm there is a lot of people waiting. Food is delicious except the chap chae (glass noodles). We has to wait a while and order and remind the waiters couple times for it to come out but the flavor is not there (compared with California). Unfortunately they r out of beef bulgogi as well so we couldn't try it. Other than that, the waiters are super nice and friendly. We got our cooking tray changed couple times since it got burnt fast. Consider the store is just newly opened there are still hiccups here and there but overall i m happy with my dinner so 4 stars it is!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went in for dinner there was a 20Mon wait, but it's worth it. Our server Alicia was very helpful explaining everything and we both love out time. We are definitely coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The service was perfect. Our server Julian was vert professional and made our visit perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Seong is the man.  He was super quick and efficient and always made sure we had our food and drinks on time.  Come get your BBQ here!!!!"}
{"text":"It's the first time at here. There have very good deal on lunch time :)   And we got best server \"Jaenica\" . Five star for her."}
{"text":"Got got some thing to say : Excellent costumer services !!! Julian was very nice & fast on bringing out our orders!! Also Ozzie was very helpful with the menu :D i would definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"Just search Yelp and came in today we were helped by Kailin, she was an perfect waitress! Kailin was patient with us. She took care of us well that kept our grills fresh and the food never stopped coming. She also had a great communicate with us, especially introducing food items. Excellent service, excellent food. Thanks Kailin again!!:)"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some protein come down to Gen. This place has a great selection for KBBQ. The inside is modern and the service is great! Be sure to ask for Alodia! She took great care of us and always stopped by to check if we needed anything."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Gen. There are more than 30 kinds of items on the menu with a really good price. The decor is so good. What's more, the server, Yuhao provided excellent service, get everything as fast as he can. Have a really great experience in Gen."}
{"text":"First time here and experience was superb! Shout out to Tamara for excellent service!! Will definitely be back for seconds (and thirds... lol)"}
{"text":"Come see Mizzo and Kevin! Good Banchan and service! Only 30 min wait. Nice decor and well worth the $20.00!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly, the service is so fast and the most importantly, the food is very delicious!! Victoria and Mizzo are the best!! Be sure to try this place out."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try all of the Koren BBQ restaurants in Vegas and today was Gen.  Let me start by saying that I read a negative review from a few days ago about the floors being sticky as if some one had spilled a drink.  Well, they are still sticky today.  Perhaps mopping isn't on their list of priorities.  Also, I did notice posted at the front by the hostess station that their rating by the Heath Department had been downgraded to a B but we decided to stick around and try it any way. Most of the meat is mediocre at best.  The only thing we would give a good rating is the smoked pork belly.  Additionally, the kitchen manager was unaccomodating.  We noticed there was a chicken dish with a cheese fondue.  We asked if we could have the cheese fondue with a different item but the manager said no.  Again later in our visit we requested only a half order of meat and were again told no that they we could only get a full order.  Honestly, those two reasons along with the mediocre meat quality marks this KBB off my list of any I would ever recommend or return to."}
{"text":"This place was great. I love Korean BBQ and Gen is easily in my top 30. Service was very friendly and they know how to make you feel accommodated. We were able to get our grill quickly replaced with a clean one like 4 times during our visit. The music and vibe were just alright but I guess it was because of opening night. I will definitely be coming here gen and gen and gen and gen."}
{"text":"the food was great. my server ALODIA was awesome. will definitely come back in the next month or 2"}
{"text":"Definitely good for $20 for ayce. Pork belly and hangjungsal are prob the best. Alodia was our server and she was great!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month with my friends and the food and service is always outstanding. Alodia was our server tonight and she did a great job taking care of us. She was super friendly, always had a big smile on her face, and made sure all our needs were met."}
{"text":"Delicious eats! Great atmosphere. Our server, Krinke, was fantastic! Very attentive and kept pur drinks full. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Really good selections! Clean. Our server, Ozzy was great with service. Checked up and delivered whenever we needed assistance."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this to open since we don't have any great KBBQ places near us, and I LOVE the ones in California.   I was a little disappointed though, I understand they just opened so they're still working everything out, but I was really excited for the rice paper, and they don't have any at this location!   We got the gyoza and it was mediocre. When we went for dinner the only menu item they didn't have was the Cajun fries. The meat is just okay, I think the meat in California is MUCH better.   I was actually impressed by the service though, everyone was really nice and extremely attentive.   I'd go back again in a few months once they work out the kinks, hopefully they have rice paper by then!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED our server Terry!! Great service and a really personable guy. He's the reason we will be coming back! I recommend him and this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Opening day at GEN- long awaited while the mall built out- and finally here!  Worth waiting for, and worth coming on the opening night.  Didn't seem to have any teething issues with the service, no confusion etc typically associated with an opening- everything was spot on.  The price:  19.99 per person AYCE, a bargain for LV, as all of the other places in town are a few $ more.  The ambience:  Not a normal AYCE BBQ place- more of a laid back modern vibe with nice decor, music, and lights. Almost like a bar with cozy white leather booths, huge tv, and great view of the mountains.  The food:  32 choices for the AYCE- a lot of different marinated beef choices, chicken and pork.  Tonight had the #1Gen Signature steak (Not recommended- chewy and no flavour), #3 Gen Chadoi (Highly Recommended- very very tasty), #5 Gen Beef Bulgogi (very good also- nice marinade flavour), #14 Cajun Chicken (Nice sauce, spicy and deep flavoured), #17 Smoked Garlic Pork Belly, and #32 Miso Soup (Very rich and good Miso base).  It comes with the usually side dishes which were laid out before getting to the table, so they were not fresh- they should be brought out after you sit down, they were mostly left untouched because either hard or a bit dryer out.    The salad and Jap Chae glass noodles were constantly refilled because they were eaten so quickly.  The grill is nice, it doesn't smoke upwards, the venting pulls it down, and you can't hear it at all, and doesn't leave the typical grease spatters on the table.  Changing the grill was done frequently, but the guys doing it simply picked up the old *hot & oiled* grill and run off with it.  No cart, no tray, no towel, nothing.  I wonder how long until someone burns themselves or slips on the oil dripping from it.  Opening day glitch maybe...    Easy payment, swiped at the table with a square, and ready to go.  Definitely coming back here- and skipping all the other Korean BBQ in town at this point- all the rest are overpriced, dirty and random.  Thank you for coming to LV, GEN!!!"}
{"text":"Edited my review. Just kept the last part. My problem with this place was due to incompetent management and poorly trained staff. These things can improve with time. Possibly.   \"I had to ask for the check at least 3 times ... There is a coupon that offers $20 off of $40. This coupon is available online and says \"valid if printed\".  ... I waited another 30min, before the waiter came back with the hostess and said they were sorry, but they no longer accept this coupon. I asked to speak with a manager.  I told them that I had already spoken to a manager earlier and he had told me that this coupon was OK! But now, after waiting more than an hour for a table and an hour more just to pay, the bill was $20 more?!   Instead of allowing us to pay and leave with the understanding that in the future the printed coupon would not be accepted, the manager simply said it was out of his hands because it was a decision that corporate had made. BS  When I got home I couldn't find the original coupon, so I just gave up, came back, and paid for everything.\" 12AM, 4hrs later, livid  Spent more time waiting on the staff than I did enjoying my meal, and that's including the time it takes to cook it!"}
{"text":"GEN just opened and it's doing great! My friend and I went for lunch on a Monday. At noon it was at 50% capacity and then at 1pm it was at 75% capacity yet the service was great! Our server was Ly, he was very helpful and prompt with our orders. Even though he had other tables he didn't loose his cool when we couldn't decide what to order next. Never felt rushed or overwhelmed. Ly always had a smile on his face. I also have to give a SHOUT out to Anthony the busser. At GEN when customers get seated every employee who hears it shouts \"Welcome to GEN\". Anthony was awesome! He showed excitement and enthusiasm at the little task of welcoming the customers which made my dining experience very eventful! Anthony also was very prompt at clearing tables, sweeping, and even talking to customers with a smile. I hope he'll get promoted soon to server because he was hustling! This establishment has the operations down. Even the manager changed and became a part of the help and assisted the staff.   What about the food??? Well it was good! I would say it's one of the best kbbq places in town. The meats came out fresh and in good portion. There are 32 items to choose from for lunch. For the price and choices, it's the best in town. I felt like they take into consideration of how many people are in your party so you don't get a huge portion of one type of meat and get full fast. I looked around and noticed that bigger parties received bigger portions to accommodate. Very smart!! There are other establishments that aren't quite as nice in decor, service, and food. Or you receive one and not the other. Not at GEN though, you'll receive it all. I hope that they can keep this high level of service and quality of food going.   The only complaint that I have is I wished that they would really amp up the Korean flavors in their marinades (ex: bulgogi) and in their banchans (side dishes). But it was excellent enough for me and my friend to make another lunch meeting this Friday!!"}
{"text":"Great food and cook at your style ... Service is on point the ppl r on it .... Gen BBQ is the the place for a great meal thx to mizzo"}
{"text":"Quickly one of my favorite KBBQ. Price to food ratio is excellent! Menu is pretty good so far, staff are really nice (Much better vs when they first open).  Kailin (Sorry if I spelt it wrong!) was awesome! she came to our table at with good consistency, always answers our questions and got us what we needed.   The checkout system is pretty neat also.   Just a few suggestions also, wish there was a bit more meat and seafood sauce or seasoning   So far I'm happy with the place and I hope it stays like this and keep improving and best price!   Update 2-5-16: what another great experience here. Our server Young was awesome. He brought everything and took care of us in a timely and friendly manner. Looking forward to coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Customer service here was amazing! Food was great ! Seong and Mizzo were really friendly. We will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We are regulars and go there often. Excellent value and litchi/pomegranate Soju is awesome!!!! The only thing I wish they had was the big lettuce leaves to wrap around the meat and kimchi. We will continue to support this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Always a joy coming to Gen! Been coming for over a year and definitely recommend asking for Ozzy! Fantastic service!"}
{"text":"bring back rice papers. i want the full experience of all you can eat kbbq and i don't want to get stuffed by your free rice.  i have plenty of rice at home."}
{"text":"Here at the grand opening. Never been to an upscale Korean BBQ joint before. The food is excellent. Really liked the spicy bulgogi, premium steak, and brisket.  -1 star for service. They did try hard, but looks like they need to get into the rhythm of things.   Will be back again."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice since they've opened. The first time we went the wait wasn't long, we were sat within 10 minutes of arriving. The service was great! We were greeted right away and was able to order our food within 5 min of being seated! The waiter that day never let our glasses get empty and always made sure we weren't waiting to be helped! Overall a great first experience! The second time we came we brought friends to the restaurant so they too can experience great food and hospitality unfortunately it did not start off that way! We were seated with in a reasonable time when we checked it! However once we were seated, it took 10 min for someone to come over and greet us at the table. Finally after waiting, someone came and took our drink order, we ordered our first set of 4 and waited 10 min(felt longer) for those to come out! Throughout our dinner we felt the food was not coming out as quickly as last time, we kept having food we didn't order dropped at our table, and the waitress maybe came by a few times out of the 2 hours we were there. It felt like we had 5 waiters/waitresses during our stay only because we had to ask others for either a refill or for more food! Thankfully the food spoke loud enough for the lack of customer service. Hopefully next time we recommend this place the service will be better! The food deserves 5 stars but the service needs help! We have a GEN in Hawaii and everyone that works there loves what they do and it reflects on their service! Hopefully the service at this GEN will hold up its end because the food is great!!"}
{"text":"Jaenica was great! Loved the service and food. I will come back and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"GEN definitely did not disappoint. I went in about 6:45pm and the place was pretty packed. There were already 8 other parties ahead of us, so it took about 45 minutes to get a table but it was definitely worth it. If you're having a get together with friends during a busy time I would suggest trying to get someone there a bit early and putting their name on the list first and then go in the mall and shop around while they wait for the rest of the party to arrive. Just keep your phone handy because they text you when your table is almost ready.   The quality/taste of the food was great, the price is competitive (20$ for dinner and I think like 15$ for lunch), the place is nice and the service was great too! I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant and can't wait to come back.   It's quite a drive for me but it's definitely worth it. I won't ever go to other places like Sura or Hwaro again because they have a much larger selection of food. Their dinner menu is hugeee. There's 32 items that you can choose from and the appetizers are also part of the AYCE menu, so that was a definite plus! I'm not sure about the lunch menu, so definitely ask if you decide to go there. There's also no charge for rice.    Can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"This has been my first restaurant visit in Vegas ever since I moved here few days ago(been craving some Korean BBQ from east coast). The foods are great and double awesome to find out that appetizers are included as well! Service was great, as our server Bo had been nice and funny all the time.  I will be probably back next week for some more bad ass Korean bbq. Great place with an awesome vibe!  Tip: gotta try galbisal and brisket!"}
{"text":"This place was a great value. The food was tasty as well. There were several mix ups with service though."}
{"text":"Amazingly good food, very good staff. And quite accommodating,  I broke my leg and they had assisted with having my wheelchair and leg propped up so I could eat in peace."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the atmosphere was fresh and lively. Blake was an amazing server that went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place! Probably not a place for kids. Also not a place for vegetarians/celiac people. They don't take reservations. We got there super early (4:45) thinking we would be waiting for a while but were seated right away. The price is very fair for what you get. They definitely get you with the price of alcohol though.   I also found it weird that most of the wait staff were under age and could not order us alcohol. We had to wait for someone over 21 to come take our order. It wasn't a big deal but it was kind of weird."}
{"text":"Went here during the first opening week, so we waited outside for 3 hours. Not bad for an opening week (there are shops, D & B, Barns and Nobles all in close proximity to help pass the time). And then it was our turn.  The ambiance is a cool, clean blue lights, and not too smoky (which is good, meaning they change out the grill often).   We were a party of 5 of people, and honestly the amount of side dishes were small, so therefore we asked for multiple \"refills\" and the frequency of food coming out are slow. With the slowness, I can understand since it was opening week so I expect the place to be busy. But the side dishes are so small that we have to ask for multiple refills, and when they are coming slow... there were multiple times where our table was just empty with no food or side dishes since there were nothing that come out.  Overall, the portions are a bit small and so are the side dishes. However, I do feel that if your party is only 2, then it will be fine. Any bigger than 2, expect the wait for food and side dishes to come out."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Gen Korean BBQ. We were a party of 9, we came to celebrate a family members birthday. Jay our server was wonderful, very attentive to our needs and requests. Jay was also very kind and polite. Everyone in our party was very pleased and happy with both the service and food. We will definitely be coming back in the near future. Thank you Gen for a pleasant dinner. :)"}
{"text":"Kailin and Jay were my servers. Their services were great and very helpful. They had a variety choices of food and my servers provided great suggestions. They also frequently changed our grill since we ordered a lot of food.  Not a bad try for $20/person."}
{"text":"It's great price for a.y.c.e lunch and dinner. The meat and vegetable were so fresh and tasty. All servers knew what their job was and a manager was generous and polite. Everything was so clean and interior design was pretty good as well. Mostly appetizers were tasty, especially, meat with rice paper was outstanding. Overall, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Las Vegas. GEN has beautiful decoration. The food is great and the staffs are friendly. Today, my server was Kailin who showed her wonderful personality to us, and we had a great night with her passion and patience. I am definitely glad that I did as this was one of the best meal I've had in quite a while, and I definitely will come back, as well as hope I can still meet Kailin again."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try even after reading all the reviews which said they had really bad service.  We considered the fact they had just recently opened and the service issues were from the staff finding their way.   We were very pleased when the service was excellent and the food was fantastic. We went in about 4 pm, were seated right away and from that point on dinner was a very pleasurable experience.  If you like Korean BBQ give this place a try it's far far above anything else we have in Las Vegas.  We will be back soon even though it's on the opposite side of town we think it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We frequent here almost every week. A couple of weeks ago we had the greatest service from Jessica.  Very attentive, professional, and has such a great attitude. As a business owner, I would hire her immediately. Great asset to your company and we will be requesting her section from now on. Oh and we love the food too!"}
{"text":"My first time at Gen!!! I went in a recommendation of my family. We arrived during lunch, everyone was very nice. A young lady greets us and wants to know if we have ever been to Gen we say no. The young lady then explains how they do things at Gen at the end of the spiel she says and as a friendly reminder they don't take Discover!!! How can we be reminded when we never even knew it in the first place!!! The food experience was forgettable I found it lacking in flavor!! The server was good (James) helpful and aware of our needs. That is the only reason for the one star. Now let's talk about the bill!!! We came in on lunch and left paying for DINNER!!!! No compromising, No discount, No Military discount, all I heard was NO, NO, NO!!!! I recommend going somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat BBQ in Vegas! Good quality meat with many choices. The service was perfect even though it was busy. Our server Kevin was nice and was fast with our orders.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the opening staff yesterday. My parents (in their 70's) and I arrived 4 minutes prior to opening (11am). The door was ajar so I asked employees if my parents could take a seat in the waiting area to avoid the heat as well as the soot in the air due to the California wildfires. We were denied. What made it worse was the Galleria mall parking which is the same for Gen, was already packed. Since there is no seating outside I figured it would be a waste of time to walk to the car to get the AC running cold and back to my parents to get in and sit. By the time it would take me to accomplish that, the restaurant would probably be open. So, I chose to take my parents to Sunset Station and with our Chairman status we were  inside and seated in AC with full plates in no time. Thanks Sunset Station! GEN you won't see me there again. You lost a customer as well as the customers friends and contacts. Not to mention my mothers Korean bingo group. Great food but horrible customer care and sympathy/empathy."}
{"text":"We have been to this place a few times before but the service was not so good. Food is pretty good. We like it because it has a nice atmosphere good vibes. But the Last time we went we had an amazing server Jessica. She gave good recommendations she was pleasant. Very friendly and most of all patient. Especially dealing with me sometimes I come of as rude but I'm not really. So thank you Jessica for the great service."}
{"text":"Good food it was a little confusing at first but Jaenica and Luke were excellent servers and help us order plus the food was great totally worth it"}
{"text":"This is a great place. I went here with my husband and our friends. The food was superb and the service was stellar. Ozzy was our server and he did a great job. He made sure that everything was going well and that we were happy with our food. Definitely recommend this place and the server! We'll come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"First timer here! I can say this was an amazing first experience. There was a wait but they notify you by text, or app, when you're going to be seated. Kailin was our server and is absolutely fantastic! She was courteous and helpful in recommending items. Food and selections were plentiful; I have no complaints. This will definitely be my go to KBBQ spot!  EDIT: I wish they had dessert."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about Gen so when my friends and I decided to try it out we were not disappointed at all. Every time we've been there Ozzy was our server and he is by far the best server I've ever had. Very personable and tentative he will make sure you have a wonderful experience while eating there! Thank you, Ozzy!"}
{"text":"Gen Korean bbq restaurant is really good! The food is amazing and yummy! I really liked the pork belly, bulgogi, and chadol. My favorite was the bulgogi. My friends and I ordered more because it was really delicious! The service was pretty good. Overall, It was satisfying!"}
{"text":"Even tho I didn't have a great experience at first time ,,, I jus went back again .... Cuz it's very close from house ... And it was lunch time ,,, I wasn't too picky ... I jus was hungry ....  But ......... I was like ??????????????  Nothing bad !!!  Service was very quick .... Always got attention from any server ...... I felt food was nothing special at first time ... But this time was good / ok like regular Korean bbq   Actually we like it and enjoy it !  Since we had good time lunch here .. We came back few times already ...   Reasonable price  Fast service  Clean restaurant  Yummy food"}
{"text":"Ozzy gave us the best customer service ever! Very attentive and super nice! I will always request him when I go there! Good job!"}
{"text":"If you sit on the white comfy sofas BE AWARE!!! THERES NO SERVICE AT ALL!!! Talked to 5 different servers for the SAME dish had to actually pin someone down n demand the dish. Their food is good but verryyyy Small portion. Their grill sucks because it kept on shutting off on us. DO NOT PUT YOUR WATER ON THE EDGE, SOMEONE WILLLL KNOCK IT OVER. !!"}
{"text":"Have to give this place 1-star because they seem as if they couldn't care less about their customers. We came here at 11:03 on a Monday night and we were turned away by the hostess. \"Sorry but we stop seating at 11.\" That's fine, but it's not mentioned anywhere on the website or the menu and we were mere mins past 11pm. Is 3 mins really going to make that much of a difference? It seemed like a slow night, so I'm guessing the hostess cared more about getting to close early than taking our business. If they treat potential customers that way I can't imagine how poor their service is when you've already sat down and they know they already have your money.   Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Also from the pictures and reviews I've seen it seems like they put a lot more effort into their trendy ambiance than they do their food (only 4 banchan dishes at a kbbq? frozen meat?). This is subpar even for $20 AYCE. If you want QUALITY, authentic kbbq and good service you'll find much better driving 10-15 mins to Chinatown area. If you prefer trendy ambiance to an authentic experience and attentive staff then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends and the food was great as usual. The waiter Yuhao was a really pleasant guy and the manager Richard helped grill the food and explained a lot about grill tips. Definitely going back again for the experience."}
{"text":"Wanted to post a review to give our servers a shoutout! Minju(?) and Jeneca were awesome at their service. A small incident happened during our experience, but Minju came in clutch with macarons on-the-house! Excellent customer service and very well establishment."}
{"text":"Updated Review!   We came here about 730pm last night (Tuesday) still skeptical about giving this place another shot. We didn't wait to long but there was steady traffic but still enough cleared tables to sit us down quickly.   Our server was Lisa She was very knowledgable & patient. When I asked about half orders again (thinking they would do it this time) she replied no but she also pointed out which items on the menu were small portioned & able to share between 2 girls. She didn't brush us off or seemed annoyed with us asking for rice paper every time she passed by, she didn't mind that we order one item at a time & she communicated with us that she was going on break so that someone else would be helping us. Her service is the only reason why I am giving this place 5 stars instead of 2 again. I'd ask to be seated in her section when I come back!  The food... Seaweed salad has a very weird after taste, not too fresh. Brisket still tasted like it was brisket. Cajun calamari/garlic calamari/pork belly/ short ribs were pretty good compared to last time.   The portion of the rice paper sucks (5 sheets or so) I mean .. If all the reviews are about rice paper why not portion it right?"}
{"text":"Gen is  great and kristina is our server and she ia very nice. I recommend this place. Check it out. Leo"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place. Best korean BBQ in Las Vegas and Henderson.   Food 5/5 The meat is fresh and there quite a selection of different marinades for the meats. The serving sizes aren't huge so you don't have to worry about not finishing or not being able to try everything.  Environment 5/5 The setting is awesome. They have vents on the side of the grills which means you won't have to smell like KBBQ so much after you eat and worry about someone complimenting you on your delicious cologne! The place looks very contemporary and very orderly.  Service 5/5 The service is great. Their system is automated so if you have to wait for a table you will get texts when they are ready for you which is perfect since it is right at the Galleria Mall you can walk around a bit instead of just waiting on the inside. Also shout out to Lisa and Mizzo for providing awesome services and being so patient with the large amounts of orders I made! :)  Overall 5/5 I am definitely going to come back. Best KBBQ with great service and fresh food."}
{"text":"O for awesome. Minus 1 star for no whole leaf lettuce but that's just personal preference. Otherwise top notch service and quality! 30 min avg wait time definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible service. For all you can eat, one serving in almost an hour is unacceptable. The manager was less than caring. Last time I'll ever visit this place again."}
{"text":"Our server Alodia was awesome!! This place has delicious food, clean and modern environment. This place is one of the best Korean BBQ places in Vegas and it's only $20."}
{"text":"Never been to a Korean bbq before and I have to say it was the best dining experience ive had in year.. My server Eugene was Very attentive and he made my experience more awesome! 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable. One of the most annoying things about Korean BBQ is that the service always takes forever so you  spend most of your allotted two hours waiting for your meat to arrive. At Gen, servers were literally coming to the table to ask us what we wanted before we even thought about ordering the next round. This was great! An endless (well, 2 hour) meat party that is definitely the best in AZ so far."}
{"text":"Good customer service , besides having good food. Kailin is the best!!!!! She always asked if we needed anything and was very patient."}
{"text":"Decoration is pretty good. Feels new. Variety of pork bellies and beef, which is something you light not be able to have at other places. Feels more like a fusion korean restaurant. Food is okay. Service is good."}
{"text":"Our waitress Jaenica was awesome!!! Very attentive and friendly with everyone she served.  I've tried them all and this is quite possibly the BEST kbbq in ALL of Las Vegas.  The red wine pork belly is a must try!  I would give this place a million stars for service and quality if I could :)"}
{"text":"The food was good, some meats were great but others were kinda eh. The atmosphere is nice and shoutout to Julian for the amazing service. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"I went to Gen couple days ago! I love the food and the service they provide. My experience there was excellent! My server is \"Yuhao\" ( I think I spell it correctly lol), and he provides the best customer service!!! Literally!! He came back to check on us really often, and he always has his big smile on! And whenever we had some dumb questions, he explained it patiently~and he definitely knows his stuff!! Me and my friend love the food! But Yuhao made our experience in Gen excellent excellent! We will definitely come back for Yuhao :)"}
{"text":"From start to finish everything was perfect. We got here kinda late so we had to rush and order before last call but everything came out so promptly. Grills heated up really fast . Everything tasted great from the cajun shrimp to the marinated steak. We also had the peach so just which is a \"MUST\" try. OUR server was Lisa , and Kristana,  they were great and really took care of us. Julian also lended a helping hand and was very polite and professional.  Had a great sense of humor. I will be back soon !"}
{"text":"The food is tasty. But the managers and employees need to get with the program. I ordered the squid tentacles with Sriracha aioli they said it doesn't come with a sauce. But your menu states it comes with a sauce. So make it or change the menu. The service is really really slow. If that's how your making the guest not eat a lot food that's totally Bullshit!!!!! It's an all you can eat restaurant. Your servers should be fast with the next dish. Damn you guys don't have to cook it!!!!! Wouldn't recommend Gens. Until you fix the service!!!!!!! People should have to wait if you have open tables. Fill the whole damn restaurant up."}
{"text":"totally awesome spot and the service is dope even during a shift change. i heard that this place is packed but thankfully, my party and i arrived at a subtle hour so talk about lucky. the music is good and the vibes are splendid. definitely gonna be a usual for me. mad props to jj and james!"}
{"text":"This place has decent food. But i will tell you why i gave 2 stars only.   When we , the four of us, got to the table, Service was good. However, time went by, servers did not walk next to us intentionally. I asked another server to get our server, he completely ignored us. We did not see our server for 30min. When he finally showed up, he looked upset and we felt very uncomfortable. Furthermore, they brought us the wrong order twice.   I talked about this service with other people who visited separately.  We concluded that the restaurant tried to slow down our order.   I am wring this review for other people not to come but to warn the owner or manager that if they keep doing business like this, they will eventually lose their loyal customers in the long term.   In the hospitality industry, we say that word of mouth spreads 10 times more than good word of mouth. If the owner want to keep his or her business for the long run, theyd better raise the price or fix the problem"}
{"text":"Jaenica was great very attentive and friendly, I would strongly recommend this place for a gathering with friends or even a date, price is good and food is great."}
{"text":"Besides the decoration of the restaurant, there's nothing here that I appreciate. Orders were slow. Food are not good at all. Specifically their beef which is thick and tough, and they call it \"premium\". I'm kind of disappointed with it."}
{"text":"So dissapointed. This restaurant would not let us sit our 2 friends at our table. I can understand if you were busy. You were empty. You ruined our afternoon over silly rules."}
{"text":"It's fine, but probably my least favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in Vegas.   The sides also seem to have been sitting out for a long time.  It feels very corporate and standardized, which I don't typically want in a restaurant.  Show me something unique!  The service is spotty. Sometimes it's great.  Other times it's horrible."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular and our waiter Kailin was outstanding. Great service and food, will most definitely dine here again"}
{"text":"This korean reataurant is amazing! Not only they provide good quality food but also great customer services :). My husband and i both like our server Yuhao, he constantly checked on our table and made sure we have everything we needed. This is the best korean AYCE restraurant in vegas so far. Definitely worth to check it out all the korean Bbq lovers!!! i will come back again ^_^"}
{"text":"I had a great time n good food. The staff was koo however there was a cat girl that did assist my table. But at thend of our evening it got weird and the cat girl serving us made some funny but kind of sick references to eating cat tongue n dog. My Whiteboy homie couldn't finish after the cat girls jokes. However the cat girl was kind of cute and was flirting with my gf n my homies gf n just seemed to be all about all of us. All in all a fun n weird evening. Thank cat girl"}
{"text":"Really good food, great service. Long wait though. Love their jap chae, beef bulgogi and all their ban chan options. Wish they would open in the West Valley."}
{"text":"This continues to be a place we enjoy going to.  Our servers were Ozzy and Michalina and they were extremely attentive.  The servers definitely are always hustling here."}
{"text":"Had Gen in Cali for the first time this year and loved it. Definitely kept coming back to this spot in Vegas. It's a 20-30 minute ride from where I live, but that's a good thing or else I'd be going here everyday!   As usual, I order lots and lots of briskets!!! That's my ultimate favorite, pork belly and kalbi come next. I love that this place has other appetizers as well, squid legs being my favorite. But like I said briskets + mashed potato is the best thing ever. Oh may I add that I like to dip this with the sesame oil with salt instead of just the salt.  Per usual, the experience is great. My last visit was tip top, thanks to ALODIA. It wasn't too busy that time, we just missed the lunch price! She came back to our table a few times to constantly check if we were doing okay. I don't really ask for much in service as long as my food is bomb.com but since we have so many plates of meat all at once, our table was always clear of plates we don't use. Over all, it's always great here at GEN and no doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Blake has provided us awesome recommendations all night, thx for the attentive service bro!"}
{"text":"I love going to Gen for Korean BBQ; however, I was so disappointed because I ordered four of my favorite types of meat. They were signature steak, beef belly, yang-yum galbi, and cheese pork cutlet. Somehow, they were not available last night. This is unacceptable. How does a Korean BBQ restaurant run out of meat? Surprisingly, they had new side dishes that were delicious. This is a serious issue for a customer like me. I am debating whether to go back or not."}
{"text":"Great service, clean and yummy. Awesome! thanks Blake! Great selection of meat, great price and cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"walked in at 11pm there was at least 7 or 8 people working  didnt even greet us or  at least say hi for 5mins horrible...gg"}
{"text":"Great place with good food. Great waitors with great customer service, especially Julian. Will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Just came in today for a friend's birthday and we were helped by Kailin, and I must say she was an excellent waitress! Kailin was very attentive to us and patient with us when we weren't sure what to order. She also kept our grills fresh and the food never stopped coming. We also never ran out of beverages as she would give us refill when they were no less than halfway empty. Excellent service, excellent food. Thanks Kailin!"}
{"text":"I visited Las Vegas during the thanksgiving. And my friends took me to Gen couple days ago. Overall, the flavor was great. I like that the meat were so fresh, which is not normally seen at other Korean BBQ restaurants. The AYCE price is only $19.99 for dinner with more than 30 menu items!!! We ordered lots of meat and appetizers. I love #9 (Beef short plate) and #3 (Beef Brisket). My friends really love the spicy baby octopus. That was too spicy for me but the flavor was great. The restaurant was so popular that we needed to wait for over 20 minutes. However, the service was great even the restaurant was filled up all the time. Our server YUHAO (also called Howard) did great job and he always checked with us. He never forgot our special requests. Every food runner and busser was just always nice and friendly. Great service plus delicious food. I guess that is the reason everyone wants to come here."}
{"text":"Service... On point. Our server Eugene was an absolute delight. He made excellent recommendations. He was attentive and he had Korean punned jokes. The food was perfect and the portions were just right. The mango soju was delicious!"}
{"text":"The buffet was excellent.   Lots of meat choices to choose from.  Outstanding service, offering to bring more to us several times.  Great appetizers also included.   The third time, I opted for the Gen Lunch special instead of the buffet.  While the selection of meats was limited, there was more than enough to eat.   Gen's is now one of our favorite restaurants in Henderson."}
{"text":"The design and style of the reataurant is great! The food here is fantastic. The waiters are knowledgeable of the menu and give great recommendation. Yuhao and Kevin are great servers! Love this place!! Definitely will come back again! No more driving from Henderson to China Town! This is the spot!"}
{"text":"I've been to their location in Tustin and the Tempe location definitely measured up. We were seated for lunch immediately. Our server took the time to get us all of the non-standard stuff like the ssamjang and refilled our banchan and our water as needed. They promptly changed the grill out as needed as well. Definitely hitting this place up again."}
{"text":"$20 AYCE dinner Korean BBQ?!! How can you go wrong?!! Took about 20 minutes to be seated on a Friday night, not bad, especially when compared to SoCal which is at least an hour wait.   Our server Terry was amazing!!!! Very attentive, super friendly and he's funny! Awesome service! Definitely will be coming back and requesting his section!  Thanks Terry!"}
{"text":"Alright first off my friend and I got here about 15 minutes before last call, felt really bad about it but our server, Terry, was pretty chill throughout the entire evening. He was really attentive to us and was hyper aware of what we did and didn't like. We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review short and concise to get my point across.   Me and my friends came here for Halloween for dinner. The hostess took down our name and we were immediately seated at our table not even 30 seconds later, so that was big plus. We ordered our food and immediately we got our food. Fast service is also a big plus. Here's where it went downhill.  1. I ordered Kalbi, one of the best Korean meats you can eat, and when it came out, it was only one slab of meat. All the other Korean restaurants I went to, I always got a plateful with stacks of Kalbi. But here, I only got...one. And it wasn't even good. So, portion wise, Gen should add way more meat.  2. This is just my two cents, but the menu needs work. This is a Korean restaurant and there were no Korean words in the menu. Only the English equivalents which made it confusing.   3. The grill wasn't even hot. Even when I turned it way up it wasn't warm enough.   4. This one really made me reel over. After dinner, I asked for the dessert menu: They said they don't serve dessert. Whhhaaaaaaaaat?! You can see my reaction. What kind of place has no dessert?! I understand it's a new joint and it just opened, but seriously? Not even Sikhye?? (traditional Korean beverage, Google it)   5. The foods themselves were okay. The workers there were okay.   ***6. Oh, and make sure you remember this: if you want to split the bill, the maximum they can do is up to 3 people. So me and one other friend had to combine our bills. That was just frustrating.   Overall, in Vegas there are way better choices for Korean food. I recommend Sura. At least there you can grab however much you want to eat. And they have dessert."}
{"text":"Finally they came to las vegas! I was so excited when they came down cuz i like bulgogi! They have amazing pork belly and lights lol. The restaurant looks great and amazing, looks very modern. They earned more of my business and ill look forward to coming back here everytime. Ichiban ichiban! Thank you lisa for being a great server."}
{"text":"Not only is there finally an AYCE Korean BBQ in the area, it's also reeeeeally good! Decor and music were on point - it's cool and modern, and they played trap music at one point! Food service is fast and efficient. And food quality is very high - I trusted the standards of everything that came out. Our server, Jaenica, did a great job of making us feel like welcome regulars. We look forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"My experience in California was great but coming to the restaurant at Tempe Marketplace sucked ass. Service was slow... AC was out.. and no muh fucking rice paper.. Food was still good though**"}
{"text":"First of all, the wait. It's long. On a Sunday night it was a 2 hour wait from 6:30-8:30 PM to get dinner. Super popular right now so it might be a good idea to go for lunch (it's cheaper too $15 instead of $25). Because it's so popular the service isn't very good and the staff is still working out the kinks. The offerings are pretty good and I would recommend the spicy pork bulgogi."}
{"text":"I didn't like Gen. In my opinion it's all \"hype.\" The wait staff was pretty hospitable but other than that I thought the food was whatever. The only thing I liked was the fried squid. They didn't offer all their side dishes when we went. Plus they didn't oil the grill, so all of our food was getting burnt on the hot plate. Miso soup needed more miso paste and everything was pretty bland or marinated from conventional sauces u can get from the store. The chicken was seasoned with Thai chili sauce. Seems like everyone hyped it up because of the decor and music but besides that it was a let down when it came to the food."}
{"text":"Our server was Ozzy, He was super nice. All the servers here are so kind and the service is fast, even when there busy! Was told it was a 1 hour wait but we only waited for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Terry is an amazing server! The food was delicious! His patience and positive attitude made my first time at Gen enjoyable! He's definitely an asset to Gen!! I'm requesting him for the next time I eat at Gen! :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Nice modern ambiance and comfortable seating. All you can eat meat and appetizers, how could you argue with that. Non stop refilling of meat and apps throughout our meal. Very attentive servers. Whole family enjoyed our meal and can not wait to go back. Thanks to Adrian, our server for helping fill our bellies."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this place!! Service was not great and portions were small. Had to pay for additional meal because of an outrageous policy. Everyone who sits has to pay. Regardless if you do not eat. There apologies were not sincere. It's about the principal not just another $20.00 paying customer. Thank you the shitty atmosphere!!! It's about creating an awesome experience along with great food and service. I will not be back!!! They seem to be out of a few things when asking the server. The host seem young an inexperienced as I had to ask how long when they had 3 booths avail that could accommodate us. Ordered bowl of rice that never came out until we asked the server again and reminded him. Horrible experience for a first timer!!!!"}
{"text":"1. Food = 3 stars I came here for the AYCE dinner and had the miso pork belly, spicy tofu soup, pork steak, bulgolgi, spicy octo... Okay, basically, I had ALL 32 options. Yes, it was good, but completely average when taking into account other options and the decent food could not overshadow the terrible service. See below.  2. Service = 5 punches to the throat Upon arriving with a party of 4, we were told that there would be an hour-long wait for the underwhelming Korean BBQ experience (see above). Please note that you cannot make reservations here. However, after an hour, as we were slowly rotting away in the shadows, one of us sought an update and was informed that we had to wait yet another hour... and this was all while at least 5 tables around us were completely empty. Apparently, there's a policy that people who had put their names down before us would receive texts that their tables are ready and are given a 15-minute grace period to show up, but this is hardly effective if no one monitors that time limit and keeps open tables empty for 30 - 40 minutes while other parties are available in person to be seated immediately. Ultimately, we ended up waiting around 3 hours to be seated because we kept falling for the incremental increases to our wait and the false understanding that the food would be worth the lost time. I found a list of things that one can do with an extra hour due to daylight savings: http://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/24-things-you-can-do-with-an-extra-hour.html -- imagine doing all of those things THREE TIMES.  3. That one guy at the bar = 2 thumbs up I will say, the guy working at the bar during the evening shift was attentive, competent and polite despite our #firstworldproblems."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Gen's in LA and was happy to see there was one in Henderson. Two of us went during lunch time on a Saturday and waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated. Warning: no lunch pricing on the weekends.   We arrived and sides were already at our table, never seen that before. Server was quick to take our order and bring us out items. Long story short, we were in and out within 45 minutes. Super impressive for us given all LA locations always have at least 45 minute wait to be seated.   Overall, quick, delicious and clean location for lunch."}
{"text":"Very delicous meats and seafood! Our server Yuhao was so helpful and on point with our orders! Defn recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I like this place because the quality of the food. I was there like a month ago at the time they open, around 11 am (Saturday) and we didn't wait to long for a table, when we left (2 hrs later) the place was really crowded. It's a little bit pricey but once in a while doesn't hurt"}
{"text":"The food were about average, some were pretty good, but many marinated items were toned down (not very Korean). The staff were all very courteous and food came quick, but we did have to remind them more than a couple of times about the things we requested. There's no steak knife, so cut any large piece into smaller ones with the scissors before put them on your plate."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my daughter who is smaller than 4 ft. The waiters and service were nice and quick with the food. The food was okay and the side dishes weren't great, the rice was also really soggy. Fast forwarding, the bill finally came and I was charged with 2 adult prices, which I found confusing since my daughter was under 4 ft. I asked the waiter about this and he went to go talk to the manager. He then told us that the manager had told him that we needed to go check her height, and this was very insulting because it was obvious that she was very small. First time and last time, wont be coming back.."}
{"text":"A cool little place that brings both quality and quantity into a nice bundle with its AYCE Korean BBQ. The interior actually looks like a high end restaurant with comfortable booths and illuminated lights. The server was super kind and made sure that we were constantly attended to. This might actually be one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ places in Vegas."}
{"text":"First timer and I must say I had a wonderful dinner, never tried korean bbq and I highly recommend any meat that's pre-marinated because it adds more flavor. We arrived for dinner Sunday around 5 and it was not that busy which is really nice! Towards the middle of our dinner I noticed the crowd for bigger so I do recommend showing up a little early if you are going to have dinner with a much larger group. I love how the longer tables are set up with 3 grills and seats up to 8 people, 4 on each side so it gives a interactive vibe. Our server Ozzy was absolutely over the top amazing! He checked on us many times and made sure we always got what we requested and treated us very well! He was also very nice about recommending certain dishes! Lastly I highly suggest trying the macaron ice cream sandwhiches, especially the vanilla or green tea!! We will most likely be returning again soon!!"}
{"text":"Pros: awesome food, customer service , and venue.  Cons: far from where i live at (i live the southwest LV.)  Definitely worth recommending and coming back for ( i just need to save some money for gas)  :)"}
{"text":"Alodia is my favorite server! She's awesome! Great food, and quick service! Been here many times and the quality of the food never fails me."}
{"text":"This is the best KBBQ in Vegas.  It's always packed on the weekends so we try to get there dieing the week. Excellent meats and sauces and upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always busy for good reason. The typical wait is 2 hours. But it's worth it. We were lucky to get a table in just over an hour. The food was great and the service was excellent. However, we didn't care much for the ice cream macaroons. They were a bit too tough. Overall, it was a very nice dining experience. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Best place to celebrate my birthday with my amazing friends!!! 2nd time here and it's amazing every time!!! Our server JJ is AAAAAAAMAZING!!!! Coming back here for sure, hopefully next time there's a birthday treat for celebrants next time"}
{"text":"my favorite restaurant in Vegas, delicious food+cheap price.  also,  Kailin is the best server in here. She always give me recommendation what should I order, help me to refill the water, and she has good customer service skills. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"About the third time dining here . Alodia was such an amazing server. Out of all the times I've been here, she is absolutely the best. She made sure all our needs were attended to and were enjoying our time eating here . Definitely going to come back and see her ! Alodia gets a 5/5 !"}
{"text":"The amount of fucks these people give suck. Service is so poor. At least smile when you serve someone food. The server or manager sucks so much. Servers name is song. Justin was great though honestly changing this to two stars because of him"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Nice looking Kbbq place, nice ambiance, not what you'd expect of kbbq. Only place I know in Vegas that has rice paper. Kept having issues with the grill last night but the server was always prompt to fix things. Awesome service from Jaenica"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the last couple of weeks. Today I came with my family and the quality of food has changed. Spoke to the Manager and he said that they have a new supplier. So folks don't expect to get the same quality meat. So sad, but this will be my last time here!"}
{"text":"So I went to Gen on Sunday with my family of 8.i was told it will be 40 min wait would be the max.after 50 mins they came and told us that they can sit us in two separate both across from each other or we can wait another 20 mins for the big table to open up.so I told him no we will not separate my family to eat here.so he told me he will see what he can do waited another 10 mins .so the manager comes back out and said he couldn't do anything for us.mind you that the meals are 20 dollars and it is 8 of us .so we decided to leave and go elsewhere. As a manager he should of offered us a discount to sit separate or even for waiting longer.so he let 200 dollars or more walk away with out even saying sorry or anything but he couldn't do anything."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome service. Best price for all you can eat. Excellent appetizers. Love the squid legs."}
{"text":"So we went with a group of 8 on a recommendation from a friend who said it was amazing. Our expectations were high and the place looked great when we walked in.   The server started with explaining about the restaurant and then all the RULES.....reading through the rules section at the bottom of the menu. So apparently they're REALLy focused on people wasting food or just plain cheap. (Of course they need rules but this seems overboard)  Also you will get charged $25 bucks if someone in your party isn't eating.  I'd suggest going to Fogo de Chao at lunch and basically pay the same amount. Get some lessons on how they run the restaurant and create a better atmosphere for guests.   We started laughing when he was reviewing them almost like it was a joke....if you have children they charge by height like it's a carnival. There's a rules section at the top of the menu for that.  They do have a large menu and you can order 4 items at a time for a table if 4. It was clean and fresh but there's nothing special about quality of the meat. The sirloin is possibly a select grade and was incredibly tough.   I guess we didn't get it...I see the reviews and many people loved it. But we were sitting there getting maybe 6- 8 oz of thin sliced meat (like for cheesesteaks) for the table. Throwing on some seasoning and then grilling yourself.   We came up with this description: A cook your own food, Asian Style cuisine, Homestyle Buffet in a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"The hostess are rude. But beside that Mizzo our server was a nice guy. He was helpful and attentive to our needs. The food was bomb tho!!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious. You can't go wrong with about 30 all you can eat options, from beef, pork, chicken, veggies, seafood items, and even already cooked options/appetizers like gyoza. On top of that, they had exceptional service. Super fast, incredibly friendly, and very informed with several questions we had on items we weren't familiar with. Jessica S. Was one of our servers, forgot the other gentleman's name who also took good care of us. But this is definitely a place I'm going to regularly visit. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and understandably there was a long wait. 45 minutes for a party of two, but great thing is they can send you a text when your table's ready, eliminating the need to stand around in a cramped area. Allowed some time to do some quick mall browsing. The 45 min estimated wait time was very accurate.   The atmosphere is really nice and feels more like a high-end sushi or lounge type of environment. Definitely not the traditional Korean restaurant look. But the vibe was vibrant, active, and seemed fun. Couple big screen TVs that were airing sports. Seemed more geared towards the younger crowd and families. Decent alcohol selection.  We were seated at the bar. As someone who prefers more privacy when dining, I didn't like it at first, but found that it was a great spot to be seated at since it was easy to flag someone down or have servers continually stop by for orders. Our grill went out several times, but finally someone devised a way to keep the air flow going. I liked that the grill was set down into the table, which helped keep any grease splatters to a minimum.  Highlights: #10 Marinated premium steak - very tender, and was our top meat choice Salad Side dishes - I loved all their kimchis. The cabbage, radish, and cucumber. Just the right amount of fermentation for my tastes.  Average: #17 Smoked garlic pork belly - came with the rind, and was flavorful but a bit too much of a smoked flavor Brisket - used to smaller pieces, and every piece had quite a bit of fat on it Cajun shrimp Fried squid legs - crispy Fried spicy rice cake - I love rice cake so naturally I loved that this was offered. However don't expect the 'spicy' sauce to be in any way similar to ddukbokki (Korean spicy rice cake). It was more of a sweet chili sauce.   Didn't enjoy: Seaweed salad - Seemed frozen, and one of the ingredients in it was overpowering in a bad way  Wanted to try popcorn shrimp, but we were told that they had sold out of it.   Have to ask for rice, sesame oil, soybean paste, garlic/jalapenos.  Let downs: No Korean boricha barley tea, no gochujang (red pepper paste), no soybean or tofu soup, no steamed egg, no rice papers. No desserts (afaik)  Service was prompt and empty plates were taken away efficiently. Unfortunately we forgot to catch everyone's names, but we were helped by several servers who were all friendly and eager to help.  This isn't one of those BBQ places where the server comes by and helps you cook your meats. (Never realized there's people out there who expect the server to cook all your meats for you!)  For $20 a person, Gen Korean BBQ is an awesome deal. Even with a generous tip, it's still cheaper than most other places. What sets this place apart from other Korean BBQ places in Vegas are the atmosphere, service, and much wider menu selection. Definitely a good one to add to the rotation if you're a KBBQ fan."}
{"text":"6 super hungry friends at an all you can eat Korean BBQ during a holiday lunch rush and one insanely busy (yet somehow organized) waiter named Ozzy! We literally ordered everything off of the menu that was available for lunch, which only excluded beef tongue and maybe one or two other items. Lunch also includes all you can eat appetizers for $15.99 per person!  Let me begin by saying that the table booths are a little cramped for 6 adults but we managed to sit elbow to elbow without too much of an issue. Once seated, we took inventory of the small bowls of sample-sized extras that surrounded the in-table circular grill and quickly received our drinks without hardly any wait time. (THANK YOU OZZY!!) Ozzy gave great explanations of everything on the menu and was attentive to some dietary needs we had, while maintaining a sincere smile and positive attitude. This means a lot in today's food service industry.  Our only problem presented itself when the food started arriving. The grill, extra sides, drinks and our place settings left hardly any room on the table for our food! It was like playing Jenga with dishes of meat and vegetables. It was then that Ozzy informed us that we could place items on the high shelf close to the wall if we were out of room. There is a pretty good amount of room up on that shelf, but it is awkward because it sits pretty far above your head and you have to stand up to see what you have placed on it. Without that shelf, there is no way we would have been able to fit all of the plates in our eating space.  We were SO pleased with the quality of the beef, chicken, pork and seafood that came out of the kitchen. The brisket was beautifully marbled, bright red, sliced super thin and absolutely melted in my mouth. The seafood was not slimy at all, which gives me confidence in rating the freshness of their ingredients. We went through maybe 8 plates of the brisket, 4 plates of calamari, 3 orders of KFC (yummy!), 4 plates of chicken, 2 plates of pork, 3 plates of shrimp and one plate of the volcano chicken along with lots of fresh veggies, pickled veggies and kimchi. You also get unlimited rice with your meal. Our favorite appetizer was definitely the fried rice sticks but the veggie dumplings are great, too! After a couple of pitchers of Sapporo and a TON of dirty plates, we finally hit our limit.  There are 3 minor complaints that I would give these guys - 1. The lack of larger tables for larger groups (just get 2 tables if you have a group larger than 4 to avoid our issue) 2. The restaurant itself is rather dark and people on one side of the table (away from the window light) had difficulty reading their menu. This is nothing a commercial lighting redo wouldn't address, however. 3. The wait staff is paid in a tip pool and are required to split their tips. Now this may seem fair from a customer perspective, but when you work as hard as Ozzy does side-by-side next to a low-energy, non-motivated waiter (who will remain unnamed), the problem becomes clear. Please, Gen, consider giving incentive and recognition to your hard-working wait staff on a regular basis! They SUPER deserve it!  I am giving Gen a 4/5 because of the 3 issues above. The food quality is amazing and is absolutely deserving of 4 stars. I would also say that the grill doesn't really get hot enough to sear the fat on the thicker-cut pork belly the way I like it, but this may just be personal preference. Maybe cut the pork belly a little thinner to combat this. Clean plates, cups and silverware and the overall restaurant seemed well maintained. I cannot attest to the cleanliness of the restroom because I did not use it. I also did not partake in any of the drinks over at the small bar they have.  Highly recommended and I will most certainly be back, with friends!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ.  This place is upbeat with great servers.  Especially our server, Jessica, she's a very hard worker and very friendly.  She always knows how to make us feel welcomed!!   Hopefully when people come here they're fortunate enough to have Jessica as their server so they can experience the great service that she always provides."}
{"text":"Meats on meats on meats. Julian took care of us. The food came out at a good speed, and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"First time eating Gen in las Vegas. The wait is not as long as the one at home. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"This place is very nice. The ambiance is great. The servers are great. They are very attentive, and are there to serve you. I had my grill changed multiple times without needing my asking. The meat is great. Great, great, great. There is a wonderful selection of choice meats. There was one exceptional server, Bo. He made sure my needs were met, and did it with a bright smile. He is very friendly and charming. It was a pleasure to be served by this fellow. Gen will see me again!"}
{"text":"Great experience here. The wait was not too long, our food came fast, and the service was great! JAENICA was our server, she was very attentive and nice! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Some orders was a little behind. Understandable being that it just opened recently. Kristina and the rest of the crew are awesome when checking on us if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. So many people come to eat at here. Food is good, servers look really awesome in shirts and pants, everything is quick and good except that they never answer your phone. I have a couple of friends working here as a servers and they told me that sometimes they have to answer the phone call because they don't know what the hell the hostess are doing. I have experiences working at restaurants as a host, and main couple jobs for them are answering the phone call and greet people and guide them to their seats. Yesterday was going to be my second time visiting here, but I decided to go to other place, not because of 45mins wait time, but because of the hostesses' attitude. I asked them if they have a phone and why they didn't get a phone call when I call them like freaking 3 times, and they just said that they were so busy and that was why they didn't want to answer the phone call. Okay, I was going to ask them what the wait time is, and if there is a wait time, if I can make a reservation. I live in Phoenix, so it takes about 30minutes to get to Gen. I called them as I left my house, no answer, 5 minutes later, no answer, and 10 minutes later, no answer. If they answered my phone and answered me some questions, I didn't have to waste my gas to go here and get out without having a meal from there. I honestly liked here for my first time, but sorry man, those two hostesses in the front yesterday made me give you guys only 1 star."}
{"text":"Came here to eat some Korean food and I was just blown away by how good it was. We ordered many different types of meat and all of them were very tender and good. This place uses real good quality meat.   Another awesome thing about this place is the service. The staff here are A+++++ when it comes to service. .   I am definitely coming here every time I get a chance."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!  They are not afraid of bringing plate after plate of food to you at once, which is always appreciative from an extremely hungry group! 6 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is really clean and the staff are friendly! Howard was our waiter, and he was very attentive with all of our food needs! There's also a good variety of meats and vegetables for all. Recommend coming here for celebrations with large groups!"}
{"text":"Great food, price & service! Thanks Eugene & the rest of the crew for taking care of us."}
{"text":"Gen's a great place to eat Korean BBQ. This is the place where my friends and I always go to. Unfortunately on this particular day we tried the KFC chicken and it was RAW, we notified the hostess and she was immediately concerned and notified the manager. Our server Julian was also notified and was too concerned. I want to say thank you to them because they really took initiative and just made sure we were ok hence why we enjoy coming back to GEN due to their great customer service. I gave them 3 stars because though Julian and the hostess were caring and made sure we were ok, their manager (an Asian man with glasses) clearly didn't. He came to us and told us he was sorry but our meals were only 50% off and that's all he could do. HELLO, we just ate RAW chicken at YOUR restaurant that could possibly contain Salmonella. Fortunately Julian and our hostess (people who care for their customers) told him we ate raw chicken and we should be compensated for the entire meal. So to the manager or who ever you are at GEN, you should be demoted or learn from your hostess and servers, they're the real MVP."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review ever. Originally went to another yakiniku type restaurant on Spring Mountain but their wait was ridiculously long so was frantically searching in Yelp for somewhere to.eat with my Hangry family. I then looked up Gen on Yelp to see how far the one in Henderson was then remembered seeing a Gen restaurant on Sahara every Sunday as we pass by it after church. I checked on Yelp and low amd behold there were already 7 reviews. I then made a quick phone call to ask how long the wait was. The friendly girl over the phone said at the moment there was no wait so we went ahead and made our way over.  And now my review begins: -Upon entering we were greeted with such a warm and kind welcoming by a lovely girl and three guys. Before we even walked through the doors we could see the excitement in their attitudes that patrons were coming in. Right before we got seated all of the front of house employees in the restaurant yelled out \"Irashaimase\" pardon my rustiness on my spelling.  -The second we were seated Anthony was there ready to take our orders and literally within a couple of minutes our food and drinks arrived. As dinner progressed I noticed how attentive and consistent they were. Another thing I noticed is that it got crazy busy.  -Despite the craziness in the restaurant, every single worker remained enthusiastic and happy to be working there. I believe the owner was there that night waiting on the patrons happily and making sure every single guest was satisfied. The manager even came by to change our grill and wait on us.  -The food was 10 stars out of 5. It was absolutely and Incredibly yummy.  -The restaurant was clean and so were the restrooms. I definitely don't see this place end up on dirty dining...and I am a stickler for cleanliness.   It's so awesome that we don't have to drive a 30 minute drive to the Gen in Henderson. We will definitely be coming back and recommending this location to others."}
{"text":"We liked the overall experience as there was a sort of grandeur to the place; the price, the interior, the food, the service. They obviously need improvements on the front desk part where they mix people with and without reservations into one line.. and they have 2 staffs!!   However as management went, we sat in the seats closest to the bathroom (under the projected movie screen) and there was this man doing Absolutely nothing but starring towards the customers (us) throughout the whole meal. I felt bad for the workers who were working their butts off for immediate service (yes everything went really quickly) and probably got paid less than this supervisor. We needed help a few times but who came to our aide? Not this guy. I would expect such a place to have an office to hide him in during busy hours.   Also and again related to management there was a review for someone who's burnt pots got cleaned, no question asked? We had a woman in heels and pencil skirt who came by and scolded us on burning the pot--she did not seem happy but bitter as the burnt pot. I know we look Korean but that doesn't mean we know how to use the pot and not burn the food without the waiters teaching us. I dont think its our responsibility to fix the stove temperature especially as a beginner but apparently it was set too high and she fixed it as she warned us. Thank you but No thank you!!"}
{"text":"A unique and wonderful dining experience. Our server, Ozzy, did a great job of explaining the unusual format so we knew exactly what to expect.   The room was a bit warm for me but that's understandable, considering there is a grill at every table, heating up the room.  Helpful staff, great food, wonderful prices... I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great family place to come and eat. The bomb.com! What really pleased me with this restaurant was the excellent service from our server \"OZZY\". I even over heard guests from other table complimenting how awesome his service was. Great job and keep up the good work OZZY!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite All you can eat Korean place.   Their meats are always fresh.  Our server Alodia did a great job as well.  She enjoys helping people and enjoys what she does.  Thank you for a great service"}
{"text":"Service was great and food was awesome! Shout out to Jaenica for the amazing service!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough!! So many choices!! One of my favorite ways to spend 2 hours. Go in hungry and leave fufilled"}
{"text":"The food is really good. And everyone here is friendly, the staff is very knowledgeable about what they have"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, love the garlic pork belly. Fresh ingredients and good service experience!!! Yuhao was our server and he's very nice and attentive! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I brought my son to eat here after shopping and my son couldn't stop admiring how nice and clean the place. The service was excellent and they're on top of everything. They worked as a team to get your order right away.  A+ for the food.  Pleasant environment to eat. I will definitely come back here soon."}
{"text":"Was recommended to this place by a few friends. Walked in a few minutes after 11pm. A young man gave an obviously over exaggerated gasp and proceded to say \" ohh my gosh this sucks for the dishwashers\" almost as if wanting to make us feel like garbage for walking in late...then a woman standing there leaning on the counter like she was holding it up looked at us and simply said \" we stop seating at 11\" with a facial expression that a paper bag can beat. There was a 3rd person standing at the host stand on their phone they seemed by far the nicest with out saying a word or giving a glance at us. On the plus side the place looked cool inside the whole 30 seconds of my visit. So much for the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to gen korean bbq house. Once we walked in there was a line. It was a lunch hour rush I guess. Everyone greeted us with a smile and a hello. The workers there are very pleasant. I moved from hawaii and let me tell you the prices for yakiniku isn't as reasonable as this location. my server was sung. He had excellent customer service skills. If I was with friends then I'd order more but it was just my daughter and i eating there. My tummy can only hold so much haha. I'm glad sung was our server,.. he made it an awesome experience for my daughter and i. I usually tip depending on their customer service. Thank you sung for your great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is JUST HORRIFIC. If you enjoy paying for stomach ache, you're in for a real treat!! If you enjoy waiting, only to be ignored, then treated rudely, to pay out the ear, to get sick to your stomach, by all means . . . . Next time? OH HELL NO!!!! We waited over an hour and a half to be seated and sat in the back. It's supposed to be all-you-can-eat, buuuuut, by the time they come to your table an hour has gone by and it takes 1 hour to cook the meat for ONE order. I believe that they purposely don't have very hot grills so people cannot order it that much meat. It's absolutely horrible, and three people in our household were sick after we ate there. Don't even bother complaining to management! I had to go through three staff and the assistant manager and then ultimately the person called \"manager\" who doesn't know how to manage anything in our opinion, including his crabby, patronizing, whiny, bad attitude. The food is so substandard, it makes hospital cafeteria food look gourmet. This restaurant is part of a CHAIN. The only authentic thing was the bad food hangover of loose bowels and queasiness.  Patrons beware. Gen bbq, I hope you get shut down by the health department. Your restaurant smells and you ought not to sit customers by the bathroom!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing customer service and quality of food. Mike was attentive and was very personable. I highly recommend this location. Thank you Mike for a great experience."}
{"text":"Terrific, affordable food and beverages at this newly opened restaurant. Ask for Yuhao to be your server. They were delightful and completely accommodating in every way."}
{"text":"I had a really wonderful dinning experience yesterday night here!! Our server Kailin is super nice and considerable. We had our grill changed several time without even asking. I will make sure to have her next time. Make sure to try this place when you want to have some Great Korean food."}
{"text":"They have great service and really great food. Will come back again. Love their Korean BBQ and the meat are fresh. ;)"}
{"text":"I went during on Monday afternoon, when it wasn't as busy, and our waiter Ly was very nice and attentive. He helped our table out when he noticed we weren't good at cooking the various selection of meats. The meat were seasoned well and I loved the green tea salt that helped add to the flavor of the meat. Loved the price, decor, and customer service. My experience here was better than the other Gen I ate at in San Jose. Would definitely come back once every month."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Would definitely return again. The atmosphere is cool and the food is delicious. Also an amazing price for all you can eat. Our server Jaenica was really attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"it's a good place to hangout with friends....the food taste good, but service needs to be improved ;)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Saw our waiter one time when he took our order and they didn't bring out all our orders so I had to call a server which I couldn't get a hold of. I had go up to the front desk two times for a server to come by our table. I asked for a new grill the server turned off the grill and never came back"}
{"text":"Awesome food excellent service our waitress Jessica was the best we never had to ask for more drinks and she kept our table full of delicious food.We will be back and would ask for Jessica all day long!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable first experience! First time trying Korean BBQ. We were here on a Saturday at 12:00 pm and had no wait at all. Service was fantastic. Food was brought out very quickly and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and advice. Her name was Kalin. Be aware this is 90% meat menu. Not a lot of veggie options if that's your thing. All pork belly we tried was fantastic. Red Wine pork belly was my favorite. Beef was also very good and chicken was just ok for me. Did not like the shrimp just because it was too messy and too much work.  Felt like we got very good value for the price $20 ayce."}
{"text":"Really well done! I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. You would never even know you're inside a mall. Food is always on point, I especially love the Gen's marinated steak. The staff is always very attentive and everyone takes care of you, even if they aren't assigned to your table. Terry is hands down the best waiter there! Totally ask to be seated in Terry's section, he's was fantastic, very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I waited nearly two hours for seats and was amazed at how poorly this restaurant was organized and managed. I've been to several Korean Yakinikus and I can honestly say this restaurant is NOT up to par.  First off, the ambience and restaurant setting. It takes nearly an hour and a half to get seats during \"peak hours\". When you are finally jostled in, the first thing you'll realize is how tight and uncomfortable it is. The restaurant is poorly lit, cramped, and you'll often be stuck sitting next to a large party on the center tables. Unfortunately, on all three occasions I've been there, my \"table mates\" were all discourteous, raucous and unpleasant. Now, the entire blame doesn't go to the restaurant, but they are partially to blame because of the poor table layout!   Second off, the food was mediocre at best. My wife and I ordered the kalbi and bulgogi, which are staples in Korean cuisine. The kalbi was overly sweet, like someone accidentally dumped an extra cup of sugar in sweet! The bulgogi was flavorless, as if it weren't seasoned at all! The meat is clearly not fresh and not marinated properly.  Finally, the servicing. The waiters and waitresses are obviously over inundated with work. It took me nearly two minutes to get a waiter's attention and another five before they delivered my beer! There are no ways to call their attention with a button (as is the way in nearly every Yakinikus). The only way you can get their attention is if you wave frantically and call them over. It's embarrassing and inefficient. Terrible service.  The only thing this place has going for it is the pricing. $25 for an all you can eat for two hours isn't a bad deal, but what good is decent pricing if the product and service are poor?  Highly recommend that you avoid this place!"}
{"text":"We ate a Gen's Korean BBQ at Tustin, CA and were so excited to see one opening one in Henderson (at the Galleria Mall).   The food and service here is great! There is 32 items plus their appetizer menu on their AYE for only $19.95. The atmosphere is perfect. It is very clean and modern. All of the employees from the general manager to the servers were wonderful and attentive. Even with their grand opening tonight they were very much on top of their game."}
{"text":"My experience at Gen was fantastic!!! My friends and I had a lot of fun. I came on Monday as well, and this may be a little late, but our server, Luis, was exceptional. He was really kind and caring of our table. The food was amazing, especially the banchan (side dishes).  Definitely going again."}
{"text":"I had several issues with this location.  1) We asked for a table for 6 they seemed to think that 2 tables for 3 was more appropriate for us. After we voiced our concerns management made it seemed like we were being unreasonable. Uh no, if we asked for a table for 6 then logically we want to be seated together. 2) The service was awful. I'm talking about one napkin per person, 20+ minutes for bowls of rice to arrive, no refills on either water or soda.  Had this restaurant been a hole in the wall, I would have expected the service to be awful. But it wasn't. It was in a location where the service in the surrounding restaurant is generally ok. I would def not recommend this location."}
{"text":"The spicy pork bulgogi and beef tongue were excellent. I'm glad to have a Korean BBQ location close to my home. I'm definitely coming back! Our server Terry was funny and very attentive. If you have an option, try to get him as your server. He also offered some great recommendations. Hoping to see him again when I return."}
{"text":"Date night with husband..first time @ a Korean bbq joint,thought I'd give genko a try & nothing but bad experience..grill sucked ass!!!took a long time to grill my meat:( didn't have any of the appetizers I wanted..the waiter said they ran out lol..staff was friendly though..will not be visiting again!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner (yay! we made goal this month!)  Friday night and GEEZ it was packed! Expect a bit of a wait, but nothing horribly unreasonable. Probably took up around 30-minutes, during rush hour. You should get here earlier if you want to beat the crowd. They don't do reservations, so by the time we were seated, I was starving. It's $20 all-you-can-eat so it was a total steal compared to places like Sura, Honey Pig etc.  We had the smoked garlic pork belly, galbisal(?), beef tongue, and garlic calamari several times. I think I found religion. THIS must have been what heaven tasted like. The pork belly melted in my mouth. Although I felt like my party overcooked it a bit, our server (Terry I think his name was), helped us out. Most of my coworkers never had KBBQ before and when I wasn't paying attention, they seared it on their side of the grill for a little too long! It was perfect the second time around. Salty, well-seasoned enough to give you a heart attack. Glad our server paid attention heh. Coworkers were kinda hopeless haha. I mean, how hard is it to cook meat right?!  The kalbi was AMAZING. Thick, marbled meat that sizzled beautifully on the grill, it tasted fresh. My best friend (korean), is pretty critical of KBBQ joints and this, by far, blew her expectations out of the water! I can normally tell when she doesn't say anything and slightly nods and doesn't criticize the food. I was kind of shocked because she absolutely dislikes going out to eat korean foods that fall short of her expectations. Her number one complaint is usually freshness and Gen, she admitted, was pretty damn good. FINALLY, she and I can agree on something.  We had a couple waiters tend to us, but Terry stood out by doing a good job of refilling our drinks (I drink water like it's alcohol) and keeping an eye on my companions when they were stubbornly cooking the meats themselves.   Decor is very stylish and modern. Fits right in with Galleria. I like the open-air floor plan. Whatever ventilation system they have, it was way better than the other Gen I went to in Cali. My clothes didn't stink of pungent meats, which is a refreshing change. My friend complained a bit about that lol.  For the price, the quality is unparalleled. It's about $15 AYCE for lunch! Even better! I'll have to bring my other friends here next time!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here hoping they got their act together. I've been to the one in SoCal, the food and service were amazing. The food at the Henderson store is good but management is beyond horrible. They all look like chickens without a head running around with no purpose. There are empty tables but we still had to wait for 30 minutes, why?  They have no common sense with how to seat people. There were so many people that were mad and left. Get your act together, you've been open long enough. Food is good but this will not last in vegas if they don't change. Kristina our server was fabulous."}
{"text":"So yummy! Meat was good, I love beef brisket and pork belly, 14.95 dollars for all you can eat is very worth. Also, the decoration is very good and comfortable. Appetizers are good as well! I think I will come back next time!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my friends! Tried it a few times in California, so I was excited to try the Vegas location. Parking is super easy because it's located at the mall, the wait wasn't long for my big party. The interior is nice, though the tables were kind of small, but that's just because we ordered a lot at once. The menu for dinner has 34 options, we managed to try almost all the beef options. Food came fast and the portions are a good size so you don't order way too much at once! Terry and Luke were EXCELLENT and attentive! Though it was busy, they still managed to handle our table and also make the experience fun."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat Korean BBQ place in Vegas and I have tried most of them. Service was fast and excellent! We never had to wait for our food all thanks to our excellent waitress Lisa."}
{"text":"I rate them 5 star because for the price of $22 the quality of the meat and the customer service are way better than all of the cheaper korean Bbq i ever been to, be it here in vegas or LA. Me and my bf been in Gen 3 times and its ALWAYS A GREAT EXPERIENCE for us.  I love the ambiance its spacious and the contemporary and modern design made it look expensive but really its very affordable, the quality of the meat i love how the brisket is thinly cut (personal preference). The taste of the marinated meats is well balance. They also have a bar!! Yay  Customer service i love it! The smile on their faces it made me feel welcome i dont care if its fake smile or what, they check on us often if we needed anything and everyone seems to be so friendly and approachable i just hope this will never change guys this is my new favorite korean bbq now  Props to our server tonight MIZZO and the hostess (sorry forgot her name) and the other staff for giving us wonderful customer service everytime, highly recommended this place everyone if you wanna try something different than the norms."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my 3 friends here for $20 each it's worth it! 5 stars for food,place and service. Our server Seong was very helpful,nice and very entertaining. We will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Kevin our waiter was awesome.  Food was great.  Service even better!  Only thing they ran out of some foods, but other than that it was excellent."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best kbbq experiences I've ever had Eugene our server was amazing...thanks dude!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. I took my nephews here for their birthdays and our fire kept going out! They had to come light it back up at least 5 times. They couldn't at least moved us to another table. The meats wasn't as flavorful as other Korean bbq places that I've been to in Vegas and California. Definitely wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Ok so Eugene and Ozzy where the greatest serves! And the cutest! 5 Star and probably my weekend spot! Love it! They are excellent servers and have excellent food! Very clean spot as well! Best server awards!  they deserve raises!"}
{"text":"This chicken was kinda cheap but the rest of the meat was okay! Great service and nice staff. The menu was full of many options. The restaurant its self was very nice and modern! I would come here if you are looking for nice steaks and porks! I enjoyed it for the most part :)"}
{"text":"Meat was just okay ,bonchan was not much on selection not sure what all raves were about . All I can say is that another review of this place mentioned the humidity in this place,  all I got to say is  the heat was ridiculous. The temperature made dinning a bit uncomfortable. One bright spot was our server Jessica very very quick and polite . We do go to Korean BBQ 1 a month and have been to majority of the spots here in Las Vegas and we never experienced anything like the heat in this place ."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!! Modern atmosphere. Our server Julian was friendly and provided great customer service!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here on a Friday night at around 7pm. Reasonable wait time (about an hour, I thought it would be more). But the real star was our waiter Ryan, he deserves a huge raise. We asked for more rice, two bowls of rice were at our table in under 30 seconds (not exaggerating). He was regularly coming around to make sure our drinks were full and to take our next order, this is honestly the best service I've had at any restaurant! There was a nice vibe to the whole place. Oh the food was amazing too! I highly recommend the steak, it's prime cuts and super tender. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.   Its already hot outside. I expect atleast to be able to eat comfortably not swimming in sweat! My son has asthma and could barely breathe! Its a shame me and my family are regulars and love the food here. My sons favorite dish is the kfc. We have been out all day and didn't eat to save our appetite for dinner so we decided to stay and still eat because they actually had the chicken today.  Thats one more thing too. You never know when they wonmt have something on the menu. Last week they had none of the fried chickens! ALL OF THE CHICKEN WAS UNAVAILABLE. And this is an ALL YOU CAN EAT?!? And the squid bulgogi is NEVER available. Why don't they just take it off the menu if you don't even serve it anymore??   Now every single time we come, we are either greeted by the hostess or not. You have to really try to figure out what day is a good day when these people aren't in a mood. Almost every single time we come, they are never smiling. And talk to you as if its such a bother to them to have to take you to a table and explain the rules. Its as if they really hate their jobs and take it out on us customers. What kind of hostesses are these?!? The lady that had a red shirt took us to our table today. With a very annoyed and condescending tone, asked us if we've been here before we said yes and she continued to tell us the rules with the same tone. Not once did she smile and had the expression on her face as if we had done something horrible. I've worked in the food industry and understand when a customer is being really unreasonable and rude. And since I understand that, me and my family ARE never rude yet we still get treated like this with the VERY FIRST person that is supposed to take care of us. We always just let it go because the service after that is usually okay and the food comes out really quick.   But tonight was the absolute worst! Appetizers were super slow, drinks didn't come until 20 minutes later, not even getting refilled until conpletely gone, grill kept turning off and our server did the best he could to fix it but was still cooking very slowly, we were getting meats that we didn't even order and find out the server made a mistake and it was for the other table, and most especially it was HOT. I suggest no one comes here during the summer since their ac is broken!"}
{"text":"I am so glad there's finally a Korean bbq restaurant in Henderson. I've already returned several times. The food is always good and fresh. The waiters are friendly and helpful.  I've had my share of korean bbq in the southern california area, and this one is just as good."}
{"text":"Service and food was great at Gen, our server Seong was amazing as well as the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"The actual food is probably a 3.5 - 4 star. It's no Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong in LA (very far from it actually) but I didn't expect it to be.   The service was what I had issues with. We went on a Saturday night around 8, and the hostess told us the wait is about 1.5 hours. I said that's fine and wanted to put my name down. The she proceeded to \"warn\" me that their last call is at 11pm and if we are not seated by then, we can't order and that's completely my responsibility. I was very confused and said \"... but that's 3 hours from now and you quoted me 1.5 hours for the wait...\" She was like \"I know, but I just need to let you know that.\" I'm sure there's another more inviting way to tell me the same information.  Our wait ended up being ~45 min to an hour. I'm not sure if the food is worth that long of a wait (while I am fine with waiting for 2+ hours for KHDB) and the interaction with the hostess was definitely a big turn off. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The decor was a lot nicer than other Korean BBQ places in town. The staff was friendly had a good knowledge of the menu.   There was a large selection to choose from and I enjoyed everything I ordered. This place you order from a menu and a waiter brings you an adequate serving for you to cook. There were several items on the menu which were not available on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Great AYCE and lovely workers. I highly recommend the spicy pork bulgogi and sesame chicken with aioli. Shoutout to Alodia, Ozzy, and Adrien! Thanks for making our experience so great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, waiters are friendly but they seem overwhelmed. More waiters perhaps? And more mocchi too. We ordered mochi for dessert which is part of AYCE but they ran out.   Inspire of that, I I recommend GEN KBBQ, price is very affordable and the food is delish."}
{"text":"My first time ever having korean bbq. I find it very satisfying having a place where i could sit down and grill my own food. It is a very unique and interesting concept for food. Overall the food was delicious, atmosphere good, friendly staff. If you are interested in a unique and fun dining experience come here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great dining experience and authentic Korean BBQ in the Las Vegas area this is the place.  It's conveniently located, just 25 minutes from The Strip.  The atmosphere was great, modern and a lot fun.  The food was outstanding, great kimchi, also loved the steak, roast beef, pork belly and cajun shrimp.  From the pre-cooked menu the gyoza and Korean fried chicken we also very good.  Our waiter, Julian, was outstanding... excellent service!  Definitely will make the trip out the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"After a good leg day workout, the boyfriend and I were starving and in need of protein for the gainz. I suggested AYCE Kbbq, and lucky for us Gen was near our gym.   We arrived at 10:40 pm and last call was at 11:30 pm. Plenty of time for us to enjoy it all since we've had experience with kbbq under our belt. We were seated immediately and our server Ozzy greeted us and from the very beginning he led us into a great dining experience.   The food was delish, Ozzy made sure we were always doing ok, and he even offered to change out the grill multiple times. Even though it was late into his shift he always had a smile on his face. Everything was great!   The boyfriend and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food, nice and big place, service is good. Servers are fast and nice. Even the place is so busy, you don't need to wait, they come over to the table often, and serve fast. Really enjoy this place, and of course very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Korean BBQ places around the valley and a lot of them have been hit or miss. So when I heard there was a new restaurant from LA I was super excited. Some friends and I went and we all thought the place was super clean with an awesome variety of food but what made the day was our waiter. Ly was super friendly and always on top of things. He was checking in on us often to make sure everything was great and made sure to always ask if he could do anything else for us. He really went above and beyond, his customer service was outstanding. We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"There was a long wait but it is in the mall so plenty places nearby to roam or have a drink.   Loved the lively atmosphere and service but the food was pure deliciousness!   Fun date spot and perfect for a group outing."}
{"text":"This by far is the best korean bbq in Las Vegas. The quality of food is superb, the service here is on point. My recent experience was by far the best I've had so far with our server Ozzy. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is very unique, the food and service was fantastic. We couldn't believe the low prices it was a bit different cooking your own meal but now that I understand the concept I'll definitely be back a true 5 star establishment. I guess that is the reason it was busy. A must visit."}
{"text":"Ambiance and food were completely amazing. Good quality for all you can eat of $20 is a steal.   Yuhao was an amazing server who took care of our needy asses. Good ish bro."}
{"text":"The noodles are amazing. That's really the most exciting thing that comes to mind when my husband suggest we go there. You cannot possibly beat the price but along with that comes meat that can't possibly be the best quality"}
{"text":"Brand new location! Yay! Us on the westside don't have to drive to henderson for Gen. they have some new items on the menu. The hawaiian style is a marinated meat such as beef, pork or chicken with a pineapple slice. Very tasty. They also now have actual Kalbi with the 3 bones on the side. My favorite is still the super tender beef tongue.   The quality is good for an AYCE. Service is fast, friendly, and your grill gets changed out regularly.   During dinner time it is pretty packed and popular so make sure you come ready for a waitlist.   Fyi this location is waiting on it's liquor license. Hopefully it will come soon as I can't wait to have their drinks."}
{"text":"I will travel from the west side of vegas all the way to hendertucky for gen kbbq. The meat quality is superb, taste is excellent, great customer service and reasonably priced. Yes I could go to chinatown for ayce kbbq, but the customer service is always unfriendly.   Try the martini's, fruity and delicious.   The only downside of gen is that if you do a mass order, everything's comes out so fast there is no room on the table for all the plates."}
{"text":"Even with a somewhat limited menu for a Korean BBQ spot, this place is better than most. Given the location is located outside the busy Galleria Mall, it tends to get quite busy. Service is decent, nothing outstanding, and nothing terrible. You get your food pretty quickly, but prepare to wait on your drink refills. A good spot for some easy, laid-back Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"OPENING DAY REVIEW  Moving from California, my husband and I are tough customers. You see, mostly every kbbq at California have similarities in menu options but the quality of the meat is what matters the most for us. That's why you wouldn't catch us in any 9.99 spot in California anymore since we've experienced a handful of premium quality meats in the 19.99 or 25.99 spots or even worse, per plate! Eeks now that's pricey but delicious!  We went at around 4pm. The crowd was a good crowd. Wasn't too hectic. We were seated within 10 minutes of waiting with a group of 7 (two kids included) which are 9.99 four years and up. Gratuity is included in groups of 6 or more FYI. We had to remind them of the salads and jap cha noodles since you can notice that with so many side dishes available, they can't keep track of whats supposed to be handed out without question. Haha. We weren't offended at all. We already know wassup. Being a waiter/waitress in hard enough, now imagine at an AYCE kbbq spot, that's almost suicide so  we have respect for them and try to be patient with no more than having to ask more than 2x of a 5-10 minute wait span.   Their noodles are really! I've tasted a good amount of glass noodles where it either had too much onions and carrots and everything mixed it to ones that were hella peppered up and all you taste was pepper to ones that were overly oiled and flavored up. This is a winner for me! Light on everything topping and flavor wise. Brisket meat was on point. Good cut and good enough fats on it. We tried their house steak but wasn't my favorite. The gen at California had thicker cuts with better texture on each bite. We used to just ask for pepper and salt to season it before throwing it on the grill. The beef tongue was one of the best yet, I'm speaking for my husband at this point coz I don't eat beef tongue at all but he kept going and going and going on it. He asked for lemon on the side so he was really happy with that. The Cajun chicken was devoured by my mom. She expressed how much she liked the seasoning as well. The pork belly was delicious. The wine pork belly is good if you're into wine marinated meats. You will taste the wine I can promise you that. The Cajun shrimp was good. You don't get that ocean taste. The calamari was alright and squid was alright. We really missed the Hawaiian steak that the Gens offer at California. That was honestly one of my favorites dish selection over there. Salad was on point! I don't know about you but I am a salad girl. The dressing was perfect. The slices were perfect. I went on and on with that. I literally had more than 10 plates of their salad alone. Perfect spice. Their brisket sauce is good too. Not too strong and not too light. They will change you grill no matter how many times you ask! Also you're not stuck with one waiter/waitress. Don't be shy to just ask anyone. They're all friendly and ready to serve you.  3 disappointing facts .. NO RICE PAPER, NO EGG POT and NO TOFU/BEAN SOUP! I've talked to the manager about it and he said they will not get any rice paper, they will not get egg pot since they didn't offer that in Cali and I stated that the Gen in California, Cerritos was starting it since I was there before we left for Vegas. They will not get tofu or bean soup since they offer miso soup and honestly their miso soup is too strong and too salty and very plain. No green onions on it nor does it have an tofu in it at all. It's more like a a tofu soup pack that you just microwave at home -__-   Overall, we're going back for the price and quality of their meats and side dishes. But very sad and upset that there's no rice paper and no tofu soup at least. The manager said he'll pass on my request and suggestions but I don't see it going that far unless we all team up and complain but then again, they're already winning with the price and quality they offer so I'm pretty sure people wouldn't give a damn in the end of rice paper or soup coz it's all about the meats anyway right?!   THANK YOU FOR OPENING UP GEN KBBQ! You've given me a little piece of \"home\" leaving California to live here :)"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for fathers day to try this restaurant called ahead to see the wait times  we where told 40 min which was acceptable over 30 min drive we get there and where told a/c wasn't working like really couldn't have told us this over the phone fathers day was ruin since we planned this 2 days before checking out reviews ect ect  ended up going next door to a burger place smh"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner and happy hour! Our server Kailin was AMAZING! The entire staff was quick and efficient. Great job everyone!"}
{"text":"Our service was great. Our waiter made us laugh, kept our waters filled, and was on it when it came to changing our the grill. Food was amazing and didn't take long to get to our table after ordering. My favorite Korean BBQ place !!"}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I'm a bit biased towards Korean BBQ since I've grown up eating Korean BBQ in Koreatown in LA. However, in Henderson, Gen contends to be a very comparable KBBQ venue for transplants from LA.  The lunch is $15 on weekdays and dinner (and weekends lunches) are $20. The premise is all you can eat (AYCE) meat, and most of the meat is decent quality. Some AYCE restaurants serve low quality meats so they can bring your a tremendous quantity, but Gen doesn't compromise quality. The beef brisket and tongue are very tender and juicy even if you have to cook it yourself and believe me, I've gotten way more plates of those order than I should. Their pork belly (samgyupsal) is worth trying although I'm only a moderate fan of that cut. Their soy sauce has a mild tart and sweet flavor which adds a unique flavor when you dip meat into it. You can ask for all sorts of side dishes included in the price such as japchae (glass noodles), calamari, tofu soup, etc.  I'm somewhat of a KBBQ veteran having eaten at many AYCE KBBQ places, and Gen is near the top in my overall list of KBBQ to visit again.  The parking is at the Galleria Mall. And if you have to wait for seating, which can happen during dinnertime, you can always wait while shopping at the mall.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive even when business gets busy.  They have you pay your check on an iPad which can be unsual for some folks, but they make the process very easy and low-pressure as they look away when you select a tip amount in front of them."}
{"text":"The food is exceptionally good and the service is second to none.  The Hostess, Shea was literally running around to make certain that everyone was being attended to.  I have never seen this excellence in service in any other restaurant."}
{"text":"Gen is a great place to get some Korean BBQ! The interior makes it feel modern and trendy which is nice compared to other bbq places in the valley. The meats are delicious and fill you up! I'm a big fan of the pork belly and their mashed potatoes were surprisingly good. My only issue with this place, like with others, is the REALLY long wait. We went on a Friday at around 7, and had to wait a little over 2 hours for a table. But at least the food makes up for it. It's conveniently located at the Tempe Marketplace, so you can walk around while you wait for a text that a table is ready. Another con is that we had to sit up on the bar stools in the middle of the restaurant. At that point, we were HANGRY, and not eating and leaving because of a bar stool was not an option. I preferred a booth but oh well. Touching elbows with a stranger isn't the best experience! The waiters were attentive, but some of our orders got mixed up which is understandable since it was hectic!   My conclusion: only go here if you are willing to wait for a table and have time to spare!"}
{"text":"great food, so many option, all you can eat with only $20.  Since they just opened, very busy, u guys should come before 5, so u dont have to wait in line.  Customer service needs to improve, we had to call them several times to order, but I give 5 star bc of the food"}
{"text":"Great customer service as always and great food selection. The orders took a little linger than usual though but it still is good. Their marinated bulgogi is always our favorite and its pretty tasty. Great time!"}
{"text":"Great experience at GEN, foods awesome. Our server Ozzy was great and always had a positive attitude. Totally will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I give 4 stars for the service and ambiance. They actually work as a cohesive unit and take care of their customers. The girl up front as the hostess is very pretty 2 lol. The food is ok nothing to brag about compared to all the LA spots. I guess I have high standards being from Cali. But for all the people in AZ who have yet to experience Kbbq it probably would be a good starting point for them since they wouldn't know any better. Hopefully this is the start of Kbbq spots being supplanted in the Valley."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic,  I would of given 5 stars. but no lettuce to make lettuce wraps. Which almost every Koream bqq restaurant has, Other than that.  The servers were on que, Kevin and Joe. Joseph was very polite an he was the person that came up after we finished eating. An asked how was everything ?  We had a fabulous time my husband and I. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner tonight at gens and had an amazing experience with Ozzy as our server. He was quick and patient. Our food came out really fast and he always checked in on us to change our grill."}
{"text":"Very satisfying food and service. Clean place plus the pork belly is the bomb!!!   Our server, Kristina was very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Plan to wait for a table since it is popular and they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"Kailin was so sweet! we came in right before the crazy rush and she was still awesome! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Always yummy food! Juan was our server he was fast getting our food out & great service. We were offered a grill change as soon as our grill got dirty. Juan checked on us & made sure our drinks stayed full. The sesame chicken is really good."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and service gets better and better each time I go! Bumped up the lunch price by a dollar but that's fine with me!"}
{"text":"Nice interior and awesome service!!! Great korean bbq!!!! I would definetly want to comeback!!!"}
{"text":"oh my god (jesus) the meat here is so dank  oh my god. oh my god.  dank dank dank dank"}
{"text":"We have been to several Korean BBQ places and this is by far the best! Great atmosphere, tons of fun, and the waitstaff was incredible. Thanks for making our day Jessica!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good location. Good Service. Kudos to our server, Kristina! Drove all the way from the westside to see what the hype is all about. I must say it did not dissapoint."}
{"text":"Service was excellent but the food was okay. I've eaten at the other branch in Henderson and hoping that my experience would be the same but sadly it wasn't. The soft tofu stew didn't have a lot of flavor and tasted like it was watered down. The bulgogi didn't have a lot of flavor also which was sad cz it's one of my favorite meats to get at KBBQs. I wished there were a couple more sauces available for the meats. Overall, I wasn't as satisfied as I wanted to be."}
{"text":"2nd time here and first review for yelp. Im a huge fan of Gen Kbbq from California. So happy they made on in Vegas. We are from north side and we made the drive all the way here. Let me tell u that it is worth it!!! Our server LISA!!! Is the best. She recommended dishes to us and was very attentive and made sure our gen kbbq experience was on point! Shoutout to her and hopefully u guys will have Lisa be ur server. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Awesome service from the birthday boy, Ozzy and his crew! Thank you for the hospitality! Much love and aloha"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Thank you for bringing this to Henderson, NV. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's practically right down the street! To feed two people the prices are very reasonable and the food is always good! The service is always fantastic and fast! This has become one of our go to stops for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Our server was alodia, she was sweet and attentive! The wait on a Saturday night was an hour, didn't expect that. Food was great! Our fav was the spicy pork bugogi. Don't get the squid for the grill, but the app squid was delicious! They serve very small portions of the Korean veggies like Kim Chee! Asked at least 10x to refill!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but our main server went MIA after taking our first order. We were done with our first round of orders & waited 20-30mins before we decided to flag down another server to place our next orders. The 2nd server took over our table and made sure we were taken cared of. At the end of our meal, our 1st server came by to apologize & that was nice. The food came out fast and the seafood was very fresh. They ran out of certain items tonight, so we will have to come back another time to try the bovine intestines. The ice cream macarons were delicious as well. Fun experience & very good food!"}
{"text":"Just when you think you've had every kind of food Gen opens up at the Galleria Mall. It's a little intimidating when you never actually cooked on a Korean Table grill for yourself, but once you get the hang of it it was great. Our server Raymond was very attentive and Swift was bringing out the dishes and clearing the empties. The Decor is beautiful and The lighting focused on your table. We tried several dishes but my wife and I's favorite was the number 10 which is a delicious food and sliced beef to cook something a minute or two. The all you can eat style I want you to try many different dishes without filling up on one. We tried the Cajun shrimp only to discover that the heads were left on not something Americans are used to.   Dinner all you can eat is $19.95 it's well worth it. Ask for Raymond for a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"Servers: Brian and Yuhao! I used to always go to the Gen BBQ in Southern California so I was excited when I learned that this place opened up in Henderson! Definitely a must go place if you're in the area. Fresh meat and great environment!"}
{"text":"Visited the Henderson location for the first time. Long time customers of the SoCal locations. The restaurant was clean and the food was delicious, as always. The difference today was the service! JESSICA was incredibly pleasant and friendly and anticipated all of our needs! She was fantastic! And the bus service was fast and efficient as well, changing out our grill 5 different times.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great place for K-Bbq, perfect environment. Fresh meat and great service, still love the spicy octopus!!! My server Bo and Yuhao are very helpful."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ hands down. A must go to when in vegas. Customer service is over the top. Good service and good food can't get any better!"}
{"text":"One of the best K BBQ spots in town. Fun atmosphere, prices are decent, and tons of food. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm finally glad AZ has stepped up their game and got an amazing AYCE Kbbq place.  They have been in desperate need for one and always fall short of expectations when there's a new kbbq joint. When AZ had their first AYCE at ohya! It was hype, but didn't live up to it due to limited days and hours, plus their food was mediocre. They ran the show for some times and the locals weren't that impressed, but what can you do when they're the only one offering AYCE at the time. Just recently, Gangnam Kbbq opened up and it raised the bar and it temporarily became AZ AYCE Kbbq to go with tier options and better quality food than ohya!  Now the bar has been set even higher and I don't believe any Kbbq AYCE can compete for awhile. The location is at Tempe Market Place which is a great location with high traffic. I've been to many Gens in SoCal and absolutely love the variety of meats along with the service, atmosphere, and quality of food. I was super stoked and have been constantly checking their Facebook to see when they would open and finally it became a reality.  The expectations were met and they delivered it and I couldn't be happier!   My favorite dish was the Crispy Cajun Chicken! It was absolutely flavorful along with their typical bulgogi, galbi, pork belly and so on. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Kbbq and AYCE. For $25 to stuff your face, you can't really beat that! The service was great and they kept refilling our waters, see if we needed any more meats, changed our grills timely, and made sure we got all of our sides and drinks. Exceptional service, amazing food, and great atmosphere!   The only small gripe is I didn't try the pork cheek, but I'll be sure to get that next time! Hopefully they'll open more and more locations in AZ!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend it...The waiting time is absurd and by the time they call you you will be starving. You will sit in front of a grill and you will morph into cave man as you wait for the meat, chicken and shrimp to cook, cutting it in small pieces. The two hours that your allowed will go fast and in a frenzy you will forget that you were once a human person and you will eat until you feel faint or pass out!... and mumble to yourself...what did I just do... Will I go back again? Damn rights I will...!  :)"}
{"text":"We had our anniversary dinner and the staff our friendly and Raymond  sat us down quite quickly even if it was busy  and took our drink order while Lisa is still attending to a guest . They explained the menu pretty well . Lisa was our server and she frequently checked us if we needed  a drink refill or want to order more from their extensive menu . Excellent food  love the baby spicy octopus , garlic pork belly , Cajun prawns , signature steaks , japchae , and all the chef recommendations are a must try .Definitely value for money  and will come back again ."}
{"text":"So frustrating! I requested two tables so we can have two separate grills, but the host refused!

Main reason for two grills and two table request is a health concern, cross contamination and seafood allergy which my son has, they still refused.

{"text":"Without a doubt the most phenomenal experience I've had at Gen Korean BBQ. As a regular of the location I really would like to take the time to recognize my server Ozzy who was attentive and very friendly. He took the time to answer any questions, was patient, and even offered his personal favorites with me.   Professionalism and courtesy of service abound at this restaurant. Combine that, with consistent food quality I will continue to frequent this location and bring new people to experience Gen Korean BBQ.   Definitely a stand out in Las Vegas being the only location here in the valley."}
{"text":"I went to this new Korean bbq yesterday. I was impressed this is well decorated restaurant. The food was so good and price is soooo worthy. Unlike other bbq restaurants, I am also surprised they have excellent service. Kailin served me this time, she is a nice girl and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"I have ordered spicy chicken 3 times. That is my favorite?Korean food is spicy entrance?then you will feel the sweetness. I will come again to this restaurant?not only the waiter are polite?and this restaurant's meat is really fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"food was incredible. my drink never made it to the half way point without being asked if I wanted a refill. awesome service from every aspect. well with the monies"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ In Town! Great Food & Great Service All Around! Big Thanks To Alodia For The AMAZING Service! Definitely try it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This is first Gen in Las Veagas. I arrived on Monday in lunch time with big party of my classmates. I have higher expectation to be here. The foods are amazing and particularly hangjungsal and miso porkbelly are my favorite! I would like to visit here again!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and it was terrific! The place was very clean and the food was awesome! If you like Korean BBQ then you have to try Gen. Great job Alodia!!"}
{"text":"Very nice Korean BBQ place. Good service and great food. Would recommend coming here often."}
{"text":"The food is incredibly delicious and the pricing structure is really awesome. But you will leave smelling like you've been working in a kitchen over a hot griddle so do not wear anything that requires dry cleaning or that you don't intend on washing or leaving outside your house."}
{"text":"I have now been to this restaurant quite a few times, and I have never been disappointed!  The food is always great!  It's one of my favorite places... and that's saying a lot considering we live in the vacation capital of the world!  Seriously, there are places on the strip that are absolutely divine, but they are very pricey and not meant for any day of the week.  Gen is affordable enough for a Tuesday night and good enough for a Saturday night, but why choose?  I think I will just go both nights!"}
{"text":"Since moving from CA to AZ I'd been in search of a good Korean BBQ spot for some time and had yet to find one. I was so excited when I found out Gen was coming to The Valley as I had frequented their CA locations on several occasions. I visited this location on a Sunday afternoon and it did not disappoint! The wait for a table was about an hour but it was well worth the wait. The food and service were great. For almost $25 you can get a an amazing all you can eat dinner. This restaurant is also very nice on the inside and I like the ambiance. Full bar and lots of TV's. If you like BBQ definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing! Service from Seaver was stellar and prompt. We got the garlic shrimp, sesame chicken and marinated steak which were all incredibly fresh. Just as good if not better than the California location!"}
{"text":"Love my dining experience here today! Even though it is not very traditional KBBQ restaurant, everything tastes soooo good. Our server Yuhao and Bo provided great services. They were knowledgeable about their dishes and very friendly! We will definitely come back for great food and services!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Gen my very first time 4/5 during happy hour late night! Not only was the food great but the best apart about my experience was the guest service. Jessica was our server for our group and with us all being new she was there to guide us through every step of the way! While it seemed that she was the only server on the shift and a handful of tables she managed to make sure that we were all taken care of. If you aren't aware of the great service she provides I hope that this shows you. Being a restaurant manager she stood out above and beyond the standard you get in any other restaurant and that is something that is great for your business. Thanks for the great food and absolutely amazing service!"}
{"text":"They're the best Korean Bbq in vegas. Nowhere here can beat them for sure. Too many side dish and different kinds of meat we can order. Finally, I can find a place to eat Korean bbq, instead of driving to LA to have All that u can eat Bbq. 5 stars for them"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have loved the food. The first time was better than the last because our waitress was very attentive and made sure our side dishes and drinks were refilled and that we had more plates as soon as we ran out. The second time, our server rarely checked on us. We had to ask for water, serving plates, food plates, side dishes from any worker we saw. The food here is really good and you can have a really great experience, specially with a group, if you have good service. So I do recommend it, but wish you luck."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. Words cannot express the talent of this place. Great price and excellent selection. The staff and managers are super friendly and make sure you have a unique experience. Check this place out you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I really like Korean bbq and this one is the best ever that I have eaten. The bf brisket is soft and delicious, the short rib is marinated well and fresh. The canjun shrimp is my favorite. The service is really good, very nice stuff. The only thing is that the desert is not included. Five star recommended."}
{"text":"Kristina, Blake, and the team provided world-class service during our visit. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Everyone raved about this restaurant....don't know why. The music is overwhelmingly loud. If you're smart order right away...and in multiples. Some items will show up and some won't unless you ask for it twice. The wait staff are overwhelmed...they cant keep up...even with the mini iPad clover technology they use. How is the service so awful when someone else is running all of your food???? So if the server spends most of they're time on the iPad why can't they smile? Be Happy? Have a fun personality? How about a thank you for joining us? The food could of been awesome but we wouldn't return just because of the poor uncaring blah service. Been there, did that, and won't do it again!"}
{"text":"Went with a party of around 40 for a class trip from UNLV. For having so many people come in so quickly, the staff remained attentive and put together. The prices for AYCE for both lunch and dinner are AMAZING.   Venue is very spacious and modern. Tamara was our server and worked her butt off! Overall had a great experience, will definitely bring my family and friends here."}
{"text":"This place is worth the price if you know how the system works and get there as soon as doors open. The food is great, especially their Korean fried chicken. The atmosphere is cool and chic, but the music can be too loud at times. The service depends really, sometimes you get friendly, fast moving servers and sometimes you get ones who rarely show up to your table. All in all great place for friends or family to eat together at."}
{"text":"So glad this place popped up on yelp when me and my friend decided last minute to eat Korean BBQ. We didn't know that it was ONLY all you can eat kbbq otherwise we would have saved our stomach to eat some more but the pricing wasn't bad. The restaurant is very clean and the employees were very helpful! They had the table all ready with all the Kim chi side dishes, a salad and jap chae out for us to eat. We ordered gen beef bulgogi (my favorite), spicy pork belly (second favorite), Cajun calamari (wasn't a big fan, id rather have fried calamari), and gen hangjungsal (the meat was really dry).. wish our stomach could take more food in but that's all we ordered! I love that the employees switch off the grill after each meat we cook so that we don't taste the other meat or continue cooking it on a burnt grill."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Korean BBQ joints in town. If you see a long line, it's worth the wait. Just go to your car if you want and  just give them your #, they'll text you when your table is ready.   Everything on the menu is fresh and very good. I've tried it all and will continue to eat everything on the menu.. The wait staff is very nice  and on top of it. They always keep drinks full, plates full and grill changed when needed. They have good drinks too. The pomegranate soju is good and so is the coconut martini."}
{"text":"This place was good. The beef bulgogi and shortribs were are most favorite to eat and cook. Didn't take forever like the chicken. Overall we had a good experience and Kailin our server was really ni e and attended to us, which was good. Because I am all about great customer service. Its what keeps you coming back!"}
{"text":"eh. this place is eh. have gone there 2-3 times and not really impressed.  quality of meat is okay. better than the average kbbq place but not enough for me to say anything. wish the beef tongue would be bigger portions/not sliced so thin.   service. fine in the beginning and then goes downhill. staff tends to be forgetful. (asked for rice 3 times, salt twice, and gave up trying to refill banchan) also tends to confuse things (asked the green salt, gived me reg salt and sesame oil instead... k.)   annoying issues. fix up your ventilation. it gets so smoky in there it almost looks like fog during peak times.   also. no rice paper. sad face."}
{"text":"This is our second time here with me and my bf and service has always been great! The food is great and the price is super reasonable! But shout out to our awesome waitress lisa! Great service experience and awesome character! Always on it and quick!"}
{"text":"Everyone at this location is super friendly we had a party of 10 for lunch and all of the servers always checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed. Our drinks were never empty, our grills were always cleaned and all of our dirty plates were taken. Our server Kenny was awesome and Eugene made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Come here to fill your tummy, and that's about it. Food was very mediocre. Been to many Korean restaurants and this was definitely not worth its money."}
{"text":"Came for lunch/dinner and was not disappointed. $20 for dinner and the menu selection was bomb. Our server Raymond was on point and was always asking if we needed anything. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Modern venue, attentive staff, and a large selection of quality meats without the hassle of China town!"}
{"text":"Somewhere in between 4 & 5 stars, but being a little generous here because I understand the stresses of working in a busy environment.  Went here around 7PM, & wasnt surprised to know that there would be at least an hour wait. It's dinner time at an AYCE location, no biggie. Once we were notified that a table was ready two dishes, a salad & noodle, were brought out as appetizers as well as 6 little sides arranged by the grill.   We ordered brisket, pork belly & premium steak to grill. We also ordered this panko breaded chicken & cheese with a dark sauce... I want to say it's similar to katsu, even the sauce. Also KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) that came with a creamy sesame? sauce, both were pretty good! Rice all around & of course we had to get more of the noodles.  Our server was a little busy & had to come back to the table multiple times when he could have made it with one trip.. but it was just simple things like refilling drinks or getting sauce. And at the end there was a mix-up with checks from our table & another table getting the wrong change. Because of those things, I gave 4 stars.  Maybe coming back at a less busy time (whenever that may be for dinner) it'll be a more seamless experience with the service. But the quality of the meats were great, & the food that is already prepared is hot & delicious! Can't want to go back!"}
{"text":"Only the quality of meat was good. But every single dishes like meats, side dishes and soup were suuuuuper sweet. Even kimchi lol. It maybe because their major customers are American American.  Side dish sit there for a long time b4 we got sit(already another yelper mentioned in other review) so every dishes were super dry and the portion was way too small and looks like left over.  Service was also sooooo slow.  It was the worst korean bbq. Oh ye. Interior of restaurant was very good."}
{"text":"Cup was dirty. Shear wasn't sharp enough. The material of the seats were broken on several of the booths. Banchan is placed on all of the tables just sitting there and does not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Oh wow this place is great! The food was so good, service was crazy fast, and our server Ozzy was great! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not accommodating to family. Should have more grills. Chinatown has better options and more attentive/skilled workers."}
{"text":"It's my second time to here. Good BBQ restaurant! I like the beef tongue and brisket! Try it!!! Thanks to our server Raymond. He is really friendly and being patient!"}
{"text":"Whenever you have all you can eat paired with Korean bbq, you'll always be happy. The price point to this place is pretty good also! $20.xx per person for dinner, not sure if any different during lunch. Your entire party MUST be there before they seat you which is quite irritating if you ask me but whatever. Now, I've only gone here once (first time waited 20 minutes for a back to back table for a party of 8) because the second time I came the wait time was about 2 hours! And it was a Monday around 7:30pm! Food is on point, didn't care too much for the flavored sojus. We tried the lychee flavor and it tasted more like the lychee juice from the cans. Tried a lot of the meats on the menu and I especially liked the cow tongue. It wasn't too gamey like most places and the pork belly was super good. I loved that I didn't my smell too much like the food because the vents were also inside of the grill. Lots and lots of parking since it's located at the mall"}
{"text":"Awesome late dinner with my friends here. Great food and great service!! We had Ozzy as our waiter and he was wonderful to us and really took care of us! We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Food and service was great..no wait but could be that we went at 3:30 but Seong was amazing and they offered to change our grill more than once. Kaitlin checked on us at the end. Super friendly and will come again"}
{"text":"Awesome place and food!! Alodia and Bo our waitress are very kind, friendly very very nice!!"}
{"text":"Price point, great. Service, not so great. It's all you can eat, but quite the feat if you can get our server Terry's attention. Not once did Terry grab refills for our drinks even though he came to the table multiple times, the bussers picked up the slack (thank you bussers). We recommend spending a few extra bucks and going to one of the other kbbq placses in china town. Too trendy and just not worth the 90+ minute wait on weekends. Cannot say we will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! When we go to LA this was a place we always liked going to and when one opened in town it was good news! If you are super hungry the wait can make it a challenge! The wait sometimes is over an hour! But the food is pretty awesome! Their little side dishes of mashed potatoes, salad and coleslaw are so good! You can request over and over! The meat is always fresh and well seasoned! The Hawaiian pork belly is sooo good, so is the ribs and the brisket. As far as seafood the shrimp doesn't come clean so it can get messy trying to eat the shrimp. For the price you pay, you get your worth!"}
{"text":"It took them 10 mins to sit us when there were alot of empty sits.  Our server took forever to get our orders. He made alot of mistakes.. 1st we want 2 miso soup and gave us 1, japchae we ordered never came but when we follow it up they were no more!! Our drinks never get refilled.  Server didn't even bother to drop by and ask if we need to order again. Our pans are so dirty that the food tasted burnt. We asked for a replacement but it took awhile as well. Servers cant be found anywhere.   The food is ok, there were other korean restaurant i have been that are way better especially when it comes to customer service.  To manager, you gotta teach your employees customer service because its not about the food alone but how you keep your customers taken care off.   Its very frustrating because its a new place but due to the bad customer service, i wont come back and i wont recommend it either"}
{"text":"Dajuan is an awesome waiter! He was very attentive and his service was impeccable. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food! Service was top notch! Everyone that walked by asked if we needed something. Food was delivered quickly. Our server was Rizy, great friendly service. Very happy with our visit. Will definitely visit when we are in town again."}
{"text":"The reason why i give it 2 stars because food quality is bad the  (Premium pork belly) was old and it had a smelly i told the server it was old meet so he had ask us to order another this times pork belly with wine same results taste. Please WORK ON THE MEET..."}
{"text":"We were all feeling like having Korean BBQ for lunch so we Yelped some places around the area off the strip. We knew Gen from back home so we decided to go to this location. We were seated fairly quickly. Our server, Jaenica, was super sweet and she helped us to enjoy our experience at the restaurant. We had the AYCE BBQ and enjoyed most of the meat that we had ordered. She was so prompt with our orders and refills for our drinks.  Location: At the mall. Plenty of parking (parking lot). Easy access and easy to find.  Food: Beef tongue and the beef short plate was really good today. Brisket was so-so and it may be due to the flavor? We aren't sure on the reason why on that one. I wished they would give us more of the side dishes at one time so we don't have to keep asking for them.  Service: Really great, attentive. Even the people that weren't our server was helpful  We would definitely come back if we were in the area or in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time i ate at gen. our server was Jaenica. She was fabulous! We enjoyed her service and the food so much! she was so helpful in deciding on what to try. I am seriously considering having my 30 th birthday there and requesting her as our server. The atmosphere was fun! Enjoyed our evening very much!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ! Yes, you cook your own meat.  All the beef and pork dishes are great. The spicy squid and octopus were well marinated. I don't usually eat the chicken because it takes too long to cook.  Some cons since it's the soft opening. The staff are still new and learning what to do. So service is a bit slow and unrefined.  Not all the side dishes were available yet. They did not have yogurt SOJU yesterday, because they ran out. Blasphemy! A Korean place without soju. I can't even.  I'm sure things will improve as time goes on.  Also,  WHY NO SKIRT STEAK??! and no rice paper?! This makes me very sad."}
{"text":"So Im half korean and we always eat at the k bbq place on the strip but we decided hey why not try the kbbq place near sunset station. WRONG MOVE. The side dishes next to our table were sitting there for an hour!! And the meat is mygod so fucking bland. The GARLIC belly tasted like ham not garlic. WAT DAFUQ. Worst kbbq experience ever. If you want real kbbq thats good go to the strip right next to walgreens is ginseng kbbq. Im not sponsored or some sht. They have real korean aunties who will help while u cook ur meat. And the meat is waay better there"}
{"text":"All of the bbq meats are very good yet all of the side dishes are poor imitation of real Korean dishes, also too sweet, too salty, over cooked noodle and so so soup, also the side dishes are already setup on the tables are not a good idea, drying out and it's not a good idea! Over all"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I'm so excited we have a Gen in Vegas. I know I'm late on my review, but whatevs. The beef tongue is AMAZING. That's all I order here, tbh. Thank god they started serving rice paper and radish. I don't think they did when they first opened. Also, the KFC chicken is pretty good. I would've given a 3-4 star rating because our waiter was ehh the last time we went. I believe his name was Julian or something. He rarely stopped by our table so we can order more. I gave a 5 star for Alan. Even though he wasn't our waiter, he checked up on us and was very prompt with everything we ordered. Totally made up for the bad service we started out with."}
{"text":"This was a really fun atmosphere. We went on a Friday night and it was definitely full, even at a later dinner time. Luckily, there were four spots at the bar that we were able to nab, which still made for a fun experience.  We did the AYCE dinner experience and honestly, it's a great price for what you're getting. The bar was set up so that there was a grill between two people and we were still able to talk and enjoy each other. The noise level was a little high, but nothing that dampened our experience.   It's not even worth listing everything we tried because I'm pretty sure we tried about 60% of the menu. It was all very yummy and filling and I didn't think the meats were too salty or anything. Our waiter was great and accommodating and since we were at the bar, the bartender was great as well. Our grill was changed out once it got pretty dirty, we didn't even have to ask.   Summary: There are a lot of options on the menu / it's a large, great space / clean and great customer service / yum.  Next time: I want to try their desserts that they showcase in the front - was too full from dinner last time!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Great food!  The servers were fast, efficient, and engaged. We had a really enjoyable dinner on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego, had to AYCE once.  Our hosts brought us to this spot in the Tempe Marketplace.  We arrived about 12:30 on a Saturday and we had a party of 9 (with 2 kids), so we opted out of the High Table in fear of the kids playing and falling off.  The high table looked like the only thing that could accommodate (comfortably) more than 6?  That said we ended up getting split up into 2 booths, at least back to back.  FYI - they don't have steamed egg here!  If that's a deal breaker, beware.  What they do have:  A very extensive menu, of raw meats, seafood - as well as some cooked appetizers!  The first round of meats we ordered were served on these huge plates, with what looked like single servings.  At first we were a little sad, but as we got settled in - we actually really like it. - Why?  The service was SWIFT, and we were able to try, and eat a  lot of variety, because that's how every meal should be.  All of the food tasted very high quality.  All of our servers were always available when we needed them, grill change was quick when requested.   It really improved the experience (And made up for not having steamed egg).  The location is great, good spacing between tables, high ceiling, good ventilation (a requirement for this type of meal), and overall good experience.  Looking forward to our San Diego/Mira Mesa location to open and hope they can replicate it - and have steamed egg."}
{"text":"Sitting in a booth with a full tummy. The service was awesome (Thank you Eugene!). He and the rest of the team tonight were on point. The price was right. They offered my favorite radish wraps without me asking and also have soy wraps. They have a large AYCE menu. We'll be back. It's super busy,  so I would suggest coming around 6 if you don't want to get stuck with a wait."}
{"text":"The service here was so bad. I loved the food, but it couldn't make up for how terrible the service was. It was busy and there was only one server working. His English was poor so he couldn't understand us very well. It took him 30 minutes and us reminding him 4 times to get me a water. He forgot our order multiple times, and never told us that something we ordered wasn't on the menu anymore. When I asked a girl working there for my water, she acted super confused. It took them 15 minutes to get our check. I asked the server for it multiple times, and he said \"I'll ask for it\". Why did my server have to ask for our check? Also, my server asked my sister how old she was for no reason. We didn't buy alcohol and she was very embarrassed. The door was full of people and the hostess ignored them. This place needs help. Do not recommend and was embarrassed I brought my sister here on her trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a amazing price.  Its a little bit of a drive to get to but it's worth it.  My brother loves this place and wants to go all the time.  Favorite meats are the brisket, roast beef, pork belly, and the Cajun shrimp. I go to their California location everytime I visit my family and am so glad they decided to open a location here. The quality here is a little worst than their California locations but it's still better than other places you can find in town at this price.  They do have long lines though but they have a good app to track your place in line so you can wonder around mall while waiting."}
{"text":"You can't argue with AYCE $14.99 Korean BBQ lunch price! All the starters, side dishes and meats (excluding kalbi and a few others) was all inclusive. It's at the Sunset Galleria so it's easily accessable.  I know it sounds great but I really am three staring it. The meat was a bit bland and I really needed to season it. We tried a lot the meats including the cheese fried pork steak. Everything want ok, not great.   Now the ambience is great and the service is fast and friendly! I might get back if my daughter drags me here. Otherwise it is a one time deal for me."}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for the simple things... This place had them. I love what I know as traditional KBBQ salad, a simple green with a light, sweet and tangy vinegar dressing - they had it. Rice paper to make little tacos with my bulgogi - they had it. Sesame oil for my salt - they had it.   Not to mention the price is killer and the service from David from Hawaii was on fleek.   My fiancée enjoyed this place as much as I did which is almost unachievable for most places.   I will be back; weekly I'm sure."}
{"text":"Finally! It took forever for it to be finished up and open for business! I've been waiting for it to open because I love their California locations!   If you've never had all you can eat Korean BBQ before, you'll definitely want to have Gen be the first place you try. If you go for lunch, it's $16 with a large selection of choices, and if you go for dinner, it's $25 with some added dinner items that are delicious. Bugolgi, Hawaiian Pork Belly, and Beef belly are my favorites. The first two are already marinated so you don't need to dip them into any of their sauces. But for the last one you can dip it into any of the three provided options - which are all good. And if you don't know what to order, they have little markers on the menu pointing out which ones are the top choices - but you can't go wrong.   Downsides of Gen: (honestly there's really none) -You can only order 4 items at a time, but it's fine because you can't cook everything at once.  -They can only split the bill at a max of 3 different ways  -2 hours is the max you can stay (but you'll be plenty full by then)  Conclusion: EAT HERE. The first REAL AYCE Korean bbq in Arizona. Nothing compares to it. And do yourself a favor, come with an appetite. I promise you'll get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, they have IT ALL. Def the best KBBQ in Vegas. This is now my go to spot & will be taking friends when they come to visit!"}
{"text":"This place is getting better and better.  Our server Eugene was wonderful.  He was always there and taking care of us.  Made sure we had all our drinks filled and his customer service was top notch.  Would definitely come here again and hope all the waiters meet up to par to him."}
{"text":"This Gen location is just okay. Coming from Southern California this place can use some work. The customer service was great, however they did take a while to retake my order and I constantly had to ask for my serve for little things like napkins.   I went during dinner time and it was not to crowded at all, which was part of why I think they need to up the customer service.  Overall a decent place out here to eat."}
{"text":"Good Korean all you can eat.  Warning this is not a traditional Korean restaurant. More of an American style rating with the fun of a Korean BBQ at your table.   The main courses are good. The side dishes were a good variety but they run out of some items or are \"seasonal\".  The was good but a few days older than the way I prefer and they didn't have fresher. (A personal preference thing with kimchee enthusiasts.) OverAll a good Korean BBQ.  Kid friendly too."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Great Food, Great Service!! Our server Ozzy was amazing, all smiles!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and caught my eye when I was looking on Yelp. I love a Korean BBQ and decided to try somewhere off the strip. The atmosphere was wonderful to walk into and very welcoming. Just a fair warning they do not have a liquor license yet (went Jan 9th) so if you are looking to have some beer with dinner you will need to call before going.   When you first sit down you have a variety of different samplers that are offered to you. And they take you order right away and it comes out in a matter of minutes! Never had a wait for slow service which was excellent, however they could of checked on me every so often instead of every 2 minutes. (Then again I was eating alone so they were just trying to friendly) overall the food was a very delicious!  I think this new place has a lot of potential to be a 5 Star but it still needs a little more experience!"}
{"text":"So this is my first tome eating here with my family and the man Austin is the best I have never had customer service like I had here and I work in the customer service industry but this place hands down is the best yet!!!!"}
{"text":"We were here once and had to come back the next time we visited Vegas. The food is great for $19.95 AYCE KBBQ and the service is EXCEPTIONAL. All the meats are great and the appetizers are also delicious. We like the Korean fried chicken and sesame chicken the most for the appetizers and the Kalbi and spicy pork for the meat. OZZY was our server who provided excellent service! The other servers are always timely in giving us fresh, clean grills and food always comes out fast. We love this place! :)"}
{"text":"A lunch for two cost me $80 due to a cashier error. Called several times to resolve only to be stonewalled in denial. Going to have to call their corporate to get it resolved. Shady business practices!"}
{"text":"We love Gen. Austin was our server and he took excellent care of us. The roast beef and premium steak are our favorites and ask for the cajun pork belly, it's not in the menu but we prefer it over the spicy pork belly.  Thank you Austin, Ozzy and Eugene!"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been waiting for this place to open up since the first time we saw that \"Coning Soon\" sign. We went on a Tuesday night just a little after 6pm right before the big rush came in. We were a little frustrated that even though we were only a couple of parties behind in line, it took almost 20 minutes just for them to take our names down on the list. But once it was our turn to put our name in, we were seated right away. But guess what? We were seated at the only table with the table light flickering on and off which was very annoying/distracting. But overall everything else was amazing and well worth it. Our server was on point making sure that our grill was consistently full of meat, grill replaced when needed and refreshments full. Im thinking round 2 in the near future. Maybe I'll try their lunch menu next time.  Lunch $15.99 Dinner $24.99."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time and dinner here. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area; locals or even visitors.  If possible, ask for OZZY. Fantastic server and very attentive. Made the whole experience even better then expected. Been to this locations twice before but first time with OZZY as server. Will definitely recommend him to all my friends and family. Food was good as ever!"}
{"text":"My family took me here last night for my birthday dinner, recommend by a friend. It was really awesome atmosphere and the food itself was great! The reason why we give this place 3 stars (less if it wasn't for the food being as good as it was) is because we felt our server didn't interact with us at all. She actually didn't do much at all, the runner, I'm guessing did. Although he didn't explain what anything was initially either he did answer all our questions each time we asked and took the effort to explain what the side dishes actually were and what the sauces for meat were etc. So besides taking our drink order and bringing the check I don't remember our server at all. She also made us feel like we were inconveniencing her. I'm not sure if it's because we had children with us or because she assumed we were not going to tip, but it made for a very awkward and uncomfortable experience. I myself was a server for 10 years from Fine Dining to Commercialized places and so I know what it's like on the other side. Hopefully, she also knows she was only given a good tip because I know she has to tip the others out (Runner, Bussers, Bartenders and sometimes Hosts)and they were great and shouldn't be at fault for her actions.   It was our first time there and not only did we have no idea what we were doing, we had no idea what anything was and had to flag down people for items and answers. We also felt rushed trying to order and there wasn't even a wait. It would have been nice if she had just offered assistance or knowledge or even ask if we had questions. These are all basic necessities of being a server. At the end, the server did bring a birthday dessert which was really nice, but she just set it down and walked away. The gentleman host up front actually remembered and said Happy Birthday as we were paying. Overall we will be back for the food and atmosphere, most likely and at least we did end up figuring out the process and items of this cool experience so now we know which will make next time perhaps more enjoyable. Was just disappointed"}
{"text":"Arrived at 2 on a Tuesday for lunch special. They were not busy. Didn't get seated til 2:50 & got charged for dinner. Brisket was tough. Bulgogi had no flavor. Pork belly was chewy. Appetizers came out cold AFTER the meat. Took 30 mins to get a refill. Service was awful. Ordered the same thing 3x because they \"forgot\" to bring it out. The booth & floor was sticky from a spill they didnt bother to clean before seating us. Waited another 20 mins for the check. Bad experience from start to finish. SO disappointed!"}
{"text":"Blake was a great server and the atmosphere of the place was really fun. Ate way to much food. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in Las Vegas!!!!!! Our server Yuhao is very kindly and helpful!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of the meat was extremely disappointing. It was obvious that quantity trumps quality at this Korean BBQ. Unfortunately this is relevant across \"all you can eat\" type of establishment. I would rather pay more for a better dining experience. The serving staff was, however, wonderful."}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ at lunch for $16? Pretty good deal. I came here for lunch and the food was great. Spicy pork belly was the best - also tried beef, spicy chicken, gyoza, and Hawaiian pork belly. The garlic chicken we tried was just plain chicken breast, however, not the best for the grill. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try this place out tonight.   He really likes Korean BBQ, I am not sure why you would want to go to a restaurant and cook your own food but whatever.   We tried the Hawaiian Steak that marinade was delicious.  Of course we got brisket and galbi short ribs and my husband got pork belly (by then the kids and I were too full).  Everything was good but I have had better.  The kids and I also got a macaroon icecream sandwich each.  For me the best part was the service all the waiters were very attentive and they changed out our grill two times.  When we ordered the meat would come out in about a minute or two.  So quick.  Also the water cups were never empty and they had the Stanley Cup Playoffs showing on all television screens. #GoKnightsGo!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 3 or 4 times and I definitely recommend it to anyone. This is a great place to eat and their prices are affordable. You definitely get your moneys worth.  My most recent experience was amazing only because our server Jovanny was outstanding! Although he had 3-4 other large parties to tend to he always came by to our table and made sure we had everything. He's the best server I've ever had not just at this place but in general. He made us feel welcomed and always took care of us despite his manager Linette who didn't make our last visit so good. We would order drinks and she wouldn't let him serve us drinks then proceeded to tell us they were out of a specific drink we ordered but then we were notified that she had lied for no reason in particular. So when Jovanny had served us our requested drink she proceeded to lecture him in front of us even though Jovanny did nothing wrong but serve us. She was merely upset at the fact that she was wrong for lying but used her title as manager over him. If it wasn't for Jovanny's excellent service I would've gave a low rating but he made a bad experience into a great one simply because of his service and personality. If you ever visit this location I recommend you have Jovanny as your server."}
{"text":"The main reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because of the awesome service. They have not disappointed me. Although I think Tofu Hut is so much better (but thats just my opinion). They have good brisket, but how can you go wrong with brisket? Its not seasoned anyway lol. The main thing I dont like about this place is the dipping they give. Its some type of sea salt with green tea leaves or something Idk but I didn't like it so I asked if they had salt and pepper with sesame oil and they did but again it was sea salt which can be too salty. The meat options are over whelming and their kalbi was not that greatly marinated. the steak was horrible. very dry and unseasoned. The pork belly was good, but again like the brisket, you cant really go wrong with it, its not seasoned. I did like how they often changed the grill out for you when it became dirty. Another reason why I rate this place 4 stars is because of the shrimp that they offer on the menu and the squid legs I believe they have as well. My boy friend orders those two things endlessly. Although I don't eat either of them, he loves them so thats a plus. I've noticed that they have ice cream macaroons which I'd like to give a try but of course you are charges separately for those."}
{"text":"I went last night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The ambiance is nice and quaint with nice decor. It is conveniently located next to the Galleria Mall, which prior to that, I was just at because I picked up a gift card because of a special promotion. I asked the front desk if this could be used at Gen KBBQ and she said yes.  When I got to Gen, I wanted to make sure so I asked the hostess before signing in if we could use these Galleria gift cards but she wasn't entirely sure. I handed both cards to her and  she asked her fellow hostess whether or not they'd work. They both said yes.  The food is alright, typical kbbq. Honestly, it kind of sucks that the meat portions are so small so that we have to keep on ordering back and forth. I would say that Gen has more focus on it's appetizers, but that's my opinion. Our server was somewhat tentative, I never got a refill at all until the very end...  We changed our grill plenty of times like at least 5-6 because of how charred it'd get. It sucks that they don't provide oil on the grill anymore like they used to.   When it was time to pay, I gave the same hostess that I had spoken to both the gift cards and she then told me that they actually don't accept them after running the cards and went to go speak to the manager about it.  Long story short, this review is more focused on the customer service. I ended up paying my debit card which I didn't mind but next time, don't provide me false information... especially if you had another hostess agree with you, when in fact, were both wrong.  Next time, if you don't know, ask the manager. I would've been more understanding.. but boy, was that a hassle. I'm not entirely sure if I'll come back."}
{"text":"Went the Gen KBBQ house for the first time just a few hours ago and it was AMAZING. Great food. Great customer service. The servers/bussers were on top of it from making sure we were okay to refills and didn't bother as much as most servers in restaurants do! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had great service from ozzy! Amazing food with the best seasonings!!! Cooking food was funny lol"}
{"text":"This place is great! Plenty a choices for low carb or Keto dieters too. $22 all you can eat? Amazing! And the food quality is fantastic. The service is so fast you're practically eating as soon as you sit down. Can't beat it. Highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Great place, i didnt mind the wait. Food was great, my gf loved it for being her first time"}
{"text":"We came a lot every time was a great service with the same server named Ozzy. He is awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"First time trying this Korean BBQ & first time for me, to cook on the table grill.  Usually my friend does it, or the cooks at the restaurant, but I was down to do it.  Justin, Natasha & the whole staff were fantastic.  Justin was very personable & helpful.  Love the modern decor, blue ambience lighting, cute red bar, also w/ the grill, a large projector screen, not traditional looking, but food-wise it was great!  Lunch is $15.99 AYCE, 33 items to choose from.  We ordered the Gyoza, Rice Cakes, Bulgogi, Cajun Chicken, Mushrooms & Veggies.  Next time, I would try the shrimp & the KFC, but I was so full!  Also I would order the rice cakes w/ the meat cause after eating rice too... it gets even more filling!  Also, the spicy chili sauce would've went great w/ the chicken.    Quick service, food was great, excellent location, friendly employees, $45 for two w/ wine, totally worth it so come w/ an appetite."}
{"text":"Went to their soft opening! The atmosphere is great.  I love the blue lighting.  Since it is soft opening, a lot of the servers seem to still be training. They got our order wrong twice and they always seem to be rushing and frazzled.  I understand though, it's a new place and I'm sure they're still trying to get the hang of it all. The food itself was good. Some of meat was a little dry, but you can't really go wrong with all you can eat for $22. ? Heads up though, \"until further notice\" they don't serve alcohol yet because they don't have their license. That was a bit of a let down, lol. But that will be resolved after the grand opening.  I'll be back then."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend.  Weekday Lunch 14.95 includes appetizers and all you can eat off the menu - 3 items that are offered on the dinner menu which only$19.95.  Service was OK to a bit slow, but the wait staff was very attentive once you got their attention.  All you can eat... but the'll charge you if you order tons and don't finish what you order. Decoration is very upscale, it's been open for a little over a year They did offer to change the cooking grill when it got too charred.   You know it's good when you see Korean locals eating there. The meats was very fresh, steaks, bulgogi, not so impressed with the cook your own calamari, the appetizer crispy calamari legs were great.  Chop chae not impressed, maybe it was from the night before.  We were lucky, only a fifth of the restaurant was full but we also ate a 1:00 on a weekday.  I heard that when they first opened they had a wait-list, they do mention on the menu that they have a 2 hour time limit   My new must stop when I get back to LV"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place. We've heard that this place is always packed. We visited this place on Tuesday night and thank goodness it was not a lot of people.   The place is very cool and trendy, it has this big projectors and loud music. The attendants are very attentive and courtious.   Food is pretty good and has a lot of meat choices. We ordered a lot but our favorite was the Red Wine Hawain Pork Belly and Garlic Chciken.  I was a bit disappointed coz dessert isn't included in the eat all you can . We ordered it separately and I had the mango macaroons the appearance was really nice and appetizing. However, I didn't tasted the mango and the macarron is chewy."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Not much appetizers to choose from and the banchan side dishes are terrible. Next time, I will  drive to Henderson to get my Korean BBQ food fix as they have more options to choose from."}
{"text":"very fast service and cheap lunch! there was no dessert on the menu but they have macaroons for sale in the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"so far the BEST korean BBQ place in Vegas. LOVE the food and atmosphere. Great customer service"}
{"text":"Been to Gen many times before and have always enjoyed the food/service here. My fav server would have to be Alodia, she's super funny and takes time to strike a good conversation. She made our gen experience fun!"}
{"text":"One of the first all you can eat kbbq places in Arizona.  The meat is bomb, the service is bomb, the atmosphere is bomb. It was so clean and modern compared to the usual greasy and messy kbbq places in LA. Not only is the service really good, but also the meat is really something special. The marinades are so sweet and complement the meat pretty well. For all you can eat, the quality is actually really good. I recommend the chadol (/Brisket), Korean Fried Chicken, and all the marinated pork belly. Only $16 for lunch menu but you still get way more that you won't even be able to try everything.  Another unique aspect about Gen is that the smoke from the grills is vacuumed underneath the table, so none of that greasy meat smell on your clothes. They change your grills really often and check up on you to refill your meats pretty fast. I'm so glad we finally have all you can eat kbbq in AZ. As a college student, this place is godsend."}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying the 2 hour wait was well worth it! The food is absolutely exceptional, and the amount of selection of meats they have is almost unbearable!  What HAD to top it off was THE SERVICE! Samuel, literally killed it! With a party of 11 super needy, hungry, angry, crazy people!  Samuel was attentive, as well as fully enthusiastic to assist us with all of our demands!  HE DIDNT FORGET ANYTHING! & got everything we needed within minutes!  Can't say enough good things about this dude, made our dinner beyond expectations!  So if you're looking for amazing service & all around good attentive service ask for Samuel!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Service. Beer was cold and the meats they serviced to us were all delicious. All you can eat for 25$ and 4 selections per round of food. Constantly asking you to change grills and showing unexperienced customers how everything works.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"First time here, and it happened to be their grand opening special. Super busy, but they took care of us and overall great customer service!"}
{"text":"The menu looks amazing, but we never got to try the food. It wasn't that busy, we were the only people waiting to be seated at first. After we had been waiting for about ten minutes another couple walked in and was seated almost immediately at the table we were told was being cleaned for us. When we told the hostest she just said, \"oh yeah, sorry.\" We ended up leaving. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"My friends and I always went to Gen's whenever we happen to be in Vegas. It was a must on our to-do list. Now that there's one in AZ, we knew that we HAD to come here.   It was around 5:45pm and surprisingly there was no wait. We got seated right away. It took quiet a while for us to be approached by our waitress. You would imagine that for being seated right away, someone would take our drink order (at least) at a decent time. Throughout the night, the service continued to be slow.   Aside from the slow service, the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Best Korean in town!!! JULIAN was an awesome server!! Don't forget the Kalbi and Premium Steak!"}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriend on a whim and was more than pleasantly surprised and impressed. The wait was about 15 minutes but I asked if the bar was available and got seated in less than two minutes. Blake was manning the bar and serving us at the same time. He was always friendly, helpful, and checking on us. Overall it was a great experience, the food was great (I personally love cooking my own food), and best of all a fantastic price. Couldn't be happier and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Jan was absolutely incredible she took great care of us and had genuine conversation with us. Thank you Jan for making our dining experience great!! Only feedback is that we arrived about 9:30pm on a Sunday and were seated at the communal table on the east side of the restaurant. No problem there... However they began to shut down that side about 10:15 while we were still eating an the clank of dishes and smell of cleaning products dampened our dining experience. I wish the hosts had sat us on the main side that wasn't being shut down... Especially knowing we would be there past the other guests.  However Jan ended our evening in a great way with a big smile and invited us back soon as we were leaving. Thank you Jan! Overall great food and service and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here today for the first time and a great dinner. The staff were friendly, the atmosphere was great and the food was delicious! Our waitress Jessica did a fantastic job and while running back and forth the still managed to make sure my glass was full of ice tea and my daughter loved her. She did an amazing job from start to finish and when we go back I hope she will be our waitress again. Thanks Jessica keep up the good work.  Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great service, good food and with an awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Same quality as the ones in L.A. One of the best AYCE. A bit too much sauce on the spicey chicken and octopus but other than that awesome."}
{"text":"Newish Korean BBQ joint trying to make it in this very transient of locations at Sahara and Decatur. Best thing about this place was the service... however the food was not very good.  Not horrible, but just ok.  The space is big... lots of cooktop tables.  That also means lots of smoke and grease in the air.  The owners need to turn up the exhaust fans or something.  They need better ventilation pronto. Plenty of meats and apps to choose from off the menu, but the quality of meat wasn't great.  Everything was too sweet... too much sauce or marinade... really mediocre cuts.   Not the worst, but many better choices for Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I have not been this disappointed over a restaurant in a long time & it really sucks because I had my eye on Gen since they opened. I wanted to give them a month or so though. I understand the pressure on new businesses but today's visit was just totally insulting.   Party of 9 for my cousins bday & they quoted an hour wait & they'll text once the table is ready. No problem, we totally understand it would be long. An hour later, we ask if it'll be any longer. \"5 more minutes, just cleaning the table.\" This happened for another 45 mins. \"10 more minutes, just cleaning the table.\" Nothing yet. Finally, we were informed that there are two booths available back to back, is that okay, they ask. Yes, but.. you're telling me that for 45 minutes, you weren't really cleaning the damn table?! You were just bluffing?! Oh hell no. We got to the table and there's a booth side by side. We asked if we could have that instead so we could interact with each other. She had to ask management if that's okay. It's common sense so it better be! Sigh..  We were finally seated & got our orders in. Received our food and cooked them. Asked for the rice and they said it will be coming in 20 mins bc they ran out. Are you serious?! By the time the rice came, we already ate the food cause we were starving. We ordered some more and waited another 30 mins for those to eat with our already cold rice. Oh, and our waters only came 30 mins into our meal after asking them several times. That should've been the first things you give to customers.   Patience was running thin at this point because every single server we encountered had the nastiest attitudes. No smiles, no eye contact, slamming plates on the table..(except for one guy who tried to compensate for his co-workers' actions but it was too late). Really felt they did not want to be there at all and we were nuisances for ordering. It's AYCE isn't it?! You make us wait so long so.. hell yeah, we're hungry hippos now!   You can only split the check 3 times so we did. 3 different servers came by and kept asking how and it got old repeating what we were saying. We waited at our table for 30 more mins for our checks. We finally walked up to the counter and asked where our checks were. They said \"Ummmmm.. Well....\" Okay, got it.. This is how you want to end an already crappy dining experience. Good job.   Walked out of there & heard 5 other parties complaining about their experience.   So there, you've been warned. I usually give a 2nd chance for places but this place is not one of them. Cousin's bday ruined. Thanks Gen!"}
{"text":"Gen is an excellent AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant. I love coming here, the cleanliness and customer service is what brings me back. Our server Ozzy was so friendly and served us great customer service."}
{"text":"AYCE KBBQ in Henderson...Finally!!! Excellent customer service! Food is amazing! I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves KBBQ! No need to drive to Chinatown to get your KBBQ fix!!Our server Samuel was really nice, made sure we are taken care of. No need to flag down servers."}
{"text":"I came here for Korean BBQ. This place is cool with  very large areas. The meat here are great, especially the calamari. I will recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Went to Gen's for lunch and they didn't disappoint. The service was good and fast. Food (meats) came quick. $14.95 for lunch, that's cheap for an all-you-eat Korean BBQ. The place is clean and it had a good vibe to it. I would definitely recommend this place. Plus you have the Galleria mall next to it. I know I ate at least $60 worth of meat and seafood."}
{"text":"First time going to an all you can eat KBBQ restaurant but they are onto something with this idea. Bring your appetite and order anything on the menu for a reasonable price. Great service was provided helping with the grill and replacing once it was dirty. Appetizer salad and side dishes were a great accent to the main course."}
{"text":"The red wine pork belly is a MUST!! The place is cool and ambience is hip. Come early or wait for a long time."}
{"text":"We ate everything. It was SO GOOD. Our favorites were the Gen beef bulgogi, beef tongue and Gen signature Galbi (short ribs).... everything was delicious & it was a wonderful dinner experience with fantastic service by Dakota. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening with my parents after i got off work late. I heard about this location a few months ago but for some odd reason, it took them a few months to open. Maybe inspections and renovations stuff? Dunoe !   Anyway, this is located on the SW corner of Sahara and Decatur, in the same center as where Circuit City used to be (ahh millennials will not know what this was... XD fyi my definition of millennials is those born after 2000). It took over this standalone building that used to be some buffet (never been...)  Renovations are somewhat similar to the Henderson location but without the high ceilings and more seating (or so it seemed).   My parents were already seated by the time i arrived and had some food ordered. I arrived and started cooking (sad face i still had to cook after working 11 hrs... zZzZz)   Customer service for this location was pretty on point (for now...). I got my drink order almost as soon as i sat down and had people asking if i wanted to order more stuff repeatedly pretty often.   Menu wise, seemed quite similar to the one in Henderson. The only thing i noticed a change to was the amount of beef tongue each order gives, and the \"premium steak\" was a sirloin steak. Iirc it was a NY strip or maybe even a rib eye at the other location but i havent been there in months. Not too much of an issue as i can start cooking on the fat cap, rendering it down then cooking it on the other sides.   Aside from beef tongue and premium steak, got pork neck/jowl (whatever they call it), brisket, spicy pork, pork belly, bulgolgi.. and a repeat of a few. XD They finally have sliced pickled radish here !   The weird thing i noticed was their salad used a \"spring\" salad instead of the usual romaine lettuce.   The ventilation is pretty bad. The ones without the hood above doesn't to suck as well (....ha...). I've seen the same type ventilate very well to point you saw the smoke curling in but this did not have this affect at all. I feel bad for whoever has to clean those glass walls daily... I actually overheard a someone telling another that they are supposed to turn down the gas if it smokes .... (most annoying thing they do at kbbq's without ample ventilation. why can't they upgrade to the ones like in korea where you can bring it down while cooking?)"}
{"text":"Food choices for lunch r great Except nobody explained the menu. Price 15,99 lunch  They charge 5$ for unfinished plates and have some restrictions which they explained once we seated  2 hours time to eat  Premium Steak was not  impressive Chicken is not breast it's huge and boney The sliced beef was very good Mushrooms and veggies are 99% onions and 3 mini pieces mushrooms  Gyozas overfried, hard and dry Side dishes were amazing  Service was ok. Not very attentive. The grill was way to hot , everything burnt outside fter 3 minutes but chicken wa still raw inside   One bus boy was kind enough to lower heat and exchanged the grill. Still the meat gets burnt pretty easy. Why not offering a lil bit oil?   Marinated meat was yummy I missed more veggie choices on the menu.  When we left the lady ad the entrance did not looked up or sayed anything when we sayed bye.   I don't get the great reviews , there r way better BBQs in Vegas ."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Korean spot. Came to celebrate one of my coworkers birthdays. The food was great but the service from Boid was even better he made our experience top notch."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place for Korean BBQ.... Servers were very prompt and courteous. Even suggested the best items on the menu..... Thumbs up on the Cajun shrimp and the jap Chae...... All the meats were fresh and good. Been there twice and looking forward to next time..... Keep up the good work you have a great spot here for Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service especially by Julian!  definitely a restaurant to return to!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty dank, the only problem I have about the food is that they never ever have the fries available... What the fuck is the point of taking the time and money to print out all these menus just to tell every customer that there's no more fries available? The customer service is friendly... However it would take me a couple of times to get their attention and when I do ask for something, the servers usually forget and I would have to repeat the process again until they have finally understood me. I wish they would fix their customer service, that way I would definitely go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was a surprise and a delight. I've been to many Korean barbecue's in the past but nothing like Gen. It was alive- great music, a lot of people having a wonderful time with friends, and an attractive decor.   All that aside the food was top notch. There wasn't one item of the 32 meat's provided that wasn't great. Granted, I didn't eat all 32 but gave it a good try!  With that said I will be back as many times it takes to give it all a sample. I know I won't be disappointed.   Lastly, the service was over the top! Krinke was amazing! There wasn't a moment that my girlfriend and I went without. The food came at a perfect rate, the drinks never ran dry, and we felt like we were the only people in a nearly packed restaurant.   Thank you Gen for giving Henderson one hell of a restaurant.. and thank you Krinke for being amazing!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Orange County girl who recently moved to Vegas.   I was looking for a KBBQ replacement as OC is notorious for having a ton of KBBQ options. As Gen is pretty well known across the board, I definitely was stoked to give this place a try!   I'll cut to the chase and spare the typical \"AYCE\" details. Love the brisket and beef belly. Everything else I'll pass. Now, I don't think $20+tax is worth stuffing myself with brisket and beef belly is really worth it, but I don't really have any other option when I'm craving kbbq.   Pros: Clean, quick, no smells, usually a short wait time!   Cons: Grill burns fast, slow service, selection isn't that great, small portions"}
{"text":"My family and I went a while ago and I absolutely fell in love with their food, environment, and the staff are very attentive and kind. I've introduced my boyfriend and so many friends to Gen and they all love it just as much as I do."}
{"text":"We got here on a Saturday night at around 4:45pm and the restaurant was already packed, but we were able to be seated in about 5 minutes (party of 7, split into 2 adjacent tables).  The interior definitely has a modern semi-club feel to it, and the restaurant itself is really cavernous and spread out.    The food was just okay, with some pretty good items on the menu, along with other things that aren't worthy of being ordered.  The brisket (chadol) was fatty but not overly greasy and probably the best thing on the menu.  The spicy baby octopus, pork jowl, and the vegetables round out the top four.  All of the other beef items sort of tasted the same (beef tongue, rib meat, beef belly, hangar steak, etc.).  They also have the real dipping/accompaniment sauces that are not given out but that you have to ask for, including garlic/pepper slices that you can add to the grill.  The biggest issue with the system was the quantity of food that is brought with each order.  They allow 4 items total with each order per table (meat, side, soup, whatever), with each item entailing a pretty small amount of food.  If we had known how long it would take to flag down a server to put in another order of food, receive said food, and then reorder more food, we would have just immediately ordered 4 new plates as soon as the previous order arrived (which is what we ended up doing once we realized how to speed things up).  Two hours can go by pretty quick when you're spending a lot of time just waiting for food to arrive or to request more plates.    Another issue was the charging of adult prices to 7 year-old boys just because both of their heights barely exceeded the 50-inch mark of the ruler at the hostess station - in their eyes, once you reach the arbitrary height of 4 feet and 2 inches, your appetite is equivalent to that of a full-grown adult.   So all you families with young kids who are preparing to eat here, get ready to pay adult prices if your children are taller than 4'2\".    The meat quality is what you would expect from an AYCE restaurant, which means that it's borderline passable.  So even though the food was subpar and the service kind of slow, we had fun while were there, and I'm just glad that more of these types of restaurants are finding their way to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"There was a time I had given up on the KBBQ in Vegas. The quality was either terrible (Tofu Hut) or the price was just outrageous (Woonam Jung). But fear not, deer friends, Gen Korean Bbq house is on the prowl, looking to take advantage of the situation, hopefully, in order to execute the awesomeness of the situation, and finding that shining light, that wherever it takes us, we will find a way to succeed. I don't know what that last sentence was, I was on a roll. And sometimes, it's just hard for me to stop. Like the copper top. Who likes to drop. Bippity bop.  Gen Korean comes by the way of California, a chain that has proven its popularity, particularly the Tustin location. This is also the only ayce kbbq in the Henderson area. I've heard the buzz and wanted to check out their stuff. I also heard it through the grapevine that they had something called 'rice paper'. I was like \"Rice paper?!?\". And then I left to try it out.  For some of you who have trouble finding it, Gen is located on a new part of the Galleria Mall that had been built out. For some reason, I thought it was near like the Sauce restaurant and stuff. But it wasn't, it was connected to the mall. So look at the mall, and you should be able to see it. There is a sign. A big one. A very big one.  Walking in, I liked the interior. It was modern, new, and fresh. But, it didn't feel too uptight or rigid. And you know I'm all about that. And then some. Picked out a boothy (boo), and started perusing the menu. One thing I noticed as I was about to order was that there were none of those huge air vents that are normally located above the grills on a kbbq table. Then I looked at the grill. Ermahgerd! They have the side vents that are located right next to the grills to suck up all that smoke! The only other place I saw this at was at Gyu-Kaku, and I thought that this was the greatest thing in the world. Right there Gen (Bennifer), you've got a big fan right ova' heah!  Onto the food itself. There weren't a lot of misses, but of course there is on every menu, so I shall inform you. Popcorn skrimpy's. If you're expecting Taiwanese popcorn skrimps, you will be disappointed. These are more of the Chili's or Applebee varieties. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. The other people I was with thought that all the other appetizers and sides were good though. And normally, my favorite thing to eat at a Kbbq is kalbi (marinated short ribs). I thought the ones here were OK. The meat quality is very good, but I felt as though the meat could have been marinated for a longer period of time. It tasted more like a steak. And steak is great. But kalbi... I need a bit more of that flava flav, catch my drift ;). And the skrimps (the ones you grill). I'll go on record by saying that I've never had good skrimps to grill on a kbbq in Vegas. That trend will most likely continue.  Everything else was rock solid. The banchan is really good here. All the other meats that I've tried were excellente. Keep an eye on that #9, that beef short plate. T-ara was right about that one (I applaud you if you got that). One of the best meats I've had at a kbbq in a looong time. Surprisingly, their bulgogi (thin marinated sirloin) is probably the best in Vegas. Haven't had a good one in a while, and this one was really good. Probably a close second to the short plate. All the meats here are amazing and the grill is heated perfectly to cook them all.   The service was good here. I've read the reviews and it looked like it would have been inconsistent, but it seems that Gen is constantly working on it, and for myself, it was probably one of the better services that I had at any kbbq in town. My drinks were always filled, and so were the banchan. They were also taking our orders quickly after we had finished our meats, so I was impressed.  Gen is my go-to Kbbq in Vegas. This place has everything I'm looking for when I go out to one, and so far, stands head above the rest in town. Oh and Gen's famous rice paper. B to the omb."}
{"text":"I normally go to Gen all the time because the food is good and its a great price. But today was an experience, first of all I have to say our waiter Julian was a great waiter and he came to our aid during our little problem. Today, I ordered the KFC which is Korean Fried Chicken while eating the chicken, I notice the chicken was still partially raw on the inside even though I asked for it to be extra crispy which I would think that it would remain in the fryer for longer. I bought it to the hostess attention which she was very concerned and let us know that the meal would be comped due to the experience. After that a guy came by with blond hair and glasses, who I would assume was the manager and said that the meal could only be comped 50%. Like are you serious you literally just gave me raw chicken! (And I know what some of you are thinking its a BBQ place you cook it yourself..no this was an appetizer that the cooks prepared in the back for you.) We told the manager that was not what we were informed and that the meal would be comp. Both the waiter and the hostess came back and was like and both agreed that the meal should be taken care of due to what happened. After, they continually checked on me to make sure I was not sick! And thank goodness I was fine! Needless to say the waiter and hostess are awesome! So thank you Julian and hostess (sorry I didn't get your name), but that other guy needs some retraining."}
{"text":"So in comparison to the 1st time i went, i dont think it changed much   service - definitely still quite the short-falling on this area. took quite the long while before our area's waiter came to our table. Waters were forgotten til probably after then 2nd round of ordering, even after a reminder. BUT after waiter took our first order, WOW the meat came out fast ! .................... that didnt last long.. it took forever for the orders later LOL dang it !   grill - noticed the venting wasnt as good as it was the first time i went. first time, i was super surprised how well they worked for the grill-side venting system. quite the bit of smoke escaped this time around. another note, not sure if it should be a blame or its just a common thing that happens... the ring of fire under the grill has a metal cap on top of it that helps evenly distribute the flame/gas... tends to get hit when waiters/whoever changes the grill. we tried to fix it a few times but still had trouble. it wasnt until the manager saw us struggling and came to fix it that it was fixed... up till then, we just had to keep rotating the grill to have the high/low spots for things XD   side dishes were definitely lacking. we had like... 3? maybe 4 diff items? wao o.O was it always this low?   this time around, they had the rice paper o.O wonder what changed ... hopefully its within health district ruling @_@ still dont have my sliced daikon \"paper\" i like to wrap my meats with before eating.   meats were the same. my uncles fav were the #1 signature steak and #2 pork jowl. #3 brisket was a bit on the leaner side this time.   overall still a decent deal for $20. yeah kind of far but eh i dont eat kbbq that often anyway... so im ok with the drive Lol"}
{"text":"Finally a legit Korean BBQ restaurant has opened in Arizona!   Dinner and weekend pricing for the AYCE BBQ is $25 with 37 items on the menu. Some of the favorites were the flat iron steak, galbi, the beef tongue, and the Cajun shrimp. The soondoobu was also really really good!   The service was friendly, attentive and prompt. There was someone ready to change our grill the moment it got even a little blackened. Our server was always present to take our order without being obtrusive. If I could give a 10 star rating for their service, I would!  The decor of the restaurant was modern and very welcoming. Unlike other Korean BBQ restaurants, the ventilation was superb with the vents positioned right next to the grill (genius!)   I highly recommend everyone to come check out Gen! Come before they open if you don't want to wait! If you thought other places in Arizona were good, then prepare to have your mind blown by Gen!!"}
{"text":"First time I came here; I guess my family already came here and loved it. I now know why they do! Very clean and friendly environment. The food is great; and the service is even better! Thank you Mina for taking care of me and my family, and attending to our questions and our requests. You are an amazing waiter, and we will continue to come here and also tell our friends and other family with this amazing place! (;"}
{"text":"Eugene the waiter did an impressive job catering to the needs of our group of 8 no matter how demanding the people in my party are he found a way to keep them happy. Kudos to him. The food was awesome and we will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Korean BBQ place in Las Vegas. Everything about this place is on-point! The location is also very convenient because it is located right outside the Galleria mall. One of the best things about Gen is how they run their wait list system. You first give your name and phone number to the hostess and when your table is ready, Gen will text you. I really enjoy this system because you don't have to stay in the restaurant the whole time. You can go into the mall and go shopping!!!  The Staff: 5/5 I've never experienced any issues with their staff! They're very quick putting orders in on the I-pads they carry around, speedy at delivering orders and re-filling drinks, and excellent at replacing the grills. All of the staff I have come across have been very friendly and helpful.  Food: 5/5 Compared to many other KBBQ places, Gen has so many more options! Some of my favorite meats include the Red Wine Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgolgi, and the Premium Beef Short Ribs. My favorite side dish is their Kimchi!  The Prices: 5/5 The price is amazing! I think it's one of the cheapest and best KBBQ places in Las Vegas. If you live far away, the drive is worth it, believe me! For AYCE lunch it is $15.99 and for AYCE dinner the price is $20.99."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Gen in SoCal (too many options, not enough time) but I've been multiple times now that they're in the valley. I'm always surprised at how quick and prompt the service is here. Most other Korean BBQ places will start to ignore you after the first few plates, forget to bring plates you ordered, etc., but the staff at Gen always seems to come around at the right time asking what you want for your next order and changing your grill constantly. The ventilation is also a lot better than most other places which is good for how big the place is. Quality of the meat has always been good. The portions are on the smaller side but I actually prefer that because I don't end up ordering a final plate that has way too much for me to finish - plus, as mentioned before, the staff is always coming around, so I'm never left with much downtime between plates."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to love coming to Gen when they first opened. However after removing several of our favorites off of the menu we stopped going. Tonight we decided to give Gen another try and it's gotten so much worse. The quality of the meat is horrible. Not only was it awful but we found ourselves spitting out bones while eating pork belly. This will be our last visit to Gen and I definitely do not recommend this place. If you're looking for a good KBBQ spot you should check out HWARO!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service!!!  This establishment has got to get rid of GIL PRADO definitely the most arrogant POS I have seen in Arizona.  Child prices change from day to day with this place.  Then this guy says kids grow and prices change in 3 days???  WTF NO CONSISTENCY!!! Food is so so and definitely not worth the wait times they have.  There is many other establishments where they have better food and service."}
{"text":"I've waited a long time for Gen to come to Phoenix. I've been to most of the locations in Cali. All the cali locations were very good, especially the Cerritos location. The servers there are amazing.   The Tempe location needs better training. We had Donna as our server. She was horrible. She didn't light our grill so we had to flag down another server to light it. The meat came out before the grill was lit. Everything else took forever and she kept forgetting items we asked for. We had to ask for items 3 or 4 times or ask other servers walking by. We put in meat orders and they kept getting lost. We sat for at least 10 minutes without meat. We also ordered pork belly 2 times and never got it. Only when we requested it a third time did she finally bring it. She asked if we had ordered it from someone else and she made the excuse that she had 8 tables to serve. That's not my problem. Talk to your manager if you can't handle all your tables. We originally had a party of 10 but they couldn't seat us together so they split us into two tables. There were five per table but still charged 18 percent tip. 18 percent starts at 6 people.   The food and meat quality is very good but I wish they had large intestine. I will definitely come back but if I get Donna as my server again, I'm walking out. 5 stars for food. 1 star for service."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Julian was so attentive & had such great customer service. Loved it here!!"}
{"text":"Well three of us decided to try this place for lunch today. Due to some negative reviews both here and on tripadvisor, it made us wonder how it could be so good for some and so bad for others. I'd say go check it out for yourself. Our waiter was Ozzie. Very nice fellow, took his time explaining how it worked. It is an all you can eat but where you order and they bring it to your table. They bring you as much as you want and they also checked back regularly. I'd suggest the KFC (Korean fried chicken), the pork ___ (I forget what it was called but it is an appetizer that comes out cooked) also the pork steak. The apps come out cooked, the entrees you cook yourself in the center of the table. The regular steak is nice, and is the spicy chicken bulgogi. tip: do not get the brisket. It is too thin, it cooks to nothing. Waste of time really to order that.  The only down side was the Asian hostess was a very sour woman. No smile, nothing. It was as if she really hated her job. I hope she finds a job she likes so she can be happy."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the valley restaurant scene.  Fast service, courteous waitstaff and an open airy space that is both attractive and functional.     We had the all you can eat lunch for $20 a piece along with a carafe of soju infused peach juice.     We had every kind of seafood on the menu.  Octopus, squid and cuttlefish were all memorable.   If you love Korean food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to Gen Korean Bbq opening up here in Henderson since I've been a great fan of the one in Tustin, California. Unfortunately this location did not live up to my expectations. The first reason is that they didn't have the rice paper that the Tustin location has which I loved. Secondly some of the items on the menu was not available for ordering. Thirdly they didn't have the steamed egg that Tofu Hut has which I also enjoy. Lastly the Cajun shrimp had a funny taste which is a bummer since I love eating shrimp. So I guess I have to continue driving across town to go to Tofu Hut."}
{"text":"This is my favorite all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place! Even if it's a 27 minute drive from where I live, I wouldn't mind coming here on a weekly basis! I love this place mostly because of their friendly staff and their FOOD, duh! The interior design is a bonus.  I really don't know where to begin with this place. But let's start with location. It's right next door (literally, a 1 minute walking distance) to the Galleria Mall. They are usually packed on weekends and during the night time. So whenever I have to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, my party and I would look around the Galleria Mall to pass time. Along with the ease of reserving a table, they have an app you download that would notify you how many people are in front of you on the list, and tell you when your table is ready. Keep in mind that you can't reserve ahead of time via phone call, you can only reserve at the front check-in desk to have them write your name on the list.  Now back to getting seated. There are booths and high tables to sit at. The booths and tables are good for parties of 4-6? However, each both has only one grill, whereas the high tables have 2 grills for every 8 seats. The restaurant is still fairly new so of course everything is spankin' clean!   I usually come here with parties of 4-8 so we order by the BULK, literally. Our favorite appetizers are the:  1. Fried Squid Legs 2. Japchae! 3. Sesame Chicken 4. Korean Fried Chicken 5. Seaweed Salad 6. Salad 7. Rice (a must lol)  and for meats we love getting: 1. Marinated Prime Rib (#10) 2. Brisket 3. Pork Belly 4. Bulgogi 5. Spicy Chicken  The quality of the food tastes better/fresher than other AYCE KBBQ places I've been to in Vegas. They have a large variety of food as well, making the price of lunch ($14.95) and dinner ($19.95) all the more WORTH IT. And I'm glad I don't leave feeling gross and smelly like how I do at Tofu Hut or Haro. They have a bar and happy hour as well, but unfortunately I have yet to partake in that experience ): The ambience is trendy and classy since the lighting is dimmed. Don't worry you can still see your food and company still!  The customer service is great overtime I come here. No matter how busy or understaffed they seem, it is always quick and personable. We get our grill changed accordingly and have no problems with the workers.  I truly recommend this place if you're looking for an AYCE KBBQ place. The distance might be a deal breaker but it's no problem for me. Thank you for opening in Nevada Gen KBBQ!"}
{"text":"This place was good I enjoyed it. Went through 3 different servers and I didn't even get asked what I wanted to order from the first server he just left. Waited about 20 minutes before I was able to get my first order in. Then asked for more napkins and didn't get any. The server when he left didn't introduce the new server as well as the second. The food was the only thing that made this rating the service failed."}
{"text":"This my new favorite AYCE Korean BBQ. The atmosphere is upbeat, clean, and modern. The staff is wonderful and everyone is so attentive. The selections are so plentiful and a great variety of beef, chicken, pork and seafood. I stsrted with the cajun shrimp and garlic calamari. I then stuck to most of the different pork belly items.The spicy soft tofu soup was flavorful I almost got another bowl. You can be sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Come here with my brother again. We always love this place. We normally come here once or twice a month. And today I met my server Julian again. He is as awesome as always.  My brother likes his service too."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Ozzy was amazing as our server. Give this guy a raise. Or an iPad at least"}
{"text":"Intrigue and good company brought me in to Gen last night. The atmosphere is comfortable and trendy, the food selection is plentiful, and the staff members are very pleasant. However, the service is subpar, the quality of the food is nothing special, and the sanitary condition and cleanliness is questionable in parts of the restaurant that give pause to parts unseen. The confusion and disorganization however became a primary focus instead of enjoying the dining experience.   I was really looking forward to coming to this restaurant, but I don't live in Henderson. I needed a reason to travel this way - and my friend's invitation was the motivating force. I was excited as I love cultural food varieties and the concept of a cook-it yourself Korean BBQ peeked my interest.   Upon walking in to GEN, we were told our wait would be 30-minutes as they were quite busy. So, we headed over to the bar for our wait but became confused where to sit. It is an eating bar so grills are located between seats. I would have had no problem sitting down regardless of the grill plates, but the restaurant policy is obviously to presets the standard sides along the grill plates (e.g., spicy cucumbers, Korean potatoes salad, kimchi, meat dipping sauce & salt). I think having people stand around preset food is a little unsanitary. So, my stomach was slightly turning before ever sitting down to eat. Upon being seated, our assigned table also had preset seasonal sides at the table. This is truly a strange concept - I mean we are not talking about sealed condiments or salt & peppershakers. We are talking about open ramekins of food on tables in a busy restaurant with numerous people eating around these tables were preset food is placed. Not even the silverware in this restaurant is open to the elements - why the food?  We first ordered some Gen appetizers to give us time to look over the meat selection on the menu. The Crispy Squid Legs were tough to eat. The Gyoza was very good. The Pork Cutlet was good but arrived lukewarm. About 10-minutes after we received the three appetizers another server tried to bring us another set of appetizers not realizing we already received our order. But, the atmosphere of confusion doesn't end here.  Throughout the dinning experience we tried many selections of meat. We had the Gen Galbisal, Garlic Chicken, Gen Chadol, Pork Belly, Smoked Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Spicy Octopus, and Cajun Shrimp. There was really nothing that stood out as an amazing choice. Some of the meat had great flavor but most was bland that had to be dipped in the salt sauce provided. The garlic chicken came with a cheese like dip in a tin ramekin that had to be tossed on the grill plate so it could be made dippable.   Food runners would drop off ordered meat selections and run as abruptly as they arrived. At times, we were confused about what had been delivered - and searching for someone to answer this question after it was dropped off was futile. The answers tended to feel more like  guesses. Some answers were blantantly not correct with what appeared to be staff feeling compelled to give an answer - any answer. For example when asked what the side selections were, I was told my romaine salad was the seaweed salad :) I know what seaweed salad looks like - so really? When I asked what meat selection was dropped off - beef tongue or Gen Chadol, I was told it was Gen Chadol. It was a different quantity than was previously ordered and it didn't taste quit the same,  so I used the menu pictures for comparison. Yup, I ate my friends beef tongue thinking it was my Chadol.  The service staff appeared to be going in two directions at the same time - rather consistently. It was standard to wait long periods of time to have the grill plate replaced (or lit). Meanwhile, inhaling the burning smoke from food particles that fused to the stainless steal plate and produced a flowing, burning stream of smoke not caught by the under grill filtration system was uncomfortable. It really ruined the mediocre experience!   Cooking the meats on the grill was easier when oil was put on the grill plates because the plates are super hot and the meat instantly sticks. Some wait staff would bring oil when changing the plates and others would not. Often times by the time you realize THIS server didn't bring oil, and didn't ask if any was desired, he was off and running. If you were lucky enough to catch a waiter to ask for oil the wait was usually 5-10 minutes. Additionally, not one server could tell me what kind of oil they were using on the grill plates.   Lastly, there is a garbage and plate collection station outside of the restroom area. It is an unsightly, gross scene.  I can't stand to see dirty dish stations. That is something that should be in the back of a restaurant. I am not sure the flow of this restaurant was considered before the opening.  My Mango-Tini was really good! -  In the end, I won't be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Really nice service and the food is good! Waited about 10 mins to be seated which was not bad for a Friday night. Our server Kailin was really welcoming and attentive. She always came back to our table to make sure we had everything. Shout-out for Kailin!! Definitely will come back to Gen!"}
{"text":"This was my first Korean BBQ experience. Food was great. My server Eugene was excellent. Easily the best service I have had in a long time. Made the trip really worth it."}
{"text":"Do something about your wait time. I have tried to go here 4 times and each time the wait was over 2 hours long!! Either start taking reservations or don't let a party sit for hours at a time during their meal. People don't have time to wait 2 hours or try to go to your establishment continuously to try to get in. I would rather make a reservation weeks in advance rather than keep having to drive there only for the wait to be over 2 hours long."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: For the most part Good service. They are fairly attentive. There were several instances that we had to remind them to bring us something we had asked for.    They are very generous with the portions and keep bringing out more and more meat.    I had never been here before so it would have been good for them to tell you how the place works.   The vents above us didn't seem to work well. There was a draft in the restaurant pushing smoke from the table next to us directly to us.   I wasn't impressed with the variety or quality of the meat. The marinades were too mild and most of the meat to fatty for my likings.   Very limited non meat options.  The KFC came out ice cold. We had to ask for a second order that was warm. Not room temp cold but refrigerator cold.   The place was poorly ventilated and too loud. The music was too loud and made it difficult to talk. Your clothes will smell like the poorly ventilated restaurant.   A lot of people obviously love this place. I don't think it's for me."}
{"text":"Two different perspectives...  By my Korean standards, I would've give the food a 2.5. While you can't really go wrong on meat, it was ok. And then the japchae, soondubu and side dishes... meh. It mimicked the real thing, but tasted nothing like it was really supposed to.  By my normal standards... a 3.5. The portions were pretty small. My friends tried about just everything that was beef and chicken, and I would say to stick with the steak meats if you're looking for real korean bbq but the flavored meats weren't too bad.   service was amazing though. I loved the attention by the servers and our cups were rarely left empty long.   I've been to the gen in California and this is NOT what it was like. Which is why I think I'm more disappointed. Was hoping for a new bbq spot to go with friends but moving on.... So overall, ok. Will I go back... maybe."}
{"text":"Gen has always been my go to place for Korean BBQ and this time did not disappoint! We were expecting to wait at least half an hour for a table, but we got one within five minutes. Our server frequently checked up with us as we were constantly ordering more items. Bring a big appetite because it seriously is a crazy amount of food!!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best korean bbq in the valley. From the service to the food and the atmosphere, you feel wanted there. The food selection is great and they do a really good job on replacing the grill when needed. I've been to Gangnam, mana, and the one dobson and. Guadalupe and none of them match to Gen. Also this place matches up to some of the best kbbq in LA."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Korean bbq. You can't beat the price for the amount of food and service you get, $19.99 is a steal. Tommy was a cool server. He just move to town and was very social. I like how all of the servers checked on you consistently. I will be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Excellent service from our waitress jaenica. 10/10 would eat here again  Food was excellent, the meat was of high quality, pork cutlet appetiser was crunchy and delicious"}
{"text":"I am pleased to say that when me and my friends went in we had one of the best waitresses ever her name is elodea. Not only was she on point she also joined in on our jokes and made our experience that much better. Elodea deserves a promotion if not recognition on being an exceptional server."}
{"text":"Coming back to this gen is always a good experience. Had great service from the great server Alan and Josh who helped out. The manager, Eugene, is so kind and welcoming every time I come here to eat. Let's not forget to mention the best hostess Lauren!"}
{"text":"Howard and the whole staff was amazing. Drove 30 minutes across town and will gladly do so because the service and menu was fantastic. Our server Howard was great and helped with all our needs along with customer service that was astounding. My new favorite KBBQ place!"}
{"text":"It's finally open and definitely worth it!   Dinner is $24.95 for adults and less for kids.  You get SOOO many options from beef to pork to chicken to seafood. Although today is their official soft opening, that did not stop them from providing good service. The place was packed full and the wait was out the door.   You really can't go wrong with all you can eat meat at an affordable price. I love that there is plain meat so you can dip it in your sauce and also marinated meat when you just want that extra oomph.   They do however limit you to 4 orders of meat at a time which is fine because once the meat arrives, you can put in your next order.   Pros: + service was perfect !  + never had to ask for drink refills   + grill was promptly change throughout dinner  + that volcano chicken was bomb, we order it 3 times and each time it came out, it felt freshly fried and not just sitting around ( watch out it is a little spicy )   Cons:  - they are cheap on their side dishes, when a customer ask for a refill, it means they actually eat that side so give a lot. Felt like we had to ask for it way to often because they give very little at a time - the person who collect empty plates kept taking away our half eaten salad bowl and not refilling it so we end up having no salad or keep asking for it again   Oh and they currently are not serving alcohol and don't have dessert yet. One of the server assured us they will soon.   Definitely would recommend this place! My favorites are beef brisket, Hawaiian steak, and rib meat!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good the service was good and our server yuhao was pretty helpful the lighting on the place its amazing and it looks everything very modern the blue lights makes the restaurant look a+"}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in town. Skip going all the way to Chinatown for a good Korean meal. This place is wonderful. Lunch buffet is great. All food is kept in the back until you ask for what you want which is great because there's no tampering with other people's food and most buffets have food sitting out for long periods of time. We tried the regular pork belly, smoked garlic pork belly, steak bulgolgi, and the beef brisket. By far the winners were smoked pork belly and steak bulgolgi. Seong was our server...great service! Prices are excellent and the food is way better than Korean restaurants in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my family and jaenica made it that much better. She was on top of everything by consistently checking up to see if there was anything else we needed and getting everything out in a timely manner. She was simply amazing, thank you again :)"}
{"text":"Our go to Korean BBQ, service is prompt and considerate. Servers were very hospitable and accommodating.   The interior is very new and 'fushion-y'. Place is very well spread out, their 6-person table has enough elbow space.  Parking is great as its located by the mall. Expect some wait time on the weekends at lunch if you get there late.  Price is just right for the buffet. My kids love the premium pork belly and KFC.  And the 2 hr limit is perfect for lunch, unless you have a big group.  The selections was a bit limited or didn't have enough variety. Looking for a few more inerts/more meat selections for some Korean Authenticity. I guess its catering to the customers."}
{"text":"Hi I'm BACK leaving a FAT review for my blue collared boy Ozzy. 10/10 with the exceptional work again. Honestly only really go to this kbbq place because of his exceptional work and service. Ozzy is the picture perfect image of what a GREAT server looks like. Will continue coming to the restaurant for Ozzy!! God bless"}
{"text":"DON'T, JUST DON'T! We went there at about 10PM on a Saturday and w-a-i-t-e-d to be seated. They put our party of seven at a table so small, they had to add a chair to the end of the table. Plus, the wait staff was extremely rude, and it took a long time to order and get our meat. After sitting there starving, and finally getting our meat, we then found that their grill was S-L-O-W!  We told two regular employees about the grill (with no resolution), then asked for the manager, and was given the \"assistant\" manager (still no resolution).  You only get a certain amount of time to eat there, and our wait staff told us that we had to have our last order in by 11:00. After complaining more, and more waiting, we finally got the \"real\" manager, Eugene Kang, who was the rudest, and argued with us about the wait time, and told us that the wait staff did NOT tell us that 11PM was the cutoff time (untrue, and unless he was at the table, how could he know what seven people heard), arguing about the cooker, etc., and more and he was VERY CONFRONTATIVE.  It was readily apparent that he was enjoying his position of power at that restaurant. It was embarrassing, and my daughter wanted to be away from everyone seated near us.  When she stood up, HE STOOD IN FRONT OF HER AND PHYSICALLY BLOCKED HER!!! She was so intimidated that she called the police, and a report was made, resulting in one of those little white cards explaining rights to victims of crimes.  Even after all of this, the manager was lying, stating that we ordered 22 orders of meat and had eaten all of them but one, when there was a grill full of uncooked meat at the table, and more meat raw on the table that could not be put on the grill. At least two of us had a very tight throat, two of us had the runs after eating there, and at least one of us still has a cramped stomach, two days later.  What we can gather, is that the food cooker is slow so that not a lot of meat can be cooked.  The entire staff was rude, and when I went to pay for mine so I could leave (I thought I was going to have to get medical care due to my stomach cramping and tight throat), there were three employees at the register who were smirking.  After the police came, the rest of our party left and were not made to pay, but I still AM PAYING even two days later, with stomach cramping.  Overall, this is a horrible establishment with staff that is RUDE, and it is VERY apparent that they don't care about their customers.  Don't go there.  There are many other \"real\" Korean BBQ's in town that DO CARE, cost less money, and appreciate their patrons.  Our understanding is that the Henderson Gen Barbecue House is one branch of an overall CHAIN OF RESTAURANTS."}
{"text":"After all the time I spent in Korea with the Air Force, I wouldn't say I'm an expert in Korea or Korean food, I just know what I like, and this isn't it.  The service is good, they bring the food quickly, and there's lots of it, but the marinade for the bulgogi just isn't quite right: it tastes like it's just soy sauce without any ginger or other seasonings.  The kimchi selection isn't what you'd get in a place in Chinatown, and I prefer a place where I go get my own selection from a line (Sura, five stars), instead of them bringing it to me (like at Mother's).  However, if you're in Henderson at the Galleria and you just HAVE to have Korean BBQ, stop here."}
{"text":"The staff didn't have a clue!! We had to re-light our burner four times, they couldn't seem to remember if we ordered two soups or four, two orders of rice or four. A drink was spilled on my buddy, yet everything was on the bill ( at least comp the tea! ). They assume everyone used chop sticks. I wasn't impressed. Lots of wasted space out front. We had almost an hour wait, so we went next door for a drink. With the pleasant night, a patio would have been nice. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Great clean and friendly environment. If you like kbbq you have to try Gen."}
{"text":"So we walked into the place to have lunch and we were asked to wait till we be seated , we looked around there was only 2 tables and the rest of the restaurant was empty. So we waited for about 15 minutes and nobody seated us so I had to ask the lady up front what the holdup was and she said we will be seating you shortly were busy right now. Needless to say we left what a joke of a place"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with my last visit..  My boyfriend come here at least 2-3 times a month, sometimes more and we have always had a pleasant experience.  But this time we left extremely dissatisfied and disgusted.  When we first walked in our shoes stuck to the ground because it was so sticky. Which we ignored because maybe someone spilt a drink, no big deal. Than we arrived at our table.. It looked clean but the second we sat down we felt a weird film over the seats and our hands covered in what we assume was grease on the table. We immediately informed the lady that seated us... instead of having someone come over and actually wipe down the table she hands us more napkins... Really? I didn't realize the people eating and paying also need to clean your mess.  So we waited until our waiter got to us and informed her, she was kind enough to offer to have our tables switched which of course we politely accepted.  Than we were faced with other problems. -The grill wouldn't get hot even after we asked her to turn it up -The scissors weren't sharp enough to cut the food -The waiter was no where to be found when we needed her -The food quality was very poor, weird textures, slimy consistency with the KFC which comes fully cooked. -Waited 15-30 minutes to pay our bill.  We could have walked out with out paying and no one would have noticed, that's how bad it was.   Like I said, we came here quite frequently at different times of the day and have NEVER had a problem like this. Tonight was just one disappointment after the other.  We will most likely not be returning to GEN and will be on the search for a new kbbq place."}
{"text":"I keep coming here, and it never disappoints!  Lunch during the weekdays are cheap for KBBQ here in Vegas! Dinner price ain't bad either. 15 or 20$. The food is bomb. Good selection of side dishes! Wide variety of meats like 30 items to order from. What keeps me coming back here other than the good price and food, is the customer service. Our server was ALODIA, and she was the best server! From beginning to end she consistently checked up on us, gave us our items quick, and was super sweet and friendly. Gave us exactly what we asked for. If you have Alodia, she's the best!"}
{"text":"First off, this place tops off every other KBBQ we've been too. Just a heads up it gets pretty busy, we came here on a Sunday night and there was a one hour wait. They also have an app that displays your spot in line, which is very helpful. Our server Howard / Yuhao, was exceptionally friendly. He provided great customer service, very accommodating to our every need. He explained the menu to us, like how the appetizers come with the price of $20 per person. The coca cola drinks are refillable, not like some kbbq places where you buy sprite by the can lol. My wife and I ordered the usual brisket and beef bulgogi. On top of that we ordered spicy chicken, Cajun shrimp, marinated beef steak. For our appetizers ordered the popcorn shrimp and Gyoza. I'm going to make this short and simple. The brisket is the business. Bulgogi could be a hit or miss depending if you like it more sweet or not. The Cajun shrimp was a miss for me, as it was lacking in flavor. The spicy chicken, it is delicious especially since I love spicy food. The marinated beef steak is delicious, has a nice garlic kick to it. For appetizers I liked the popcorn shrimp, the Gyoza was very lackluster. Overall the dinner was awesome! I suggest you ask for Howard as he was really tentative to our every need! I'll see you soon Gen kbbq!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying our waitress, Alodia, was amazing!! She was very sweet and attentive. At the end of our meal, when the person that took our payment asked what our favorite part of dinner was...I told her it was our waitress! They don't take reservations but if you can request Alodia, I would!   I was surprised by how good the quality of the meat was considering the affordable AYCE price. ($20.99 for dinner) When you sit down, you have your standard side dishes on the table already and the server brings you salad. Once you place your order, the server will also bring rice for everyone at the table. My favorite items were Bulgogi and the K.F.C. chicken. (Korean Fried Chicken. It's a sweet and spicy chicken that comes to the table already cooked. We ordered it twice because it was so good! The Bulgogi takes a while to cook but it had the most flavor out of what I ordered. The only dish I didn't like was the pork belly. I'm usually a fan but it wasn't good at all. (I could only eat one bite)  If you're looking for an affordable, clean, yummy Korean BBQ restaurant, I would give this place a try! If you download the Nowait app, you can use it to get a table, with notifications of how many parties are ahead of you."}
{"text":"I've actually been to another Gen in California, and when I heard they were opening one in Tempe I had to go! This spot is Instagram worthy! The food is delicious! I always recommend Gen to everyone! I think it makes a fun little date spot too :)"}
{"text":"Great BBQ AYCE place to take the kids. The weekend price is all day ($21.99) and kids are measured to determine the price. I think over 50\" is full price? We've been here a few times. This last time we had Anthony as our waiter and he was very kind and continually checked on us throughout. The meats were great and the Galbi and the spicy pork was the favorite. Food comes out very quickly and they ask to change the grill plate a few times. Sides were pretty standard, but limited in comparison to other AYCE places. There aren't any extra appetizers available or desserts included so that's the main reason for the star loss. You can order a macron ice cream sandwich for like $3.50 extra? The place is huge so the wait is minimal, which is a big bonus for us! Customer service has always been on point, which is a big reason we have been back a few times."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be awesome but ...? Went during lunch hours, only 5-6 sides were out. I'm used to more but the portions of the sides seemed smaller than normal. We ordered two meats to start off but then I realized our waiter didn't turn on the grill. We had to wait a bit until the second server came out with our meat and turned on the burner for us (it wasn't a big deal since the grill heated up so quickly). I ordered a Cajun chicken but I feel like I ordered wrong as it didn't taste great and I love Cajun.   Loved the atmosphere but it didn't feel like regular KBBQ place,? I was put off at how little there was (even the menu seemed scarce?). I plan on giving it another try during dinner time but for now, it's just okay. It isn't the best."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Atmosphere is truly a 10/10 and I really appreciate the food here. I rarely find a KBBQ place that exceeds my expectations but I really found that the 30+ menu items and the pricing here was actually really great. Start off with 3 items at a time, usually not something I would do but was recommended by the waitress and that became my routine throughout the night. I believe it works best because the service is a bit slow and I'm sure it's due to how busy the place is. It did however take me asking 3 different times for a part of my meal. And waiting about 10 mins for a pair of chopsticks to replace the one I dropped in the middle of my meal. Coming here just be mindful that the staff may not be as attentive as is standard in many restaurants due to the high occupancy the restaurant has at certain hours.  We got there for dinner in the mid week."}
{"text":"Gen gave me really nice experience!! I came here yesterday with 8 other friends. What surprised me the most was that we were a large group, but our server YUHAO aka HOWARD served us really well. He gave us lots of recommendations and was always there when we need him. And also when Yuhao went on break, Terry helped us a lot. He is nice, too. The food was good. My favorite was spicy octopus. I literally ate more than 5 dishes of them!! And more importantly, with such nice environment, service, and high quality foods, it was only $20 a person and $15 for lunch!! I have been to so many KBBQ AYCE restaurants in Chinatown, they can't even offer a price like this!! I will definitely recommend everyone to come here and try. You will know why I like here so much."}
{"text":"Had dinner with husband Sunday 6/26. This is our 4th time. We're always impressed by the service and the food is delicious. It's fun to be able to cook on the grill. The waiters change them out often. Our favorite is bulgogi  anything. And spicy anything!  Chap chae, tofu soup, Gyoza were all tasty. Gen's all you can eat venue provides enough food for an army!!!  A big eater could really inflict some damage. It doesn't hurt that they have Sapporo on draft!!  Macaroon ice cream cookies are a must try.    Minna is always our waiter as we ask for him!  He's attentive, courteous, makes great suggestions. We love his work ethic!!!! Entire staff is super friendly and fast!!  If you don't want to wait, go at 5:30pm."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the menu. Lots of things to choose from for new and experienced kbbq consumers. The variety of proteins was very balanced between \"strange\" meats and common such as chicken. The price is really good for dinner. Slightly cheaper than most places. I'd been craving soondoboo jjigae (spicy tofu stew) for a while. When I saw that they had it I was excited. When I ordered and got it.....not so much. It looked so watered down and the tofu looked like it was mashed up. The deokbokki was strange to me. It was crispy and the sauce was overly sweet it was almost like I should have ordered it for desert.  The banchan honestly is part of what makes kbbq what it is for me and this place SUCKED!!!! The kimchi was alright but your selection was so bleh because you only had four to choose from. The KFC was really good and definitely would be getting that more often. The portions were a little on the smaller side than I was used to but that's fine. Order little by little. The service was great, the server was very attentive and changed the grill when I asked. Expect to smell like meat because there were no vents. The ambiance was nice though, super modern. Would I go again? Sure if someone asked me to go. Would I actively try to go or recommend it right off the bad? Probably not I'd rather go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I tried this place on my Vegas trip and it did not disappoint me at all. The meat was high quality and flavorful; also the salad was really well-dressed. Compared to the location near where I live, the quality is a bit above service and taste wise. However, the downside is that the restaurant is way too smoky, it's as if the ventilators are not working at all. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience because I was extra hungry but I hope they could do something about the smoky environment."}
{"text":"Great price, great food, great service! ALODIA was AWESOME! very friendly & prompt! Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious meats, fresh and clean atmosphere. Staff was nice on a super busy day. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, great time. Ozzy did a great job waiting on us. Food was fresh and fun to prepare. Staff was very helpful with what to order and the best way to prepare. Very much enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Service was only okay. Food was good.   Restaurant has a 3 card per group regardless of size policy. Made the check really awkward. Then after working it out with the server he didn't do it. A host came by and we had to go through all of the awkwardness again.   Will absolutely never return."}
{"text":"We love Korean BBQ and we went there based on Yelp's reviews.  We were very pleased.  Food was great, service was very attentive, and loved the atmosphere.  The only thing we were disappointed with was the chicken served with a can of cheese for fondue.  We were not impressed with the cheese but the chicken was good. Price was great for the lunch hour.  We will definitely come back here next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Gen is definitely a good Korean bbq place! Food quality is very good, especially Kalbisal and beef tongue! However the food portion is a little bit small, at first we didn't expect about the portion, so we just ordered a little at first; however,our server,Bo is very caring, he gave us very good recommendations and always check up with our table. Food came out very fast and overall that is a very good dinning experience."}
{"text":"We usually go early (before 6pm) to ensure that we get a table and not be stuck in line.  We have been here about 4 time and it has improved each time - esp. the service.  Here is our breakdown:  1 - Environment.  Very spacious and plenty of room.  The seats are comfortable for parties of 6 or less.  For parties that are greater than 6, you most likely be sitting in separate tables.  If I recall, they have booth seating instead of individual table seating.  Overall, it is comfortable and nicely laid out.  I give this a solid 4.  2.  Service.  Like I said, service has improved each time.  We were here when they were opened a few months.  Let's say service was horrid.  However, they have gained more experience, quality of the servers have improved, and response time have dramatically changed for the better.  It went from a 1 star to about 3.5.  3.  Food.  I wish there were more side dishes.  However, there is still enough of a variety.  The quality of meat are average (you aren't going to a five star restaurant) but still very good.  We spend much of our time ordering Galbi, Bugolgi, and Beef tongue (very good by the way).  One of the things they could improve upon is to have a dessert menu as part of the AYCE.  We give this a solid 4 for the type of restaurant and variety of meats.  Overall, we enjoy dining here.  It is definitely one of our go to places for Korean BBQ in Las Vegas... esp.  AYCE!"}
{"text":"Back at Gen. so pumped to have Shea again, she introduced us to radish paper...game changer!"}
{"text":"Food is great ambiance is cool and modern. A nice place to go for BBQ... Serving are small portions so try to order 2 of each.. Everything is great but the downside would be as usual long waits like other restO but worth it..."}
{"text":"Love this Korean BBQ. Really good food for a great price. What time kind of long. Doesn't take reservations. But worth trying. Lunch price is good too"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The wait though can range from 30 minutes to 3 hours!! Definitely always recommend going in early to put your name down. The food is all you can eat but be carful cause if you don't finish they charge you $5 extra. It's a very busy place and sometimes can be hard to grab your waiters attention but the food is really good!"}
{"text":"Was seated fairly quickly compared to other popular places. The food was good as well. The portions were a bit small seeing that my group had 5 people. The servers were very attentive, especially Jaenica! Good service all around."}
{"text":"have been here for several times, however, this times is amazing, the recommendations from Our service Rei is excellent (I think his name is Raymond), The ice cream macaron is so good, try the mango flavor. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Ok. This is my first time here trying this place. There's good and bad.  The good: the service is good. It's pretty easy to get their attention and they comes around to check if you need anything. The environment is nice, less smoky so the smoke won't be in your face the whole time.  The bad: The food is tasteless. They need to marinate it long. waited for 45 mins for our food, and then we have to reorder them. They probably lost our order because there's a table that came after we order our food and got thee or food already. The portions are small so you have to keep ordering and wait for the food to come.  But we did come on a holiday, maybe they are too busy. I don't know if we will come back again though."}
{"text":"Nice environment, great food, our server Terry delivered an excellent service! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"WELCOME TO GEN!  I just found this place about a month ago and have already been here 5 times.  It's phenomenal- the food, AND THE SERVICE.  There are mere seconds between making and order and having the food delivered to your table.  The amount of options and quality are just mind blowing.   Gen please never change."}
{"text":"The place was really good and the service was outstanding. The waiters where very attentive and the actual service was pretty quick from ordering to delivery of the food and drinks. I will definitely be going back. The only issue that I had which it's kinda understandable is that it was pretty warm and I sweat a little which I understand there is a grill in the middle of the table but maybe the a/c should be set to a lower temperature or something. Like I said its a small thing but overall my family and I loved it, recommend it to anyone, and will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Just had a beyond compare experience in this Korean BBQ restaurant. Spicy octopus is a must try. Very nicely decorated. Also wanna say thanks to Malaika, Alan, Tao, Jessica, Josh, Shea, Dakota and Kailin for providing excellent experience."}
{"text":"If I could give NO STARS We would. Staff is totally inexperienced and no management to train or lead obvious except the only guy over 20 sitting at a rear booth with a computer and never once asked if he could assist. First off, we had no idea what to do with the grill... So when we asked, we turned It on, but it didn't work so we waited to get it lit. Still didn't work, so we waited again for someone else. He had to keep the grill cooking surface at an angle, so veggies rolled down! I asked three people for a fork. Finally went and got one myself. No one explains what/how this dreadful experience works. We got KFC chicken for appetizer and it was stone cold. We put it on our grill. We told our waiter and he said, \"that's great\"! We then had marinated beef, but it burnt the grill and we were told that you should cook raw meat first... And why didn't you tell us that before? Horrible experience with a staff who is totally green. NEVER would we go there again. WE asked for the check and that took ten minutes!!!"}
{"text":"Overall bad experience.  First, the seating in the place is inefficient. If you come with a party of six or more people, be prepared to wait for 45 minutes. This could have been totally avoided if they sat smaller groups at the respective small booths, but for some reason they don't do that.  It was frustrating to see a couple eating at the \"large seating section\" meant for larger groups.      No sense of urgency.  This is ironic as this restaurant has a time limit. It takes too long for the wait staff to refill drinks, take more orders, bus tables and generally speaking, tend to customers.  We had to write a list down of \"refill soda, more X, Y, Z, extra spoon, etc\" because the time in between a waiter checking on us was a rare occasion and the list of things needed kept growing.  Hiring a few extra workers would do this place wonders."}
{"text":"Gen is now one of my favorite Korean BBQ restaurants. I went on a busy Friday for my birthday and was told it could be a 2 hour wait, which I was fine with since there were 8 of us and I didn't want to be split up in booths. We walked around for a bit and not even an hour later I got a text that the table was ready and even a phone call. That helps start an amazing night knowing it didn't take forever to sit down.  The food was amazing as well. You can have 4 meats at a time and can order more if everything is on the grill. No complaints and we were taken care of very well. Our waiter was James and he was amazing. Always checking on us to see if we wanted to order more, got my friends large bowls of mash potatoes and kim chi, always changing our grill for us, and even help celebrate my birthday by singing with other employees and was amazing at taking a pic for my party.  Above all I approve because they were playing kpop. 5 stars and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Totally hip, spacious, and busy.  My first impression of this place, its packed! Came here on a Saturday night, and it was a pretty full house, fragrant with grilled meat that you will definitely leave smelling like your meal.  Love that they have drinks here! Soju galore! The soju capri is a fun choice if you're feeling adventurous. (Not included in AYCE)  They have appetizers like gyoza and jap-chae, veggies, and your typical side dishes.  Hostess failed to greet us, but the rest of the staff was friendly, attentive, gave reccomendations, and solicitated feedback. They were also very fast is bringing out what we ordered within a 5 minute timeframe. So good job there guys!   Now for the important stuff! The meat! Porkbelly dishes were thick, most of them weee pretty good with acceptable flavor. Except for the wine porkbelly. That was the most bland and dry/chewy piece of porkbelly I have ever eaten, also the purple color was a little off putting. Briskets and beef tongue were cut thin. We ordered a steak, or something along those lines, and it was huge! You definitely get some quality meat here, and they don't skimp at all.  They have seafood here as well! The squid/calamari was so tender and tasty! The octopus wasn't bad either, but it did look scary at first uncooked haha. Shrimp were not marinated, but a good option to start out your meal with(you peel off the shell yourself).  They have ice cream macarons here (not included in AYCE, so 3.50 each). Totally worth it if you love sweets! They have strawberry, green tea, coffee, and mango flavor.  The only thing I have to say is that I was incredibly thirsty after the meal. I'm usually a very hydrated person, but I was so parched and guzzling down water hours later. So that might be an indication of what they use to marinate thier meat/seafood with.  Overall good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour to be seated for a table of 7. The waiter was very unanttentive he initially only brought out half the meat we ordered. He then kept bringing out plates of noodles we didn't order. Our drinks were empty for extended periods during our dining. The beef bulgogi they brought out was frozen and we waited for at least 30 minutes for edemame that was ordered. The server returned to the table 3 times and asked if we were doing ok and we kept having to remind him about the edemame. The worst is that they charged 18% gratuity for tables larger than six, I usually tip more but on this occasion the server was less than deserving of any gratuity at all. I have eaten at many Korean bbq establishments in Las Vegas and Los Angeles this place is by far the worst as far as service and food quality."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday and you need to come early. I been to the location by Galleria  mall. It was good at that location but this location is way better. I brought my family and we had a party of 8 and everyone I mean everyone is awesome that work there. They are so nice and attentive. Even did things I didn't expect.. The upper management helped out and I was shocked that they would be helping out..   All the meats was good and fresh. Came out fresh and fast. I can't complain of all the meats and veggies. Just wished they had a dessert option but never fear I went to Dairy Queen lol.  But I'm not  going to lie this place is good.. it's not Mom and pop place but the employees are awesome and you all deserve a high five.."}
{"text":"Way over rated work Korean BBQ the serivce was slow. The meat was avg. Went in a party of 6 paid 18% for bad serivce as well avg food. Drove all the way to Henderson for a good night out with feienda and family and found it was no where close to even ok. The place looks nice. But it just to trick non foodies. If u are a true foodie u will know the place is over rated"}
{"text":"I went on a early weekday afternoon where the place was pretty empty, just a couple people and a bunch of workers and I still had to wait a couple minutes to be seated. The service is alright, they come out really fast when you do order. I just sat down and they came to the table asking for our drink order and I didn't even have time to look through the menu, I always found that kind of annoying. The food is really good, I enjoyed myself but when it came time to pay the girl I had taking down the food we were ordering had an attitude because I asked if they had any to go cups. Which kinda blew the mood on wanting to be there."}
{"text":"Went on a date here. We both loved it! The service was great, the food excellent,  the lighting and energetic atmosphere created a wonderful dining experience. The food was great, and we enjoyed trying new flavors. This place is perfect for any occasion or dress attire. Recommend as a Vegas must do!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience!  Was seated in less than a minute. Our server Alodia was very informative about how everything works and came to check on us more often than any other Korean BBQ I have been. Even our busser, David, was always on top of getting our table cleared and always looked busy. There was plenty of options to choose from when it came to the menu. The food tasted great and we never had to wait long to order for more. I will sure to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Nine of us came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. When my mother-in-law called, they told her that they don't take reservations, but when we got there they said they had two large parties already scheduled for that night, so I'm still not clear as to whether they actually would have accepted a reservation if they had known the size of our group.  Because we didn't have a reservation they told us it would be an hour wait if we wanted to be split into two tables or a two hour wait to sit as one group at the high top tables. We opted for the hour wait and agreed to split into two groups. After nearly an hour had passed, and watching the Yelp app showing that we were nearly next on the list, we checked on our table. At that point they started to claim that it would be another hour before we could get in. It appeared that they were trying to wait for two tables to clear at the same time, rather than hold one open until a second one cleared. As a result, it seemed to me that other people were being sat before us. We almost left, but decided to give it a few more minutes. I don't know if they could that we were going to leave, but within 20 minutes we were notified that our tables were ready, although it still took another 10 minutes before we were actually seated. So, nearly 90 minutes after arriving we were finally ready to begin ordering.  The concept itself is fairly straightforward. There's a burner/hotplate/grill in the middle of the table, you order from the menu of 38 items, cook the items you order on the grill, and eat. The cost is $25 per person and it is all-you-can-eat. To ensure that you're eyes aren't bigger than your stomach, they will only allow you to order 4 items at a time, there is a two-hour time limit on how long you can stay at a table, and they charge you $5 for any items not eaten (basically a restocking charge).  As for the food, there are many options and it's fun to try new things. Among the more common items we tried were the garlic chicken, Korean Fried Chicken, pork belly, and calamari. The more exotic items included baby octopus, shrimp (with heads and tails still attached), and beef tongue. The expressions on my kids face were priceless as they put an octopus on the grill or learned to devein a shrimp, but they soldiered on actually really liked the food. My 12-year-old said his favorite was the spiced pork bulgogi while I enjoyed the beef tongue the best, although it was sliced so thin it didn't really have the typical tongue flavor.  Food service was fast although my one complaint was that every time you asked for a refill on your drink they took the entire glass and actually refilled and returned it which took a while. Come on, plastic glasses aren't that pricey and a restaurant should have enough so that your server can get you a new soda and remove your old one at the same time.  Also, they should really take reservations as they almost lost our entire business and we likely won't ever return because of the wait. Once we were in though, we did enjoy the food and the experience so if you don't mind waiting or just want to plan to do some shopping at Tempe Marketplace first, you may want to check it out."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place last time I was in Phoenix but my schedule didn't permit it. Luckily I was able to in here yesterday.  The service was great I was greeted and seated promptly. My waiter was always around and asked if I was alright or if I needed anything. My only gripe is I was seated next to the clean up cart which kind of downed the experience a little. Maybe get rid of the table I was at so no one has to sit next to a pile of dirty dishes in the cart.  The food was great a lot of good choices. I had the galbi, spicy pork bulgogi, pork belly, premium chador, and some gyoza. As soon as I ordered my 4 and the food came out my waiter asked if I wanted to order anything right away. As I was eating alone I passed as I had a lot of food already in front of me.  I liked everything I ordered galbi, chadol, and the spicy pork bulgogi were probably my favorite. I didn't really care for the pork belly. Skip the pork belly to save room for the other meats.  All in all great place with great food I just wish I was at a different table. I'll be back again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Gen to open in Vegas for the longest time, so of course I had to go to their grand opening. I've been a really big fan of Gen ever since I got to try it in California, and it is definitely one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants I have ever been to (although this location still does not compare to the ones in California). Service here is alright, it really depends on who you get as a server.  Lunch price is $14.95 while dinner price is $19.95, which is great considering all the choices of meat that they offer.  When I went here for their grand opening, they still needed to make some adjustments, specifically on their grills. Our grill turned off so many times to the point where it got so annoying, but the servers were nice enough to help us and keep turning it on. It probably would've been better if they transferred us to another table though lol.  Anyway, I'm in love with Korean BBQ, so I definitely went back several more times. The time I went with my friends, service was slow. Our server just kept disappearing, and we had to keep asking other servers for help. Same thing happened when I returned with my boyfriend and my sister also. The servers just have a really big problem of neglecting their customers. They should always be on sight, especially since this is an all you can eat restaurant, it's expected for people to keep ordering meat, so there really shouldn't be a reason why I can't get a hold of my server.  Another down side to this place is the location and wait. Although I don't really mind driving all the way to Henderson, it takes 20 minutes from my house to get here. So whenever I go here, I always make sure I'm starving, so it's actually worth the drive. I also recommend going here before 6 or 7pm, because that's the time they start to get really busy and the wait can go up to 2 hours, especially if you have a big party. Other than that, everything else is great. This is the only Korean BBQ restaurant I would ever go to in Vegas, because of their exceptional price and high quality meat!"}
{"text":"It's always a fun experience at Gen at any location I go to. However, the waiter forgot several of our orders, and was distracted whenever he came to our table. Other than that, the food is always good."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Gen Korean BBQ House! Fantastic service -- we were greeted right away, seated and offered some outstanding recommendations. We ordered and everything was out in minutes. They were quick to take away plates and put in more orders for us. Our waiter changed the grill often which I appreciated. We tried almost everything on the menu and we were very pleased with how delicious and fresh everything tasted. We will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We have been to Gen when we go to LA, and we're very surprised to hear that this location in Vegas had just opened.   Pretty long lines to get in. An hour on the weekend and 25-30 minutes during the week. The ambiance is laid back, clean decor, and very spacious, and for you single guys, the waitresses are easy on the eyes.   Food is spectacular. The spicy pork bulgogi, premium galbi, brisquit, and beef tongue are superbly marinated and great cuts of meat. Paired with the house salad and radish paper, you won't find a healthier, more fulfilling meal.   Our server was Alodia- very nice, prompt, attentive, and recommended all the right items to complete our meal.   We will come here every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food quality here is wonderful! My Mother and I always order a ton of pork belly and steak, and it has never disappointed. Also, the quickness of food delivery to the table is amazing, always. Why the three stars? I have probably been to this location 15-20 times and only once has a server been super friendly/informative/happy to be there. It's almost just expected that there will be a grumpy server every time."}
{"text":"Just like any other Korean BBQ all you can eat. Seasoning is ok. Sides are ok. Service great."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Yuhao and Luke were awesome servers and took good care of us! Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but this really upset me. I am currently sitting inside Gens while I am typing this. My boyfriend loves this place, the food isn't bad it is just isn't MY taste. As of right now this is our second time here and when I first came here I gave it a try. Like I said above, GEN isn't my type of food but I know a lot of people like this place. Long story short, I came here with my boyfriend (let me remind you it's our second time ever) and I told our hostess that I wasn't eating. She said she had to charge me even though I wasn't eating because I was sitting at the table, which I understand but the thing is though no one told us this policy! No one told us this policy the first time we came! Yet the manager insist that we should of know because it is our second time here but no one told us this policy the first time we came nor while we were being seated for our second time! It isn't the hostess fault she did her job and told me the rules, but when I first came our host didn't say crap!"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars if my girlfriend and I had been seated once our buzzer went off. Rather we were kept waiting for an additional 20+ minutes which I feel is bad for business. As far as the food is concerned, I'll rate that at 5 stars. The service itself was terrible though. We actually had to grab another waiter other than our own to assist us with the grill because ours neglected us for the majority of our time until the bill was delivered."}
{"text":"Dined here in December 2017.  Found the wait staff to be very attentive and super helpful.  Loved the atmosphere and overall vibe of the place.  It was a fairly busy Friday night and yet fresh meat arrived promptly.  The barbeque grilling at the table is a lot of fun and super delicious.  I really enjoyed a variety of meats and veggies such as beef bulgolgi and baby octopus.  This is one of the highest quality Korean BBQ in the Phoenix area.  Price is quite reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Gen used to be one of my go to places for AYCE KBBQ. Havnt been back in awhile because I live all the way on the other side of town but decided to eat tonight. I loved that this place has a lot of different appetizers and sides to choose from but THEY CHANGED THEIR MENU!!! Their banchan is so pathetically small too. U can finish it in one bite and constantly have to ask for more sides. They should just give a bigger portion of banchan so they're not always running back and forth to get the sides on the table. I went thru about 5-6 plates of kimchi sides and 7 potato salads and it was just my BF and I.   Onto the meat- Ordered the brisket because that's my favorite to eat. Its ok. The galbi used to be good and tender as well but this time it was so chewy I couldn't even swallow it. Smoked garlic pork belly was good though.  A couple eating next to us ordered a meat that I wasn't sure what it was so I asked a waiter and he told me its roast beef. So I said okay I want to try it and when it came out it was totally different than the plate next to us but they just said its a \"different\" cut. Idk.  Overall, I am disappointed and will not be returning. I'll stick to eating $13.99 tofu hut because it's WAY better than gen and bang for your buck.   Side note: the table next to us ordered an iced sweetened green tea and when they recieved it , there was no ice and it was not sweet. Lol weird"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Gen in Ca, don't come here just yet.  The food is good, but the service is not up to par.  My family of 4 waited 20min after informing a server we needed a refill on water.  He brought the other thing we asked for, then disappeared basically the rest of our dinner.  Everyone else was friendly, but the service basically ruined our experience.    Second visit and wayyyyyyyy better.  Blake and rice paper made a big difference!"}
{"text":"Came here for Easter because Hwaro had a 30 min+ wait. I really like how this place has ample parking and is super spacious and modern on the inside. Waited about 5 min and we were seated. The best part about this place are the servers and the quality of their meat. Our server was Austin, he gave great recommendations, provided quick service, and was very attentive. Our cups were never empty. Not only him, but all the other servers who came by to check on us and drop off food. It was a nice change because usually at ayce places, they tend to forget about you after the third order. Also, the way they season their protein here is very good, very distinct and different flavors rather than everything tasting like sesame oil. Although this place is great, I had to subtract a star for two reasons. One, our table did not have a vent fan above it (some tables do, but our particular section did not). Two, the only dessert they have here is ice cream macaron and it's additional cost at $3.95 I believe, and they are tiny!"}
{"text":"Mathew and Terry were great. Terry was polite, enthusiastic, and attentive. Mathew was bussing, but he took care of us when our server went on break and the next server to cover was stuck in traffic. If anyone's been to any of the other AYCE Korean BBQ places, you'll know that the service is far better. People enjoy working here. It's very well ventilated, and the quality of the meats are pretty good. I've been here a couple of times, and I know my friends, family, and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Pleasant eating experience. Food is good, especially the short rib and tofu soup. Yuhao provided us good service, and he is an expert on the menu! I will bring more friends here next time:)"}
{"text":"Super tasty food w just average quality but can't expect superior quality from an all you can eat. Staff were super attentive and friendly. Only complaint i have is the two hour limit and his place seems to be westernized. They don't bring out lettuce to make wraps of bean paste soup. Otherwise decent if you don't know any better. Disclaimer: the spicy chicken w the warning label is no joke."}
{"text":"Little did I expect, Gen was located at a hip strip mall at Tempe Marketplace. The entire atmosphere, in fact, was surprising. It is much different from dining in an Asian food district; Gen is modern, trendy and loud. When I opened the door, I was greeted with blasting pop music and the aroma of Korean BBQ. I arrived shortly after 1:00 to  get lunch prices ending at 2:00 PM. Unfortunately, the hostess told me there was a forty-five minute wait, delaying my quest for Korean BBQ. They then asked for my phone number to text me when a table was available. This was a neat feature, allowing you to roam outside the restaurant instead of sticking around for your name to be called. The wait passed by quickly since there were many stores to peruse nearby. After forty-five minutes, my family and I were seated at one long table with grills for multiple parties. I would not recommend this if you are uncomfortable sitting close to your neighbor. I was okay for the most part, although my neighbor's plates and utensils kept sliding to our side. The lunch menu M-F is a great option even if you do not eat too much because it is only $15.99. Plus, Gen offers a huge variety of plates (about 32). To try more meats without fear of getting full, Gen allows you to order a half portion of a dish. This was an outstanding option since my mouth was watering for every item on the menu. My favorite dish, however, was the spicy octopus. It was harder to cook due to its shape, but it turned out deliciously after being cut up. Marinated in the traditional gochujang sauce, the flavor was spicy and vibrant. Their other meats were decent, but lacked marinades or seasoning. I did not mind the subtle taste since I enjoy natural smoky flavors as well. Gen provides dipping salts and an oil/sauce at the table to accompany these meats. On a different note, the service was incredibly efficient but not friendly. A couple instances, the waitress stood across the table to hear me order but had difficulty with all the noise. We both ended up frustrated with my orders getting lost in the Kpop music and my overall hardship of pronouncing the Korean dishes. Set the service standard to just taking orders and dropping off dishes. Ultimately, the food variety and prices make another visit worth it. If I happen to be around Tempe during the weekdays, I will definitely return to Gen."}
{"text":"10/10   Best Korean BBQ I've had by far! The hostess and wait staff were so generous and kind, which is hard to find in the costumer service industry. The last two waiters before I left gave us some insight upon Korean BBQ history and that made my day!   I disliked their green tea, it was just too strong for my taste buds. Next time I'll try a different specialty drink from the franchise.  Get the red wine pork belly, it's a must!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We went there for my best friend's birthday and Terry our server was awesome! Great good! Great service! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Such a fun place to have dinner at. They have so many choices of meats to grill and appetizers. Spicy Pork Bulgogi, Spicy Pork Belly, Galbi and Gyoza are a few of my favorites. It's about $25 per person but worth it if you eat a lot or want a really fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Always good! The food always is fresh and the salad is the best thing in life. I did have to remove 1 star since they have been removing options I love such as the seaweed salad, miso soup, and the past two times they were \"out\" of jap chae. And those were big reasons to come. It's not cheap so it's annoying when you don't get to order all that you want."}
{"text":"Been here twice to eat, for the sole reason that it's close to home. Definitely not a fan because of the horrible service. Wait times are ridiculous and the staff seems to be all over the place. Nobody knows their roles or what to do in general. Food is eh.. You get what you pay for with the price. Quality is just not there for me and some of the meats have a weird, pungent smell to them -- noticeable in the porks. They also don't serve steamed egg, no big deal but what a turn off. ¯\_(?)_/¯ I rather make the 30-40 minute drive all the way to Chinatown and be satisfied with a legit KBBQ restaurant, not a wanna-be."}
{"text":"my server Julian is good. he always checks if i need any help. this is always my favorite all you can eat Korean bbq place. i normally come here once a month at least."}
{"text":"Food and service are very good! Only a few issues; the staff seems to insist on changing the grills. We we're asked maybe 11 times by several different people. It may be more efficient for them to clean, but it keeps the grill hot and the food gets a better char if it isn't changed. Wish they didn't ask us so many times, and while food is still on too!!! Another problem is that we had to wait a long time for the meat to come out. For some reason, the bulgogi on our second order didn't come with everything else and took a very long time to arrive. Overall, this place is kinda pricey, but very fun with good quality food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night with our normal dinner friends and was pleasantly surprised there wasn't a wait!  After having had Korean BBQ one other time in Vancouver, my taste buds were definitely excited. The servers were super nice and gave us a run down of the rules....so.many.rules. And one of the reasons for taking away a star. Once we got it all figured out, we started ordering away!  Definitely a great selection with 37 items to choose from...only bummer is you can only order 4 items at a time. Luckily, they were super quick when you put in additional orders so there was never really a lag. I enjoyed all of the items we tried...bulgogi, short ribs, pork belly, steak, chicken, gyoza, shrimp, noodle salad...and I have to say the rice was perfectly done!  I wish there were a little more variety in the sides and the shrimp was a little fresher but, overall, a great value and experience!"}
{"text":"I went yesterday for the first time with my cousin and her boyfriend.  We figured all you can eat for $16 was a pretty good deal.  Once we sat down, we were told prices were higher for President's Day (about $5 more), but we're already there so no big.  My cousin and her boyfriend ordered calamari and brisket and got their food pretty quick.  I ordered crispy sesame chicken, but what I wasn't told was that there would be a wait (at least 10 minutes).  I had some salad and rice to munch on, but it was annoying to have to be the one to remind our waiter about my food.  He'd come by asking if we were ok, and I'd have to tell him \"just waiting on my chicken.\"   He would tell me it's frying, but he never said why it took so long.  I worked at a restaurant where we fried food, it would never take as long as this did.    When it finally arrived, it definitely didn't look like the picture, just 5-6 pieces of shrunken fried bits.  Half of them actually had chicken in it, the other half were just pieces of fried skin.  I ordered Cajun chicken next, which came out pretty quick, though it was hard to taste the Cajun flavoring.  Then our waiter forgot my cousin's final order for more brisket.  Most of the food (minus the chicken) was actually decent once it came out and was cooked, and the presentation inside is neat, almost has a club like atmosphere, high end.  But service brought this experience down. If our waiter seemed friendlier, it might have not been as bad, but he just seemed like he was running through the motions for basic service.  Plus, for those who have never been to a restaurant like this, you cook your own food.  There's a skillet/stove top in the middle of your table and you put your raw meat on there to cook.  Yes, it's unique, but you're paying them so you can cook your own food.  Sure they're providing the meat, but it might not be worth it to you.  In addition, you cannot leave any leftover meat or else they'll charge you and you have a two hour limit.  Now this is common with other All You Can Eat places (like sushi), but if you want to eat without restrictions on how much to eat and for how long, stick to somewhere else.  I wanted to try this place, but now that I have, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Gen sets the standard for quality KBBQ in Vegas. It has the best price, one of the largest selections of meats and appetizers and punctual service. The atmosphere at Gen is ideal for situation, with it's contemporary design. The restaurant is very clean and also offers television and music entertainment, setting it apart from other restaurants as it's ambiance promotes a social experience. Also, our server Lisa was awesome. Her quality of service and care topped off this overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Service was on point,  never left wanting,  our server Lisa and Mizzo are great! Marinated steak was amazing! Portions are great so you can try everything."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and both times I had an amazing experience, from the service to the food. The all you can eat is totally worth it. Great to see a quality Korean BBQ restaurant in this part of Henderson.   Shout-out to Kailin! She's a cool server and helped my mom out with food recommendations. Now my mom loves beef short rib!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Lower food quality but cheaper prices. If you're on a budget, it's probably fine. If not, go to Mothers in Chinatown and have some real Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"This use to be the best Korean bbq, what happened?? Food is alright. Service is terrible, they changed."}
{"text":"Definitely a cholesterol booster. The food was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating. Everything on the dinner menu was marinated to perfection. The restaurant was gorgeous and a good environment to meet up with friends. I'd go back more often but my doctor probably wouldn't like it."}
{"text":"This Gen is far better than the one in Cerritos California  Our server Dakota was THE BEST!  Besides being attentive he made sure our food servings never ran out  This place is a must try and definitely ask for Dakota he will take care of you!"}
{"text":"1. I told the waitress that it was our first time there  2. she offers the lunch box or the ayce  3. we chose the ayce 4. we had a little bit of raw meat left and a little bit of fully cooked meat left 5. asked the waitress for a box, she said she'd bring one but we would have to pay $5 extra for the uncooked meat Ok fine. I understand. waitress drops off the check.  paid. never see waitress. waiting. bus boy shows up. starts clearing everything off the table. request a to-go box again. he looks dumb founded. uhhh, we don't normally do that. ... waitress said she would bring us one. dumb look. lemme go ask her... waiting. waitress comes back and talks to me like I'M retarded. EVEN ASKS oh have you never been here before? I said I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN WE FIRST WALKED IN. Anyway, 3 other people heard her say she was coming w take home box and now she says we can't take home any food. so NOT ONLY did I pay $5 for food we didn't cook or get to eat, it's all going in the trash!! SERIOUSLY. what a waste of food!! and she LIED to my face when she first came to the table. But what really pissed me off the most was SHE SHOULD HAVE WARNED US IN THE BEGINNING WHEN WE SAT DOWN ABOUT THE EXTRA CHARGE AND NO TAKE HOME! this was my first and LAST time eating here. so greatly disappointed ): two stars were for the atmosphere and food. otherwise, shitty service. 2 thumbs WAY WAY down."}
{"text":"I've had this before in Cali and had a great time and great meal. Very excited to hear they were opening one at Tempe market months ago. This place definitely met my expectations. The decor was very elegant and music choice was on point.  Our server, Sarah D, was great. She took very good care of my friends and I. Always made sure we had our orders in before we finished our meats and seafood. Made our drinks always full. All around great service! I definitely plan on coming back again with my family to give them the whole experience of kbbq houses."}
{"text":"This is our second time to eat at Gen, the first one was at Fullerton. (The food was heavenly) So when we are at LV we looked for Gen. They never failed to amaze us on how delicious and fresh their food. I highly recommend their Gen Premuim Steak, Hawaiian Pork Belly and Spicy Pork Bulgogi all of these are very tasty and tender. The mashed potato (one of my favorite) green salad, pickled raddish and kimchi are so so good. Also try their fresh seafoods like cajun calamari and garlic shrimp. About their services, they are very fast on giving what you need, they will give you 4 different item and then after that you can order again. We tried their mouthwatering macaron ice cream and it taste good."}
{"text":"Foods were good and service was prompt. We had a very attentive server, Habron. Everything went well as far as the orders and service were concerned.  However, as far as being seated and the manager's demeanor involved, it was just unacceptable. When we entered the restaurant, we were told that the wait was 10 minutes. After about eight minutes, we were told that our wait would be 30 minutes or less. There were six of us and we opted to stay. It wasn't as bad coz we were seated at about 20 minutes later. Orders were taken and beverages were served. one of the foid runners accidentally nudged the glass of water of my wife and doused her sweater and pants. The food runner was very apologetic. He even called the manager who just wiped the table and the floor but did not acknowledge that my wife got drenched with about 16 oz water.  My wife and I left the restaurant earlier than our kids coz she was getting cold coz of her drenched sweater and pants. We paid our bill and left a generous gratuity for our server. We expected more from the manager though.  We will not be back at this branch again."}
{"text":"I finally found the best AYCE KBBQ in Arizona and it is located at Tempe Marketplace. Although the wait was 3 hours long because they had to accomodate 20 people, it sure was worth it! Once we got seated we were helped by David S. and he went above and beyond, especially when we asked how many items we could order from the menu. He walked us through the menu and also told us there were unlimited sides we could order from. He came back and forth to check up on us and asked if we needed refills, the grill changed, and basically he was always there. Thank you so much for taking care and helping my family and I tonight and also celebrating 2 birthdays. Sadly they ran out of the intestines but that's okay! Still eating so I'll send pictures soon! Happy All You Can Eat KBBQ!"}
{"text":"Ugh, I'm so torn. Immediately let me preface: Gen is currently the best KBBQ in the Phoenix area from meat quality and value. But having eaten at practically every California location, I hold Gen to a higher standard and they've disappointed me in more ways than one.  First the bon chon/side dish game was pretty weak. You see a lot of staples, mostly kimchi variants, and out of nowhere you see COLE SLAW! Just thought it was funny, the classic mayo sweet salad felt out of place. Also we had daikon but NO RICE PAPER!? And instead of the purple mixed rice I loved to eat, they just offered white rice which was just okay.  We ordered a carafe of lychee soju. I'm used to it being incredible sweet and delicious, but for some reason this had an incredibly harsh alcohol forward blend and we couldn't even finish it. Maybe it's a different mixologist who isn't trained since this place is new, who knows? Also might explain why it took us 10 minutes to get a server.  In terms of meats it was still an impressive spread, albeit slightly smaller around 35. A lot of the classics were there. Some of the more exotic jowl meat and large intestine wasn't present, and instead we had multiple variants of fried chicken. Crispy Cajun Chicken had good breading but was incredibly salty - pretty sure it was just blitzed in cajun salt. And the Volcano Chicken, while no BonChon, was pretty hot and hilarious to eat.   I don't know if my main issue was with inconsistent service or the occasional whitewashing of the already contemporary and accessible Gen. While excited a location finally opened here, I'm incredibly disappointed the ASU crowd can't enjoy the same experience we have across California. While that really only takes it down from a 10/10 to maybe a 7.5, knowing just how better it could be hurts the most."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place from coworkers and friends, wanted to try it out. We came around 5pm no wait time. The staff was very friendly and helpful.The food..there was so much! all you can eat for $20.99  you sit down, and you are just surrounded with side dishes. Great menu wanted to try everything but got full. Looking forward to coming back here."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this Korean bbq and I finally gave it a shot... there is two locations one in Henderson and one on W Sahara. I was surprised as I walked in it was huge dark and clean. Before you are seated they set all your sides up. There are so many options on the menu over 36 items to chose from for just $21.99 dinner. The service is fast and the food is nothing short of amazing."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. All you can eat, for a decent price , and the food is very flavorful. I've been to other Korean bbq and there was always something wrong and super expensive. I was turned off of Korean bbq until I came here."}
{"text":"Excellent place,, food, and service.  The beef bulgogi was great and lisa made sure our experience with this restaurant will make us come back again with more friends."}
{"text":"Holy Korean bbq!!! This place is great for eats, drinks, and grilling. Different style of buffet..."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment.... I was eager to give this place a try from all the raving reviews. I drove over 20 miles just to give it a try! They told our group of 7 that they would prefer for us to split up. That it would benefit them, because they didn't have enough servers to accommodate us.  I've been to the other location in Rancho and even the menu items are different. Missing quite a few necessities like , , and . To top it all off a lot of the menu items were sold out.   However I do want to call out our server Blake, who provided us with great service. Attentive and friendly.   I guess Vegas will never have a K-BBQ joint that is comparable to LA."}
{"text":"Don't bother... what horrible customer service.  Had a party of 9 and they would not accommodate us.  Got there 2 hours before to get put on their \"List\"... and still they would not work with us.   1)  They would not sit us until every single person arrived. 2) They wanted us to sit in 2 separate booths, not even close to each other. 3) We were only allowed 2 hour limit to cook our food and enjoy our party... and 4) We were told we were going to be charged a madatory party gratuity, even though we were going to be in separate booths and we cook our own food.  ($25 + 18% per head regardless if the person eats or not, it's a charge for sitting). At that point,  the whole lot of us simply got up and walked out. We had enough of this place. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and atmosphere immensely. Was a little concerned with the plates of side dishes that had for an uncertain amount of time been out unrefrigerated. The service was excellent. Our server patiently explained the dining process and even suggested ways to make it better through out the meal. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was awful! Our server was very unfriendly and didn't explain anything about the menu to us. When we were done we had a little bit of food left over and he got mad at us. Told us that we are supposed to pay for any leftover meat we don't cook. If we would have known that from the beginning we wouldn't have ordered as much food. It took forever to cook and wasn't good."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I will definitely go back and highly recommend this to anyone. The food is fantastic and I like the fact that they bring the food to you. Other Korean BBQ places I have gone to have you go up and get the food to cook like a buffet. This place is much better. This will be my go to spot when in Vegas and wanting Korean BBQ!!!!"}
{"text":"Let it slide the last time that the service was slow and they kept forgetting to bring around our order. Granted we had a party of six people and they were busy but they did start to slow down and yet we still were receiving poor service and when we went to pay we found that there was a 20% gratuity for our table!  My friend was treating that evening and he did not want to argue about the bill so we let it slide.  This evening my husband and I went and walked in before midnight which it states is their time of closing.  They informed us that their kitchen closed at eleven!!!  I was upset and we left. They need to post that they stop seating at eleven in their website.  However as we got in our car the time on the dashboard said eleven which means we were there before eleven pm.  Then I also remember that when we were there with the party of six previously that we still ordered food after eleven pm!  This place needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Service was horrible I waited for 40 minutes after being seated for my server to to ask us what meat we wanted"}
{"text":"During our visit to Phoenix, we saw that there was an all you can eat Korean BBQ joint.  Five of us decided to give it a try after looking at the pictures on yelp...and I'm glad we did. When we arrived there it was super busy...but that's a good thing. It means that it should be good. We had a few drinks at Dave and Busters to kill the time. After getting called, we sat down and was greeted by our server Kevin....poor guy. He had five crazy guys to attend to.  He was super cool as he explained how things worked. We ordered a pile of different foods which came out super quick.  We ordered beef tongue, pork belly, the KFC chicken, and almost everything else on the menu. Needless to say, Kevin said we probably ordered the most food he's ever seen.  The service was awesome. The workers constantly keep changing our grill when it got dirty and the orders are quickly served.   If you want good Korean BBQ....you gotta go here. You'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"OMG I really enjoyed my time here!! Love the food, and our table sever Yuhao was really nice to us!! I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Checked in with hostess for a party of 8 and was told it may take up to an hour.  It was a birthday dinner with family.  We had no problem waiting for almost 1 hour 20 mins.  They take us to the tables.  Yes!! We were seated at 2 seperate tables then was told we would be charged an 18% gratuity for party of 6 or more.  We then ask for a manager and was sent an inexperienced hostess as a reprensentative for a manager.  We told her how long we waited just to be seated at 2 separate tables as a family and on top an 18% gratuity for 6 or more.  The hostess then blames us and says \"Did you tell the hostess you wanted to sit together?  If not then thats not our fault.\"  Last time I checked saying party of 8, its implied and common sense says we're here together to sit together and eat together.  I have never ever been seated at different tables  w/large parties in my life. We could have only waited10-20 mins to sit seperatly instead of almost an hour 20 mins.  Then I asked her to justify the 18% gratuity.  We were split up, we are no longer a party of 8, there is only 4 being served in our group.  We should have left then.  We ordered drinks and 2 drinks didn't come til meal was almost over after notifying them numerous times that we're still waiting for drinks.  Same with food, everytime we put an order in they forgot 1 or 2 items and after asking and being told it was on its way, it never came.  I don't know how the other half of our party faired but I doubt it went well.  They didn't look happy and left about 45mins before our group.  I've been here many times and would rate it a 3.5 but after this last experience, I doubt I'll/we'll go back or recommend it to friends/family. This is the 1st I've ever asked to speak to a manager, hopefully last."}
{"text":"The food is great! I have no complaints at all about the food.The reason for my 2 star is because of the service. I am all about customer service especially when I work in the same field. The ladies at the front was very welcoming to seat us. However our server Julian sucked. He did not look happy at all and it took him awhile to get our order. As soon as he came over, he rushed us to order our food  & seemed annoyed we were still looking st the menu. He forgot to get our drink order first before getting our food order. My boyfriend tried to talk to him but he was quick with getting our order then left. We had to keep asking other servers to get us refills on drinks or sides. He was gone for a long time and finally my boyfriend asked another server if Julian can place another order for us but he said he was on break. (That's unprofessional. a heads up would be nice)The second server I forgot her name (she's Filipino) but she was very sweet & actually made us feel welcomed. She also lost her voice  & said she was getting over being sick, but still had a smile and had great customer service. Finally when we were about to leave and we see our server again Julian and my boyfriend gives him the check, he did not say thank you or anything. As we are heading out the door, he had the nerve to ask us if we would go on yelp and write a great review for him because the person with the most reviews would get a promotion. Sorry not going to happen when you had crappy service & was not engaged at all. The second server I wish I got her name but she was awesome!"}
{"text":"My friends wanted to give this place a try because they love KBBQ, so I decided to join them. Let's just say that I was satisfied with my experience.  I have never heard of this place and so I didn't have any expectations, but they did make a good first impression. Before entering the restaurant, there's a menu for you to look at. There's was so many things I wanted to try! We haven't gotten a table yet and already I'm craving me some KBBQ.  Atmosphere: Upon entering the Gen, the first thing you see is how the interior is decorated. The design is modern. It is definitely decorated a lot better then most of the other KBBQ places I have been to in Vegas. It's a plus, but I didn't come here for the decorations, I came for the food!  Food: They have a big menu and I was really excited to try a lot of the stuff on the menu. My boyfriend and I already knew what we wanted to order. One of the cons was that some of the items that we wanted wasn't avaliable, such as the Cajun fries and the hot tea. Still, there's a lot of things for us to try, so it wasn't a big deal. The food came in small portions. It allows me to try more stuff before I can't eat anymore. Some items were better than other. I didn't expected everything to taste great, but overall most of the items were pretty good. Noteworthy items includes: Spicy Chicken, Red Wine Samgyubsal, and the Gen Pork Bulgogi  Service: The service started off really great. Our drinks came quickly and our first order of food came out really quickly as well. At one point we noticed that our food wasn't cooking because the food wasn't on, but our server, Lisa, got that fixed really quickly. As the night went on, the service fluctuated. Most of the time we would get our food quickly, but there were a few instances where we had to wait a long time for our food to come out. Sometimes, the food runner would bring over food that we never ordered or bring us food that we have already ordered.  Miscellaneous: Another thing that I want to bring up is that their venting system is AWESOME. One of the things that bothers me about KBBQ is that I always leave with that KBBQ smokey smell and it stinks up my car for a week. But not this time, I was spared the stink.  Overall: I would eat here again. I wasn't expecting the best food ever, considering it was $19.99 for AYCE, but I definitely wasn't disappointed. The food is comparable (or even a little bit better) to some of the well-known KBBQ places in Vegas. I wasn't expecting the greatest service ever, considering that they have only opened for a few days when I ate there, therefore I was very lenient with the service."}
{"text":"Great service & super friendly workers! Our servers name was OZZY and he was by far the BEST server I've had since I came here. He made the experience so awesome! He deserves an outstanding award by his managers! His hard work and dedication to this company shouldn't go unnoticed. He made sure we had everything we needed and more. Very patient, and quick! Thank you again OZZY and Gens workers! :) will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I'd go for ayce kbbq in Las Vegas. I've been to the Gen locations in Southern California and I can honestly say that this location has the BEST customer service I've experienced. The waiters/waitresses are always so attentive and they are on top of grill changes. I wish all restaurants I go to had great customer service like Gen Henderson.  The quality of the meat is always good too. The must-try item on the menu is the Red Wine Pork Belly and their Premium Steak. The appetizers I always get are the Spicy Rice Cakes and the Jap Chae--SOOOO GOOD. They have a new item on the menu, the Volcano Fried Chicken. WARNING: the Volcano Fried Chicken is spicy AF--make sure to order a small portion first to try it out because the spice WILL creep up on you. One thing I wasn't too excited about was the Spicy Baby Octopus, it just wasn't for me.   Because the place is popular, I do suggest that you call ahead of time to ask how long the wait is so you don't end up waiting for 2 hours for a table.  If it's your first time trying kbbq, you won't be disappointed trying out Gen."}
{"text":"So!  How can even begin about this mouth watering experience.   Let's start by saying this, it is an epic restaurant highly advised for 100% meat eaters and folks with huge appetite. (Your money will be totally worth it)  The variety of dishes and options are HUGE!.  Spicy, sweet, sour, blah blah, delicious!  The whole idea here is to seat on a booth or stool, have literally a small grill next to you with multiple seasoning to add flavor and cook until you get food coma (or gout), whatever comes first.  Highly advised to call before or arrive early during weekends, it gets packed.  Price is definitely worth it. Great location!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I can say and am confident bringing larger parties here at the last minute. Late dinner hours.  We were told 25 minute wait but it was about fifteen. Service was great! Gen crew came thru for our party. Our orders were served up quick and no lag in time at all.  Ignore 2nd update since there is no more fork issue. (plus I just re-read it and I sound like Cartman in that Yelp Southpark episode..yikes) Just go back read my original review for food review. Mr B said those who whine(like I did) about meats that  are bland, my guys tell me to add the seasonings that are on your table..duh.    We had no problem using the coupon from Zip code magazine. The manager who came to our table to check us out said as long as it is an original and not a printed copy we were good. They cant accept photo copied versions.   Still no dessert, manager is still working on finding local vendor.    If my guests I bring in are happy, Im a fan! Thanks Gen!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Not as good as the location in Henderson, we went around 2pm and the service was good but the food... the soup and rice was not warm but the dumplings were really good!  The meat quality was kind of bad, the spicy pork was sweet not spicy and the bulgogi was very strange."}
{"text":"My tenth time here and this place never ceases to impress.  The food is amazingly fresh and delicious and the staff is super attentive and friendly.  I've been to many Korean all-you-can-eat places and this is the best! If you're ever in Vegas and want an awesome Korean bbq experience, this place will not disappoint.  Oh, and a special shout out to our server Jaenica. She's the best!"}
{"text":"Good place to go when you're really hungry. Had it the first time today. Totally worth the drive. Great service as well, our server, Alodia, took great care of us and made our experience there a good one."}
{"text":"Ozzy is perfection. Best server ive ever had. He gave me my first macaroon bless his soul."}
{"text":"Liked the concept however didn't like the fact that you couldn't bring leftovers with you. The food was great. There was a 45 min wait. Does get a bit smoky from all the food you cook. So if you don't want your clothes or hair to smell of food when you leave, or are going somewhere else after, try another day.   If you have never been it's worth trying it out so you get an idea of what it's like. Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Great place went there yesterday.  Had unlimited food very good service."}
{"text":"So we went for dinner for the first time last night at the new location. My friend was able to get a table before we arrived so that was nice compared to the other location where they will not see you unless the entire party is there. And our server was very nice and once we ordered are Meats they came pretty quick. The only downside to our entire experience was they are always trying to take the plates and I like to keep one for the done meat so that was kind of irritating when they took the plate that I had the cooked meat for. We will definitely be going back as it is much closer than the other location!"}
{"text":"Would we want to go back..... Hmmmm NO! for sure NO! It was Tuesday at 6PM and the place was busy but not packed, there were free ready tables available, yet we had to wait - why? After waiting for few minutes we were walked to the table. Side dishes already on table - makes you wonder for how long these were there for. The side dishes selection, size and taste had a lot to desire. The place has high ceiling there's loud music and we had hard time to hear the waiter who was standing right next to us. We ordered their favorite meal #5 and #10. The waitress brought the meat to our table but started to serve it to a couple sitting next to us. The burner was not on. We called waiter to turn it on, he did. then you need to wait to have the burner plate to heat up - it never did. After about additional 5 minutes of waiting - the burner was still or again not working. We called the same waiter. He turned it on again. That was well over 15 minutes after we walked in with raw meat on the table and still cold burner. The burner was yet again not working. We called the waiter - again - he called manager. Do you know that manager has magic touch? Yeah he does and the burner was up and hot. In the meantime -since we were starving we ordered appetizers that is supposed to be ready to eat. The 1st round of the meat was already done and appetizer nowhere to seen. When we finished the #5 and #10 appetizer arrived. Taste wise - not much so far. Let's order some pork. Pork belly arrived - after we called waiter. Hey look the burner is off again. Called that guy and he turned it on. Got that pork going - at the end it was so greasy that most fat bacon has nothing on it. My wife refuse to swallow it. Then she ordered something that should fix the bad taste and improve bad experience. So how about chicken. Chicken arrived - hey look the burner is off again. OK that's it! Enough it enough. We call them to take that raw chicken away - paid the bill and left. Nobody came to talk to us to apologize or trying to remedy the bad experience. Price for the entire dinner was in upper range, taste was not much and waiters - we just could not hear what they are saying. Even if this place is just one of few in town we would not come back. Thank you but NO thank you"}
{"text":"My family loves Gen Korean BBQ in L.A. so this was their choice for lunch on our way home from Las Vegas. This location was perfectly on point. Every staff member was friendly and efficient and the food was delicious as usual. Our main server, Julian, was attentive and nice. We ended the meal with the best ice cream macarons. I would definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"1st waiting isn't usually long 10-20 minutes max, and for being next to a mall, that's pretty quick. 2nd when you get seated your side dishes are already set for you. Last night the salad and Japchae was already at the table. FOR ME THAT IS A NO, because it's not sanitary to me. I mean how long has that been sitting there? I'm fat, so I still eat the fish cake and kimchi. 3rd BATHROOM WASH TRASH! The floors were sticky and it was not properly clean. I understand they have the dinner rush, but please have someone delegated to clean the bathroom at least every hour to the hour. 4th service was great, Ozzy you were great! Always making sure we were good, and making sure we got our food right away. They even accommodated my weird request of just having a plate of lettuce no dressing .They were always asking to top off our drinks or to change our grill.  5th the real review on the food: meat was really good, I don't think you can really go wrong with the meat at Gen. If it sounds good, 8 out of 10 times it will taste good. THAT BEEF BELLY THOUGH! THAT IS A FREAKING MUST TRY!!! Chicken and cheese sauce is good as well. Red wine pork belly is so sinful. Sesame chicken my favorite. Only complaint is that they NEVER have Squid Bulgogi.    PS: Ozzy I was trying to get you and my tall man friend together.    Gen is a great place to eat, GOOOOOO!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy. Yummy. This place has great food, great selection at a great price. The service is also really good. They have it down to a science, everyone from the hostess to the servers works hard to make sure you are attended to. The only read I'm knocking them down to 4 vs. 5 stars is: 1) They hesitate to allow you to order more if you have a few items still to cook... which I understand to an extent but if we have 4 people and only 1 plate left, let me order... we are here bc we are hungry. Lol. Not a huge complaint but frustrating if you are starving. 2) I am a little disappointed that there are not more vegetables options... I love their selection of proteins and satisfied by the starch but I really enjoy veggies with dinner and with this they are lacking a bit. Otherwise, super happy and I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to several locations in Cali but this one in Henderson is a little disappointing.. Some meats are not available, even simple appetizers like endamame is out of order??? Maybe I just have higher expectations since I frequent this resto a lot..   when you're in town and looking for Korean Bbq, I would highly recommend HOBAK in spring mountain."}
{"text":"Great service. Affordable price. Nice ambience and lots of parking space. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this much anticipated Korean BBQ restaurant.  I've had the pleasure of eating at Gen in California and their new location in Arizona did not disappoint. All you can eat dinner for $25 and the food selection is great, as well as side dishes and sauces.   The best part about our experience was the service. We were told that our wait was an hour and a half, and in exactly 90 minutes we were notified via text that our table was ready. The hostess, waitress, manager and other staff members were all friendly and very attentive. They had a number of staff members patrolling the tables  to take away empty plates, replace the grill, refill drinks and our waitress cake by at appropriate times to check on us. With it being only their 3rd day of being open, and being very busy, they were staffed and organized and was able to provide amazing customer service. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't come here with groups larger than six. We had 15 in our party and waited an hour and thirty minutes to be seated. They need to work on there seating process as some 30 other groups ranging from 2 to 6 sat before us. I hope their food is better than their seating process. Not impressed thus far will update if anything changes.. Update: had a blast! Great food and service! I still stand by my original comment for seating of parties over 6 people.  Update- since this first visit I've returned a handful of times with my family. Food is excellent and quicker seating with my family of four."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've went out of my comfort zone to try a new AYCE Korean BBQ place. But tonight I finally went to Gen, and was more than pleased! The food was amazing! Better than I expected. And for once, it wasn't just another overhyped restaurant. Jan, who helped us, was great and made the experience even better by her great service and charismatic personality. Already excited to bring my friends and family here in the future!"}
{"text":"All around amazing. We had the all you can eat lunch for $20 because it was Sunday. Food started coming to our table before we even finished our order. Alodia, our server, was friendly and fabulous. All the food we had was delicious. Apps: Popcorn shrimp, calamari legs, and sesame chicken. For the grill: spicy pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, premium steak, cajun calamari, beef tongue, and more that I don't remember (we ordered a lot xD). Can't wait to bring more people back to this place!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Gen.  It was funny because i thought i was in a dance club when i first stepped inside.  The decor is modern and hip while the embiance is relaxing a comfortable. Its a great spot for a date! There's a huge TV screen that i hear plays music videos however, when I went there they were playing infomercials!?  I couldn't quite wrap my head around that.  Anyhow, i got the all you can eat menu!  Me and my brother ordered meat after meat!  My favorites for sure would be the beef cal bee and spicy pork!  Both were full of flavor.  I also tried the deep fried shrip, and octopus which were great as well.  The agedashi tofu was also delish.  I liked how they fried the tofu and served it separate from the sauce.  Get a side order of veggies as well to compliment your meat and your all good!  The highlight of my meal was the desert! They have ice cream macaroons here!  I've never had one before but i loved the strawberry one i got!  I'd go back here again just for the macaroons!"}
{"text":"So good! Am not used to eating Korean food so when my boyfriend took me here I wasn't too sure about this place, but omg so delicious!"}
{"text":"Second time at Gen's and it felt just like the first time we came here. We were welcomed by Laurie who remembered us when I said: \" Girl, we back!\"  Then we were swiftly taken care of by Ozzie who was very kind and welcoming. He even remembered me when we first came here. He said: \"I remember you guys. You were sitting on B-13 & I remember the birthday!\" Ofcourse this made me happy! We were so comfortable that when he said he had to leave his shift we were bummed out, only to feel happy again when his shift was taken over by Shea! She was the lady who took care of us during our first visit! The food was amazing, quality at it's best and the service was good. There was a period where we had to wait for longer than normal for some of the items that we asked for but that's just a little mishap in the grand scheme of things.  I encourage everyone, locals and visitors alike to visit Gen's as it will not disappoint. Great food, great ambience, great music, & great service."}
{"text":"This place used to be a lot better. The last time we came in the staff was not very attentive and it took forever for them to bring out the plates. Customer service was very lacking and it wasn't even that busy. May give this another try maybe it was a bad nite? We'll see"}
{"text":"After finding out GEN was being brought to Arizona, I could not contain my excitement! Whenever I was in California, this was my go to spot for KBBQ. Since they've opened I've gone at least 100 times (not exaggerating). My friends and I love coming here so much! My favorite servers that I've had are definitely by far, Sharon and Leyna! They are always attentive and make sure your visit is perfect. I give them 4 stars because sometimes servers are a hit and miss. As well as the quality of the food are a hit and miss. I like to go during off-peak hours so that I can get the best quality and the best service!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the restaurant's service and food. The bulgogi was especially flavorful, and the kimchi was also good. The steak could have been more tender though. Delicious glass noodles come with the dinner. Great lunch price value!!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Gen and I really enjoyed myself, our server Jaenica was really helpful and friendly. I wasn't familiar with the menu but she recommended some popular and personal favorites. I was definitely satisfied and will be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Gen is absolutely my favorite KBBQ spot in Las Vegas! I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the superb service I always experience. My waiter, Ozzy, gave wonderful meat suggestions and was always attentive to our needs. Sometimes there's a wait to get a table but I think it's definitely well worth the price. This place is definitely worth a try if you're considering KBBQ!"}
{"text":"Finally we have a Korean bbq in the east side and don't have to drive all the way to China Town. Great place and atmosphere. Pricing is not bad either and includes appetizers. Quality of meat is great. Mizzo the waiter was helpful.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ozzy was flat out amazing!!! The service was fantastic and today was his birthday too! He worked and provided some AMAZING service!"}
{"text":"How nice a Korean BBQ in Henderson.   No need to go all the way to Chinatown.  The Baby Octopus is a must.  Same with the Squid Legs.  Marinated Steak also yummy.  Reasonable prices, only negatives, no dessert with AYCE, and only one Korean beer available.  Our new go to Korean place now."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Korean BBQ in Henderson. It has become a regular spot my friends and I. I find the prices to be reasonable and, the food is just amazing. The staff is just outstanding as well. If you're lucky, you'll get a waiter named Ozzy. Super friendly, very helpful, and just makes the visit feel a little more special. Another plus about this place is that you aren't left thirsty or hungry as they tend to you in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"This place iz tha baaaaaasssss! The secret saaaaaauze! Kevin are Christa had great service"}
{"text":"nice place, nice staff, nice food. The meat are so fresh and I loved shrimp and octopus . They were so delicious . I will come back"}
{"text":"One of the only KBBQ places in Henderson so this place is always super busy and the lines are really long so get here early. I usually come for dinner.   The staff isn't the friendliest, probably because it is busy and they are rushed. Sat down and the menu is pretty comprehensive. Tried to order some beers for the table but the waiter was too young and had to get someone else to order. Got our food and about halfway done, no one came to check on us and we still couldn't place our beer order. Only when we were almost done did someone show up to let us order beer.   Food is alright, but can't expect much for an all you can eat place. Prices are kinda pricey as well but that's to be expected in a mall and in Henderson. I prefer eating KBBQ at some of the places on Spring Mountain as they are better quality and better service."}
{"text":"Gen has never failed me on service and quality of food. Been too about 4 different locations in Cali.   I was worried about it here since we are in AZ and in CA was predominately Korean severs so they new how Korean BBQ worked and had that background. But this place was just as good or even better in some aspects in all around service.   I could not believe how tentative they were when we didn't even ask. It's like I turned around and they were their again asking if we needed anything. I was worried since they didn't have the service button at the tables like in Cali but we never even needed it even if we had it.   Grilled was changed on the spot with no wait and hassle. I think they took so long to open to really train everyone very well, like too well.   Our server **AMBER**, so you can see her name lol. Was awesome. Never misses a beat got our orders right, everything was refilled, it's like her life depended on it haha.   Basically what I am saying is this service today even on the grand opening weekend so more than superb and I will definitely come back.   The only bad hung is the dang wait but I assumed it on a Friday night. But they do an awesome text message so you can walk around TMP and kill time which we did at DNB so the hour and half was like nothing. We basically ran back when we got the text.   Now to the meat quality, it was on point just like any other GEN which I knew was not going to be an issue. They have a huge selection of stuff, dinner was like 38 items all included for 25 bucks.   Just go and you won't be disappointed, just assume a long wait so you don't get all bummed haha."}
{"text":"The price is something to Bali attached initially, but it's a hell of an experience. Go with friends or family. It's very hip, and a trendy looking spot. Food is great, but not a solo dining experience."}
{"text":"It is a good place to enjoy the BBQ. They offer a good environment,high quality meats,and different flavor Korean sneaks for guests. They have the best Soju, it is very tasty. All the sever are kindly, especially, sever Yuhao and Jiahao who was offer the highest level service quality to our group. I'm really enjoy the restaurant."}
{"text":"Considering this place is slightly more Americanized the service was stupid bad! Our server had a section of nine and as much as I wanted to feel sorry for her, all she does is use the iPad and get drinks... so why was she so busy to take MY order?   The place is fully staffed?!   My favorite was when we tried to order seconds and our grill burned for a good 10 minutes, drinks were empty, before she comes over and asks if we're done...?? Not to mention she lets us know after my other half complains that they are out of some of the meats we ordered.  After the next set of food arrives, everything shows up in 2s.... So, I ordered a good 6 dishes and she comes out with 12? I'm sorry but I never said 2 of everything and I certainly cannot eat all of that. Don't understand where her brain was.  Super frustrating to be excited about KBBQ next to my house to only stick to Chinatown with my angry waitresses with broken english who always let me leave with smiles."}
{"text":"20 minutes drive from the strip but it's worth it, they're super friendly here and the meat options are extensive... Most reasonable AYCE in Vegas. $15 for lunch and $20 for dinner... Not bad.  I especially like the spicy octopus n the galbi steak which was tender n had a good marinade. The squid was just salt n peppered. Utilize the scissors, ain't no table side service here. The only time they do anything at your table is when they change the grill. Fast process btw, they got it down to max efficiency.  We came in a little late at 10:30pm n their last call for meat orders is @11pm so we ordered a table full and spent the last hour just cooking n eating. Had a really good time. Our waiter isn't the most skilled at waiting but he certainly tries hard and is super nice.  Ambience is modern, music n blacklight... Nothing distracting though, pretty comforting not having to see other peeps too clearly.  Wish they've more assortment of banchon. Nothing seemed made in house. Still, unlimited so keep 'em coming!  They're located at Sunset Galleria (right across the casino) on second level next to Larson's. Outdoor entrance."}
{"text":"This place has to be the best ayce Korean BBQ in Vegas. So much selection, and the service was excellent. Our server Terry was very attentive and brought us everything we needed. For a Friday night, we only waited about 25 minutes. Definitely coming back (:"}
{"text":"I went there the other night with my husband on a date and let me tell you that Hawaiian steak and bulgogi was absolutely mouth watering. Not just that, but our service was outstanding. The girl who checked up on us and prebussed our table was so kind! She even asked us if we were ready for desert, may I say she was sweet as desert! The music was a perfect fit for the youth and a great place for those you like to watch the game and cook meat! The bathroom had good sanitation and clean toilets. Will definitely return and expect the same service I was given."}
{"text":"Love this place! A bit pricey but well worth it. Came on a special occasion and everyone enjoyed."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with anything.The brisket was gristle and chewy. The kimchee was over spicy as the same for all the sides used same spice. The service was unimpressive as the hostess and server was very uninformed with menu and beer selection, when asked about beers which found out there were only two on draft told we have bud and Widmer whatever that is, which I said it's a wheat beer!?not even told there was a Korean beer.Better off going to Chinatown which has better Koreanbbq,better beer Hite and O.B. and much better brisket."}
{"text":"I walk in, and the place is PACKED. I'm like daaamn business is booming lol the wait was about 10 mins. The lady was about to seat us totally totally in the corner next to a seat two other people were next to and I felt it'd be awkward since the whole row was literally empty and sitting next to these people in the corner would be a really awkward dinner hearing both groups conversations so I asked the lady to be seated somewhere on the empty row and she seats us on the other end next to where they put all the dirty grills since supposedly a 6 person party was supposed to sit next to us (but they never even showed up until closing!) anyways. Our server was Eugene and he had probably the best customer service than anywhere I've ever been! He constantly made sure we had napkins, sesame oil, orders in, grills changed, and etc. basically his customer service totally made up for the host trying to put us in the horrible corner. Now The food, the meat all tastes like way better quality than honey pig, or even some of the korean BBQ on the southwest side of Vegas. I didn't get really bad indigestion from eating here versus any other korean restaurant. The only thing that's possibly different is their sesame oil, it doesn't taste that great with my pork belly versus other places, and their spicy tofu soup lacks a bit of authenticity but other than that; they also have Cajun shrimps you can grill and a huge variety of meat selections I mean so it makes up for it. I'd give this place a solid 4 stars but our server Eugene was so awesome I have to give 5 stars. I'd def recommend or probably bring all my friends here if we have time to drive across town"}
{"text":"One of those best Korean bbq restaurants I've ever visited. I had bulgogi. The sauce was exquisite. The guy who waited our table, Yuhao was sweet. I had a great time and will definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came on opening night around 9pm.  There was a pretty good amount of people but we were seated in about 5 mins. It's located in Galleria Mall so we were quite excited that it was somewhat close to us considering we live in the Henderson area. I should have noted that before we stepped inside this establishment. Most of the menu was catered towards the dominant American population's taste.  I don't know what they consider \"premium\" but the meat was definitely not authentic. The pork belly was not black pork belly usually used at other kbbq restaurants. The chadol aka thinly sliced beef brisket was two or three times thicker than it should have been making it less savory, more dry and lean. Note that the bulgogi used the same thickness of meat.   They had no boricha (korean tea),  gochujjang (red pepper paste), steamed egg, and soybean soup. Knowing  we paid $20 a person for three people and that some of the essentials in a kbbq dinner were unavailable made our dining experience very very unsatisfying. We could have paid less at another place at ala carte price and still have left completely satisfied.   It was nice to note that the bar actually has grills installed in it. The grill itself throughout the place seemed to burn too quickly however.  Although it was slow sometimes (getting an extra place setting, water and drinks, rice, and paying out), the service was very good. I know that they are just starting out right now but I know for sure we won't be back.. at least anytime soon.."}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars for the Miso broth(yes broth as there is no tofu or anything else) because that is great tasting. Gyoza get the other star.  Its new so service was terrible...  We were not told how to cook anything or what sauces were to be used.  Yes, I know we should \"know how\" to cook at Korean restaurants as its very simple ... Buy would have been nice to have waiter to explain how everything worked.  The service of the busboys is awesome. Music is that of a day club...Except day clubs don't play it as loud.  I would pass on this place if you have read this far."}
{"text":"First of all it was my first time to go to this restaurant. We had to wait to be sitted. The food taste good. I would recommend to my friends to visit this place and also share your experience."}
{"text":"Definitely an amazing Korean BBQ experience and really delicious high quality meat. We got there around 5:30 on a Friday night and had to wait 20 minutes. They took us to our table and we were amazed at the all you can eat (24.99 for dinner). Unfortunately they weren't serving any alcohol when we came. The ambience and scene were definitely more modern and the lights gave it a club like feeling. We tried the chadol and the cuts were prime and tasty. The high variety of preparations of pork belly (premium, red wine and smoked garlic) were definitely highlights. The bulgogi was sweetly marinated. All this meat was served with salad and traditional sides. In terms of service, they were attentive to our needs but it was slightly inconsistent in terms of timing of food coming out and ordering (i.e. We would order food and be asked if we want to order meat before our previous order comes out). Grill changers were frequent but inconsistent (one person put the oil in the center of the grill pan while another sprayed oil throughout) We also purchased macarons (which do not come with the all you can eat) and the flavor was good but a bit hard to eat (very solidified). Overall a great experience and I'm already making plans on returning and spreading the word :)"}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate an early birthday here.  Their doors opened 5 minutes before 11:00 AM (official opening hour is 11:00 AM) ^_^  We were greeted and seated promptly. ^_^  Interestingly enough, the price we were quoted in an email from GEN KBBQ was 16.99 Lunch on a Sunday. We were charged 24.99 (Say whaaaa???) We were not very happy bout that. : !  Service was adequate. ^_^  Not enough room on the table for food for 6 diners or elbow room. : !  Just a quick walk from car park to the restaurant. ^_^  We came out not smelling like what we cooked! ^_^"}
{"text":"A very unique and fun filled dining experience! Staff did a great job of explaining the whole routine and we're very attentive throughout our meal. LOVED the Korean Fried Chicken. Also enjoyed the garlic calamari. The ginger dressing on the salad had a great pop of flavor. The two hours passed quickly as we had a lot of things to talk about as we explored the menu. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Gen is delicious but is definitely not your authentic Korean BBQ. It more main stream but is still delicious. My family comes here when we bring my mother and the babies because It is very open and very well ventilated. My mom hates going to the small \"smelly\" Korean bbq places. The perfect time to go with out any wait is around 3:30/4. Any time before or after expect to be waiting. The staff is always great and very attentive to our table and they bring they meats out so fast. They have your normal sides but don't have the egg soufflé and their tofu soup is literally just tofu in spicy broth. Their meat servings are small so if you want to fill your grill up three servings will fit."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and I'm being nice, there was a booth set up sitting there for a good 15 minutes for our party of 4, yet a party of 3 that came in 10 minutes after us got sat first! Then we waited another 15 minutes and our food actually started coming before our water, when a waitress walked up to refill our nonexistent cups she got on it which was nice considering she wasn't even our server (Jaenica was the ONLY reason our meal was enjoyable).   We asked for forks from 4 different people, when Jaenica again was the ONLY person that informed us that they were out of forks, and took it upon herself to even clean some for us, thank you!  We even asked for refills on water 3 times and they got refilled once!   For being open 3 weeks, you guys need to up your service and attention to detail standards or you'll be going out of business soon, I'd rather go back to tofu hut or sura bbq anyday and their a good 30 min from my home!"}
{"text":"Came here right after they opened and I enjoyed it.  There are more meat options than other bbq places, although at times simplicity is always better. This place is very LA, a little too much to be in a town like Henderson. Service was adequate, unlike most Korean places where there are rarely table touches and refills. That's a plus!   Now on to second, third and fourth visits; I feel service (food wise) has gone a little down hill, I've noticed now that this place is poppin, their meat portions they bring out are smaller. With it being busier, our parties are going through the smaller portions faster than they could replenish.  The sides are also smaller, oh on top of that, I'm really sick of them constantly being out of certain items. Some of these items are not seasonal.  When has there ever been a shortage of potatoes? I also remember the fried squid coming out with this awesome crack sauce, that no longer happens now.   The staff are genuinely nice and are always accommodating. I won't take from that."}
{"text":"We came here for all you can eat and I was surprised on how delicious everything was. Great food and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant, nice staff awesome atmosphere. Austin is an awesome server. Me and my boyfriend come here often and he always served us up and has a great attitude and great personality"}
{"text":"I like gen because good services.I came here on mother day and gen services say me as mama.Plssss come to gen yo have good steaks"}
{"text":"So this was the first K-BBQ place that my Mother-in-law has ever tried and it did not disappoint. We were out on a Mother and son outting and came here for lunch, since it was her first time I played it safe and pretty much ordered the stuff every body likes i.e. bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, gyoza, some sort of marinated chicken with cheese, KFC(I got 5 orders of this) along with the salad and ban chan. She was very impressed on how everything tasted. The ban chan could have been more of a variety but I can't wait to come back. Great service and Atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family and I came in to eat for the first time and the food was great. However, the food servers were a little snobby. They had this demeanor as if they were better than everyone. The only one that was kind and pleasant was the lady who took my credit card payment; she even smiled at us and thanked us for dining at Gen. We stayed to eat our desserts and this idiot server asked us to pay up and I told him we did and he had an attitude. We ate there Saturday,130pm, 11/19/2016."}
{"text":"We came with a big group (14) and were attended quickly and with so much kindness. The food was fast, delicious, and made for one of the best Korean BBQ experiences we have ever had.   Our waitress Alodia was amazing, making sure we were taken care of at all times. Definitely recommend this place, esp if you're looking for  DEALZ"}
{"text":"Sure it's all you can eat, but you have a 2 hour time limit and you spend most of that time cooking the food yourself so I didn't feel I got close to my money's worth. The spent a lot of time going over all if their 'rules', but never bothered to explain what the different dipping sauces and garnishes were, I still don't know what they were. To top it off we we're a larger party and had a mandatory gratuity added to our table, so our waitress pretty much ignored us. I would only recommend this place to someone wanting to try something novel and different. Otherwise, go to any other Korean BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Big kbbq fan, and when I saw that there was one by my house finally I had to go. We had a party of 12 and our server Lisa was great! Quick and good service. Would come back here next time."}
{"text":"We had prepped our body to consume the all you can eat Korean bbq by coming hungry and with a strong mind. We put our name in for a table of 5+ on a Sunday at 1pm. Their texting system allows you to walk around Tempe Marketplace while you wait for your table. After letting the hostess know that our stomach was literally eating ourselves, some of us were starting to get hangry and ready to bail. We even contemplated sending our doctor friend to tell the staff that one of us has hypoglycemia and needed to eat STAT. We were finally seated at 3pm, a two hour wait.  The vibe was confusingly awesome. With the movie Hook playing on their big screen, clerbbb music jamming loudly, and a classy ambiance, I didn't know where to put my attention... Until our food came.   If you haven't been to an all you can eat kbbq before, you're in for a treat. It's mainly meat but they have a few other selections like Japchae (rice noodles) and dumplings you can order. They will bring raw meat to the table and you cook it on a hot plate. Using scissors, you cut up the meat to bite size and serve yourselves.   They have \"four orders at a time\" rule, so we immediately asked for our four orders right when we sat down. When the food came, our instant regret was not turning on the hot plate ahead of time so we can eat sooner. We nommed on the kimchi, sweet mashed potatoes, and other Korean complimentary side dishes while the meat was cooking. We got the routine down that whenever the new item arrives, we order our next four because we knew that the 2hour limit was going to be more of a sprinting marathon. They were well staffed and changed our hot plates at least 5 times. Some of our faves were the garlic pork belly, cow tongue, and galbi. Their meat was good quality and well marinated - no other place like this in the valley.   We ended up ordering 34 orders between the 6 of us, so we challenge you to eat more than us! Overall, I won't fault them for being popular and the experience was super worth it for their dinner price ($25).  Protip: Show up before 11am to limit wait time. They don't take reservations."}
{"text":"We showed up around 6:00 p.m. and had about a 20 minute wait. They took my phone number and when I got the alert that our table was ready, it was another 10 minutes before they actually sat us. I was a little annoyed about it because I can understand a few minutes but why alert me when my table won't be ready for 10 minutes?  Anyway, we sat and the table was prepared with the Korean side dishes. The hostess asked us if it was our first time there and we said yes. She told us we had a 2-hour limit and the 2 of us could have 4 plates at all times and that any uneaten raw food would include a $5 fee. When our server showed up, he just assumed we knew what we were doing - we didn't. I was hoping for some guidance.  So when our meats arrived, we just threw it on the grill. We kinda wish we knew the grill was not non-stick because everything stuck. We eventually had to get a new grill because our first one was burnt. Like I said, we didn't know what we were doing.   We liked the variety of meats and dishes you could choose from. I think the only dish we had that I would not get again would be the short ribs - way to chewy (and I tried to not overcook it because I knew it could cause chewyness).   $24.95 per person for 2 hours. While it was a nice meal, I felt like I was so worried about my food cooking that I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Then we decided to turn the temperature of our grill down so that the thin slices of meat wouldn't stick to the grill and then tear apart as we try to peel it off the metal.   Will we be back? Probably. My sweet tooth was sad they didn't have more of a dessert selection. You can purchase macaron ice cream sandwiches at the front desk but it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a must do. For an all you can eat, the variety  and quality of the food is awesome. But the service... OMGosh they are so attentive and cater to your every need. Hats off to the many servers who made this meal extra special."}
{"text":"Our 3rd time here, literally 3rd time is a dime, we we not rushing to cook our food like in the past and our host/server Dennis was very polite and great. we took our time and actually enjoyed a goods worth of dinner. Price is just right and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really liked the concept here. You pay 24.99 and can eat unlimited meat for 2 hours and your food comes with a salad (so good) and white rice and some stuff to mix your meats with. You get 4 options at a time. I enjoyed some more than others but I liked the place it was good."}
{"text":"Place has a great mosphere. Always busy which means it must be worth the visit. Cucumber sake is nice as well as the pork porgogi...a reservation is a good idea.  Really big screen tv."}
{"text":"I feel like the quality here doesn't even compare to what you'll find in Chinatown. Service is OK, I wish there was a little more privacy as we got seated at those long tables where there's nothing blocking you and the next party."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ place I've been to in Las Vegas. The service at this store was incredible. The meat was out within a couple minutes, waters were constantly filled, and our waiter Austin was extremely friendly. We will definitely come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Make sure you eat everything ! Their seating is kind of funky.. especially when you end up sitting next to another party. But thankfully we have always sat in a booth"}
{"text":"If you're a first timer, make sure you try a little at a time so you know what you like and don't like. Remember that you're cooking your own food so cutting it up will help it cook faster. I would highly not recommend going there when you're starving cause you'll be waiting on your food.   Great flavors & love the price"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I understand they have only been open 4 days and are going to have some hiccups. That being said, I am also going to be very honest, as always, in my review.   We arrived a little after 8PM and checked in to wait for a seat. We were told 20 - 30 minute wait and they took my number to text me once our table was near ready. We were called to our table and all seemed to be going smoothly.   We were seated, ordered water and a sprite. We were given info about how the restaurant works and whatnot. Our server brought our drinks, followed moments later by someone else bringing another Sprite - lack of communication, not a big deal. I'd rather have 2 than none. They start you out with banchan waiting at the table. The Oi (cucumber) kim chee was good, I don't really care for the other sides, which seems a waste to start them at the table instead of letting people order them.   We ordered 4 meats. Spicy pork (one of my favorites), chicken, beef bulgogi, and the closest thing they had to kalbi. The meats were brought out - they put the beef bulgogi down and told me it was spicy pork (BIG difference both in taste and looks) - the beef bulgogi was actually non-spicy pork, the chicken was garlic chicken, and the other beef order was possibly correct. When I asked about the spicy pork, the server didn't really seem to know what I was talking about. He went and checked with the kitchen and then returned to get the correct meat out. We then later discovered that the beef bulgogi for my husband was the pork (which he doesn't eat). It took forever to have someone check on us so we could ask about the mix up. It was replaced fairly quickly, but the rice had already gotten cold waiting for the meats. I also ordered edemame, which never arrived.   We ate the food, which was rather bland. The spicy pork had some flavor due to the spicy, but the rest of the meats did not have the traditional korean flavors. The best tasting part of the meal was actually the Oi. Our server checked on us a total of one time, about 5 minutes after the food came out, to see if we wanted more food. They charge if you have leftovers on the plates, so we wanted to wait until we had actually had some food to eat. Good thing I don't eat that much anymore, because he NEVER came back! We ran out of meats, I never got the edemame (though we did randomly get a salad we didn't order?) and we ran out of drinks. After waiting for a LONG time, we realized we had been there nearly an hour and had been served ONE serving... seriously? We waited for the check. And waited. And waited.   I heard the table next to us call someone aside \"hey bro, who's our server, we'd like to order\". So, it wasn't just us being neglected. We waited a couple more minutes for the check, which never arrived. I got up and the husband followed. We walked toward the doors and were wished a good evening. Honestly, I was tempted to just leave, but I'm not that kind of person. We could have walked out without paying and no one would have known. Not a great business model.  We asked if we could pay, and the girls up front looked confused. I explained the situation and the manager was called over to speak with us. We explained it again, spoke with the manager for a few moments, paid our bill and left.   For nearly $50, I would rather go down to SURA for more flavor, better service (serve yourself from the food bar) and only a few dollars more per person. Honestly, I doubt we'll be back. I know the husband is not willing to go back at all. Hopefully they can use this as a training experience, but that still wont fix the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"I am genuinely happy that Gen opened up in Henderson at the Galleria mall. For the last year (and for the next 6 months only! I'm counting down the days!) I've been living and going to school in this area. All the Vegas Korean BBQ places are clear on the other side of town and I'm never usually in that area. Pretty much the only time I ate kbbq was when I went home to LA. So I'm really glad that one opened up here because it is going to be my default kbbq spot simply because of the proximity.  That being said, I am extremely familiar with Gen and have dined at multiple locations. It is honestly my default kbbq spot back home too since they have one in Torrance, CA and I don't have to drive all the way to Koreatown. Compared to the California locations I've tried, this place really isn't that great. It's okay for what it is, but it could be better.  One thing to keep in mind is that Gen is not your traditional kbbq restaurant. It is more Americanized/modernized. This is reflected in the decor, which is very \"nightclub\"-y. There are also no hood vents, as the ventilation system is under the table/surrounding the grill. There are also no traditional staples of kbbq such as steamed egg and Korean pancake (which I love and wish Gen would offer). There are Americanized appetizers such as cajun fries. Actually, the appetizer thing is new to this location if I remember correctly. They do not offer rice paper at this location, and you can only order 4 meats/apps at a time.  The service is pretty bad. I have been here 3 times so far and I've had to search for our waiter every time. It's too bad I don't remember the names of the waiters. The first one was the only slightly decent experience as he was on point with service up until the end, when it was time for us to get our bill and there was no one around for like 20 minutes. It really sucks to have finished all the meat you cooked, without being checked on by anyone, and wait for 10-15 minutes before someone finally shows up and asks if you want to order more meat. Bad service isn't really localized to the Henderson location though, it is a complaint I can make of most Gen locations in California. They really needs to implement the button system that traditional kbbq restaurants have.  The table ventilation system can be a big issue. I haven't had too many problems at this location with it, but the flame in the grill can and will go out, causing you to have to find someone to light it again. One time we went, the couple next to us had to have theirs relit 3 times within what was probably a 10 minute period. If that happened to me, I would be really annoyed.  The Gens in CA offer macaron ice cream sandwiches as a dessert (not as part of the menu, you go up to the little freezer by the host stand and pay for one there), but this one does not have that, which is really disappointing.  As for whether or not it's the best kbbq in Vegas, I can't really say. I do genuinely enjoy the meat and the marinade flavor. The spicy pork bulgogi is one of my favorite things of all time. However, this location serves much smaller portions than the California locations do, and I don't know why. It's not that big of a deal for me as I usually go to eat here with my boyfriend only, but considering the 4-at-a-time rule, if you're trying to eat here in a large group some of you won't get to eat. Or you'll all eat really teeny tiny portions, like one slice of brisket per person.  A final note to my unnecessarily long review, because this really rubbed me the wrong way... The first two times I dined here, the waiter informed us of a promotion they were having for their grand opening. If you wrote a Yelp review on your phone before getting your bill and named your server, you would get your drinks on the house. I feel like this is SUPER SHADY. First off, I write too much (as evidenced by this very review) and I would feel way too pressured to do it while sitting at the table. I mean, do I just sit in the table occupying it after I'm done eating and write my review for 20 minutes? Or am I supposed to do it a quick one-sentence, five-star review like Gervin D.? Secondly, I wasn't told to put 5 stars, but if he was told to by his server, that's super uncool and shady. That actually makes me want to drop my review to 1 star. I'll think about it."}
{"text":"If you are what you eat, I'm pretty sure I would be Korean BBQ.  I'm glad Arizona now has an AYCE Korean BBQ place. It's more beneficial to eat with a group of four since you can try a little bit of everything. You order four dishes at a time with a two hour limit. Anything you don't finish, you will be charged per plate. I suggest getting the yogurt soda to wash down your food. Also, don't forget to ask for rice paper to eat your meats with. Gen Korea BBQ House is legit. I rather come here for dinner than lunch since they have better entrees.  The restaurant is clean, the staff is prompt  and knowledgable, and I can see why they have become so popular. They run like a well oiled machine. Gen comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was good. Only thing Our party didn't like was that our water wasn't being filled, our waiter didn't seem like that our party kept ordering. They told us that they ran out of rice  you have an \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" business, how do you run out of rice? Spilled water on me too. When we were checking out the cashier had the nerve to ask for more tip, like WTF"}
{"text":"KBBQ is not one of the foods I crave. However, I have tons of friends who do, so eventually I get dragged out to most of the major places in town. Gen's new west side location finally warranted a visit, as the new location eliminates the hassle of hiking out to Henderson.  I love this building and have watched it go through three other restaurants over the past few years. Gen feels like the best fit so far, and the clubby lighting isn't as off putting as I normally find it. Space is large, several seating options, plenty of larger tables for groups, $22/pp is more than reasonable for what you'll get here.  The menu is pretty huge, as are the portions. Come with a group or after a day of fasting for the biggest bang for your buck. The banchan were plentiful not quite as great as my favorite spot, but the meat is definitely swoon-worthy: platters of pork belly in several different styles (red-wine marinated being my fave), beautiful towers of rolled brisket, and my personal favorite, the garlic calamari. I haven't even had all they offer across a couple of visits, there are so many choices. Save room for macaron ice cream sandwiches for dessert. I'd rather allocate space for that than drinking, but they have a huge bar menu too if you're into that sort of thing.  Shout to the super attentive staff who are on top of drink refills, always asking what they can bring you next, change out the grill before I even think it's needed, and just generally have a good attitude, no matter who I've had so far."}
{"text":"Was shopping at the Galleria snd decided to stop by because a few friends said they liked this place and for the cheap price. The restaurant is very big, modernly decorated, has bar area and lots of tables.   We came in around 3 pm, they only had a few tables but we were asked to wait for a table, not a big deal, just a little curious since they had lots of tables open and enough staff walking around. We were greeted by our server immediately and drinks were brought out quickly.   Typical of other AYCE places there are lunch price ($16) and dinner ($22) I think. Dinner you get tongue and two other types of meats.   Only 3 stars compared to other AYCE places because: -No soup and no steamed egg on the menu -No tongue on the lunch menu ( in my opinion tongue is very basic for Korean BBQ, they should include tongue in the lunch price) -They give very small amount of the sides...when I say small I meant teeny tiny...like they are serving barbie sized food - it was annoying having to constantly ask for more sides and waiting quite a long while for re-fills  -They do not offer to change the grill until you ask them to -Meat was ok nothing impressive, even the marinated ones were decent, nothing stood out  A few pros are that: -Server was very nice and friendly -They offer more variety of seafood than other places -The vent sucks the smoke down to the bottom instead of sucking the smoke upward like other places so we did not smell like a BBQ pit leaving the place - this is a great pro if you plan on going somewhere after the meal so you don't have to smell like meats   If you are in the area or watching the wallet this is a pretty good place for Korean BBQ. I personally would rather pay a few more bucks to get tongue, steamed egg and soup!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend came here booked our table but we missed the first time call in. It was our fault. But we came in and put down our name again and told they would text us when table ready in around 30 minutes. Been waiting since 6:00pm until 7pm and still didn't see any text message. Came back in and checked if table was ready and they said our name had been REMOVED since they didn't see us waiting inside???? WTH?? Then why you said you would text us?? since the receptionist said they would text us so we went outside and waited. F*** this place. Wasting my time"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Gen. On one hand, the food was delicious and the menu was pretty big, and the aesthetic of the place was trendy and fun. On the other, the service was quite rude, and I still don't understand why. My friend and I were dressed appropriately, and we were super nice to everyone who was serving the table. The servers pretty much ignored us, though, and when our waiter deigned to make eye contact with us on his way around the restaurant, he always seemed to be annoyed that we were bothering him asking for a refill and was bristling with impatience when we asked for more meat. He was overly polite to the couple next to us, though, even though they were quite demanding; maybe it was because we were an ethnic minority that night?   Food and drinks took forever to get to us, and the portion sizes weren't consistent. We got a tiny little portion of beef bulgogi, so we asked for more, and the next time the portion was 3 times the size. It made it hard for us to judge how much to order, especially when you're charged extra for leftovers. The food tasted good, but I don't know if it's worth it when there are other Korean BBQ restaurants in the city with staff that don't make you feel like a leper."}
{"text":"First time Korean bbq and I came to Gen because I got plenty of suggestions from friends and family. I was quite impressed, very cozy environment. The booths provide privacy since I took my girlfriend her as an anniversary dinner. She absolutely loved it. Also, Luis the food runner provided extraordinary service, friendly and constantly checked up on us making sure our drinks were filled, orders were made, and cleaning up the table. Highly recommended Luis his open attitude makes me want to visit Gen more often."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times including when I lived in LA.  Went today for lunch with a large group of 9.  Luckily I looked at the menu because it was the dinner menu (basically the lunch menu with a few additions) and not the lunch menu.  Lunch is 17 dollars which is kinda pricing for Tempe and dinner is 25 dollars.  Asked for the lunch menu and was told that since it's a holiday (Presidents Day!!!) they are charging the dinner price all day.  Asked to speak to manager and asked for reasonable accommodation and for lunch time to be lunch price.  For a group of 9 that's a lot of money for lunch.  He refused.  We left and went next door to Kabuki who didn't think that Presidents Day required a gouging of the lunch time crowd.  I will be back to Gen because I love the food but it no longer is my \"go to\" for visitors."}
{"text":"For those who are not con kids or are weebs, this post might not make sense to you. We are avid Cali con kids who live in AZ. KBBQ is on our to do list every california con so we have standards. We know that when a KBBQ place comes to AZ, there is going to be a wait. We planned accordingly, signed up on the wait list and just did our thang in Tempe Marketplace. We were quoted 2.5 hours and got in about an hour and 45 minutes later. It's an all you can eat so of course that it was enticed us to go. We got all-out typical sides and ordered many more to come (I am pretty sure our server was like thought we were endless vaccumns as we order endless amounts of rice paper; we know what want). The Brisket is good. We ordered pork belly, bulgolgi and so much more. Our server, Dohee, was hilarious. Awesome. And everything your want in a KBBQ place. Soju was awesome! Very generous. The only tiff we had was that we were rushed out later. Not our servers fault. We're con kids. When you go to KBBQ, you keep ordering. AZ has a lot of catching up to do to understand all you can eat is ALL YOU CAN EAT. Haha. Waiting for a long time, you're going to want to stay because you paid your dues. So next time we go, if we get rushed out again, well post GEN on 4chan and be ashamed anonymously we did it but still not regret it because we should be able to eat that brisket as much as want. All in all, still recommended. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend to try it out since it had great reviews. The wait was over an hour but so worth it! All you can eat and the food was to die for. Tried a lot on the menu and the atmosphere of the place was amazing. I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Want to say that if you go here you need DAKOTA as your server, such a phenomenal person!!! I mean what service they had. I've never had this kind of service with such an amazing attitude!! The food was excellent as well I'm never disappointed by it. I'll always prefer this Korean BBQ spot compared to anywhere else in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite kbbq spot! Everything was amazing! We waited about 30 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it. The service was great, Luke took really good care of us and so did the rest of the crew. The pork belly and brisket were the best. Appetizers are included in the AYCE, I recommend the agedashi tofu and the crispy squid legs. And they have spicy tofu soup!!! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Another example of the Phoenix food scene catching up to the top food cities. I've been here three times and I've enjoyed my time. You get a large number of options and the best part is it's all you can eat in a span of 2 hours. If you need a little break from all the grilled meat, you can order some other great options like gyoza, Korean fried chicken (KFC) and jap chae (glass noodles). My go to meats are the brisket, which is really thin so it cooks quickly and you can season it to your liking. I also like the galbi as well as the premium steak but I haven't had anything that I don't like here so far. One thing to keep in mind is If you're coming here for dinner on a weekend, be prepared to wait at least an hour."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service every time we come here! It's our 3rd time here and service stays consistent. Our servers swapped out In the middle of the meal but service was still on point. Shout outs to both the servers Eugene and Jaenica. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great place and great service! Loved our experience here. We will be back! Open more stores valley wide please!   My kids absolutely loved \"cooking\" their food. Very authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Went with another couple and had a great time. At first, cooking your own food seemed unpleasant. After getting used to the grill and how the food cooks it was fun. The meat that is brought to your table is fresh and taste amazing. For all you can eat this place is absolutely ridiculous. Can't remember our servers name but she was awesome as well. Going back soon and with a bigger party."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time tonight and it was amazing.  Perfect price for the amounts of meat you can order. The staff was very friendly attentive fast and informative.  We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for our meats. Always were offered more many times. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Good service from Kristina. She was very courteous and patient with our large 14 person party! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Gen location. I've been to multiple in various cities so I did come in with some expectations but this location did not meet any of them. The meats were tough to chew, bland, and lacking in flavor. The only meats that my group somewhat liked were the pork belly dishes. The service was subpar as well. This was unfortunately my last meal while in Vegas, and I'm really disappointed I ended my trip at Gen. Gen in other cities are great, but I recommend going elsewhere if you're looking for a KBBQ place in Vegas (we tried Biwon when we first got to the city and liked it so I recommend trying there instead.)"}
{"text":"IT'S FINALLY REACHED ARIZONA!  To the receptionist in the Gen headquarters in California: I apologize for consecutive phone calls over this summer pestering you to give me a date for the opening.  To the Gen Tempe social media: I apologize for the spammy posts on Facebook. I promise I wasn't trying to incite a riot. (Kind of.)  I've been craving a high quality AYCE kbbq since I left LA, and although Gen is a higher price point than I usually care to pay - I live in Arizona, so I'll take what I can get.  Let me also mention that Luna is a FABULOUS waitress. Seriously, she knows what she's doing.  What's cool about this Gen in particular is the menu is actually different from the norcal and socal ones I've been to - namely, they serve korean fried chicken! Seriously impressed. It's SO good. The bulgogi and pork belly are my other favorite things to order.  The meat is high quality and consistent with other Gens. Also, I've only gone for lunch at this Tempe location but the music isn't as blaringly loud as the California Gens - a big pro for me!  GO HERE! Try to go for lunch to make the lunch price on weekdays, if possible - I hate waiting hours for a table, ugh. Also, COME HUNGRY.  Rice is included so eat up."}
{"text":"The best waitress/server I have ever experienced in any restaurant. Very kind and attentive. Jessica is a true classic!!"}
{"text":"For starters, I was so excited to find out that there was finally going to be a Gen in Arizona! I've been to multiple locations in California and to the one outside of Las Vegas - always great food and amazing service to follow.   Unfortunately I cannot say the same for this location. The food is good but quality definitely differs from the others. For example: the cuts of steak are thinner. Not too much of an issue though, as it is all you can eat. I understand that this location is new, however it's still frustrating that my friends and I had to wait at least 10-15 minutes to get greeted by our server and put in orders for food+beverages. Many times our orders didn't come out and drinks were not refilled so we had to ask our server again and again. It got to a point where we had multiple servers helping us, as our original girl was running so behind.   Also, being a regular at other Gen restaurants, I'm familiar with their payment policy. Three debit/credit cards to split and the rest may be paid cash. It is different here. You may either pay in all cash or split between three cards, not a mixture of both.   Overall, you can't get a better deal on AYCE KBBQ than at Gen so this is a good addition to Arizona if you can look past the lousy service.   Tip: go during lunch hours or grab an early dinner (before 7pm) to avoid long waits."}
{"text":"Gen is my favorite place for AYCE KBBQ. I've been waiting for what seems like forever for the location in Tempe, AZ to open!!   My friends and I take trips to Vegas about twice a year and we always make it a point to come out here. You can't go wrong with AYCE for under $25 whether lunch or dinner. Also cannot complain about the playlist; they've always got 2000's hip hop and r&b hits to set the mood right.   If you saved enough room for dessert, they also have macaroon ice cream! It's pretty solid frozen so I always have to let it sit and thaw for a minute. Take that time to digest ;)"}
{"text":"Raymond is very professional friendly and I would rate him from 1 to 10 perfect 10.  The food was excellent and all of the staff was great and a great price for ayce.  Enok great manager he will take great care of u.  Happy hour starts at 9:30pm"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me there for lunch on a Monday afternoon. The price for lunch was very reasonable at 16.99 for an all you can eat korean bbq place. The only thing I was not happy about the place was that I wish they had lettuce to wrap the meats in and more side dishes because it was hard to grab our server's attention to give us some more kimchi and rice. Other than that the ambience of the place is really nice and the meats were yummy! They kept changing the grill too when it got too black which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Worth the money for sure! Food was brought out quickly so you have more than enough time to order more dishes. The KFC is probably my favorite"}
{"text":"Waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated and customer service sucked. Food was ok and I've had better"}
{"text":"The good is very good.  We tried to make a reservation on mothers day and they said its first come first serve basis and there is no reservation list. So we get there and they say it's a two hour wait and they can put us on the list and that we would get a text. A text arrived to download an app called Nowait.  GUESS WHAT, that's a reservation list! I could have already been eating if I would have known about their \"non-official\" waiting list. SMH!   Just a word to the wise. Download that app"}

Just  keep ordering, even if you are full.. come on you can do it! We sat for 3 hours and ate one of each item... twice! they definitely lost money on us! Don't go during lunch, Dinner is more fancy and a much better selection for the price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its a great place for people who want to go out to  dinner but HATE having to spend money! AKA- ME!  Super Authentical.  Tons of americanized options for the mall crowd. KID FRIENDLY"}
{"text":"About the Manager assistant lied about the discount .  First at all, we didn't ask any discount. He is the one who offer 50% . And when the birthday boy got the check it's only shows 20%. I really wanna know how dare he lied to a birthday boy which is only 19 years old! This is not about training system , this is about their personality. Really disappointing of Gen group also really disappointing of UNLV. Cuz the person who lied is graduated from UNLV. Really wanna know with his personality how does UNLV let him graduated. Second , I checked all the reviews. Pretty much there have a lot ppl had same experiences. Why Gen group they never improve ? Looks like they even don't care about what we wrote. I know Gen is only open a month . So what? If u guys not ready for open a business like this. Then finish the training . Don't open when you are not ready.  Third, just wanna let everybody know I went to Gen in LA before. the service and food quality r better than Gen Las Vegas . Much better. At least Gen @ LA they didn't lied about discount."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Our friends took us here as a going away dinner and it was the best place we could have gone.  $25 per person gets you unlimited menu items for 2 hours! We practically tried everything! I'm pretty sure they lost money on us haha! The sirloin was my fave, but everything was pretty great too. They only let you order 4 items at a time,  which we thought was weird considering we had 7 people with us,  but they brought the food out so fast, and you were able to order more, when they dropped it off, that no one went hungry. Wish we weren't moving because I would definitely make this a regular date night spot for me and the hubs!"}
{"text":"Just pay $14.95 for all you can eat Korean BBQ is super worth. The meats are juicy and fresh! besides the meats, the servers from this restaurant are nice and kind. Jiahao was our server and I do recommend him because he was excellent!"}
{"text":"The entrance is just outside the mall.  I had a much better experience at this korean bbq restaurant than at Sura.  This place is much cleaner and I didn't leave smelling like the food - so two thumbs all the way up."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing. We came here as a team during a tournament. There were 10 of us. For how much we ate, the price is awesome. The service was great.. Shoutout to our server Ozzy. Definitely would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Oh man what an experience.  I've always wanted to try Korean BBQ and I'm so glad this place was my first experience.   I was visiting the city so can't really say much about the area. The restaurant and surrounding plaza area is very nice. The atmosphere felt good and I felt very comfortable walking around with my wife. Inside this restaurant however, was yet another amazing experience. I was blown away by the interior design with all the bbqing at each table going on.   After we were seated (no wait, in prime time too), they asked if we ever tried this before which I mentioned we have not. They were very well detailed in explaining how the process works and were very patient and nice when I needed them to repeat a couple things. You pay one price (I believe it was $35~) and you can order as much as you want, 4 at a time per table.  If I remember right we ordered: Steak Calimari Bulgogi Brisket Chicken Two types of fried chicken  The table already comes prepared with veggie side dishes, they also provide rice and salad.  As far as actually grilling the items, I was a bit nervous as I wasn't sure if I would grill everything properly, but it was actually quite easy. They also came and gave advice whenever you asked of how long to grill and prepare each item if you need the advice.   I didn't think it was possible to eat as much as I did, it was so worth it. The only regret I have was getting the fried chicken, it's basically already prepared which should have been obvious, I wanted to experience everything I eat from the grilling I did so that got more attention to what I would eat. You can't take any food home with you for obvious reasons.  They also came and changed out the metal griller whenever it got too dirty. They did this twice, which was awesome. They really pay attention to you.  I'm now a huge fan of Korean BBQ thanks to this place, highly recommended. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm hitting this place again."}
{"text":"I really liked the service of Ozzy the waiter. He was very prompt with his service and super enthusiastic about the restaurant. He had great recommendations and overall was an awesome server. 10/10 would recommend requesting him for your visit."}
{"text":"So glad that they opened a location closer to me because I hated to drive all the way to Henderson for AYCE Korean BBQ. The menu is a little different from the one in Henderson but who can complain when you can get all that food for $21.99!! I would've given the place 5 stars but our waiter was really rude. Pushing plates to just so she can hurry and get on to her next table."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong at Gen korean bbq. All you can eat! Prices are great at every location. Celebrating my birthday in Vegas and drive from the linq hotel and casino just to hit the spot. Love it!"}
{"text":"JJ was our server. She was excellent. She had a smile on her face the whole time we interacted and made some great recommendations on what to eat. I'll be back just because of her great service!"}
{"text":"Food and Service was excellent! Mizzo and Kevin were amazing and consistently coming over to our table to offer assistance."}
{"text":"Being Korean AND a California native, AYCE Korean BBQ was something that Arizona definitely was missing. I have literally been waiting all summer for this restaurant to open since they announced the news! I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch ($15.99) and there was about a 15-20 minute wait - no big deal. Again, being from California and having tried other Korean BBQ restaurants in Phoenix, I didn't have too high of expectations for Gen. But man, to say that I was satisfied with my experience would be an understatement! The food was good, definitely MUCH better quality than any Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to out here. But what made the experience so amazing was the service! Our server was Ly and all throughout our meal, he was sweet and so helpful - constantly checking on us to make sure we were doing okay. We made some out of the ordinary requests but he made sure we were taken care of and our needs were met. Having worked in the hospitality industry before, I literally left the restaurant thinking, \"That was the best service I've gotten in a really long time.\" Now onto the food, we ordered the premium steak, pork jowl, smoked garlic pork belly, regular pork belly, Korean fried chicken (KFC). All were really delicious except we weren't huge fans of the smoked pork belly as it just tasted like bacon...? But either way, I was so happy with my experience and can't wait to be back!   Tip: if you ask them for rice paper, they have it. :)"}
{"text":"First time here and last. Service was terrible. Our server did not take the time to explain how everything worked. He took forever to get us our drinks, had to constantly remind him. He left in the middle of dinner and didn't even let us know. We saw him walk out of the restaurant. He looked very uninterested, maybe he was having a bad day.  The food, however was good. Won't be coming back here based on service."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Gen locations in cali and so far this Gen location in Vegas is good. We had Austin B. as our server and he did a really good job serving us and recommending good food."}
{"text":"This place is great!! I've heard good things about it back in LA. The food quality is great! Not only their meat, but also their appetizers. They have a wide selection of food on dinner menu too. The service is great too! My waiter, Yuhao, is very friendly and attentive. I'll definitely come back with my friends!"}
{"text":"Great food as always. Service was good, but what is up with the super loud music. Don't get me wrong I love hip hop but not while I'm enjoying my lunch super loud and don't want my little kids listening to all the bad words. Not cool guys."}
{"text":"The best part of the whole experience was our waiter ozzy! He was caring and very attentive.   The only reason we're giving it a 4 star is because the system went down on our order got lost but ozzy was very apologetic for the inconvenience.   Food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Spicy pork was  delicious and the first salad is my favorite thing (considering I hate salads) Service is wonderful, I just wish they'd let me take my leftovers home...lol overall, it's great as far as Korean bbq here in las vegas :)"}
{"text":"I have had Gen here in Las Vegas and in the Bay Area. Of both locations, this LV one is much better. The atmosphere of the restaurant is more appealing and it's so much more spacious.   If you are looking for a Korean BBQ joint with an awesome variety of meats and appetizers Gen is the place to go. I personally will choose Gen over an other KBBQ restaurant in LV. You really get what you pay for, so I'd rather spend a little more to eat here than at another stop.  Now for my recommendations, you absolutely need to get their Beef tongue! This is by far my favorite meat dish because of the texture. Also the marinated steak is really good as well. On top of that their potato salad and tofu soup is delicious.   If I were to rate just the food it would be a 5/5, unfortunately when I ate here last night it took our server nearly 20 minutes to bring our drinks to our table because he forgot. We literally got all the meat we ordered and couldn't find him. Once we had someone stop by our table to change our grill, we asked him for our drinks and he said he'd get our server and it took another 10 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Awesome food for the price you pay !! This was my second visit the same week. Both were excellent service . It's the holiday weekend , the place was packed but we only waited for 10 minutes for two ppl .  However make sure you only order what you can eat or else you pay $5 addl per person for wasted meat order."}
{"text":"Worst service!!! New establishment with no bartender, no organization and ok food! I went with a group of 7, no one knew what the other was doing, half of my party was seated separately until I had to address the front desk staff. Once we were seated the grills had to recleaned, when are orders were placed half of it would come with no one aware anything was missing so we had to continually remind and ask the wait staff where this and that was. Our server was responsible for 9 tables with various party numbers, which was just not manageable. I will NEVER revisit or recommend this place to anyone. By the way don't ask for the Cajun Fries as they are \"seasonal\" as stated by the manager!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Gen! We tried Gen in California for the first time a couple of years ago and couldn't wait to try this location in Arizona! Kevin K. was our server and he was very attentive and gave us quality service!  He came back frequently and answered every question we had about the menu! All of the hostesses were very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back again! Word of advice: come early because they  don't take reservations!"}
{"text":"Super bomb KBBQ.  Third time in & the service has been outstanding every time. Kalee kindly greeted & sat me as soon as I got in and was taken care of attentively by Alex & the rest of the  wait staff.   My go-to order:  1. Salad 2. Jap Chae 3. Cajun Shrimp X3 4. Bulgogi Beef X2 5. Hawaiian Steak  6. Brisket  Lunch time price is 16.99$ and for lunch, and considering all that I ordered that's definitely worth the price.  Noise level is medium, the place looks as new as it is, comfortable seats in the booth that are perfect for intimate dates & group of friends, lastly they play modern R&B & Hip Hop music so that's always a plus.   Everything tasted as perfect as usual."}
{"text":"I really love the customer service here. Our server, Jaenica, was really nice and helpful. She was very easy to talk to and made us feel right at home. I recommend this place a lot."}
{"text":"I have never had Korean BBQ before, and for my first time I have to say it was really good. I went with my friend Rachel and a couple of her peeps. We arrived a little after 12:30 and waited just a few minutes while they prepared our table. I thought we were getting the lunch price, but they do not do lunch on the weekends. Still at $19.99 pp, that is not a bad deal.  Our server was nice, she did have a very thick accent so it made it kind of hard to understand her. She explained the menu to us, and how it works. Everything is AYCE, so you can order as much as you want. Most everything comes raw, and you cook on the grill in the middle of your table. This way you can cook to your liking. You are given a menu with a list of different meats, as well as appetizers. The items we tried:  Appetizers Gyoza- Really yummy. Little fried dumplings with dipping sauce, one of my favorites Edamame- It's edamame with salt, nothing good and nothing bad. Sesame Chicken- Fried and comes with sriracha mayo (I think) dipping sauce  KFC chicken- Korean Fried Chicken, tasty with a little bit of spice. Reminds me of General Chix Popcorn Shrimp- Not much to say bout this one. Came with the sriracha mayo that is yummy. We wanted cajun fries, but they were out.  Main Course Salad- Comes to your table with your dinner. Had a delicious ginger dressing on top. Veggies- Mixed veg, green pepper, green onion, and zucchini I think. Tasty when grilled. Spicy Rice Cake- OMG these are delicious.   Garlic Chicken- Comes with a side of jalapeno nacho cheese, wtf?? Not that garlicky. Beef Bulgogi- Yummmy.  Spicy Chicken- This is very spicy!  Spicy Baby Octopus- I wanted to be adventurous and try this out, but I didn't like it at all. it was spicy and chewy.  Brisket- This was my fav. Super thin and delicious. Rice- White rice to accompany our meal  We ordered a lot of food, and by the time we were done, everyone was super full. I would be careful in ordering because if your eyes are bigger than your stomach, like ours, you might give yourself a stomachache trying to finish. The thing is, you can't take anything home and they charge for uneaten meat. All in all, I have to say this was a fun experience. I told my boyfriend about it and he can't wait to go. It's safe to say we will be back."}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite KBQ I've ever had, and I use to live in Korean Town in Los Angeles! So good, service is always great. The wait is long, but well worth it. Brisket, short rib, and Tongue are favorites and the volcano chili corn is a must try."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here again! The food is great and the service is amazing! Jaenica our waitress was so nice, helpful and funny! The place is so nice and modern, way better than the other Korean BBQ places here in Vegas. I highly recommend the gyoza, so crunchy. The sesame chicken is also good!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was great.... Customer Service was great! I was always asked if I wanted any more meats. I never I had to wave to get any bodies attention which I really appreciate."}
{"text":"Loved the 'capri sun' type drinks! The food was great. We didn't see our waiter for a very long time (I think his name was Phil?) and he brought my husband the wrong wine. But I thought the lunch prices were reasonable and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Korean bbq may not be an inexpensive cuisine and for that reason, those of us who love Asian food but try to watch our budgets carefully will tend to gravitate more toward Chinese or Vietnamese. But a bit of a splurge is a good thing every now and then, and this place fits the bill. This was the International Supper Club UYE's pick for November and it was quite a satisfying experience. We came on a weekday evening and it did not take long for us to be seated. Our very friendly server explained the method of ordering, set up our table's grill and within minutes we were were ordering and grilling a variety of items: bulgogi (so good, we ordered it several times), galbi, a number of beef, chicken, and pork preparations in a variety of marinades, plus some cooked items such as glass noodles - all very good. The servers were very efficient and the items were brought to our table very shortly after we ordered them. The restaurant is conveniently located within the Tempe Marketplace. While 25 bucks per person may not make this a place for most people to frequently visit, the quality and quantity of food, the modern casual vibe and the friendliness and efficiency of the staff definitely makes this a great place for treating yourself to a Korean feast once in a while."}
{"text":"It was our first time and once seated our server Alodia recommended everything good to us. She was very friendly and kept checking up on us. I think that all servers should have that kind of attitude.  Menu selection is huge and they give you just enough portion at first, so you won't waste food but you can still get as much as you want. The location and environment is also great. Since it's in the mall area, if there's a waiting time you can always shop first while waiting."}
{"text":"great customer service. they were really quick with the delivery of all things from drinks, ban chan, meat and other side orders. not too pricey, and didn't have to wait long to get seated. (only 2 people) might take longer for bigger groups, but overall I really liked it, and would defintely come back again and recommend it."}
{"text":"What a pleasant dining experience....the food was amazing and our waiter Raymond was very friendly and attentive...he was always right there to answer any questions....I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"This place is very good, went for dinner very specifically so we could try the few items that are only dinner items. Let's start by saying, the atmosphere was very nice, upscale and clean.  I've spent 20 years immersed in the Korean culture spent a considerable amount of time in Korea and attending Korean events, this restaurant is hit for the most part. There are a couple things that aren't right and that's why they didn't get a 5 star. Let's start with what was amazing, the beef tongue was unbelievable, we ordered that 5 times, the steak was out of this world for the price and quality. The first waiter we had started waiting tables for the first day when we arrived, so he wasn't very good and seemed very confused as to what to bring to the table. We needed to ask for a bowl of rice otherwise it would have been protein overload. The one thing I didn't like about Gen's is, they don't have the traditional leaves to wrap your rice, meat and bean paste in. I asked for it and I got radish wraps, they are tasty but very small. Next time I go back I'll be bringing romaine lettuce from my local Sam's Club. The waiter all though he was new, was not a big deal, he was trying something new in his career and I think that deserves a little patience as he learns. The lack of romaine lettuce to wrap my cook protein, rice, bean paste and fresh garlic was a bum deal. I'm assuming the restaurant will work this out eventually and will probably offer a better wrap later. Overall the restaurant was very nice and I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try a Korean BBQ, it's fun, inexpensive and a nice night out."}
{"text":"Great food choices, great venue, clean tables and great customer service. Only downside is they don't ever have the fries available to order. My servers were Luke and Jaenica."}
{"text":"Yes, finally!!!! So happy that Gen made it way to Arizona! Walked in and instantly know there was a wait already. We waited about 15 minutes for our table and our server Ly was very nice and efficient. He got our table settle right away and we order 4 plates of meat to start. Their KFC is a must try! All the meats tasted very good, tender, and juicy.   Limit is 4 plates of meat per order but once they arrive you can always start putting in your next order. Our service was the best! Ly was great and fast at getting our side dishes and putting in our order.   Price is 15.99 for lunch before 3pm, after that its 24.95. But for AYCE, the price is worth it.   I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow and wow. This was my first time at a Korean barbecue place and I was blown away by the experience. I can tell you that it was worth the wait we had. Just walking into the place you can see that it is very modern. There is a bar in the back corner and in the other back corner is a huge screen project some videos. It's dimly lite but they had plenty of lighting around the barbecue to keep your food. It's not that loud inside and you can converse with your friends at the table easily.  The way Korean barbecue works is that you pay one price, per person, and an all you can eat menu for up to 2 hours. You order 3 items at a time. If you are not able to finish a large portion of the last round of food you will be charged an extra $5 for the dinner. This didn't happen to us, we ate every last piece of meat. :D  Employees here are fantastic. Always coming by to check if you want to order more food or if you need drinks. Our server did a splendid job. You could really feel the energy in the restaurant.  Such an amazing place. If you guys are around the Tempe Market place you have got to check it out. Remember to come hungry!"}
{"text":"5 star review for our dinner at Gen. We went around 8:30 pm on a Thursday and there was no wait. We were seated promptly at a booth, which was very spacious given the extra ledge on the top. I think Korean BBQ places are always lacking table space since there's so many plates.  Our server, Ozzy, totally made our experience at Gen memorable.  He was very attentive and always came by right when we needed him to order more dishes. He had great recommendations and everything was delicious.  Coming from LA, I was so happy to see that Gen had made its way to us from Henderson. We had the dinner menu, and we got to have all you can eat appetizers in addition to the meat. The only downside is that they ran out of the seaweed salad, but there was plenty of other food to make up for it.  Must get: galbi, bulgogi beef, signature pork steak, bulgogi chicken, japchae  Good: chadol (brisket), bulgogi pork, garlic chicken with cheese fondue (interesting), fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, grilled veggies  Probably not again: fried squid legs, Cajun shrimp (too much work to peel)  As with any AYCE Korean BBQ, there are plenty of side dishes, rice paper, salad, rice, etc to accompany your meat. The staff was very attentive our your needs and changed our grill pretty frequently. The thing I love about Gen is the small portion size.  We were able to try so many things with just the four of us.  We also enjoyed reverse happy hour towards the end of our meal. We could mix two flavors of soju, our favorite was the Peach/Yogurt recommended to us by Ozzy. We also tried strawberry/mango and pina colada/yogurt which were good too. All of them are pretty sweet as soju drinks usually are. Overall, we'd definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Las Vegas. It's just $19.95 per person for all you can eat Korean BBQ and side dishes and appetizers. It's like a dream you don't have to wake up from.   The garlic pork belly and spicy pork is the best. Make sure you get Jap Chae too.   Alodia was an amazing server. She made sure our drinks were full and our BBQ was sizzling clean.   I want to come back tomorrow, but I'm leaving town. :("}
{"text":"I love AYCE Korean BBQ Restaurants, and I was super excited when I learned Gen was coming into town. My fiancé took me to lunch today, and I was a tad bit disappointed.   We ordered Cajun Shrimp, Chicken w/ Cheese Fondue, Thinly Sliced Beef Brisket, Top Sirloin Steak, Soft Tofu Stew, and Veggies.   The quality of the meats were amazing, especially the beef brisket and the top sirloin steak. It literally melts in your mouth. It was very juicy and tender. The seasoning of the shrimp was done very well. It had the perfect flavor. Chicken was pretty good too. As for the soft tofu stew and the veggies, it was a major disappointment. The stew was very bland. No flavor to it whatsoever. I also expected more from the veggie platter. It only had sliced mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers. I was expecting red leaf lettuce, sesame leaves, etc.   The service was too much. Our waiter kept coming over asking us if we wanted more meat; he was being a little nuisance, acting like a salesman. Ugh.   Overall, I recommend this restaurant and will go again for the food."}
{"text":"With high expectations  we tried the restaurant  last Sunday at 5.45 the wait was about 20 minutes  not long . It was loud the waiters kelp shouting.  We were limited  to four items . Portions were small for 4 persons  by the time we reordered . It took a few minutes . Needed more sides and dipping sauces . Some of the meats did not have much flavor . One order took 20 minutes.  It is buffet but food was average .The grill got dirty very quickly. Not worth the money"}
{"text":"With much anticipation for this location to open up, it was definitely worth the wait. I have been a few of the locations in California, this new location has by far the best interior. The meat quality is very similar from what I remember in Cali and it was a delight. My server Leyna was so friendly to us and was very attentive to our needs. We also has rice paper that was stiff and dry, she didn't hesitate to get us new one quickly. As her shift came to an end, she still came to serve us until the next server came up. Sharon became our new server and provided exceptional customer service as she was very welcoming and  quickly helped us order new meats and grill change. I recommend the brisket, bulgogi, KFC(Korean fried chicken) and pork jowl.  As my third time in a week, it's pretty clear that I'm happy that I don't have to travel to another state to enjoy Gen.  #CERTIFIEDBANGER"}
{"text":"Was craving Korean BBQ and my sister in law recommended this place. She said is new and cheap and it's all you can eat! Got there and was seated right away. Staffs was friendly and service is fast and great. For $21 per person it's not too bad. Meats was fresh but I give them low rating because the foods is very bland. Probably would not come back."}
{"text":"No reason to go to Gangnam bbq (rip).   The food was very good and the meats were in good quality. Wish their ssamjang was better, but i couldnt complain because the lunch was only $16."}
{"text":"All meats are great, service is great they cater to your needs, is a must to visit if you ever in Las Vegas well this place is in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We came here for lunch so we missed out on the kalbi, but never the less it was very good!  We were sat down and served almost immediately, service was very friendly and had a bunch of great suggestions. All of the side dishes were outstanding I kind of wished they had the soybean sprouts commonly seen with Korean meals. The workers were really on top of changing out the grill plates.  We ordered AYCE lunch, it was just awesome. It's only been one day and my fiance is already asking me when we're going back!"}
{"text":"Always my best place to eat !! Service are very please and food always great !! It's worth every dollars spent!!Will return again !!!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here. Absolutely love the different varieties of AYCE. Thank you Alodia for wonderful customer service! Definitely plan on coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place, was worried place was too small from the store front but they have done a great job with design.   The staff was friendly, prompt and helpful.   Look forward to going back again. Much shorter distance than driving to Cali!  Welcome to Arizona!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Best Korean restaurant that has open up and the prices are super cheap for all you can eat. Also you make the meat he way you want it.  Terry was our server and I couldn't recommend him more as he helped us decide on food and always checked on us and was an all around awesome guy."}
{"text":"Yuhao was a great server and the food was amazing defiantly coming here again. It was my first time here and I think it's going to be my favorite restaurant. Sherry was awesome too"}
{"text":"Great restaurant  very good service  they were fast on your order, changing the stove top and they were polite  I recommend this barbecue Korean restaurant. Check it out"}
{"text":"This place is really cool every time we head there nothing but good food and cool people. Make sure to ask for jaenica as your server , this girl is on point and know how to make her customer laugh and have a great tim"}
{"text":"Honestly, at this price point how could I complain? Great value. A lot of fun for the whole family. The food is great. The service is friendly but they always seem to be just slightly short staffed, or staffed with brand new servers. There's always a wait, so we try to come on weekdays for lunch. But needless to say, we love it! We come a few times a month. My fave: short plate (beef belly) My hubby's fave: pork bulgogi  My mom's fave: wine marinated pork belly My kids' fave: macaron ice cream I much prefer the thinly sliced meats with good marbling that are not marinated. Make sure to use the green tea salt...it's amazing!"}
{"text":"GEN Korean BBQ (ayce) is no stranger to the Korean BBQ market, nor it's following fanatics of the grill galore at your table top and turns even the most decent mild manner human being into FEASTMODE. With several locations, well established in California (mainly so-cal), GEN brings the flavor to Southern Nevada in the city of Henderson (basically Las Vegas) but to be politically correct..it is in Henderson & situated in the Galleria Mall main entrance along side other restaurants.  I do compliment the fact that Gen provided an outdoor menu located by the entrance pathway for those not familiar with the delicacy or those just curious of what will be served...of course alongside prices.  This does give the opportunity for the customer, the option to decide whether or not they want to eat here without stepping inside, only to walk out in slight embarrassment...depending on one's personality.  (This could be a good thing or bad thing for GEN) I decide it is a good thing for me as a customer and to know what is expected.  Since the restaurant is located in a high traffic shopping mall, parking can be a hassle, especially at peak hours.  Wife and I arrived at an off time, around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Booths were in full use with a couple of hungry patrons before us waiting to be seated. We were given the option to be seated advanced with an open area at the high tables (somewhat like a bar area with high chairs) but we opted to wait an additional 30 minutes for a more comfortable and intimate booth. I do applaud the host for recognizing the option as others not willing to wait...would be able to jump on it.  Low & behold, our 30 minute wait turned into a quick 15 minutes as we noticed the patrons before us, being seated in timely fashion.   ***** Please note that peers and colleagues have noted that waiting time can be very long especially at peak hours...so we got lucky.   Weekend price was fixed all day to a reasonable $19.99 considering it was a dinner price & everything on the menu was available. If you are looking for a cheaper price & time permits, definitely come in during the weekdays during lunch hours, but do caution limited menu items for ayce.  Ambience was very modern & contemporary...very different compared to the casual and Asian feel of the usual Korean BBQ places here in Vegas and Chinatown area anyways. It had a feel to somewhat being in a VIP night club to an expensive gourmet restaurant. Background music was mild in sound, but could have been drowned out caused by Noise level chatter. It was some what loud, but not as bad as a Chinese Dimsum restaurant I won't name since I am not reviewing it.   Upon being seated, our hosts & servers were on point & seemed to check back frequent for more food order requests, taking empty dishes away & making sure our experience was on par. Menu choices were a-plenty in variety which I appreciated & even included appetizers to the ayce menu. Some of their portions per order were on the smaller side, but since it was ayce...it didn't matter, because you could request more & more until your heart desires...or until your stomach can FeastMode no more.   I was disappointed in the brisket, being bland compared to other kbbq joints. Their dipping sauce was limited as well as the seasoning & oils. I cannot complain on that area though, because I did not ask to see if they had any hidden in the kitchen.   Over all my experience was definitely on par & did fill me and my wifey's Tum~Tum to the brim. I do knock off one star as I have tried many kbbq joints...4 stars is being generous...as taste was mediocre and comparable but not better than cheaper china town locations. Again variety, service & ambience gave a very slight edge, but not by much.   I think the real winners here are the Henderson locals who do not have to drive out to Chinatown to get their K-Fix. As for me living in Summerlin it is quite a drive, so I do not see myself coming back anytime soon, as other competition are much closer. This does not mean I won't come back. Vegas is small so even a drive out to Henderson isn't that bad compared to California standards. Am willing to give it another go if I am in the area or bringing others out to try it.   I think Gen did a good job, & it's always nice to have another option to go to. It gets my approval and recommendations to try and check out...so if you are in the area...check it out too!"}
{"text":"Not that I've been to better korean bbq places it's just that I don't really care for this place, and my last visit left a sour taste in my mouth.  The first time I went was fine.  We had four people and got sat relatively quickly at a table with two grills.  We got our food and cooked.  The flame was really low so it took a long time to cook/eat but the experience was fine.    The second time was a mess.  We had 6 people this time and got crammed into a booth with one grill.  The place was really busy when we went so we weren't really expecting fast service but what we got was a snail's pace.  We got our drinks and free sides quickly enough but with those, our entire table was already filled up.  Like there wasn't any room to put anything!  We all ordered our food and it came out but the servers didn't have anywhere to put it so they kind of just looked at us to either finish the free sides (which are supposed to accompany the meal) or hold the sides so they could put the meats down.  None of us could eat at the same time and we had the grill so filled with food (one from each person, with one or two people left out bc of room) that the food took about 45 minutes to an hour to cook!  This was totally unacceptable but we couldn't complain because our servers didn't come back for another 45 minutes or so.  Our table was literally piled high with used dishes and empty plates, some 6 plates tall!  We got so upset at how long it was taking to cook the food that we decided to just order ready made dishes.  Half of what we ordered they said they were out of, even though the table next to us ordered the same food ten minutes after we did and got it promptly delivered.  We were honestly so pissed at this point.  I hate their two card policy, I hate how expensive it is when we are doing most of the work, I hate how little seasoning they give with your food, I hate how weak their grills are, and I don't understand why this place is so popular!  I am giving it 2 stars because of my first experience.  The last time I was there definitely gets a 1 star.    I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"We need this in AZ. Hopefully another one on the west side of town soon. Food was decent and the price is good. Situate in a nice hang out spot. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food here is decent for what you pay. Their marinated meat is flavorful. As for the quality, eh...I'm surprised the wait is as long as it is. I wish the table offered more space, especially because of all the plates our raw food comes on.  The water here tastes like they get it straight from the faucet."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic.   It felt like a whole team of servers were making sure we were well taken care of.   Top notch stuff.  Also, the atmosphere of  of the restaurant is great.   Very modern, clean, and comfortable.  For the AYCE dinner, it's $21.99 a person.  And I believe there is 39 options of raw meats (some marinated and others not) and already cooked appetizers.   The selection for the most part is very good.  I was wishing they had skirt steak but they have lots of other choices.  They have a few varieties of pork belly, chicken, cuts of beef as well as calamari and shrimp.    I've been to a few different Korean BBQ AYCE places and don't usually see the seafood selection this place had.    The only big knock on Gen was the quality of meats.   Most of the items we tried were chewy and not the quality levels I'm used to at a Korean BBQ place.   And we weren't a fan of most of the marinades when the meat was pre-marinated.     My favorite item was the KFC.   Also thought the spare ribs were pretty good.     Considering most of the people there are grilling their food, the ventilation seemed quality because it wasn't very smokey at all.     Servers are very attentive, helpful, and nice.   Restaurant is really well done and on a Saturday at 7PM, we only waited like 3 minutes to sit.   Everyone else seemed to like the food here a bit more then me so you should probably give it a try for yourself."}
{"text":"Last night my Mom and I went to check out the newly renovated side of Galleria Mall in Henderson.  We stopped by this new Korean BBQ restaurant and luckily it was AYCE!  A nice surprise tucked away in East Henderson.  The menu was interesting.  Different than what you'd find in Chinatown, and the meats looked and tasted fresh!  It wasn't overly garlic-y in taste, which was a huge plus.  Some dishes were on the sweeter side, like the KFC and potato salad.  Not bad, just different.  I would definitely be back here, but make sure you come early, because it does fill up quickly.  Our server was Janicka (?).  Give her 5 stars across the board ;) and some free meals!"}
{"text":"My second time here. Food here is always great. I feel like I need to be wheel chaired out because I eat so much, but it's such a good deal for all you can eat Korean BBQ. I love the salad they give when we sit down. Short plate and beef tongue are my favorite! Ozzy was very tentative and super nice! He took very good care of us. We'll be sure to request him next time I visit. Thank you, Ozzy"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite restaurants. Good quality, good flavors, really great service even when the place is really packed. My only wish is that someone work on the sound system so the the music is not deafening in the back and barely audible in the front."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and the food is pretty good for the price. Not the best Korean BBQ I've had but certainly delicious."}
{"text":"Not bad. I love the one in Cali so when I found out one was opening in AZ and I'm there all the time I was excited.  We were told the wait would be 30 min, we got our text after only 10 so that was a plus. They have tons of tables, pretty big restaurant. I liked the high boy type tables that's different.   We were seated right away and the hostess said she has to measure the kids. Not sure if that's how all Gens charge (according to height) but just an FYI. So if you got a tall kid who doesn't really eat a lot, might not be worth it to go since anyone over 50 inches (4 ft 2) is charged as an adult. We went on a Saturday where its all dinner prices and had a 7 year old who's tall (4ft 4) and charged full price, he barely ate..so just keep that in mind.  Service was good..our server was nice and attentive. She was quick with our orders so we were never waiting for more food. As for the portions. Small! So make sure to order multiple of the same dish. You can only order 4 dishes at a time, but our server took our next order before our first order came out and so forth, so it worked out.  They are in a good location so even if there is a wait you can find something to do while at the marketplace   Since there arent that many AYCE Korean BBQ places on the east side or Tempe...I'm sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"A slightly disappointing dining experience. Whilst the meat was of a good quality the sides were very poor. Every table has sides set out and leaves them dry and unappetizing. Also they are unable to prepare hot drinks - a restaurant  that does not serve hot tea - what is this about??? I will not return :("}
{"text":"The food here at Gen is so good!! We come here at lease 2 times per week just to eat the roast beef. I had a awesome server Julian. He gave us great customer service.  Thanks Julian!!!"}
{"text":"We had a good time, I recommend the briskets! The service was very attentive. The wait was short since we went there for lunch on a Wednesday. Good value for the price."}
{"text":"THE best all you can eat Korean BBQ Restaurant in the area. Enough said. Quality, price, atmosphere, comfort and service all fall under \"best\" for me. I have had GEN BBQ in California, and I have to say that GEN always pleases me. Their menu is extremely extensive, which I love since other Korean BBQ restaurants have a limited menu.   A few advantages that GEN has over other KBBQ restaurants are: An extensive menu, a bar and great service. Can't go wrong with that.   I personally really like the pork belly. Grab a perfectly crisp piece of pork, dab it with some savory sesame oil and salt sauce, put a piece of perfectly grilled kimchi on top and enjoy a mouth watering, sensational explosion of deliciousness in your mouth."}
{"text":"This is must-go-place in las vegas! Premium all you can eat bbq finally in vegas! Servers are nice and attentive. Try beef belly, pork cheek, galbi, and prime steak. This place just opened up!"}
{"text":"About time we got a legit Kbbq place here, fellow yelpers Cher-Yee L., Mike Y.,  and Sohan P. know I had been complaining enough. Once I heard it had opened, we immediately made plans to go on a Sunday afternoon. Be aware that they don't take reservations, and we ended up waiting hangry for two hours. By the time we were finally seated, we were solely dedicated to maximizing the two-hour all-you-can-eat grazing period. You can only order four dishes at a time, and in the most efficient way possible we were planning out our next four before they even brought out the last four. Our most popular were beef tongue, bulgogi, galbi, and garlic pork, but definitely branch out and try the other stuff.   Inside is somewhat of an usual ambience -- it's almost like a nightclub with the dark tables and neon lighting. They were also spinning up some old school rap (Tupac, Biggie, etc.), and there was a huge multi-TV screen in the back that was being totally wasted on some network TV movie.   When I went, they were definitely still figuring stuff out, and we had to ask for rice (their cooker broke) and some of our missing dishes a few times, but they may have it under control now.   It's a little pricy, and they only do dinner prices on the weekend, but for the sheer amount of pretty decent quality kbbq you can stuff down your gullet, it's a pretty good deal.   I had planned to do other stuff after eating... lol. If you do it right, this should be an entire day where you consume all your nutrients in one sitting and then go home and veg out on the couch.   Also, the hostesses are really cute!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. The food was great! It's a unique experience and I will go back!"}
{"text":"Third time today with the cousins after our bridal/bridesmaids dress fitting. Lots of improvement since they first opened. Servers are a lot quicker and surprisingly no wait at all on a Sunday afternoon. I tried most of the bulgogi, except the squid bulgogi and my favorite is the spicy pork bulgogi. Serving sizes are much smaller than other kbbq restaurants. Somewhat a good thing, so you can try their different meat selections. I still prefer Doh KBBQ! At that place, you don't come out smelling like smoke after."}
{"text":"Finally an affordable all you can eat korean barbecue in Phoenix! The selection of food is really nice, and the quality of the food was excellent too. I will definitely go back! However, I give it 4 stars because: first, the service was a little bit slow. Second, the grills were not well oiled and burnt very quickly. We had to ask for 3/4 grill changes over the course of our meal. Third, I believe the place could benefit from over grill fans. The ventilation was not great."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is delicious and atmosphere is great. I am a fan of Korean food and this place is one of the best Korean BBQ restaurants I have ever been to. Also enjoyed my experience here. Our server Yuhao is attentive and willing to help. He recommend us great food based on our preferences and serves quickly.   I'll definitely bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"Aldonia was the best! She took care of us even though it was busy during lunch. Spicy pork bulgogi is a must!"}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all.  Korean food is my favorite but I could not even stay long enough for the food.  Extremely loud. I could barely hear the hostess that sat us at our table.   There was a sign saying that anyone being seated pays full price.  I had someone with me that was not gong to eat anything.  I was told there was a 2 hour limit so we had to be out of there whether we wanted to or not and we were told that of we habe left overs there is a $5 charge. Yeah, we got up and left.   We will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been here probably a dozen times and i would always get great service but tonight it's even better! Alodia who's one of the servers just blew me away.. Great personality very attentive and of course outstanding service! I'll be back and I'll request for her to be my server again! Thanks Alodia keep up the good work! I could see you working in a very high end restaurant and making BIG BUCKS! So if you plan to visit gen Korean bbq try to request for her!"}
{"text":"The place is nice. Wait staff are very attentive. They have very good varieties of meat but not so on seafood and desserts. Meat are not marinated though. Overall, it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. We ended up ordering from the manager because our server never came back.  The meat was very fatty. I asked for chicken breasts and I was only given thigh meat. I'll never go back there."}
{"text":"We went out for our roommates birthday whose from California. It was a first experience to Korean BBQ for the rest of us. Great experience, will come back."}
{"text":"I've been here one other time, and it was a good experience. Wanted to take my Mum to a nice restaurant and decided to take her there. Bad idea. First off, we got plastic spoons when I asked for cutlery. Was told some story about guests stealing cutlery so they had run out. Then service was horrible! Started off ok, but went downhill. Waited over 20 mins for a bowl of rice. Asked for things that never got to out table. All the while, saw the waiter serving and chatting with other people. Ended up asking a runner to bring us rice. By this time, all the food was burnt or cold. We had lost our appetite. End of the meal, asked for the check, twice. Took an extra 5+ minutes to get that. The food was still good, hence the two stars. Service was just so bad."}
{"text":"alodia, alan, & joe are the bestttttttttt. gen's customer service is always on point :)"}
{"text":"One of the better yakiniku around the LV area. Down side is there us always a wait,but worth it."}
{"text":"FOOD: 5/5 The food and the variety is SO GOOD here. I recommend the Korean fried chicken, japchae, salad, pork belly, beef tongue (for dinner only), squid, and spicy pork!  SERVICE: 4/5  The wait was a little bit, but it isn't that bad of a wait. The people are also really awesome. Shout out to Jennifer, our server, for being so great. They were always very attentive and were always there to take our orders. I remember coming here with my mom and they were very good about letting her know what the different menu items were since she was only familiar with certain things on the Korean BBQ menu.   AMBIANCE: 4/5 The ambiance of this place is pretty chill. I like the decor and the vibe. There are high tables and booths, which makes the feel of this place even more modern. I think that it truly enhanced my dining experience.   PRICE: 5/5 It was reasonably priced for AYCE. For less than $25 a head, you get great quality and variety.  LOCATION: 5/5 The location is easy to find in Henderson. There is a ton of parking, which makes it pretty convenient to get into the doors."}
{"text":"Don't show up at 11am when they are suppose to be \"open\". My coworkers and I showed up today at 11:20am and they had a sign on the door stating \"Sorry for the inconvenience, We will be open as soon as possible. Which was fine, but then 10 minutes later they put up another sign stating \"Won't be open for another hour\". Are you kidding me!? What kind of restaurant is so poorly ran that it would cause an hour and a half delay? I recommend going to other chains that are actually punctual for lunch. I hear that Manna on dobson are actually punctual and have better food quality."}
{"text":"Dined at Gen on a Saturday night got there around 5:20 and was told there was a 30-45 min wait, no big deal I get it since it's a Saturday night and they don't take reservations. We wondered around the marketplace until they texted us about 40 mins later. We checked in and they said oh your table will be another 5 mins, (then why did you text me and tell me it was ready?!?) Sat down at table 16 near the kitchen and bar and was told a someone would be with us to take our drink orders. After watching what felt like 75 people walk by and stare at us for a good 10 minutes still no one asked what we would like to drink. I flagged down the young girl that sat us and said that we have no seen our server yet and she said \"well I told her\" finally Carrie our server came to take our drink orders (ice water) and our food order. With that done we were ready to EAT! The food came out extremely fast and the drinks came out shortly after minus the ice so it was lukewarm water. Our first round of food we got the red wine pork belly which was extremely tasty and the brisket also tasty. The shrimp was bland and small (wouldn't waste your time). Carrie who was very friendly but a little scatterbrained came back to take another order and I specifically asked for ice water this time and again got NO ICE!! We ordered beef tongue and smoked pork belly the tongue was really thin and good the smoked belly was extremely chewy, our grill also seemed to be malfunctioning because the flame kept getting low despite being set on high. As we had a table near the kitchen I was able to see that they just had someone arrive with bags of ice and when Carrie came back I asked for ice and she finally said yeah we have been having a problem with that tonight. Overall the place is just a 2 some of the food is good the service for drinks is eh I expected better since they don't bring out the food or clear the plates. It was also difficult paying the check as Carrie seemed to go missing for about 10 minutes after dropping the check and before she picked up the card to run it. Sadly don't think I would waste my time coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite kbbq place and Alodia was awesome! She got all our orders on time and was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"This was my second experience at a Korean BBQ place and I gotta say, this was so much better than the last kbbq I was at. You know those servers who're just there to take your order and you don't see them til it's time to pay? Well, our server actually came back from time to time and actually conversed with us. Alodia definitely made a memorable visit. She kept it fun yet professional when needed to be. Definitely going back because of a well service. It's a plus that what we ordered came out right away. It was great. And I was very fascinated by how high tech everything is."}
{"text":"Great place compared to the other Korean Bbq restaurants around town. Depending on the times, the waiting time can be very long but worth it. Plus the prices for AYCE Korean bbq is hard to pass up.  The times I've went to Gen, Jessica S is our waitress. She's amazing!"}
{"text":"Best KBBQ in Henderson. Lisa and Kristina were amazing. Great service - the whole staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. OMG.  It's better than any place I've had in Las Vegas.  Their meat are truly premium. I love love love their spicy baby octopus. It's my favorite thing from there after the premium steak. The restaurant is clean and the staffs are definitely friendly. The only thing I have to complain about is the wait time but there's nothing they can do about that.  The best part is that it's $20 for AYCE which is awesome. I hope it stays this way bc I will come back like every week. I hope it's not a thing where they get a lot of people and then raise their price. They should open another on the southwest side of town lol  I definitely recommend this to everyone who has doubts about it bc it's honestly the best in town and I go eat KBBQ a lot. Awesome food at awesome price."}
{"text":"This rating is based on customer service only.  I have read great reviews about this place so I am considering trying it out. I called just for some general information hours, prices, etc... The girl that I spoke with was very short when it came to answering my questions. When I was done I said \"Thank you\" and all I got was a click. How rude can someone be? If she doesn't like her job she should leave. I'm sure there are plenty of people that would appreciate working and do it with a better attitude.   IF I decide to go I will update my review based on service, food, and the experience."}
{"text":"This was the first time we visited Gen and we were not impressed. Ryan our server was awesome! The food was ok but not great.  Granted I do realize we had to cook it but nothing we tried knocked our socks off.  The biggest environmental annoyance was the hostess consistently shouting new customers were being seated followed by a rousing \"welcome to Gen\" from the rest of the crew.  This is an incredibly busy restaurant and the constant shouting gets old in a hurry.  Probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Great food!  We came here for my Aunts birthday lunch. There was about 12 of us with 3 kids and they were very accommodating. The severs were all very nice and considering the amount of people we had in our party they all kept their smiles on and were friendly. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at gen in Oxnard and the service was great and the food was pretty good. Now for the Henderson location. Okay, let start with the service, everyone that served us was nice but, please tell me why it took us 15 mins to get 2 glasses of ice water, she said it wasn't ready and that's why it taking so long. Our food came out faster then the water. We found out it was happy hour asked for the menu that took 10 mins and to order a alcoholic beverage we waited 15 mins on top of that. I ordered japchae along with our meal, never received it. I had to ask 3 times for radish skins, and when they finally came there was a green thick film on one of them I was told it was wasabi radish skins. But tell me why the kitchen didn't know or our waitress didn't know what it was, she informed me that her \"manager informed her it was wasabi radish skins\". Ordered the premium steak but it had such a thick layer of grizzle i didn't want to attempt to try to eat it. Everything else was okay."}
{"text":"Terry was awesome!!!! He was hilarious and very interactive with us. The food was delicious we ordered a lot, but I had to call it quits after a few orders. From eating here I learned I may not be the best cook, I'm only slightly discouraged from cooking meats myself again. If you don't mind being disappointed in your ability to cook meat afterward, laughing while being entertained by lovely staff, or leaving with your pants unable to fasten then this place is perfect. Love it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  I always love Korean bbq and this place delivers great food at a reasonable price.  The problem I have are the staff.  It's really half half, meaning half of the staff are on top of it and the other half needs improving their service skills; however, I'm sure they will improve as time progress"}
{"text":"My favorite bbq all you can eat. my sever Julian is awesome, very nice and very patient on my request. will come back again and again"}
{"text":"The service has been so slow that I do not want to eat there anymore. According to the server, they got a new slicer to sliced the meat but that is not the excuse to provide less meat and also 15min+ waiting for the meat to be sliced for every order we made.  As a result, we had to order something that was not thin cut which we did not want to. I used to go there with my friends pretty much every week or two. You guys just lost a bunch of loyal customers"}
{"text":"They give you rules to eat there. You'll leave smelling like smoke. Super slow service. Not a good selection of options.  After listening to 30 mins of rules we were finally able to order.  Final rule is that you only have a 2 limit.  Not a problem because I don't think it takes me 2 hrs to eat.  If you like pork then for sure try this.  I don't eat pork for the most part. I probably should've done my homework and realized steak isn't on the menu and the options for chicken were very limited.  Each time we submitted another order they got slower n slower to bring it to us.  If your emphasized rule is we only have a 2 hr rule then you should be prompt as well.  We only spent 45 mins there.  Had maybe 3 courses.  Our waitress left after 30 mins and her replacement took 10 mins to come over and check in on us.  I only had chicken and brisket which both were very bland. Spicy chicken: a slice of non-marinated chicken breast with a side of nacho cheese .  I have no idea how this is spicy chicken. Volcano chicken: already cooked breaded chicken tenders tossed in hot/sweet sauce. ?  Truly don't think I'll be coming back here.  It's just not worth the price.  If you like hype instead of good satisfying food then this is ur spot."}
{"text":"My server Raymond was fast and friendly,, the food is perfect in general, the brisket is fat but it's good with rice, had a really good time in here,, definitely will come back again! Ps. The dessert do not come with the all you can eat price"}
{"text":"Food was great. Atmosphere was fun.  Service needs improvement. The waiters were slow and non attentive.  Waited along time between orders.  The waiters were switched and we were forgotten. Talked with the manger and then waited another 15 minutes to get our check.  Maybe it was just a bad day and we paid the price.  We will try it again and hopefully I can update this to reflect better arrive."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since they've opened, once for lunch when they first opened this location and again a few months later for weekend \"dinner\" (dinner price all day on weekends). I can say that while the food is decent, it's definitely nowhere as good as their California locations.   On our first visit, service was terrible and it didn't seem like anyone knew what they were doing. Although service improved a lot by our 2nd visit, the food just isn't what I'm expecting from a Gen BBQ because it's straight up mediocre compared to their sister locations in Cali. Their meats don't taste as good and their steak doesn't have a nice fatty rind like I've had in Cali.   One good thing about this location is that they offer to change your grill top fairly often which is nice. It's also a little weird if you want to pay with a credit/debit card because they send a manager to your table with a tablet to run it instead of taking it to the register...just seems a little unnecessary but works I guess   Would I come again? If I was in the area maybe. This place is definitely not worth the drive down here unless you live in Henderson"}
{"text":"The best service I ever had at all you can eat Korean bbq. All of the employees seem always ready to help with anything to every table. I loved all their food that I choose. Sadly, the dessert wasn't included   Great place with a great service and a great price!! My new fave AYCE to go to."}
{"text":"This all you can eat,  cook it yourself restaurant is BOMB! You order as much as you want and you cook it up! I have never had Jap Che until today and DAMN!!! It pairs well with all the meats. I recommend the KFC, Beef Bulgogi,Gen Chadol and the Garlic Chicken...stay away from the fermented bean paste!  (Doenjang)"}
{"text":"I don't know.. I was happy to find out there was a Gen nearby after moving to Henderson, but then was extremely disappointed after tasting the food. Compared to the socal locations I've gone to in Irvine and Chino, it was just bad. The dipping sauce was so bland, the marinated kalbi wasn't good, the side dishes weren't good at all (ie: overcooked japchae and weird seasoning), and my plate was dusty. Also the main thing for me was that there's no bean paste stew... at a kbbq... wuut!! (Okay if you're not Korean I guess it doesn't matter much?) I also don't think they had steamed egg either but double check. Anyway I dont recommend this place to anyone.. better off finding a place in chinatown!"}
{"text":"I wish i could post a positive post for this restaurant. I was extremely excited for Korean Bbq.  I read other posts saying the wait was long. So understanding this came at 7:30 on a Sunday in hopes of being sat by 8:30 at latest. We came for my birthday and had 20 people and a infant and small child in tow. Continually the staff kept telling my husband and i and our guests 30 minutes. The initial said 1 hr to 1.5 hr wait.  When we checked at 9:30!(2 hrs later) the hostess kept saying 8 parties were ahead of us and another large party. I believe they were moving people in front of us. She told me not yo create a scene. The WORST HOSTESS EVER.  I told her to take us off the List. I was very mad, hungry, and disappointed. It literally was my birthday. She could have just decided to say we weren't going to eat there and we could have gone somewhere sooner.  We went next door to Kabuki. The manager let my large party get seated 20 minutes before close. Gave us free appetizers as her apology for another restaurants poor business practices.   So even if the food is good (wouldn't know).... the customer service is TERRIBLE... at Gen H. Once novelty wears off i doubt this will hang around if their customer service does not impress  Skip Gen Korean and go to Kabuki  Very Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always been fan of AYCE Korean food!!! Just Korean food in general really not much too dislike in my mind. Meat and more meat and more meat. Beef Tongue unreal good. They do serve other proteins and a good variety of side dishes. I feel family style of cooking your own food in front of you makes it fun for everyone, entertaining, and good times.   I read that few yelpers have had problem with the service. Maybe it helped that went early before 6pm meet up with friends for dinner. By the time left around 7pm the place was crazy busy. I think overheard someone say easy over hour wait. Early is the way too go. We had wait but nothing crazy like hour. Really from the minute sat down feel like the service we got was nothing but five star. Once we started ordering I was surprise but the raw protein and the side dishes was bam bam bam coming out one after another. It was pretty darn fast our plates was piling up around the grill. Since there was five of us just about ordered the whole menu. The main things I ordered or should say got my AYCE in was the Beef Tongue and Japchae. The only other AYCE Korean been in Vegas is Sura. The last time went they never had Beef Tongue or was out. The Japchae I believe they never offered. Both are right up on top for my favorite Korean food in general. Both were awesome at Gen Korean BBQ House. The Japchae could have ordered that all night be totally happy in life. The gyoza was solid. Pork Cutlet another solid dish. Bulgogi another one of my favorite was tasty. The chicken I would pass on order the other stuff. The dipping sauce found interesting that came with it and suppose you dip it before or once it done. Any case just never worked besides it does take longer too cook then some of the other proteins. The head on shrimp friend order seriously  waste of time. It lot of work just get little pieces of meat and takes forever cook. The pork belly looked good have two different ones on the menu. Friends ordered both. Our glasses never had empty glass the whole time. They checked after round two if need was grill plate changed up. Our server was friendly and no problem separate checks.   The interior was very modern. I had no idea that walked into Korean BBQ. The minute you walk in see  nice open bar area with couple wide screen that can hang out while wait. Or might be able eat there just never walked by but it the first thing notice walk in. Nice high ceilings always plus for BBQ cause so many people cooking can get smoky. Think with the place being packed packed be really loud but not bad and you can have great conversations over dinner with friends. I had no idea the place was outside or part of the Galleria Mall. Honest got lost. Dooh!   The price......Dam! Talk about cheap!!!!!!! I was in shock under twenty dollars. Dinner. Five star awesome. If only lived on the opposite side of town would take advantage of it more often.  =("}
{"text":"Vibe and customer service is always good.   As a Korean, I just can't eat here. The price is good, side dishes are good but the quality and their meat is sub-par to most other Korean bbq places.   For people who are new to kbbq or don't eat Asian food often, you will love it. But for authentic Korean bbq is what you are looking for with good quality meat, I would not eat here."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the service is always really good! Alodia was our server and she was super nice and always kept our water full. Definitely recommend the Cajun calamari, the KFC,and the beef bulgogi.. three best items"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I was with a group of 8 and we all had a good time. The only thing that sucked was that they could only split the bill on three cards, since we were all paying separately. Other than that, definitely recommend!!!"}

{"text":"2nd time here - fast service - good service - great food - a totally unique experience and a super cool vibe - if you've never been, check it out for sure - cough cough first date idea (interactive) cough cough"}
{"text":"A very industrialized food chain! Why am I saying that? Smiles are not seen often at this location. With the amount of people in and out constantly, sometimes they forget to how to employ a good hospitality. My water never got refilled, my waitress works like a robot just come and go for the tasks of the day and nothing else, busboys would try to clean up quickly without asking if I was even finish with my food. Oh I get it! Because there is a line waiting outside and you wouldn't slip that chance of having extra money right? That was my last drawn! Okay, please take my unfinished food and rush me out of the door, oh and also I'm not coming back ever so it doesn't bother me! I will trust my instincts on trying other BBQ house located around Oriental Supermarkets."}
{"text":"Shout out to Seong our sever! He was the best. He was prompt with our service and made us laugh. He also made sure our burner was always changed out and gave us tips for cooking our BBQ. Nothing's better than good food, service, and laughs! Thanks Seong! We will def ask for you next time we are here!"}
{"text":"Sorry I may be too critical here, I'm asian,  my background is 18 years in Tokyo and 2 years in Korea. Normally you are expected to pay atleast $50 per person for a decent Korean style BBQ, so at $19 all-you-can-eat, well you get what you pay for...low quality meat. The place is gorgeous, clean and staff were friendly, but I'm willing to pay extra for a satisfying dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for lunch. Lunch is $14.95 and dinner is $19.95. There are 29 items you can choose from including raw meats to grill at your table (bulgogi, pork belly, chicken, calamari, octopus,etc.).  plus appetizers. The best items were the rice cake in spicy sauce and kfc (korean fried chicken). Now you might be wondering..why 3 stars? Well, the meats were not really marinated that well...the meats tasted as if they were just dipped in the marinating sauce and served to us. Thus, they had little to no flavor. The \"grill\" itself was weak so it did not impart any \"grill\" flavor to any of the raw foods. The fried items tasted way better. I would say this place is good bc of the AYCE cheap price but weak on grilled flavor."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat experience I have ever had, great service only issue is the wait which is which is likely since it is such a good place to dine"}
{"text":"I love this place. However the wait is very long. The price is cheapest out of all other All You Can Eat kbbq and they have way more options. The service is fast. The decorations are nice. Except, I would love if the atmosphere is more quiet. There were some uneducated drunkards who kept yelling when I ate. I know there is a bar but there is no dance floor so shut up and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Great food and very fast and attentive service. I have eaten at one of the California locations before and was very happy to discover this location in Tempe. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. My only complaint is that the music is a bit too loud. It's kinda hard to enjoy a nice conversation with my dining partners. You have a two hour time limit and they will tell you that any extra food left over is subject to a $5 charge. Order what you can finish."}
{"text":"Korean Food is and its flavors are nearly ubiquitous.  Gochujang (spicy, sweet fermented chili paste) can now be found in grocery stores nearly everywhere and even on the shelves at Target.  This savory, earthy, spiced \"condiment\" is the basis of many tasty Korean dishes including the venerable, and healthy, food known as Kimchi and is being incorporated into everything from fine-dining fusion dishes to snack foods.  It is so versatile that it is even used in many Korean marinades and sauces, including some of the tasty meats and sides served at Gen Korean BBQ House.   Rightly so, Korean food is spicy, sweet, savory, crunchy, crispy, salty and full of umami - all things that satiate today's palate.  Combine all of these flavors with the carnal sounds of grilling, the smell of caramelizing meat and the earthy smoke of grilled protein and vegetables over a gas flame, right in front of you, at your table, and you have Korean BBQ.  How do you turn it up a notch?  Make it all you can eat!  How do you catch the attention of the general public and make them want more?  Use quality ingredients; provide prompt, knowledgeable and friendly service in a colorful, comfortable and inviting atmosphere.  The fun of trying new flavors, interacting with, and cooking your own food, creates such a memorable experience that you leave making plans to return before you have even left the parking lot.  Because of its all you can eat nature, ordering off the menu is as simple as choosing four items at a time (typically numbers 1-20 on the lunch menu, 1-24 on the dinner menu) and then choosing as many items in the lower half of the menu as you want.  Gen BBQ does the chopping, dicing, marinating and saucing for you so your order comes from the kitchen quickly, and ready to grill.  Delicious ready-to-eat choices are K.F.C., Goyza, Cajun Chicken and Volcano Chicken.  Essential with every order of uncooked proteins are #25, mushrooms and vegetables, and #28 Jap Chae (Glass Noodles).  Banchan (Kimchi, marinated cucumber, mashed potato, edamame, cabbage slaw, radish, marinated onion) and a green salad (chopped romaine with a sesame soy dressing) included with every meal, are also endless and served immediately after placing your order (sometimes before).  Once your meats are grilled and on your plate, hail your server, ask questions and repeat the process.    You only have two hours to consume all you can . . . do it right, and in no time you will be in your own euphoric protein stupor, rolling out the door, wondering who was the first person to say, \"Hey, Bulgogi and Galbi are so delicious, what if I could eat them, and twenty other Korean favorites, for hours and hours?\"  Apparently, the geniuses that started Gen Korean BBQ House thought this and replicated it over and over.   Fine dining restaurants often call themselves intimate.  Restaurants with a breathtaking view or scenic location call themselves intimate.  Small, quiet, dimly lit restaurants also call themselves intimate.  However, Korean BBQ redefines intimacy because it allows you to interact with your food, tend to it, and cook it just the way you like it.  Dining at Gen Korean BBQ House brings a higher level of appreciation to the food served and seems to elevate the taste and flavors in every bite.  And it does all of this at a reasonable price, in comfortable surroundings, with great service and an experience that never leaves you wanting more.  And yes, there is alcohol and dessert too!  Moderation, is a good thing . . .  sometimes   Overall: 4.7 Quality: 4.6 Service: 4.5 Cleanliness: 5 Value: 4.5 Atmosphere: 4.8"}
{"text":"So this is the second time we came back and been a long time customer. Now they're measuring kids and charging if they're tall for such a young age. My daughter is a tall 4 year old above the average percentile among toddlers. Kids don't eat free anymore due to change of company wide policy. Trust me I've eaten way better kbbq for less of the prices in town. Price gouging the consumer , constant policy changes, service is 2 star, etc. this is the last time we are giving them or business and I'm not recommending or refer to anyone that has a family with you g children look else where to eat."}
{"text":"The best Korean Bbq in Las Vegas so far! The drive and wait was well worth it. The food is amazing. try the red wine marinated pork belly, it is delicious. Service is great they even apologized before we sat down since they are new and the workers are mostly trainee. However the service here was great. Thank you Lisa!"}
{"text":"We came for an early dinner (4pm) and there was still a 20 minute wait. Food was good but service was just ok. My 2 year old was sleep in the stroller but they denied my request to park it next to the table. The place was half empty so there was plenty of room but I had to place him on the floor in a stroller seat that's not meant for such use. Hostess seemed annoyed I even asked. Not great hospitality."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The staff is amazeballs!! Shea and Anthony kept me comfortable and made sure I had everything I needed!"}
{"text":"You have to grill most of your meats on your own. The place can be smoky and when you leave, you'll likely smell like smoky grilled meat. If that's your thing then try this place. Their food is really tasty. They give plenty of sides like in a typical Korean restaurant. The staff is efficient. The restaurant itself is clean and beautiful. Having said that, I usually go out to eat because I'm too tired to cook meals at home. So, this was just too much work for me."}
{"text":"my favorite go-to place for Korean BBQ. the best selection of meats and super quick service! Ozzy was an awesome server! he was really attentive and had the most positive attitude which made our dinner experience even better!"}
{"text":"I live on 95 and Ann but this place is worth the drive, I just went a week ago but I'm already making reservation for tonight!  Pretty good meat quality for AYCE and head-on shrimps are also included. There is also a good amount of cooked appetizers to choose from.  The menu was a little long and confusing but our friendly server, Ozzy, was really helpful when it comes to recommending meat selections."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this past weekend and had a fantastic experience! This Gen is just like all of the other Gens I've been to in California.  This location is BRAND new so everything is pristine.  I love the décor of all Gens.  They've got lovely lights, vases, seating... This Gen in particular had a large projector screen for movies!  I went with a total group of 5 and we showed up before they had even opened - thank goodness we did! There was already a line forming when we got there, and by the time we actually got seated, there was an even longer line! I definitely would recommend getting there early AND making sure your whole party is present.  As previously mentioned, this location is new.  The staff is still training and they're still working out small logistics, so be patient! We had a great waiter, but he was seriously working his butt off (thanks Jackie!) trying to deal with his responsibilities while also helping others.  Despite how crazy it got, the staff was super friendly!  Definitely would recommend checking this place out.  I know I'll be going back again sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying this place out... Being Korean finding good Korean bbq is hard... To be honest the food is good here but the service is fu@$ing horrible. If you work at a Korean restaurant learn the names in Korean and in English.... Today it took them 13mins to get a sprite and so I got so irritated that I asked 3 times and still nothing so I went to the front and said I don't know how far you guys placed your soda fountain it shouldn't take you this long and as the waiter saw me go complain he sped walked over and gave me the Sprite... They never came and checked up on us so whenever we saw them walk pass us we had to quickly order... PS FOR ANYONE WHO NEVER BEEN IF YOU SEE THE SIDE DISH OUT BEFORE YOU SOT ASK FOR A NEW ONE. The table next to us had their side dish out 20m or so before some one sat down. That's disgusting. I will never come back to this place it's a joke"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, good food, reasonable price! Kailin was very attentive. Brisket was awesome. Very clean. And they swipe your card right in front of you."}
{"text":"Made it here 2 times so far. Once on a Monday afternoon and the other on a Friday night. Big change in service.  Food was amazing both times. My favorites are the KFC(to me the sauced one tastes like orange chicken, the one w/o sauce taste very flavorful too), spicy shrimp and beef bulgolgi! Everyone loved the gyoza and the spicy octopus was just a little too spicy.  Monday afternoon, no wait. Our waiter was super attentive but not overly, personable and always came at the right time when we needed refills or to make another order. Perfect service.  Friday night, was told it would be 30 mins-1hr and a half wait but they would text us when a table is available. Luckily it was only a 30 min wait.  Once we get to our table we place our order for drinks and it takes about 20 mins for her to get back with them. We place our 1st order which comes out quickly.   Honestly after that the service went down hill. Each order, refill for drinks or rice and asking for napkins always took more than 10mins for her to do. We would usually be sitting there looking at empty plates and a grill and another server or the manager would come by to ask if we needed anything and we always said yes.   The Friday night service just definitely wasn't a great experience compared to my afternoon one.  After we ate we asked for dessert and the check. The strawberry macaroon ice cream sandwich was delicious.  She comes back 15 mins later with mixed up receipts so she has to go back and fix them.  10 mins after that the hostess gives us our receipts and wishes us a good night.   It just left us feeling a little grumpy in the end when we were there for a birthday."}
{"text":"Great food and they have 'all you can eat'  for about $22. Lots of meat choices for you to select from. What I like to get: spare ribs, skirt steak, brisket."}
{"text":"First time here and our server ALODIA was great!  She took care of us and we had fun.  Food was good and we'll definitely be back and request for her!"}
{"text":"What made my experience so great was made my waiter Ozzy he was the bees knees and couldn't believe how quickly he got all our food even tho we ordered so much and I didn't feel like he judged at all. Will definitely be coming back to see him."}
{"text":"Julian is an awesome server, definitely makes the experience more enjoyable having a server who is on top of it and thoroughly takes care of his guests!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Gen. Our server was Terry amongst many others. Above and beyond service. Drinks filled before I even realized I was almost done. As for the food...fresh and delicious. Pork belly and brisket are my favorite so far. Shrimp are a pain to peel, but very yummy. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This was our first time, but it was better than any other Korean BBQ we've visited. Ozzy was our server and he is fantastic. He was so friendly, upbeat, positive and always attentive. We tried all of the steaks and shrimp and a really good pork steak. I am not too into pork, but it was delicious so it also exceeded my expectations. We will be back! Thanks for making our third Anniversary dinner a success!"}
{"text":"Great service. Unique experience. Will definetly come again. All the meat was delicious."}
{"text":"The interior is very clean and modern, one of my favorite Korean BBQ spots. The food was great. I recommend the beef tongue, beef bulgogi and chicken katsu. I also recommend ordering the K.F.C as one of your appetizers. The service was amazing. Our server Alodia had great communication skills, and was very hospitable. The experience was outstanding."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times. You can't make reservations, but you can wait nearby with text updates to your phone. Dinner time was really busy, but that was pretty soon after they opened. Its all so good, but sometimes they are out of certain items, like spicy rice cakes. Their menus show some items they don't have as well, like macaroons. I guess maybe they could be waiting to introduce their desserts after their staff is more established?"}
{"text":"Service was good and food was fine but it still lacked the attraction of our normally visited Korean bbq location that has more appetizer options and more quality meats. This is a good alternative  on the Westside of town if you don't want to wait in a 1-2 hour line on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service is improving but not quite there yet.  Almost feel that they can't keep up with our table so a lot of time is spent waiting for food or a drink refill."}
{"text":"Moving from SoCal made me miss legit Korean BBQ- so I am so glad Gen opened up! We went for lunch (around noon) on a Thursday. It's $15.99 pp for lunch with a menu of about 39 items (including spicy tofu soup, meats, shrimp, gyoza(potstickers), japchae(rice noodles) and it was great. They do grill changes, have a clubby type ambiance and the food and service are quick."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  If you're looking for a fun dining experience, head to Gen Korean BBQ House!! You pay $24.95 and can eat for up to two hours (last call for food selection is at 10:30, though; so if you want the full two hours, arrive before 8:30). There's 37 different items to choose from, and you can pick up to 4 at a time. There is a grill in the middle of the table surrounded by sides. You can also ask for salad and white rice. The sides are refillable upon request. The Hawaiian chicken and garlic chicken were definitely our favorites. My husband said the steak was great as well.   We also got a surprise when we realized Alex Len from the NBA Phoenix Suns was sitting behind us. After dinner, he got a picture with us!!    If you've never been to a Korean BBQ, make sure you let your server know, and you'll be guided through the process. So to sum it up, if you're in the mood for a fun and delicious dining experience, definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"My second time here and I just love this place ! The food is great and the service is awesome , today our server was ozzy and he was sweet and attentive to my family and me , New fave place! I will definitely recommend to all my friends and family  and coworkers  etc!"}
{"text":"$20 for all-you-can-eat is a steal!! Great service, our server was especially nice (Ozzy)."}
{"text":"I had Alodia as a server and she was amazing! Very friendly and sweet, provided great service"}
{"text":"Finally an Asian restaurant in LV that appears to be clean and with good food! I have to give the location alone 5 stars because it's in Henderson (outside of the Galleria mall) which is in my neck of the woods.  There was quite a bit of a wait our first time but then we learned our lesson the second time and beat the dinner rush on a Friday night by arriving just before 5:45 pm.  Don't let the fact that there are no visible hoods above each table fool ya! It doesn't get holy smokey in there because they've forked the dough on some really super powerful venting system! Now the service, well they are beyond fully staffed and definitely didn't skimp out in this area because we never had to wait for anything. You sit down and BAM!...your sides are there.  There is a waiter who checks on you often and takes your ongoing orders, and another person who clears your table from the plates and changes your grill.  Food...well it's an AYCE dinner for $19.99 which is a heck of a bargain! From the 4 -5 variety of side dishes, rice paper and/or radish paper, appetizer and meat variety...there is quite a selection. We loved the crispy squid legs from the appetizer menu, finding ourselves ordering it throughout the night. The miso pork belly, bulgogi, Cajun shrimp head on, and calamari were are choices which were all equally tasty. Now for dessert they offer a n ice cream macaron for an addition $3.95....and oh so worth it! I had the coffee flavor while the hubby had the green tea.  Definitely a fave in my book!"}
{"text":"Gen Korean BBQ always hits the spot. It's a shame there isn't a location near me. I could be wrong but I think they offer the most items of any AYCE Korean BBQ businesses in the valley. 36 items!!! That's a lot. There's no way I could order 36 items and finish them but I'll give it a try if anyone wants to put some money on it. They have it all sirloin steak, beef and pork bulgogi, short ribs, various pork bellys, brisket, pork chops, chicken, shrimp, calamari, tongue, Korean fried chicken, octopus, intestine, and so on. Just check out their menu. They also have dessert and alcohol but they're extra. Everything is good here the food and the service.   The only knock on them is the music is cranked up way too loud. I get it that's the type of atmosphere they want but at lunch on a weekend you could take it down a little can't you!? I'd be back for sure."}
{"text":"I dont know if we truly took full advantage of the all-you-eat aspect but we were so full by the end of this experience! And more soju please!  Meat, meat and more meat is the best way to describe it.  And it just keeps coming if you want it to.  What amazed me the most is how this lump of unassuming raw meat with out much sauce turned into something super juicy and flavorful right before our eyes.  BUT IT WAS ALOT OF WORK.  The grilling on your own concept kinda sucks here though.  We go out cause we dont wanna cook.  Call it lazy but its really just preference.  Plus something about cooking your own $50+ meal seems absurd.  One note...if you order the volcano chicken prepare to sweat...you've been warned."}
{"text":"The king of Korean bbq's has finally come to Vegas, and it doesn't disappoint. Their menu has a large selection of 32 different types of meat, 29 if you're stopping by for lunch. My personal favorite on their menu was number 10, their premium marinated steak.  One thing this gen lacks though in comparison to the California locations is the infamous rice paper due to it being a Las Vegas health code violation. But I didn't complain, I never ate the rice paper anyways. What I was disappointed in it missing though was the rib fingers (meat between the ribs), and the daikon radish.  But despite that, gen still packs a punch in the gut, a good one that is! Their appetizer menu will keep you plenty satisfied in between main course orders and their selection is pretty large, unfortunately the seasoned fries, popcorn shrimp, and calamari are usually the first to go so I've yet to try myself. Wait times can take up to an hour, and the room occupancy is slightly smaller than their California counter parts, but still an hour wait beats the 120 min wait I've endured in the oc and rancho locations.. So be ready ahead of time.  Over all though, nothing beats a $20 all you can eat premium Korean bbq. Just be sure to clear out your schedule if you plan on going because you'll need it open for the food coma recovery!"}
{"text":"This is legitimately the best dining experience I've ever had. The food was amazing and everything on the menu has impressed me. Our server Tau was the most personable and accommodating waiter I've ever had. I definitely plan on making this a must stop destination on all of my future visits to the Vegas area"}
{"text":"We love Korean food and Gen Korean BBQ restaurant is one place that can definitely satisfy one's craving. Food was great and they serve  a lot of side dishes :) our server, Jaenica, was very informative and fast. We had our food served in a timely manner. She is an asset to this establishment. Thanks, for a great service, Gen! We will definitely be back. Soon"}
{"text":"I was so excited that Gen was finally coming to the Phoenix area. I'm sad that I have leave a bad review. From the time we walked in to when we sat down and ate. It was a terrible experience.  I was with a semi large party and we wanted to be courteous and let them know that we had a large party coming in. As soon as we told them that and our party was enroute to meet us, they just kept telling us that they had to break our group up and that they wouldn't be able to seat us together. We ended up waiting an hour until we were seated.  Once we were seated, our waitress brought us some meats to cook and she would come back periodically to check on us. Then for about 15 minutes she was gone. We had track down someone to find her. I guess she was on break and someone who was filling in for us, put in our order for meat. After that, my sister asked him where the restroom was and he pointed in the direction and after that he says to my sister \"This was a mistake taking this section.\" And he proceeds to walk away...we found that to be rude and unprofessional to tell your customer you feel it was a mistake to take that section."}
{"text":"Tonight was my boyfriend and I's first time at Gen. We finally had a day off together for us to go on a date. To start off I went to the register to get a table, but when I went up the host and the two servers ignored me and proceeded with what they were doing. Fine, I understand it was busy, but they could have said \"we will be with you in a moment\", but they acknowledged me without saying a word. To keep this review somewhat short the waiter (he had a pony tail and glasses) forgot half of our order and we had to constantly remind him to bring our food. After we finished our first order we were ready to place another, but when we looked over the waiter was on his phone. We were left without food for a good 20 minutes, my boyfriend got so upset that he spoke with the assistant manager (Bryan); he did offer to only charge us for one person but when the check came he charged us for two. Apparently the server was off, but he didn't let us know, and we had to order from the busser that was clueless on what the restaurant served. We also asked another server if they had a certain soup and he said \"I don't know\" and just walked away. Honestly if we didn't say anything I think we would have been left at our table without service and food. In the end my boyfriend had to ask for a refund since we basically didn't eat anything. I expected a lot from this restaurant since they are extremely popular in L.A."}
{"text":"AMAZING 5 star service!!!  Every waiter was so nice to us! It was our last night at vegas and we decided to try this place out and im so glad we did!!  Theyre very quick and efficient when it comes to assisting you. You dont need to ask theyll immediately come to your attention. Honestly in NY its rare we get waiters this nice to us so it was definitely a shock at how great this place is!"}
{"text":"Hmm. So sad. I had a friend growing up that we dined on this style of cooking at the dinner table and it was AMAZING. I was really excited to share this with my husband as something different and what I hoped would be as great as what I had as a teen.   Umm yeah. Our first server was terrible. At the beginning, I asked how it worked (since we had not been here before) and she didn't explain anything other than it is all you can eat, but make sure you read the clauses at the bottom of the page on the menu. Didn't explain the 4 random dishes sitting on the table already, how it works, etc. Whatever. I asked for soy for my hubby, and she looked at me like I was insane. SOY? WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY??? What Kind of establishment do you think we run here? You have some, well you have a sauce, that isn't soy, it's slightly sweeter, but there ya go. Fortunately, we were taken over by a new server after our initial order. We did manage to get some soy too.   Food- It was sad. Maybe we hit an off day, or maybe it just is crap, but the quality is nothing. The pre-cooked things were all either overcooked, hard, or stale. Nothing was fresh. Nothing. Second note, if you get the marinated shrimp, ask them if there is a technique to get the shells and heads off without totally getting it everywhere. I had no such luck and had so much gunk all over my hands trying to get it apart. UGH. There was no flavor to anything. It just had no redeeming quality, aside from our second server, the bussers, and cooktop swapper were all incredible friendly and nice. We tried almost everything, and I can't say I would try any of it again. 2 stars just because it is all you can eat (again, read the clause on the menu....and note they have cameras on the facility...in case you were thinking of slipping some chewing calamari or cow tongue in your purse to avoid being charged extra for it) , service was nice, and the process is fun.   Won't be back. ever. Love the concept, hate the execution."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of six adults, two babies, and one toddler. We couldn't fit at one table so they split us up with two booths next to each other which is fine. The decor is very spacious, modern, sleek, and with the blue neon lighting throughout the restaurant, it has a trendy, loungey feel to it. They also had a big screen and they were showing college football. We came here right when they opened at 11 a.m. on a Sunday. Since this restaurant is new and popular, we didn't want to wait an hour. We turned out to be right because people started coming in and they got busy with people waiting.  They charge the $19.99 dinner price for lunches on weekends. $14.99 for lunch on M-F. Dinner is $19.99 everyday. You can order four apps and meats at a time. The servings are small. Some people have complained about the portion size but I actually like it. That way, I can try more things and I tend to be a greedy KBBQ eater. I order too much sometimes. They were out of a few apps that day which I wanted to try. Out of the apps, I liked their sesame chicken the best. Their kimchi is really good too. I find that if I like the kimchi a restaurant serves, I usually end up liking the food as well.  We ordered beef brisket, Cajun shrimp, galbisal, miso pork belly, beef tongue, chicken bulgogi, and beef short rib plate. We repeated some of the orders. I like the galbisal the best. I liked the seasoning on the Cajun shrimp but it was too much work peeling the shrimp. I rarely get chicken because it takes too long to cook and I'd rather eat red meat. We only ordered it because my friend's kid likes chicken.   We received VIP service. Our waters were constantly refilled, our grills were changed 6-7 times, got more banchan, and the servers checked up on us often. The cons: no gyeran jjim (steamed egg), doenjang chigae (fermented soybean soup) and no dduk bo ssam (rice wrappers). Also, I'm not a fan of their grills. They don't have an overhead hood system. The grill burned too quickly and it needed to be constantly changed. However, you don't leave with that terrible KBBQ smell on you so I like that part.  I haven't been to the CA location but looking at the pictures, their portions seem larger and they offer more items. I'll have to visit one of the CA locations to compare one of these days. Other than the lack of some KBBQ staples and the grill burning too quickly, it's a pretty good deal to satisfy your KBBQ fix. I felt so fat and satiated after."}
{"text":"Gen in vegas a must try! The food and service was great. Lisa was amazing. It was a very short wait and the staff was very helpful introducing the different types of meats to try. My favorite is the mashed potatoes as the side dish"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Korean bbq place in the valley. They have a large variety of food and the place is massive. The beef tongue and Galbi are one of my faves. They have this volcano chicken but be careful its super spicy but suoer flavorful."}
{"text":"This place looks so cute. Quite a different interior than what I'm use to here in Vegas :) they have the white rice paper here & a wide variety of meats  &... Service was fast & amazing! Ask for Ozzy to help you out!"}
{"text":"The food came out fast and was delicious! Will come back again! Our server, Yuna, did an amazing job tending to my group of 5 and surrounding tables. We constantly bugged her for potatoes and our orders, and she smiled and laughed with us every time. She was amazing and I bet the other servers are as well."}
{"text":"Finally, the popular California chain is in AZ.  Unfortunately, there's a 2hr+ wait if you go after 5pm on any day of week.  If you have a large party then good luck...they only have high tops that fit large parties and no kids are allowed at those.  Otherwise, you will have to wait for two booths (sits 5-6 people each) next to or across from each other to open up simultaneously.  Good thing is they will text you when table is ready so you could go early and put name on waitlist then go shop around Tempe Marketplace.  Once you get in, all the wait will be redeemed with limitless meat for $24.99 ($15.99 only for weekday lunch!).  I like that they offer all meats for one price unlike some kbbq's that have different tiers of pricing and quality. Meats are mostly good quality with the pork belly being AMAZING and best I've ever had!  Kalbi also better than other places and their premium steak is great too.  The one thing Gen has that others don't is the thin rice paper to wrap your meat.  I was excited that they had radish wraps but was weirded out by odd taste thats unlike the pickled radish wraps I've had.  The meat comes out fast and they frequently change your grill.  Overall, good service once you get in but not a super kid-friendly environment with the club scene lighting and loud hip hop music.  It is still fun all around!"}
{"text":"I have been here over and over and it never disappoints. Large variety of meat options with delicious sides. The staff is attentive and keep the food coming. can get very busy! They do not take reservations so careful with big groups."}
{"text":"Had many AYCE korean BBQs in LA. this place is good!  So happy to have a good korean BBQ place in henderson."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service...the server Yuhao was amazing!!! Speedy and timely service and excellent atmosphere. I can't imagine a better place for Henderson Korean BBQ. Love it and will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am amazed at this place. Food quality was very good. Service was the best. Our server Alodia(6 stars) did a fantastic job of taking care of us. She make sure we enjoy our meal. The price for lunch was $14.99 which is insane. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is NOT family friendly. They do not have a menu for children who do not want to eat the all-you-can-eat menu. Turns out they charge by height! My 8 year old only wanted rice a few pieces of chicken and I was charged Full Price. I asked why could I not pay the  kids price, they said he is to tall. If your child is taller than 50\" they pay the adult price. There was no discussion from management about the price. Do not take you family there, go to any other Korean BBQ you can find but avoid this place."}
{"text":"What is this nonsense?! No rice paper! My pregnant wife literally cried! You suck gen in the galleria. But I still love your pork belly"}
{"text":"The meat quality is very good for an all you can eat restaurant. The service was amazing, especially our server Jessica who was very friendly and made sure our drinks were getting refilled. You definitely won't leave hungry here."}
{"text":"I must say this is thus far the best kbbq I have had in Las Vegas! Anyone who's looking for a Kbbq experience this is the place to go even though it's on the other side of the town but it's worth it!  First of all hands down for our our waitress! She was amazing and very attentive! Unfortunately I forgot her name but I have never had that much attentive server experience at a kbbq restaurant. Not just our assigned waitress but also the other waitress and servers as well. For AYCE lunch is 15.99$ and Dinner is 20.00$ Which is way cheaper than the Kbbq establishments in Spring Mountain.   We waited couple of minutes to be seated because the restaurant was packed that night but we never had to wait that long for our food. Our waitress and our hostess told us we have two hours for AYCE to finish and cannot leave extra meat un eaten and we will be charged (just like all other AYCE places) We ordered AYCE of everything beef. Although it was on the menu, they did not have beef belly servings that night. We also ordered yogurt soju and man it was so yummy and sweet just like we wanted it! Unfortunately we were so full we did not prefer any desert."}
{"text":"His place is fenomenal! The atmosphere and decorations are relaxing and modern. All you can eat meat for Lunch and Dinner. 2hr max I believe until you have to leave. Their servers are super nice and every slice of meat is delicious. Also their ice cream macrons are to die for!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong when you get KBBQ at Gen.  Gen was always my go to spot for KBBQ in Cali and am really happy they have tin Vegas.  I came here on a Thursday night it was pretty packed but still took less than 10 min. To get seat for 2.  I do suggest making reservations for parties of 4 or more.  Inside is really nice, they have TV's to enjoy the game, and a bar if you wanna grab an alcoholic beverage."}
{"text":"Dining at Gen Korean BBQ was by complete accident today and was very hesitant at first since it was located in a mall as well as an all you can't eat place, but after caving into the love of my life...all I can say is wow, this place is awesome and the flavoring was perfect not to mention we had a great server named David from Hawaii. So make sure you ask for him, he was hustling and bustling and ensuring that we were happy as well as his other customers.   I'm definitely picky when it comes to food, so make sure you try this place out. My favorite dish was the Gen Beef Bulgogi (sweet one) and their side appetizers of different kimchi. The disappointment was that there were no short ribs with the bone, but if you like it without the bone then you've come to the right place. This was my first and definitely not last time to dine here.   Last note, it's hard to find this place if your looking at the galleria mall map. So the best way to get here is to go up the escalator to the second level next to Larsen's at the main entrance area before you enter into the mall.   Enjoy and eat up!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Gen in the LA area and they are all the same. Great experience, super fast service, high quality, and all you can eat. Now if you have never been to an all you can eat Korean BBQ listen up..... Don't eat the sides (they are wonderful, but you're here for the meat) on your list should be beef bulgogi and spicy pork belly and throw a dart for anything else and you'll do fine. The staff is amazing very knowledgeable, great overall experience."}
{"text":"The venue is beautiful. The set up is really nice. Seating took a little long for the amount of empty tables there were but overall, the service was good. Food was great quality. Well worth the dinner price of $21.99 per adult."}
{"text":"I finally found the best all you can eat Korean BBQ in AZ. The service and food are quick and great. My friends and I dined in last night, there are 6 of us at first we were informed that we have to wait for an hour, but it turns out that we got table quicker that the est(like 15 mins wait). As soon as we sat down we began to put in order and it come out very quick!!! Gen's become my new favorite Korean restaurant, I'll definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a weeknight. The girls up front were friendly and welcoming. The wait for 2 people to get seated was about 15 minutes and we received a text message when our table was ready.   We were seated at one of the high top communal tables. If we were there with a group it would have been fine, but as a couple seated next to another couple it felt awkward and tight. The music was pretty loud as well.   Our server was ok to begin with, but as our meal went on it got harder to get a hold of him. When we did get a hold of him, he seemed a bit befuddled. It also took a while to get orders delivered to the table. I've never been to a Korean BBQ joint where we had nothing on the grill for longer than 5 min. tops. Here we waited about 15-20 min.   The plain brisket, pork, and roast beef were good, however I would advise against the marinated meats. The macaron ice cream was tasty and the perfect size. The price for dinner was comparable to other places around town, but there's really nothing that made us want to come back."}
{"text":"Caylin was bad ass! Better than every other server there!! Best server I've ever had at Gen!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality meat served with wide variety. The meats had very little fat on them so you could tell the meat was prepared well. The various meats were excellent like the pork belly garlic, the premium pork belly, and would highly recommend the red wine pork belly. Ozzy was our server and was on point. They were courteous and was excellent in service and would love to have him again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! For all the food you can get, $20 is really cheap! In some other KBBQ places that aren't ayce, you'll easily spend that on one meat. The food is really good. The spicy pork bulgogi is my favorite. The service is great too! Kailin is really sweet! She made great recommendations and had answers to all our questions. She's also really attentive."}
{"text":"Went last night which was a Friday night around 7 and were told of a hour and a half to 2 hour wait time (didnt matter the party size because we were only 3 and that same time was quoted for a group of 7 and 10). Well we did it and it was totally worth it. The staff is all so attentive in checking on you during dinner and we had a blast cooking the meat. The beef tongue and Hawaiian pork belly were some of our faves but honestly all the meat was wonderfully seasoned and so juicy. My son loved the KFC which is already fried up when it comes to the table. 2 hours is the time you get to eat/cook and we used almost all of it to just rest in between cooking more meat. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First, I'll begin by stating that I'm from LA and have also lived in OC, and I've also been to Seoul, so my standard for kbbq is pretty damn high. To be fair, I'm not going to compare this place to my spots in Cali because Gen doesn't stand a chance for many reasons. On that note, I think it's common knowledge that the kbbq scene in Las Vegas is pretty weak and leaves much to be desired. Sorry, but it's true.  Enter Gen House. First impression: Ohh my my my.. The atmosphere is definitely chic, like something you should come to expect for a kbbq spot in Las Vegas (I know it's in Henderson, but whatever). Gen is centrally located in a mall, so parking is of no issue. Waiting in line, however, can be sporadic, much like most kbbq places.  Like I said earlier, I can't compare this place with my spots in Cali, but I can, however, compare the service. Enter Jaenica (heart and music note). She was simply amazing; I couldn't ask for a better server. Seriously, she's the best, I can't emphasize that enough. She catered to our needs very quickly and was very entertaining to talk to--cute, too.  There's nothing much to say as far as the food goes, other than that it was pretty standard for what you would expect for a ayce kbbq. Nonetheless, I do have two gripes: kimchi and bean sprouts. I don't even know where to begin, but of all the sides, kimchi reigns supreme and should not be compromised. The ones we got were watery and were mainly the rooted end of the cabbage--very disappointing. On the other hand, the bean sprouts, second in line to the throne, is missing in action! Where are my bean sprouts?! Seriously, Gen, get it together.  All things considered, I definitely recommend this place for your ayce kbbq needs. This is the spot in Vegas, hands down, no doubt about it. Still in all, I'm inclined to give Gen only 3 stars because of the kimchi and bean sprouts ordeal. I know I sound like I'm nitpicking, but these are Korean staples, so add more love in the kimchi and bring on the bean sprouts! But to sum it up, this place deserves 4 stars since Jaenica made such a great impression on me with her outstanding service and witty humor. I shall return--bookmarked."}
{"text":"Having lunch with my girlfriend today. She said we should try out Gen. I hesitantly said Sure... Walking in, I already had a biased opinion formed due to my terrible experience at their TUSTIN location. I can't say I had a better experience this time around either.  I understand this is a pretty new location but the kids all seemed young an inexperienced.  They also need to step up their banchan portion game! This was also an issue at the Tustin location. I asked for extra kimchi. They bring the little thing with TWO pieces in it. TWO! I was like Oh gee. Can I have a BIG BOWL of kimchi please, perhaps with MORE than TWO pieces in it? Thaaaaanks! I mean, seriously. Wtf. Banchan + Korean BBQ go hand in hand! Especially kimchi! What the damn hell! Besides, the more I ask you for something, the more annoying it is for BOTH of us. I am an unhappy guest with no kimchi and you are an unhappy employee who had to keep going back and forth to bring me said kimchi! How bout just a niiiiice portion size to keep your guests satisfied?? They have little banchan anyway, meaning not much variety, as well as TINY portions.  They didn't have rice paper. They didn't automatically give you garlic and jalapeños.  They do have appetizers you can order which is different and they also have some lunch box options which is nice too. That's about the only positive thing i can say. Oh and thank you RICHARD for changing our charred grill. Even tho we were pretty much done eating it was still nice of him!  We only had the beef brisket, premium pork belly and spicy pork. It was all pretty MEH.  The banchan was pretty mediocre as well.  This is the third and LAST time I will ever waste my time, money, and calories at any GEN restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Very lovely interior & clean. Food is tasty, we enjoyed the wide selection. Upbeat, current playlist. The servers were polite. If I have any critiques, the consistency of service. My guest and I along w the people we sat next to were waiting for sometime before we were asked for our orders or refill of our drinks.  But Jaenica (heart)(musicnote) went above and beyond to make sure that was changed, and that we were well taken care of for the rest of the time she noticed  the mishap. Will def eat here again."}
{"text":"Really awesome barbecue; pretty much all I can say is \"holy crap.\" After living a year in Japan and eating (and loving) the barbecue there, I wasn't sure any other barbecue would meet my standards, but Gen blew me away. Seriously, for this much food, my fiancé and I probably spent $90+ in Japan to eat the same amount with the same quality. Arizonans, I hope you take advantage of this deal! So happy to have Gen around!"}
{"text":"First time at Gen Korean BBQ ever and it is wonderful. All the servers are kind and fast. They check up every so often to make sure everything is going well and if we need any more orders. Yuhao our server seemed to appear whenever we needed anything.   The place is well lit and great for groups. They have a great selection of meats and appetizers for their all you can eat. Would definitely recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Went for lunch ($16.99) today around 2pm. It wasn't busy and we only waited less than 5mins in the line and waited another few mins for the foods to come out. Staff are friendly and accommodating. They let you know everything you need to know if its your first time in Gen's (stuff like; not allowing discovery card, a 2 hour time limit, and charge of $5 if you did not finished everything you ordered...etc). **They do not allow unfinished foods for take outs since it is a All-You-Can-Eat Restaurant.  NOTE: foods quantity are given in small portion but nothing to worry about, you can just reorder until your tummy is satisfied.   RECOMMENDATION: Grab a Macaroon Ice Cream before you go. Its not part of AYCE though, but $3.50 is worth it."}
{"text":"Visited with my family (wife+2 kids 12/10yrs) on Wed 9/13  Tried Bulgogi, Kalbi, spicy Octopus, pork belly.  All were very good.  Side dishes are just ok.  Tried Japchae and tofu dish.  Just ok as well.  Did not see steamed egg dish.  If you ever go to a decent LA all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place, it's just like that.  $25pp for dinner.  $10 for kids.  Now this would be the best Korean BBQ in Phoenix area.  Don't have alcohol license yet.  Should have soon.  Service vary a bit.  When not busy, excellent and fast service.  Got a bit worse as the restaurant got packed.  Still working out the kinks.  Extremely busy restaurant.  Walked in at 6 and sat down right away.  At 7pm, wait becomes ~1hr.    Weekend here is going to be a mad zoo at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Another great experience for a late lunch Sunday.  The staff were great as always. Can't wait to come back with friends and/or family in the near future"}
{"text":"Loved it! Went there last night and although it was like almost 2 your wait time, was totally worth it.   They offer all you can eat bbq for $24.99 per person and this includes about 40 different meat items. We do not eat pork so this limited some of the menu items that we could try but loved everything we tried. My favorite was the bulgogi and my husband loved the prime steak.   The service is also exceptional. Our server was very attentive, kept changing out the grill when needed and prompt at bringing out the meats. Great restaurant to go to if you like Korean bbq. Bring an appetite!!"}
{"text":"Service is very slow, waiters need to get their act up. We only got 4 sides as they only had those, what the hell. The meats are ok had better. And top if all off they have no dessert, nothing, not even coffee. Let's see if this place latest, I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"I love Shea!!!! She was great! Helped us and put up with our antics! Definitely a spot to go to!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Best Korean Bbq! Plus it's an all you can eat. I would love to go here again! Great service too"}
{"text":"Fresh food, fast service. 32 choices during dinner service. Very reasonable price. Excellent cuts of meat, which is a plus considering other places have frozen beef. Gen steak is a definite must. Korean fried chicken is boneless with sweet and sour sauce. Upgraded version of orange chicken. Will return here very soon. Thanks Gen for providing excellent customer service and quality food to us."}
{"text":"I come here about once a month since it's opening. This is by far the best experience I've had yet. I had Ozzy as a server and he was amazing. He was triple seated and still got our refills and orders in a timely manner. If he was swamped he didn't show it because his demeanor and attitude made it seem like we were the only table he had. This experience wouldn't of been this great if we had another server"}
{"text":"I really had a great experience here. All you can eat for lunch is only $14,99, and you can eat all you want to. My friends and I ordered a lot of meats and appetizers. Those were all amazing. I really recommend this place. It is a ideal place for people to hang out with friends and families."}
{"text":"Average quality of meats, Good service, seasonings are a bit strong."}
{"text":"These guys are still working out some kinks but definitely a great addition to Henderson.Try it!"}
{"text":"Great food and environment. Great service at an affordable price. Took my daughter because she loves Korean BBQ AND THIS PLACE WAS PERFECT."}
{"text":"My friends/co-workers have been raving about this place so I thought it might be worth the drive out to Henderson to try it out... And I'm glad we did! When we arrived the hostess told us it was going to be a 45 minute wait. But we only waited 20minutes upon being seated.  Everything here is amazing. The service, food , ambiance. There wasn't one thing I ate that disappointed me.  We ordered almost everything on the menu so I can't go through everything. But let me just tell you, YOU CAN GO WRONG WITH ANYTHING! But the items that stood out to me was the \"roast beef\", kalbi, and the Cajun shrimp! (Cajun shrimp is spicy, juicy, just mouthwatering burst of flavor!)   At the end we got a green tea macaroon And coffee macaroon ice cream. Although it was BRICK hard when it was served to us, we let it sit on a plate ONTOP of the warm stovetop to let it thaw out for 5minutes. It was a perfect ending to our dinner.   I will be back!!! Even though it's a long ass drive.. It's totally worth the drive and wait!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. We went there for lunch last week. Food was ok, the meats lacked flavor. Thats my only complain about this place otherwise service was great. Servers kept making sure we were ok. The last time i was here they had the fried calamari which was so delicious but now its a discontinued item."}
{"text":"So delicious! My boyfriend and I ran out of ideas for good food places open late, so we consulted Yelp. The 5 star reviews are all on point. We stuffed our faces with so many choices on the all-you-can-eat menu, and appreciated the help from staff on crowd favorites and best methods for cooking this or that (octopus?! Yums.). We especially liked the glass noodles, pork belly and strawberry rice wine, but literally everything we tried was great. Great location and really nice staff."}
{"text":"Quality of meat is good, assorted prepared appetizers are nice as well. The newer style venting is much better than the traditional hood over the grill. Service and atmosphere are all a step above other Korean BBQ places. The price of $20 for dinner is much better than other places especially considering the quality of food. The reason for the one star rating......I witnessed an employee leaving the bathroom stall doing #2 (not the urinal) and not washing his hands. Not sure if I'll be able to eat there again it's a shame because they are clearly the best overall kbbq place in Vegas, and they allow single diners."}
{"text":"Compare to the last visit I had here, I will take off one star for the service. The food was delicious for a $19.95 ayce. Seasoned just right and they have more than just meat options also included seafoods. Most disappointed thing was the house steak. No flavor at all. Make sure to always get the bulgogi options! Service was decent! I was absolutely happy when I got seated right away, only upset thing is that it's so hard to get the servers attention & they barely come to check on you. Out of the 60 mins I spent there, our server came check on me \"once\" I get it ur busy but it's a little unacceptable if you got more than over 20 servers the whole store.  The seating arrangements are weird. We were set to sit next 2 another couple that has already been there. And it' were so uncomfortable bc we absolutely could hear everything the other couple said to eachother. Other than that, weren't all that bad! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Super good !  Took my girl on a date here and we never pick up our phones and took time away from each other.  Gotta try the KFC chicken!  Pork belly ! Steaks are incredible"}
{"text":"My family enjoys coming here. My boys love having the chance to cook for mom and dad. We pretty much know which meats are our favorites, so that is what we'll order each time.   My 2 year old daughter isn't much of a meat eater yet but she love the Japchae noodles. I enjoy eating my meats with a little bit of the salt and sauce they give you on the side. Macaron ice cream sammies at the end are a must!  Service is great with the exception of when our food and orders arrives at our table. Especially during a bigger party. Tonight there were 9 of us because we were celebrating some festivities. We had 3 grills. I was so annoyed when they'd bring our meats, appetizers and even drinks out. They'd just place them anywhere on the table and my family has to figure out amongst ourselves what is what and where/who they belong to.   There's gotta be a better system about who ordered what on the table. Just because I order a cut of meat, doesn't mean I'm going to know that it is what you brought out especially if you just placed it at the other end of the table. Same with our drinks, which should be the easiest thing for them to do."}
{"text":"I stopped by Gen on the evening of 07/19, around 10pm, with a party of 5, but 1 of my party, my sister, was there not going to eat. She had already eaten at Gen about an hour ago. The waiter even recognize her and he said \"back so soon?\"  I informed the host that she had just ate Gen and she was accompanying a different party. The female host in the white blouse stated she would try to accommodate us. But after she  briefly spoke with management, they stated their policy was to charge everyone at the sitting table. I think that is a bit inconsiderate when there are 4 potential customers willing to eat at the establishment.   We left and went to a different AYCE KBBQ called Arirang, which had extremely better service and minimum wait times. They had also accommodated all 5 of us, but minus 1, because my sister was not eating. Their gyoza taste 10x better than Gen as well.    I think im going to stop supporting this corporate/franchise KBBQ from now and stick with the locals."}
{"text":"After the first order, the 7-8 waiters basically ignored a group of 9 people sitting basically in the middle of restaurant. Isn't that amazing? The better part is that basically all our waters were empty and we had people glance over, but didn't even acknowledge our existence. It took 20 minutes for us to even get the check after we finished eating, all clearly waiting for a single waiter to ask if we wanted the check. Simply. Amazing. Forced gratuity for service that wasn't present is psychologically mind breaking."}
{"text":"Love this place! It was pretty busy but we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. Ozzy was great at making sure we had everything we needed and I was very happy to have all the kimchi I wanted.  All of the meat choices were excellent and were brought out in a timely manner. Cant wait to come back and eat some more!"}
{"text":"First let me say how excited I am that there is Korean BBQ on this side of town. Absolutely pumped. We've been twice already since it opened. The service was really good the first time, and kinda shotty the second time. It was a little slow, but if you order enough each round, you typically have no problem flagging someone down before your food is gone. I also felt like I needed to ask for every little thing (rice, lettuce, sides, etc.) and they were way less busy the second time so I'm not sure what was going on. There are also a ton of options and variety which is great (wish they had 1 or 2 more veggie options). They will gladly let you switch your grill top or you can ask for oil if the grill top starts to make everything taste burnt due to older food sticking on it. Highly recommend this to anyone who lives on this side of town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go with my gf. Their service is A1 and I'm not talking about the sauce. As we walk in we get welcomed with \"Welcome to Gen\" each time. As soon as we order our food they bring it to us within a minute or two. Food is great as well. We usually get the Hawaiian steak, the brisket, the kfc, and the premium steak. Only one thing I do recommend is for them to have a bigger variety in dessert but besides that the place is 10/10."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 stars.  My rating is based solely on one major gripe about the restaurant is the water.  For some reason the water we were serve had a soapy and chemical taste to it.  Even after new water it still taste the same.  I ask our server if it was a common compliant and was told because it's the Tempe water sucks.  So assuming they serve tap water and you have had others complain about it. Invest in some filters then.  But overall everything else was on point.  Good food, clean, and awesome grill change outs when needed."}
{"text":"Our first time here and I was a bit lost but Kailin helped us. We will be back!! Food was delicious plus great waitstress was a plus."}
{"text":"No short rib at a all you can eat option. The meat isn't marinaded well. Not a lot of sauces on the side for the meat either. The portion sizes are pretty small. There are a lot of better options in Vegas. The service wasn't great either. So probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Food was great. The large food portions can serve two people on one order. The staff is extremely friendly and the prices aren't bad. I recommend Gen for anyone who has never tried Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Nice all you can eat Korean BBQ house. Modern decor and plenty of seating. Our party of 7 met today to celebrate Father's Day and enjoy some good food. My first time to Gen Korean, overall good food but I guess I'm spoiled by Hobak and others that cook the meat for you and also provide dessert in the price of the meal.   Most of the bon shon were good and the waiter was quick to replace any empty bowls and favorites we had. We enjoyed some bulgogi marinated meat 4/5, octopus 4/5, shrimp 4/5, brisket 4/5, and strip steak 5/5. Additionally we had some volcano chicken, extremely spicy but still good flavor.   Overall a good meal and nice time spent with family. Unsure if we would come back, but nice to try."}
{"text":"My mother, my three friends and I went yesterday for the $24.99 all you can eat special and let me tell you, they surpassed our expectations! I see people on here complaining about servers not explaining how long to cook items, well it's not rocket science to know when something is cooked. Plus, all the meats are thinly sliced and cook within a minute or two. Honestly, it's common sense. Someone else also mentioned on here that they were annoyed the grills had to be swapped. Really!? Some of their meats are marinated in sweet sauces so if you think about it, of course the grill will start to char as sugar caramelizes and as a courtesy they swap it out with a clean grill. Without asking our waiter came and changed ours (about two or three different times to be exact cause we ordered a lot lol) and every time it heated up very quickly and we resumed our cooking. This place gives you two hours to eat all you want and let me tell you two hours is more then enough. Our drinks were always full and the server kept checking on us to see if there was something else we wanted to order or try. Put it this way, we enjoyed Gen's so much my mother and I went back today for lunch along with my aunt and cousin. They were very impressed and we all talked about our wonderful new experience the whole ride home. This place is AMAZING! Anyone on here complaining is overly picky, impatient, and/or have a predisposition to be negative. I will be coming back to this establishment very soon. Maybe even again tomorrow lol!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great quality of meat, variety. Favorite Korean BBQ place already. Ozzy ozzy ozzy oi oi oi! He was great :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service every time I come here with my group of friends.   Lunch prices are a little cheaper so we make it a point to go around 11am-3pm ($16); dinner is ($21).   Order the KFC Appetizer, Jap Chae glass noodles, and gyoza to start. I normally order two or more orders of the KFC because it's just that delicious! We've recently switched from white rice to rice paper which helps us save some room for more meats. You should try it!   Red wine pork belly, Gen signature steak, spicy pork bulgogi, and lots and lot and lots of Gen Chadol which is the brisket. We order all those over and over again till we're full!   They also come with sides that are already available at the table upon sitting down. I usually only eat the fish cake, sweet potato and kimchie. The rest I kinda just push aside. They're kind enough to get me some more of my favorite sides if they see you run out.   You can also ask them to change your grill when you feel like it's a little gross from all the cooking. They'll gladly do it for you. This place always has a good amount of staff working and will always have people constantly checking on you throughout your meal.   Aura of the place is nice. My BF especially likes the old school songs they play in the background.   Will always be back!"}
{"text":"The staff totally made the experience at this BBQ house. Often if you try to visit a Korean BBQ spot the food takes a little while to come out, drinks aren't refilled as frequently etc.   Not the case here!  Their staff was on point just as much as their food. From the moment we sat down until the moment we left we were constantly checked in on, brought refills, etc. they even provided excellent suggestions based on what we shared we enjoyed off the menu.   You can't go wrong making this a night out. For first timers it is an all you can eat deal for $25 per person. But they aren't kidding when they say you get all you can eat. Whatever you want to try they will bring you. We didn't shy from the beef tongue or intestines.  Tongue was a much easier texture for me. My very favorite was (no surprise) the pork bulgogi.   Fun. Yummy. Great service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and fun experience! Great service! Wonderful service, I can't say that enough!!! They were on top of the drinks, clearing dishes, letting us order more food. I thought they might stall a bit since there is a time limit on how long you can stay but they helped us get our moneys worth in the time we had!   Go early, or be prepared for a wait, but it's worth it! I would suggest going with a group of 4 or more so that you can split the meat and have a better experience trying more things.  The salad they bring with the meal was one of my favorite dishes, so delicious.  As for the meats, you order meat after meat after meat until you have the meat sweats. I would suggest clearing you calendar for the next 6 hours so you can have time to digest and enjoy the euphoria! :)"}
{"text":"It was awesome!!  A bit on the pricey side BUT you definitely get what you pay for!  The only thing bad about the place is that the water is terrible.  It is not really their fault.  Tempe water in general is very bad.  They could get some kind of filtration system I guess, but it is still not worth knocking them down a star.  We went for Sunday lunch and had to wait about 50 minutes to get seated because they were so busy.  They were up front about it though, which is why I still give them 5 stars.  Also, on the weekends, it is about $25 per person because the lunch menu is only during the week for about $17.  Overall it is really good and you don't feel rushed or anything."}
{"text":"So freaking good! Never been to a place like this before and it was amazing! Our waiter was awesome! He was so funny and joked around with our group since we are a little crazy he made it vwry enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for a seat. When they were ready they told us to wait even longer with no where to really wait. Adults are $25 bucks a piece! Then they said bring ur daughter here so I can measure her on the wall, so she measures the height of my 2 year old little girl like she's at the damn drs office and said that will be $10. I was blown away at this practice and just walked out. Had had enough at this point. Garbage rude staff as well. Enough smoke in the whole place to kill an avid smoker. Smh."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The design for a Korean restaurant is very modern and lively!!  Quality meat!"}
{"text":"I love going to korean bbq however, this location was so uncompromising about the lunch pricing. My party of 3 arrived at 2:40 and we had to wait 40 minutes to be seated and because of this they would not give us the lunch price. Not to mention online the dinner price was $21, and in the restaurant the price is $25 dollars, compared to the $16 dollar lunch price. For the price to increase by ten dollars is ridiculous and second for them to charge us ten dollars more because of their wait is even more absurd. I had high hopes for this location but the incompetence of the staff and manager is disappointing."}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat good, Gen is the place for you. I've been to 3 locations throughout California and Vegas, this location is by far my favorite. Ambience is great, service is excellent. Tip: I usually try and catch their lunch times, the prices are a few bucks cheaper"}
{"text":"This place is one of my go-to place for korean bbq. This time though, the server Alodia did such an awesome job taking care of us =)"}
{"text":"PROS: The meat is very fresh and the decor is really nice. It's not like some of the KBBQ in China town. Don't let the fact that it's in the galleria mall fool you!  There's usually a long wait for dinner but they have an app you can download which tells you how many people are in line ahead of you.   I really like the garlic chicken with fondue and the bulgolgi pork. I also tried the rice wine which was strong but did it's job lmao    CONS: Most (save maybe 2 or 3 people) of the staff seem snobby and unhelpful. Pretty much like college students that hate their job. I've been there before but I don't appreciate it when I am tipping you.   All in all, this place is great."}
{"text":"AYCE BBQ in Henderson for $21.99 dinner price. Not my favorite place in Las Vegas for AYCE when there are a myriad of other places in Chinatown to choose from. They serve everything from premium steak to brisket to bulgogi to pork belly to short ribs. The first few meat dishes that you order will come out more fresh than the subsequent dishes which appear to be more frozen. Banchans are simple and they give about eight different dishes to try. Beverages such as soda, teas, and alcohol are not included and come at an additional cost. Dessert is also not included, however macaron sandwiches can be included for an extra $3.95. All in all, a typical kbbq spot with mediocre service and mediocre quality of meat."}
{"text":"For the price you can not go wrong!!!   Great food atmosphere very cool.  We went with a large group and think maybe they are not use to large groups, they were disorganized and half the table received all the food and other half did not get anything.  The servers were very nice and tentative, again just unorganized!!! We will definitely go back again with smaller group."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here, her first time, we had Jessica S and she was fantastic! Super friendly and attentive and we never had to look for her! She came all the time and so did everyone else. Great food, great service! Thank you Jessica S!!"}
{"text":"Came back here last month! There really is no waiting in Vegas/Henderson unlike in SoCal and in the Bay Area. Gen is still my all time favorite AYCE KBBQ (Although K-Elements in San Francisco may soon top that), and prices are damn cheap! Servers are friendly, décor is nice, has a very hip feel to the establishment. Banchan comes out as you're seated, and they have a very good salad dressing. They haven't done this before at any of my previous visits to any Gen locations, but they now have a Japchae ready from the start, so I don't have to order it. Soft tofu soup has gotten a lot better compared to the last several times I have ordered it. It actually has some flavor now. Most meat seems to be pretty decent quality, and flavorful. They have a huge selection of meats! I have tried the appetizers on occasion too, but I think you can pass for the most part. The thing that puts everything together is definitely the sesame oil dip/sauce. I don't know what they do differently from other KBBQ places, but this one has a little bit of sweetness and saltiness that works with all of their meats. Prime steak is nice and juicy, kalbi is good but wish they brought out more on one plate. Most of their pork belly taste the same to me. They have the down draft system here, so your clothes won't smell like crap after and you can still go out! I know Sura BBQ is in Chinatown and the kalbi is pretty good too, but I'd rather not smell like charred food after I eat. At $20.99 for dinner, I'll be coming to the Gen in Henderson when I'm around and avoid the 2hr long waits that I have in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Ozzy is the best server in this restaurant. He continually asked if we wanted more meat and rice. He also checked to see if our water was filled. He is such a gentlemen! Thank you for all that you've done. You're appreciated :)"}
{"text":"This is most definitely our favorite Korean BBQ in the Las Vegas area! We used to go to sura in china town but never again! I swear the food is better and better every time we visit and there is no denying that the price can't be beaten! We travel from the mountains edge area in southwest Vegas to enjoy dinner here almost on a weekly basis. The food comes out ridiculously fast, just wish I could try those Cajun fries on the menu!  last night our server was jearica (sp?) and she did a great job. Super friendly and had great recommendations. Always a must order is the signature steak, brisket and most definitely the roast  EDITED IN LIGHT OF NEW \"CHANGES\": I'm sadly disappointed in our old \"FAVORITE\" KBBQ. We used to frequent Gen 2-4 times a month at least as it was our go to when we couldn't decide what to eat, because it was always good. But life came up and we have not been in the recent months and last night we decided to put that to rest. I'm sad to say I don't know when we will be back after the new changes they've implemented now. First off one of my favorite things were the gyoza, they were small and extra crispy with a delicious filling and the sauce was to die for! During our last visit I ordered them and they were awful! I didn't even finish them. They were larger than they used to be (obviously different), very lightly fried and no dipping sauce came on the plate! When I asked about the sauce they said it was \"discontinued\". Discontinued?!?! Who discontinues a dipping sauce with gyoza?!?! I've never been anywhere that serves gyoza without a sauce! Not to mention the gyoza tasted fresh out of a frozen bag from Smiths grocery store and I already started my meal off disappointed. I then went to order our favorite meat, the Ribeye, which used to only be on the dinner menu, to be told yet again that has been \"discontinued\". Seriously, ughhh! They did have a flat iron steak option which was a decent replacement but still not the same. The brisket was unusually tough and dry and again a let down. We made it all the way through our first round of meat before we got our first inital order of jap chae which was for our picky toddler so she was getting grumpy as well. The service has always been pretty hit and miss (but at the time the food made up for it, it no longer does ) but last night our server seemed irritated when we asked for anything and would blow past our table so quickly it was hard to even get her attention. During our first encounter with our server,  we ordered a waters for the table including my daughter. My daughters water never showed up nor did the lemons for my water I asked for directly with my initial drink request either, but believe me I wasn't going to ask for anything else and made to feel uncomfortable for bothering the server. She just shared mine. We eventually tracked down a busser to ask for a fork for our toddler and he was friendly and said sure, but it never showed up and we had again to wait to manage to grab our elusive servers attention. My toddler ate about half her meal without any utensils, which was annoying, but fine. Hopefully they would notice for any other customers that 2 year olds don't always use chopsticks very well and bring a fork next time before even being asked. Thankfully the KFC, cucumbers and potato salad are still awesome but I'm not sure it will be enough to keep us coming back like we used to and I feel sad about it. Very disappointed in the changes in the new menu and the quality of food. I feel like they really made a bad move with trying to save money! They've lost our frequent dining money for sure."}
{"text":"Very fun great place to eat really good food and all you can all-you-can-eat  can't beat that"}
{"text":"Went on NYE. Wine was inexpensive and food was abundant.   I wouldn't order chicken however it takes too long to cook and the shrimp comes in shell and is mess but over all happy and will be baxk"}
{"text":"It is one of the best Korean bbq places to eat. The meat quality is on point. The wait staff keeps the orders coming. I rarely had to wait to place another 4 orders of meat. I tried half of the menu options. I recommend going to eat with a bunch of carnivores. Lol"}
{"text":"The wait was over an hour and a half, not going to lie, my group, party of 12 in split booths was getting frustrated because all other groups were being called before us. Even larger groups were being called before us. HOWEVER, there is an upside to this story, hence the 5 stars. Our waiter Blake was prompt, professional and excelled in every way possible. I do not say this lightly, Blake was by far one of the best servers I've ever had ANYWHERE. He's a hard worker and would recommend coming here simply because of the service. Service aside the food was also excellent!"}
{"text":"That was the worst Korean BBQ! Meat quality is extremely poor, grill was sooo cold, we asked the waitstaff to adjust the temperature for 3 times, but no change. You have a 2 hour limit, but I doubt you can enjoy this food for sooo long. We got the mushroom and vegetable dish which was 4 pieces of cut mushroom and 5 pieces of zucchini cut small and the rest of the plate was chopped onion! Seafood was very disappointing and meat was not fresh, plus it had aftertaste! My husband loves Korean BBQ but this place made him so disappointed! And you get cold rice))))"}
{"text":"No excuse for coming fast around the coroner with a hot grill and not protecting the front of it. A waiter came around the coroner pretty fast and his hot grill slammed right into my daughter cheek causing a burn. All waiters need to be re trained on safety. All I got was an I'm sorry! Are you kidding me??? I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean BBQ. I really enjoyed the miso pork belly and the macaroon ice cream sandwiches were definitely worth the money! Our waiter Ozzy was super helpful with recommending different meats to try! Would recommend this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love coming here!!!   Food is delicious and prices are reasonable for all you can eat.   Great service.   Our server Ozzy was very friendly and on top of everything!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place when it first opened and was curious to try it out when I was back in Arizona. Over the next few months, I saw a lot of my friends singing its praises on Facebook. So before I came back to Arizona, I made a list of all the restaurants I wanted to go to and this was at the top of that list! I had never been to a Korean bbq restaurant before, but this experience was pretty much what I expected. I went with a group of people - some had gone to kbbq before, others hadn't. We went during the holidays on Friday at lunch time. We didn't have to wait at all and it looked like there were still some open tables. However, by the end of our meal, there were a few groups waiting for tables. So I would recommend going earlier for lunch especially since I heard it gets very busy for dinner.  We let the people who had gone to kbbq before be in charge of the grill. The grill is in the middle and you order a few meats at a time and then just place them on the grill using tongs. It's a pretty straightforward process, you just have to make sure the meat is cooked but not overcooked, and be mindful of contamination between cooked and raw meat on the grill. I would recommend having a grill for every 3-4 people. For some reason we had 2 people at 1 grill and 4 people at the other grill and the 2 people at a grill had trouble eating all the food before the next round came out.  Along with the orders of meat, you also get side dishes (banchan) and a bowl of rice, which I think are good to break up all the meat. Other than pork, beef, and chicken, you can also order seafood (octopus, calamari, etc) and vegetables (pineapple, assorted veggies).  Our server was great - he was always checking up on us and put in multiple orders for us cause we wanted to try everything! We also had to get our grill replaced twice because it got burnt - to prevent that from happening, just  make sure to not leave the food on the grill for too long, once it's ready, just set it aside.  By the end, we were all really full and had a great experience overall. My favorites were the bulgogi, spicy chicken, and pineapple. I would definitely come back again and I'd recommend coming with a group of people so you can try more. For the amount you can eat and all the options you can order, this is a great deal!"}
{"text":"The meat was of poor quality and the service was even more disapointing. We had to ask for the same thing like refils or extra side dishes 2-3 times. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We were there 5th of July. It was our second time there. Meat are really tasty as usuall! We liked our waitres Natasha too. I gave 4 stars because our gas stove was leaking, and floor was in grease, and my wife step on it, and her foot got dirty.. but manager gave us discount, and made a promise to fix that stove. But food is really delicious!! Try bulgogi beef!!"}
{"text":"Two words - Amazing food! I have had Gen Korean BBQ in California before and I love it so much. I was so happy when I found out they made one location in Arizona. I'm a fan of Korean food so I definitely had to come here.  The atmosphere is great. The interior design inside is beautiful and there are many tables that can seat 6+ which is perfect.  Knowing this place gets extremely busy, my group of friends and I went at 11:30am for the lunch special. There was no wait and we got seated right away by the nice hostess Thuy. I was pretty surprised that there was decent amount of people at 11:30 though because the store opens at 11am. Lunch special is $15.99 for all you can eat based off the 25 items off the lunch menu which is a great deal with lots of variety! You get a 2 hour limit per group which is reasonable.   There's not much to critique about the food because you are the one grilling it yourself. But every time we ordered the meat it always looked presentable and it came out extremely quick too once we ordered. It probably only takes 5 mins to get to us after we ordered. I also ordered Capri Strawberry Soju. It was super tasty! Price was $8.99 which is a little pricy but I think it's worth it because it comes in a big clear pouch and with two cute LED flashing ice cubes.  The customer service was fantastic. Our main server was Vu and he was really nice about explaining the prices about other items such as drinks, keeping track of the order every round, and always checked on our table if we needed anything like water, more rice or if everything in general was okay. He was really patient about everything and was great at communicating. Luna was another server there. She was very nice and friendly. She also made sure everything was okay and gave us a grill change if we needed. When she delivered my Soju drink, she socialized with our group for a little which was great because we enjoyed her presence and made us laugh. I appreciate the other servers too who come around to check if we need a grill change, give us more water, or take empty dishes out.   The only thing I was disappointed about was not being able to get to try the ice cream macaroon sandwich. There was only Vanilla ice cream with taro macaroon left when I really wanted to try the Green Tea. I wasn't sure why it was all sold out when I ordered it at 12:30 and the store opened at 11. Maybe they didn't restock the night before. But regardless it's still a great place and I would come back a million times more!"}
{"text":"Ever since I brought my mom and stepdad here a few weeks ago I've been dying to come back everything we had was super amazing it's the best Korean barbecue I've had in az and I've tried quite a few places the spicy pork belly was our favorite and the giant alcohol Capri sun type drink was very fun I had the lychee it was delicious.  If you want good food and a lot of fun come here"}
{"text":"I was kind of undecided about this place but the more I think about it the more I've decided to go with it was an ok try it one time but probably will be fine without returning type place. Gen had a chill atmosphefe, work staff was nice, but what I first thought was super cool, ended up being a downer for me instead. I think it's great that they have a grill in the center of the table to be able to cook your own food. Can't beat the all you can eat stipulation BUT it took FOREVER for your food to cook. If you are starving, do not sit at the tables with the grills. The food and the extra sides were great but as far as what you had to cook for yourself it was like ughhhh hurry up so I can eat you! Lol"}
{"text":"I tried GEN again. I was hoping that with time to get into a rhythm that things would of improved but I was wrong.  Gens could have so much potential. A few things wrong with GEN.  1. Not enough staff 2. Restricted menu. Everyone at the table have to order from the same menu. If you have kids that don't want BBQ, you have to settle for the kitchen menu. You can't mix and match. 3. Limited banchan, side dishes. You get 4. That's it. They call them \"seasonal\" but I call it lazy. 4. The spicy tofu soup took over an hour to make and served. 5. Service was pleasant but slow.  I don't think I will come back. I will make the drive to Koreatown. It's just too \"American\" for me. I would rather do the drive, have grumpy service from the sugnyeos, and have the different unlimited banchans."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this restaurant my friend and I took his wife there for her birthday on Friday night, the food was great and the employees were very nice I would be giving it a 5 star rating but due to having 3 employees sit right next to us bragging that the get a discount on their dinner which I completely understand but they were treated with better service then we were the server kept forgetting our drink refills and food that we had ordered but did not once forget anything they ordered if not brought out extra for them, also didn't like that the whole staff kept coming out to say hi and bring them more and more food."}
{"text":"Dress: casual  Drinks: not really a selection  Happy hour : none  Price wise : Too pricey to cook my own meal . Grill your own food type restaurant! So if you ain't feeling like cooking don't come here ! Me and my girlfriend wanted to get some lunch we live by sunset mall so we stopped by very modern and spacious... it was just after 3 PM and we were told that lunch which was $15 all you can eat stopped at 3 PM so we didn't make it on time for that special but dinner was $20 a person we ordered plenty of stuff chicken with cheese fondue we had beef and shrimp among other things the servers were very attentive... You do have to finish all the food or they charge you extra for it so be careful with that if you're not hungry::/..I finished it off with a green tea macaroon !"}
{"text":"Manager was extremely rude. We had been waiting for 50 minutes and were quoted an hour. She snapped at my friend when my friend asked for an estimate and said \"it's a quote.\" We stayed anyways and the food was great. The service and how the manager talks is absolutely rude and unpleasant for a restaurant setting."}
{"text":"We came here last night, the service was awesome, the food was just okay though. Smoked garlic pork belly was my favorite, but the rest was just \"okay\" (some were too fatty). It's a pretty decent price as well for a korean bbq buffet, it's a must try place if you are craving for korean bbq, but my ratings is just 3stars because I do not see this place as my \"go to place\" or I dont look forward coming here very often. Do you know the feeling when you eat too salty, or too sweet food & you'll just suddenly say \"im done\", thats how I felt, the flavor was too much & I didn't really feel full I just felt like \"im done\" & craved for something sweet right after few orders."}
{"text":"By far the best KBBQ ive ever eaten here in Las Vegas. Its about time that Gen finally came here from California. The food was amazing and the service was the best. My server Mizo told me that the service was going to be a little slow since it was parked during their dinner service. After he said that i expected to be waiting a long time for each order but he was dishing them out as fast as i was ordering. Even if the food was bad(which it wasn't), i would be coming back because of Mizo and the awesome hospitality."}
{"text":"Korean food is my favorite type of food to eat. I tried Gen for the first time and honestly the best thing to eat there is the crispy calamari. All the meat they have to offer is nothing special. They give tiny portions so you have to keep ordering. There is no dessert included.  Returned here about 2 months after I wrote this post and they took away the crispy calamari!! The best thing on the menu. Kind of bummed about that. I tried something called a spicy Korean rice cake. It was different. I liked the texture but not the sweet and spicy sauce on top of it. I noticed that they do have a macaroon machine out front now but it's an extra charge! Come on now! They could just include dessert for the high cost of the AYCE?   Honestly, this is place is nothing special, I'd rather eat at Doh."}
{"text":"Gen always satisfies my meat cravings! The Hawaiian steak is thicc and juicy and the brisket is what dreams are made of"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good , it was our first time and kailin was pretty amazing service , very energetic and friendly , attentive and always had a smile , it's because of people like her that makes customers come back again , the food quality on the other hand could be better , I had Korean BBQ at different location and was better , I won't mention names :)"}
{"text":"YAASSSSSSS MY DREAM HAS FINALLY COME TRUE!! Gen has NEVER failed me on service or quality of food and it's finally here in Arizona!!   The wait time was expected, it was about a 1-2 hours wait. Note to people who have never been to a AYCE KBBQ, wait time of 1-2 is expected. Pretty busy for a soft opening but regardless, the service was superb.   We got a huge list of food, everything on there was beautifully marinated and delicious. Refer to picture :) is"}
{"text":"Found this AYCE Korean BBQ place on Yelp. We frequent Galleria Mall and we had no idea that this place had already opened.  When we got to the restaurant we were greeted & seated immediately. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our server Ozzy was very helpful with the menu. He recommended the #10 marinated steak which was very yummy! Ozzy was called to clean and he informed us that Terry was going to be our server for the remainder of our dinner. They were both great servers and the food choices were great. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the interior it looks like a really nice club/lounge. But I prefer a chill place to have conversations with my friends over a place that's trendy where I got to yell over music and other people's convos next to me. Also the hour wait time wasn't really worth it in my book, I'll stick to my usuals."}
{"text":"This is our second time there. Apart from the wait time, the place is decent. A little smokey, but that is expected from korean bbq. The selection of meats were good. I usually only get the pork belly and beef tongue, a bit disappointing to know beef tongue is not served during lunch. This time around, it was our server Ozzy that makes me wanna yelp a good review. He was amazingly pleasant and very proactive with his service. Compared to the 1st time we were there, this 2nd time was definitely a much better experience."}
{"text":"To be quite honest with you all, I am not sure where to begin with this review of Gen Korean BBQ House, much like how the server had no idea when to begin refilling our water cups. It takes approximately 10 days without water for the average human to die of dehydration, which was clearly taken into account by this establishment as the all-you-can-eat-but-not-drink time limit was set to 2 hours. I must commend them for their forward thinking. It got so bad that at one point, myself and 8 other patrons were forced to participate in an in-house spelling bee contest in order to gain access to the coveted cup of water. We were asked to spell \"rondayvoo,\" which apparently is not the correct was to spell rondayvoo. To the surprise of nobody, their thirst for literary excellence was not quenched.   There is much more to say, but I am writing this review with what is left of my withering energy. I can feel my senses numbing. I struggled to decide whether or not to contact my loved ones for the last time, or warn all future customers of Gen Korean BBQ House. My decision is obvious.  I farewell thee, and hope for a equally brighter, more hydrated future for our children. With that, I tip my glass (and a mandatory 18% gratuity) to the readers of this review, a final sip for us all, because that is all you are going to get."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool, music was on point and not too loud. The experience was good. James was our waiter and he guided us on some good choices to help us get that authentic Korean feel. I tried Soju for the 1st time and I must say...I'm a fan! Would come back again some day..."}
{"text":"My Man Richard ( server ) is top notch best service I ever got from GEN. Hands Down! Friendly, hard working, always checking up on us if we need anything. Ask For Richard if you want the best service from GEN"}
{"text":"I LUV UR BBQ LONG TIME! Highly recommendable. Prompt and courteous service too. Contemporary relaxed atmosphere compared to ur typical gangnam bbq joints! LOL"}
{"text":"Food was great julian our waiter was very pleasant and helpful! A great choice if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"We love Gen! Sometimes there is a wait but it is totally worth it! The waitstaff at Gen is constantly checking on you and always ready to take your order.  The food is outstanding and we will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"By far the best Korean All-You-Can-Eat BBQ in Arizona. I have tried many other restaurants and originally being raised in California, I always craved good Korean BBQ and couldn't get it till now. The service is kind and always looking out for anything you need. The food is the highest quality than any of the other Korean restaurants. And the price for the selection is very honest."}
{"text":"Just opened! Clean and good customer service. The food is great and consistent with all the other branches. When I'm looking for good korean bbq with a little more this is the place to go! It's got not just the korean but a bit of everything!"}
{"text":"I always come here for KBBQ and it never disappoints! Julian was a great waiter and always checked up on us even when it got super busy. Will be coming again :)"}
{"text":"Had such a great experience dining here. Everything was amazing! The food and the service was great. Shoutout to our server alodia she was amazing, she got our orders out faster than we thought and she checked on us often. Ask for her!!!"}
{"text":"My experience m, 45 min wait! For the long wait, have more then. 6 chairs for us to sit & wait, especially for the elderly! Overpriced! Very unorganized staff-waiters! Not worth it at all! I'll stick to my Kabuki."}
{"text":"This place is great. THE FOOD WAS AWESome. There are many selections rangingbfron chicken to beef to pork to seafood. THE servers Khristina and Kevin are very helpful in accommodating the customers. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to go with friends or family, but take them in the afternoon around lunch, because in the evening it not only gets expensive, but extremely packed and loud. There is a large variety of choices to choose from on the menu from pork to beef and even octopus! I don't recommend this place if you are vegan or vegetarian as it only has one veggie option and it only has onions and bell peppers in it. Other than that though, I recommend at least trying the beef tongue and getting the KFC! It's delicious. My only big complaint is that every time I have come here, the wait staff seems to fall short. My party always has to flag them down and they always seem irritated about being there. Another time I was there, a waiter completely forgot to bring a round of drinks but still charged them on the check."}
{"text":"the quality of the food this great for the price. i'd say the place is comparable to Tofu Hut as far as quality, but much nicer restaurant and service is consistently exceptional. Luke was our server today and he was very professional and courteous. He did a fine job maintaining our table. the service was on point and i can tell the waitstaff was very well trained. very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. All you can eat Korean BBQ....yes please. Look if you need more than two hours to stuff your face you either didn't eat fast enough or are the biggest glutton ever. 2 hours for all you can eat is not only insane it's also amazing. Hahahaha.   I stumbled upon this place as I live in more of the north valley. I liked the vibe, ambience, and the food was good. Our server David S. was on point. One because we have the same name but he was totally cool and also took great care of us. Definitely 5 stars for him all day long.  The meats were good. I have had all you can eat and this was better than the other place up in north Scottsdale.   For two people we got 10 items and we were stuffed. The bulgogi is necessary always and you have to just try it anywhere they serve it. The steak was good. Gyoza was also tasty. Oh the KFC and Volcano Chicken were amazing. The Volcano chicken was spicy but perfect for me. Great great flavor but do not get it if you don't like spice. Flat iron steak was thinly sliced and you have to cook it in the middle. Galbi was also tasty. The Hawaiian steak was also good and they have a nice piece of pineapple to go with it.   They also had unfiltered sake. Yaaaaaa!!!  Only thing is I wish the condiment sides were a tad better tasting and more variety but they were still good.   Again, David S was awesome and everything came out quick and there was plenty of food. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Have been for dinner ($25) and for the $16 all you can eat lunch on weekdays. Service has been excellent and they are always ready to take your next orders. Our favorite meats have been beef bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, and spicy pork belly. I don't recommend the fried chicken as it is pretty much just orange/general tso's chicken. Only downside to Korean BBQ is you leave with your hair smelling like meat and grease. Overall this place has great quality food and a nice upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been MIA from my Yelp Reviews BUT this place is definitely a restaurant that deserves 5 stars (and I'm not just writing this for my free beer) ;)   I've first heard about GEN in Cali, haven't tried it over there but heard nothing but great reviews! So when I heard they opened one here in LV better yet in the Henderson Location we couldn't wait to try it!   GEN welcomed us with their blue night club lights and open dining area and huge projector! Tonight they have a DJ playing all my kinda music! And the service is incredibly fast pace and the servers continuous check on us when it looks like we need some attention to refill our all you can eat needs from meats to appetizers!"}
{"text":"Pros: I've revisited this place many times due to its awesome location in Galleria mall. The service at the table was always great. The servers were quick and efficient. Love the variety that they offer! The shrimp and calamari were a great plus as they're not usually offered at other Korean bbq.  Cons: the hostesses at the front can be rude sometimes. They can improve on their service and accommodation for the customers. The meat quality was also inferior to some places in Vegas's Chinatown. Meat can be fatty and salty."}
{"text":"One of the better service I've gotten from Gen BBQ and I'm from Southern OC. Shoutout to Jaenica! She was very friendly and knowledgable. I'll be back if I am ever in the area again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Even as someone who doesn't eat a lot of meat I love KBBQ. Gen is no exception. The staff helped our rather large group quickly and explained everything to those who were new. We never were left wanting for anything.   The meat is well seasoned,  the ban Chan is plentiful and delicious.    The only downside is how difficult it is to split checks and the price. Lunch is 17 dollars and dinner is 24."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool i really like the people they're all really chill and help each other out. This restaurant works as a team nd not just rely on the server for everything. Our server Alodia was really cool and out going, i loved her. she had us well taken cared of. Aways taped out our drinks, stopped by often to check on us and we're teenagers and i work in the restaurant industry and kno how servers treat teenagers because on how they tip (we're not like that tho lol) but not Alodia she always checked on us and gave us great service thanks. Tow thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because my family and had a great experience from my birthday dinner last night (around 9pm, Tuesday, Aug 22) and our sever Ms. Alodia was outstanding! My husband and I come here almost every other week or once a month and we always have a good service, but Alodia was the server that stuck out to us the most. Alodia always smiled, made sure we were taken cared of, and just she did it genuinely.  She took care of of our party of 7 and we were all impressed by her customer care."}
{"text":"I always enjoyed Gen BBQ. The food and enviornment is always pleasant! Its yakiniku style and you can prepare the food to your taste!"}
{"text":"Undoubtably there is a new contender for the best korean bbq restaurant in Las Vegas.  Gen Korean BBQ house offers some of the most delicious selections of meat and ALL of their appetizers are included for free!  Your group is allowed to select 4 appetizers and 4 meat selections at a time.  You then cook at the grill centered at your booth's table.  The price and quality can't be beat!  $15 for lunch and $20 for dinner, eat here now and get your money's worth!  Our server Kristina did a good job explaining the different meats and recommending meats for us to grill.  Our selections included the dinner only items (Roast Beef, Galbisal [marinated premium steak]) as well as premium pork belly, beef bulgolgi, and beef brisket.  As a tip, always get the beef brisket because it cooks really fast.  That way you have stuff to eat as the other thicker meats take its time to cook.    The appetizers we also ordered (again, surprisingly free)  included japchae (glass noodles), miso soup, seaweed salad, pork katsu cutlet, popcorn shrimp, korean fried chicken, and gyoza.   Of course staple mini dishes like kimchee, rice, spicy pickles, and potato salad were also included and waiting on the table when we were seated.  The service was great and overall there seemed to be enough staff as almost every booth was filled with customers and yet the food kept on coming.   There are plenty of tables in this large restaurant and parking is easy as it is connected to Galleria Mall.      So move over Tofu Hut, Hwaro, Sura, etc.. Gen's finally reached its way from California and I'm sure it's here to stay."}
{"text":"I've been here two days in a row, it's a nice lunch spot. The food is good, the atmosphere is fun, and the staff is friendly! :) I recommend the Chicken and Beef Bulgogi! The downside to this restaurant is that there is no desert menu!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by this place!   I had been wanting to go here for a while and I really, really wanted to like it. However, the atmosphere, service, and food was just so mediocre.   It was a Monday night and the service was soooo slow. Several of the things we ordered were forgotten, despite reminding the server several times. Additionally, it took over 20 minutes to get our waters and drinks from the bar. When the drinks did arrive, almost a third of mine was spilled on my friend. They did not offer to refill it or even apologize to my friend for spilling it on her. My other friends soft drink never made it to the table.   The food was good, when it arrived. Like I said, several of the dishes we ordered never made it to our table. I liked the idea of cooking it ourselves at the table. I wish they gave more sides/seasonings.   The atmosphere isn't the best. They are constantly rushing everything (you have a two hour timer) despite having plenty of time left for your table. Each server we encountered used the excuse that it was busy and that's why we were getting bad service, however, this place is always busy, so I guess they just have bad service all the time. One server, Michael, was really trying and he's the only reason my review is 2 stars instead of 1.   Honestly, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Great service and an amazing meal with great value! One of the best meals we had in Las Vegas  I would recommend the KFC, calamari, beef tongue, roast beef, japchae, beef bulgigi and premium pork belly. Everything was delicious! My family and I had such a great meal there, thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and I am very impressed Ozzy was awesome! I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Howard gave good service and definitely beats out Tofu Hut and other KBBQ places because of the wide variety of meats you can select. And it tastes great!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"I go here with my wife at least once every few weeks. The food is good and the service is always on top of their game.   However, I have to leave a two star because of the heat and humidity inside the restaurant. AYCE Korean BBQ is not cheap, I get it, but if I'm paying $160 for my wife and a few friends I expect it to be nice and cool inside.   The server was nice and sorry for the heat. He checked on it three times for us. The reason I go to Gen over the other Korean BBQ places here is because of the pleasantries, but this time I would've rather endure the poor Korean service from Lee's over the sweltering humid heat inside today."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but it was way too smokey, needs way more ventilation in here. Waiter tried to charge us full price for our 7 year old and he never asked to refill drinks! It took 25 minutes to find him to get the bill. Sticking with Sura's or DJK."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  The spicy pork bulgogi and spicy rice cake delivered on the spicy for sure!  The spicy rice cake is a fancy twist on tteokbokki (though no fish cake and not as saucy). The rice cake is lightly fried which is *really* nice.  I and my co-conspirators went through practically half the menu and didn't find anything disappointing.  Surprise: they didn't have any hot tea available.  Missing: seafood pancake (haemul paejon) - it would be awesome to see what Gen's take is on this!    Fantastic service!  Banchan is waiting for you before you're seated.  Everything is done electronically which is pretty cool too.  Our guide Alodia was tha bomb! Patient, attentive, funny, friendly, and informative.    All around a great experience - I plan on going back to satisfy Korean food cravings!"}
{"text":"Well worth the long wait!! The staff was on top of everything.  Everybody will ask you if you need anything, no need to wait for your waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"Awesome all u can eat. You cook your own but your choices are unlimited. Very attentive staff. Great meal"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was quick. This place gets really crowded and you might have to wait from 30mins to 2 hours and they don't sit you unless your party is all there.  This place offers \"all you can eat\" bbq and they will charge you extra if you have somewhat significant amount of unfinished food."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and usually the crew is on point. Tonight went a bit wonky. By wonky, I mean we arrived about 9:50 pm and were told we had a 10 to 20 minute wait. During our wait, we observed multiple tables which sat empty, waiting for their place settings and when they did get their place settings, they sat people down but you could tell there was a disconnect between the clean up and set up crews. The hostess was doing her best to get people seated and the place was packed with people waiting. It felt like they were short staffed overall.  As soon as we sat down, the waiter took our drink order and plugged it onto their pos system. They took our app and meat order as well. Our food showed up first so we started cooking it and the waiter came back to check on us, but we hadn't received our drinks yet. He went back in and apparently our drinks were sitting on a tray waiting for someone to bring them out.  We ordered more food and had someone else's food show up, it was the table next to us. We think the rest of our food showed up, but by then we were decently full. Then our waiter just disappeared. It looked like they took people from the front of the house and pulled them into the back of the house to clean up. Another waitress refilled our drinks and she brought us our checks.  Usually the place is on par from our previous visits, but tonight was really quirky. Not sure if we'll be back until things get smoothed out again."}
{"text":"Service was not the greatest but I understood that they were new and short staffed per our server. However, I called about a party for 40-45 people for my birthday dinner and they asked me to come in an hour early and wait????? No reservations at any cost!"}
{"text":"My server today is Jeanica, she is awesome. Excellent service, delicious food. I will recommend ur restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Exactly the same as the GEN's in Cali, this location is tucked away at the Galleria in Henderson. The service was fantastic thanks to Lisa and Krink who tagged teamed our table. They were on point every time with our high demands.   If you are familiar with GEN then you know they set them selves apart from other KBBQ with their special marinades and wide selection of meats choices. Aside from brisket that I can eat all day, I recommend trying the Galbisal which is the marinated short rib steaks.. it is absolutely phenomenal.   The ambience inside is nice with the stencil art up towards the ceiling, the huge projection tv and and hip music. I am definitely coming back and telling everyone about this new gem in our town."}
{"text":"Service was horrible the waitress was unattainable at times the guy helping her bring the dishes to our table wasn't explaining anything to us had to \"guess\" what everything was ... We received our appetizers after we started receiving our main meal ... I asked for sugar for my green tea then she said \"There's no sugar on this table?\" ... Just a crazy, disappointing experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a party of 13 and told us it was a 2 hour wait. At the 2 hour mark they told us 30 minutes more. 30 minutes passed and they said another 15 and they were cleaning the table. Of course that wasn't the case... they even texted us and said our table was ready but we still had to wait. Anyways we ended up waiting for 3+ hours. We told them from the beginning that we were fine splitting up the tables and they kept persisting us to wait for this one table that was big enough to fit all of us.   Food is good tho. And the servers are all really nice! But jeez."}
{"text":"We always loved to go to the original Gen in Henderson. But haven't been there for awhile since it is way too far from us. So We were so happy to find out that they have just opened up a second location in West Las Vegas. But first huge disappointment was a terrible ventilation system. Unlike the henderson location it was \"\"really smoky,,\"\" secondly maybe because its a fairly new place, the service wasn't that great, my waiter forgot to bring few items from the first order, we ordered soju but he forgot to bring shot glasses(??) then we asked someone else for the shot glasses after a quite long wait, then he brought us tall beer glasses :-(( My favorite appetizers at Henderson location wasn't on the menu anymore (Crispy spicy Rice cake, Fried Squid legs) Very good quality of beef tongue, ok pork belly, ok galbi, very good K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken)..No doubt it's a still decent dining spot for the price but we are not sure if we ever go back again because of their bad ventilation system and they don't offer my favorite appetizers anymore."}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in Henderson. It does lack in marinated meats, which is why I had to give it one less star. The style and atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! Many items on the menu to choose from when you do the \"all you can eat.\" Many employees to take care of you! I visited thrice and did not have any issue."}
{"text":"I'm NO longer a fan of gen!!  They just opened this 2nd location and it's very spacious and look the same as every Gen I've been too.  I stop going to the one in Henderson cuz #10 galbi is label on the menu but it's NOT galbi, its chewy and w tendon beef which they claim it's galbi(I know my meat) .  When I saw on Yelp that the new location have it cuz they just open and was excited to try it, BUT was disappointed  in the quality of the meat, omg it lack flavors and was sooo chewy..  I love marinated meats and all their meat lack in flavors..  Appetizers are very limited now, not like before.. NOT planning on coming here again, I'm going to stick to my new love  8ounce kbbq"}
{"text":"YES....I'm so happy they open one in vegas, wish it was closer to home(somewhere in Chinatown) or southwest area..  Located along the mall, next to JC Penny.. I'm so giving this AYCE kbbq a 5+.. By far the BEST kbbq in vegas..All the meats were so tasty, well marinated and tender.. This is even better than the one in California.. They have only open for 8 days and it's packed, came here for lunch @12 ish and had to wait for half an hr. Wkend is $19.99. They let u order 4 item at a time and everything on the appetizer. They didn't have Cajun fries and Popcorn chicken, which I didn't care for anyway. The KFC chicken was crunchy and tasty.   They have galbi(short ribs-boneless)... So delish.. MUST order!!! I'm not a fan of pork belly but the #17 smoke garlic belly caught me by surprise.. Not over powering with the smoke flavor.. Really good  All the side dishes were on par. I don't know how many times my niece and I order the side dishes, japchae was alright and I didn't like the fried rice cake(weird texture) skip it!!   This meal today is my breakfast, lunch and dinner.. So full and can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time attending a Gen restaurant... my friends really talked it up and convinced me that we should go for the $25 all you can eat dinner menu. I was on board and decided to join. Upon arriving the business looked nice and the ambiance was nice. We didn't wait long to be seated in a booth at the front of the restaurant. We sat and ordered drinks with our server, which I asked for water with lemon.. as she's gone we realize the first issue.. the a/c is blasting over our heads.. so we all froze the entire dinner, and the heat from the grill on the table was obsolete in helping warm us up. Upon arrival with our drinks there was no lemon in my water so I asked for lemon again... she took our order and returned yet again with no lemon. Long story short I asked for lemon 3 times before she came back and realized yet again she didn't grab the lemons and asked a passing bus boy to grab them. My friend also asked for rice 3 times before getting irritated and demanding the rice. One of the food runners brought us dumplings and dropped them on the floor and told us she would be right back with more... she never came back with more. Our server also never once offered to change out our grill. It was honestly awful and I'll never return to a Gen after that. At least not this location!!!!"}
{"text":"They finally have the Spicy Tofu Soup. Our server Eugene had some great recommendations on #9 and beef tongues."}
{"text":"This is my second review and I would like to take a shout out to JESSICA. Best server! She's been our server twice and she very sweet, consistent, and most of all since the squid fried legs and shrimp popcorn are not on the menu for some reason she has that magic and we're still be able to order it. Keep it up Jess! See you soon. Lol   On the other hand shout out to MARISSA she's one of the receptionist to be honest and straight forward she's rude. I don't think she loves what she's doing. She probably need to quit her job! Came in today no line nor no people waiting. She greeted us, turn around, started chatting with other co worker, looking around somewhere after 10 mins she greeted us again and she paused for about good 2 mins before she told us that we can be seated. Is it that hard to accommodate a customer when they walked in? She could've said \"welcome to gens, I'll be right there with you\" or something. Ohh plus when we're about to pay why give so much attitude? Because we didn't add a tip on the card? Sorry but we prefer giving cash for tips. Well I'll still come back because of the food and good servers. Pls Marissa be nice with your customers. *rant ends*"}
{"text":"I didn't \"yelp\" my first visit here but I'm deciding to do so after my second visit. If you didn't realize what I said, yes, this was my second visit here within a month....yes, it's that good! I can't really say what to eat or what not to eat because EVERYTHING I tried was outstanding!!! The wait time wasn't that bad - be patient, it's worth it. I especially enjoyed the price of the AYCE venue. I'm shocked to see this place rated as 2 $'s because compared to other Korean BBQs in this city, this far exceeds expectations for price. I think it's hilarious when people rate these types of restaurants low because of the quality of the food...especially when the customers control how to cook their food. Only recommendation would be to expand the restaurant to accommodate more customers. Saving the best for last...this city is filled with rude and unpleasant-to-talk-to-type of people. It was refreshing to have a waitress (Jessica) as friendly as we had tonight. She is very attentive and caring...I just wish more people/workers would be the same way in this city. Thanks for an outstanding experience; I will recommend this place to friends and co-workers....and I recommend this place to all yelp-ers."}
{"text":"The novelty of this place may be the coolest part about it, for the price and what you get it's a major win as well.  I came in for lunch while I was waiting for my car that was getting serviced down the road, as I walk in the hostess very loudly announces \"party of one!\" The entire staff then shouts \"welcome to Gen\". Okay this is corny as all hell and it was the only annoying part about this place.  To the good stuff now. This place is straight forward, 16.99 all you can eat up to two hours during lunch and if you have any leftovers you have to pay a $5 penalty. Not bad.  I started it off with a \"premium\" steak, which is essentially a top sirloin, I also got pork belly, beef bulgogi, gyoza and a side of rice. I literally had to muscle through at the end but this stuff was not only good but worth the price of admission. This is a cool spot to go with a small group because the inherent interactive nature of Korean BBQ. The service is top notch as well. Gen is a winner, even if it's a chain.  My advice though: stop with the \"welcome to Gen\"."}
{"text":"It isn't THE best korean bbq place that I've been to, due to the flavoring of some meats are not as flavorful as I would have liked compared to other places. Nonetheless, it is still a great korean bbq place in vegas in my opinion! The look of the place is very nice, since it is new! It's a clean place, the servers are very friendly, good meats and appetizers. The price is decent."}
{"text":"I have been going to Gen since it had its grand opening at Galleria Mall...I usually go for rounds of #3, #9, #10 over and over until I get full! (so good)   I usually wrap the meat with Radish papers (get the radish and not the rice papers...the rice papers doesn't seem fresh at times)  For appetizers, I usually get the agedashi tofu!   The service gets better each time I come here. Our server today was Jaenica and she was very cordial and got our orders pretty quick! She was also very personable and lovely :)"}
{"text":"Yay! Super excited we finally have a legit AYCE KBBQ place in AZ! I've already been twice in the less than a month they've been open. Once on a Friday night around 7pm and once on a Sunday afternoon - waited 1.5 hours both times. I hear a lot of complaints about the wait; but for me, it's not so bad. I'm a seasoned line-waiter. Lol. Little Miss BBQ anyone? How about the 3 hr wait Pizzeria Bianco days? Or Boiling Crab when they first started out? At least here you can go explore Tempe Marketplace to kill time.  Now onto to the real stuff - the meat! I was with four hungry dudes, so I was able to try a lot of the items they had to offer. My favorites include: Hawaiian Pork Belly Brisket Pork Jowl - cook it longer to get it crispy Garlic Calamari Beef Tongue Galbi  Other favorites at the table: Garlic Pork Belly - tastes like little smokies sausages Cajun Shrimp Flat Iron Steak Premium Pork Belly Hawaiian Steak  Not so great: Octopus - maybe we cooked it wrong, but none of us enjoyed this. Garlic Chicken - got it for the cheese fondue that comes with it but the cheese was not good. Bulgogi - wasn't a fan of the marinade but looks to be most people's favorite, so I'll have to try this again next time.  Tip: By the time you get seated you're probably hangry from the long wait. Order thin cuts of meat the first round or two (brisket, beef tongue, flat iron steak).They cook quickly and you can start eating while you wait for the longer cooking items in the next rounds.   $24.99 per person for dinner and all day on the weekends. $15.99 for lunch Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? It was a journey of delicious food, fantastic service, and an incredible atmosphere that was conducive to an enjoyable dining experience. To begin, Our server, Luke (AKA Luke Skywalker) was, what I could only describe as, a boss. He gave us fantastic recommendations, was knowledgeable of the menu options, as well as providing superior service that we could not find in most restaurants. The food could not have been better; we had the #10 steak (I'm not sure exactly what it is called), but it was absolutely delicious. The chicken and spicy pork bulgogi were all fantastic choices. Affordable prices, great for a date night, and a huge selection of foods for all-you-can-eat. I must say, I have not been this blown away by a restaurants service and quality in a long time. I would highly recommend Gen Korean BBQ House."}
{"text":"Jaenica has been our server 3 times upon discovering this restaurant. She has been super attentive to my family as well as kind with a great sense of humor. I will continue to return to this restaurant with her as my server, and order my favorite dishes: bulgogi, jap chae bap, and spicy rice cake."}
{"text":"Amazing place for AYCE BBQ. It's new and was pleasantly surprised. the staff did well accommodating us to make sure we knew what we were doing when cooking our own meat. mizzo and Blake were very helpful and will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I have to admit...I was a bit leary of the place. My wife and I had numerous selections to include 2 servings of the tongue. All of the food was pretty damn good, but the tongue was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Food was bomb, i enjoyed the atmosphere, the service was also good. Even though we had to ask for our salad 3 times....1 out of three not bad....but other than that food was there as fast as you ordered it"}
{"text":"Our new favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spot.  The selections of meat as well as sides/appetizers is superb.  Definitely going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The service is quick and very helpful. Try their Mango Soju & the crispy squid legs. Aldoia and everyone else were amazing! Definitely bringing my friends here lol :)  This place is my go to place for KBBQ. The service is excellent and the food is amazing. Eugene was friendly and remembered us from the last time my friends and I came here. This is my favorite KBBQ place! :D"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been visiting the Henderson Gen at least once a week every week since their grand opening so we had to visit this new location downtown and show our love and support. Eugene was a wonderful manager in Henderson so it's no surprise that he's doing a fantastic job here! The staff here have the same bright, friendly, fun personalities that made us fall in love with Gen three years ago so prepare yourself for really great and entertaining service! All you can eat meat is not just a gimmick here, they will happily feed you to the brim and still offer you more. You'll love it here! Trust the Gen Regulars!  Shout out to Mizzo, thank you for the fabulous service!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a couple of coworkers and went to go check it out one night. The food was AMAZING! The marinated steak is a must try. I also had the peach soju during happy hour and it tasted great. Alodia was an amazing server always ask for her when you're coming to dine in."}
{"text":"One of the best kbbqs in Vegas! We love this place, would go more often if there wasn't such a long drive to get there!"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean bbq place I have been to sofar quality meats sauces always have a full drink always have a clean grill"}
{"text":"Gen is a really cool, newer trendy Korean BBQ place. It has a pretty good vibe inside.    It has a wide selection of food especially compared to Korean BBQ places in Chinatown. They have a really good Gen signature steak, Garlic Chicken, and my favorite was the beef Bulgogi. If you're feeling the appetizers, the fried squid legs & Special Korean Fried Chicken was amazing! The Gyoza was just okay. They change out your grills when it gets too charred so that's really nice.   We've been here twice now. We recently came right after Valentine's Day after they opened & they were pretty steady. Our waitress Alodia had a full section but she was very personable & friendly! They were out of rice for 45 min which I could see a lot of tables getting frustrated (we didn't really mind) but she made sure to keep on top of everything to try & compensate for the kitchen/management's lack of preparedness opening up that day. She compensated for it very well & made the experience great despite the little hiccup of no rice for awhile.   After a decent first experience & wonderful second one, we def will be returning!   Ps: payment at the end is really convenient as well."}
{"text":"I usually eat at Gen on special occasions or when I have friends visiting from out of states. Every time before I entered, I looked at the menu displayed at the main entrance to see if Gen have the steaks that Gen serves during lunch time. I will see it displayed but when I am ordering with my family or friends the steak, even when the Restaurant just opened, the waitress will tell us , \"I am sorry we are out of the steak.\"  The problem is, the menu on the main entrance and the menu that they gave me and my family or friends did not say, \"out of stock on the steak.\" The waitress waited until you start ordering.  The other problem with Gen Restaurant about ordering steak, they always \"out of stock.\" One time, we ordered 3 different menus and guess what, the waitress told me with my family, we are \"out of stock.\" Imagine, 3 consecutive orders were \"out of stock.\" I was invited with my spouse back to Gen Restaurant by a friend. I told my friend that Gen Restaurant has this habit of \"out of stock\" on their menu. She told me that to give it another try and if it happens again, we will never go back to Gen Restaurant. Guess what? There was no steak again, as usual response,\"out of stock.\" For me, this is a pattern. Gen displays a \"False Advertisement \" to the public. I need to contact the agency that enforces the Consumers' Act because this is not the first time that this \"False Advertisement\" has happened. For the readers, I used to work in a restaurant and I know what the things the owners in the restaurant are not supposed to do. For the future customers, I wish you luck because by writing this article whether Gen Restaurant will take it constructively and have the menus always \"on stock\" or you will be the next VICTIM of \"out of stock.\" Lastly, for the new customers, be prepared to be embarrassed by Gen's waitress. Gen Restaurant is \"Eat All You Can\" but when you call the waitress to order, they tell you as a customer, \"You still have food on your plate.\" I am the customer. Why comment that \"You still have food on your plate.\" Then again, future customers, good luck and enjoy your unwanted menu on your table Gen Restaurant because \"out of stock.\""}
{"text":"It's alright.. There are definitely better places for ayce Korean food (sura, honey pig) but if you're on the Henderson side, knowing there is no real good Asian food, it's worth going.- especially only $20 for dinner .. But if you have the time go somewhere else lol  ...also it's probably only \"fresh\" cause it's new. Let's see they'll be able to stick around. Good luck!!  Happy eatings!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times now and this time was better of all.. great service and great food.. I enjoy myself here and don't feel rushed at all.. Shoutout to our server Alodia such a great attitude and very attentive!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh!!! I've heard many good things about this place. I wish I loved it but the service was HORRIBLE!!! My party of 6 arrived, there was a 45 minute wait. Which I didn't mind because you were able to leave and shop inside the mall. They have this really awesome system were they send you a text letting you know when your table is almost ready. The decor is really nice, clean.   Finally, time to eat. We waited FOREVER for our rice to come. We can't start eating without our rice! Haha. They serve small portions of meat, so your constantly looking for the waiter to make more orders. We're a party of 6. Two small plates of brisket will only satisfy one person. Having to constantly wait for them to bring out more meat & changing the grill just had me annoyed to the point where I just lost my appetite. Everyone looks so puzzled, & disorganized. The food was actually good. Which is why I rated it two stars. It's just the service that killed it for me! I rather go to China Town! :("}
{"text":"Great, good quality food and best of all the price is reasonable! Our server Ozzy was awesome. Very attentive and went above and beyond to ensure we were well taken care of! Thank you for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"so this is my first time to try GEN resto. and my verdict is  Excelllent!!!   - foods are delicious -what i like is how they serve the food (not huge portion) -ambience is good -price is not bad at all  -many foods to choose from -server lisa is excellent in customer service   comments: salad should be in bigger portion or it should be in a salad bowl."}
{"text":"Tried Gen for the first time yesterday and it was amazing . I never had a kbbq experience like this one . The food was great and Luis was grabbing my food. He was very attentive and made sure I always had water cus I hate waiting for a drink while I'm choking . Definitely one of my favorite kbbq places . I'll definitely come back !"}
{"text":"This place is easily the best All you can eat Korean BBQ joint in Vegas at a price that can't be beat. I went for lunch, All you can eat for $14.99. I got Korean fried Chicken, pork belly, Bulgogi, soon do boo, Cajun chicken, Chadol, shrimp, japjae chae, and steak and these are all you can eat.  It also comes with unlimited Bun Cha (small side dishes like Kim chees).  Highly recommend this place and it's attached to the Galleria Mall in Henderson."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed with the prices for AYCE! Although I was a little upset with the portions for the choices of meat, but other than that not bad"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I'm in a food coma.  Really enjoyed trying all the dishes even, tongue!  So much variety on the menu and as much as you can eat, what more can you ask for.  Our server was very attentive and checked on us regularly.  Nothing seemed too much trouble.  Would definitely go there again and again and again!"}
{"text":"This is totally what I'm expected to have in a Korean bbq restaurant. The foods are delicious and it is like buffet. Highly recommend red wine pork belly, it is tasted a little bit sweet and no.3 beef brisket, juicy and easy to bbq."}
{"text":"At 7pm on a Friday night, the wait here was around 30 minutes.  Not bad compared to SoCal.   Came literally starving... so it was pretty disappointing that we were left unattended for around 10 mins.   Luckily Ozzy (blue shirt) came to the rescue and was super attentive all night and super apologetic. That was really appreciated!  Korean BBQ honestly all tastes fairly the same to me. Nothing stellar here, but definitely hits the spot. The nice ambiance is a definite plus, too.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gen a couple of times because I'm a fan of the meats here- brisket, beef belly, & premium steak are a must! We've been here during some great days and some just sub-par days when it gets too busy. Today my little brother and I came for an early dinner and it was close to amazing!  First off, it wasn't as busy today because we came around 4:45 on a Saturday & stayed for about an hour (beat the rush hour!). The meats came out quickly and with generous cuts, our drinks were refilled in a timely manner, they offered to change the grill twice, and we even ordered 2 green tea macarons for dessert at the end which is an extra charge.  However, the experience was great because we had a GREAT server-Jessica. She was very polite, helpful, checked up on us regularly AND she looks around while she walks to make sure her tables are doing okay. She offered suggestions on menu items like a good server should, but her friendliness and attentiveness were what made her stand out. Like I said, I've come here often, and it's normally a hit or miss, but she went above and beyond. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat AYCE kbbq in Vegas although it's actually located in Henderson. It's $14.99 for lunch and $20.99 during dinner. It could get pretty crowded during dinner around 7pm and in some instances where I waited an hour. There's a lot to choose from especially for the price and good variety of side dishes available. Right when we were seated, they gave us a plate of salad and japchae with the side dishes already on the table. The order came out fast. Overall the meat was good quality and service was alright."}
{"text":"I guess you can say, \"VERY AMERICANIZED KOREAN BBQ.\"  Which, ain't nothin' wrong with that!  It was clean.  It had a modern, contemporary feel and ambience.    Downfalls: 1. Had to wait 15 minutes for a table, but they had one side of the restaurant empty... Maybe they were understaffed or the kitchen couldn't keep up.  2. The meats weren't marinated long enough.   3. They were out of 2 of the 5 appetizers we ordered. 4. We had 4 different servers... I wasn't sure which one to flag down for drink refills, meat refills, grill change, and the bill.  It's just one of those places where you've at least tried it once."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst Korean barbecue I've ever had. it's hard for me to even consider this Korean food. They've completely destroyed all essence of Korean flavor in all their dishes.   Meats were not marinated or presented well-incredibly bland and not of good quality. I want to say they have tried to make this place mainstream and by doing so made kbbq terrible. For example, they had bloody French fries and fricken nacho cheese garlic chicken in their menu-it'd be fine if it was good but it was really just awful.   Overall, Portions small, flavorless meats, not tender, service was slow, not authentic."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place.  Went with my family while in Tempe Marketplace.  Brought the kiddos.  Definitely not a place you want toddlers but the restaurant was super accommodating.  Service could have been better but they were slammed.  Waiter was good and efficient and it was a great time.  I'd recommend this joint."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a Gen while being in AZ. I had to wait about 15 minutes to have a waiter acknowledge us at the table. Once we ordered we were rushed because the very young employees were wanting to get out early. I had to ask then for a second cup of hot tea and soda refill. It was really sad for a slow Friday evening. I will try another place next Spring..."}
{"text":"This place is a great find as i have been looking for an all you can eat Korean BBQ in Phoenix and have nothing on the west side of town.   Gen is a very clean environment with great pricing and a good selections of meat to choose from.  It is Located in Tempe Town Center and is the busiest restaurant in the place. During lunch we waited for twenty minutes to be seated which speaks volumes to how people will wait for GOOD and   prices food. Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Hostess was very abrupt, (nose ring?) We should have left when we were seated but decided to give it a try. Our server was very good with recommendations on what to order he should get 4 stars. The rude hostess was also our cashier which gave us our first and last impression. We will not return."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for dinner when I'm in Phoenix. Located in Tempe Marketplace behind Barns & Noble. Go early or the wait will be long. But it's worth it even waiting for 1 hour to get a seat. Makes you appreciate the dishes more. All you can eat buffet but limited to 2 hours. Open for lunch and dinner.   Get the salad to eat with the barbecue meats. Portions per servings are small so go ahead and order more when the previous dishes are delivered.   The exhaust system could be designed better for a huge dining hall. You will smell like bbq after dinner. There's also a projection screen to watch games or movies while you dine."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat. Everything was amazing! We ordered so much food but my favorite was the calamari and Spicy Pork Bogulgi. The ambience of the place was really modern, I'm surprised they have a place like this in Tempe marketplace. I will definitely be back, they have some cool looking cocktails I want to try. Only down fall was there wasn't hot sake, might not be a Korean thing (wasn't sure). They do however have cold sake :) ! Last but not least the waiters were so nice and helpful. It was my first time making my own Korean BBQ and had no clue what I was doing...nor am I a cook. Ha-ha. So thanks again to the wonderful staff."}
{"text":"This place is highly overrated, the waiters and waitresses are more concerned with changing out your heat plate then they are with serving any food. They act like they are doing you a favor whenever they come to serve you and you would think with that attitude that they would actually be serving good food but it is subpar at the very best. I was disappointed but not surprised."}
{"text":"I haven't even started eating and if we weren't with friends I would be leaving. If your child is taller than 50 inches, you're paying full price. My six year old son is being charged full price. Needless to say, we are not happy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing set up. Amazing atmosphere. Still going to give them 5 stars even though I want to give them 4 because they're so boujie and only have Lunch special Mon-Thurs. 5 stars because workers are friendly and food is bomb."}
{"text":"I've worked in F&B for over 15 years. I rarely write a bad review because I understand the BOH to FOH. My family and I ate here last night. Our table was HORRID. I went to sit down in a booth, the entire floor under our table was completely covered in grease/oil! My feet were sliding around when I was trying to scoot in to the booth. We asked the waiter kindly if we could move. He sent someone over to clean under the table. Which I understood that I guess because they were busy peak hour. The man brings a mop!! To clean grease...which did not help at all. I knew...it wasn't gonna be good. We should have left right there. But my kids really wanted to try it out. I had to put paper napkins on the floor to stop our feet from slipping. My shoes were covered in grease when we left, they whole time, something was dripping onto my shoe. Leather Vans RUINED. My sons water had a some kind of plastic string in it. We asked for new glasses of water. They brought an empty glass. Our food was coming out all messed up. I was so disappointed. It felt like they new we were having a bad experience and they clearly did not care, just pay us and get out. We felt robbed. $140.00 Dinner...$60.00 ruined Vans. Looks like I DID get robbed of $200.00."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly. Our servers are attentive, fast and efficient. Food came in quickly, side dishes are fresh.  Portion are great, food are tasty and good. Ambiance is relax, casual and great for meetings. I frequent here for Paleo diet. Price is definitely reasonable for AYCE. Love it here, I can recommend it and it's also nice to see this thriving local business do well in Henderson community!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Gen KBBQ! The food is great, the appetizers are actually really good. For $20, this is more than worth the price. But what I really enjoy about this place is the great servers! Usually, KBBQ restaurants lack in customer service, but every server I've had here has been nothing short of amazing. Today, I had $Alodia$, and she was great! She was always checking up on us, and she was super nice. She was really fast with our food and drinks and she was on top of our orders. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends!"}
{"text":"Eaten many times in the Huntington Beach GEN, here for work and craving Korean. Never been let down. KONRAD AND JR busted their asses to keep my belly fully. Pertty much stuck with the Hawaiian Steak and they kept them coming.   Thanks Guys!  KONRAD & JR for employees of the month!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now In two weeks. First time wasn't week with co-workers. Walked in its super nice. The food you cook its really cool. All you can eat and its soooo good. Great spot for a new date  Price is gate its 20 bucks a person or so"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Gen Korean BBQ House. We loved it! The value for the price was great. Good flavor and all you can eat. The place looked really clean and well maintained. The speed of service was also impressive, within five minutes of ordering our first round of dishes came out. The only down side for me may have been the chicken, paled in comparison to the pork and beef as far as quality of meat. Last but not least, our server was so nice and attentive. Ozzy made us feel welcome and was always ready to help. I would definitely eat here again soon."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in Las Vegas!! So happy to have AYCE in Henderson, close to our house. Great Atmosphere, very clean, food was fresh and service was excellent. I can't wait to bring my kids and family when they visit."}
{"text":"Interesting dining experience.  Food is brought out raw and you cook it at your table.  The food was pretty good, nice selection.  The only concern I had was the raw food (such as chicken) on the table where we were eating.... Service was good, a little slow at times as they were pretty busy. Overall, I'd recommend it for the experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Gen because of their excellent customer service and their delicious foods. They also carry a variety of choices to choose from and the proportions are small enough for you to try the whole menu if you ate with 2-3 people."}
{"text":"This was the best Korean bbq ever. I do wish they had more than macaroons for desserts, but this place is stellar."}
{"text":"Service here sucks. We saw our server about 2-3 times the entire time. We had to chase down a busser for refills and to replace the grill. The server only came around when we needed to order and when she dropped off our check. I only saw two servers on our side of the restaurant. They need to hire more staff and seat accordingly. The KFC chicken appetizer and the calamari was the only thing that stood out for me. The other meats were just bland. I really wanted to like this place since it's so close by and it's pretty cheap. But you have a two hour limit and it's hard to track down your server to actually order and once you do order it takes forever for the food to come out so you don't really get all you can eat. And the server had the audacity to ask us to give her a shout out on yelp and give the restaurant five stars for a free beer. That's the only reason this place has 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite all you can eat Kbbq place in town! They have a large variety of options for a reasonable price. They have high quality meats and every option is delicious. Every time we come here we always have a great experience. The staff is always welcoming and friendly. The service here is the best and shout out to our server Caylin for helping us last visit she's awesome! Would highly recommend people to come and eat here!"}
{"text":"This Korean BBQ has all you can eat options for about $20 per person. That's pretty reasonable considering their sizable menu. They have about 30 items to choose from.  I was a bit disappointed by the food. My sister commented that the meats tasted rather Americanized and I'm inclined to agree. I always get favorites like beef bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi at other Korean restaurants but when we got the food, it just didn't taste right. It tasted overly sweet and the charcoal flavor wasn't really there. The Korean fried chicken ended up being like this weird sesame chicken.  However, surprise hits were the beef brisket and the beef tongue. Both meats were sliced very thin and cooked really fast. The flavors here were nice, and we kept on ordering multiple orders of beef brisket.  The mashed potatoes were really good. The potatoes were slightly sweet (probably due to apple) and had some corn. We had multiple orders of this dish.  The grill we had was really weird. Despite using a lot of oil, the grills kept sticking. Maybe the heat was on too high? Maybe the grills were bad? Combination of both? We had to get the grill changed out like five times.  Also initially the service was really strange. Our server seemed disinterested and almost hesitant on getting us orders of food. Later on she lightened up and was more friendly about it, but the relationship started out strangely.  Anyway, this place is okay, a lot of the meats tasted funny, but there were some good hits."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because my boyfriend loves the location in Cali and we were excited that they opened one here in Henderson. To start off, the restaurant looked very clean and modern. There were plenty of seats and the vents did a great job at keeping the place smoke free and not smelling like a grill. Although it is a big restaurant, you would have to wait for a little bit since this place is plenty popular already.   At first, most of the staff members were very attentive. We were greeted once we entered and put on wait-list. Once we got to our seats, our server, Yuhao, did a great job at explaining how ordering food works, any drinks to start off with and what was or was not available for the day. Yuhao did a fantastic job at serving me and my friends. He constantly checked up on us and refilled our water.  The food served here is great. My favorite dishes were the brisket and KFC chicken. They have the best brisket ever! It was very nice to find a Korean BBQ place that served unlimited appetizers. A lot of their appetizers were good, especially the popcorn chicken. My friends and I also tried a lot of their meats that contained the \"thumbs up\" sign but found that a lot of them were not that great. The smoked garlic pork belly tasted like bacon and the red wine marinated pork belly tasted like Chinese sausage. I was very excited for the garlic chicken but was disappointed when it tasted like grilled chicken with nacho cheese. Besides those three, all of the other dishes were delicious and had a lot of flavor to them.   However, toward the middle of our meal, we noticed that our great service was dying. In the end, it seemed that our server was off the clock and new servers clocked in. This is where the customer service went from 10 to 0. None of the new servers ever bothered checking up on us. We wanted to order more food but it was almost impossible to get someone's attention even though my friends and I were constantly staring at any staff walking past our table. After two tries of trying to get someone's attention, I had to wave my hand and give the server the \"come here\" gesture for him to come to the table. My friend decided to order another appetizer but after waiting for over 15 minutes, he never got the food. We decided to just ask for the check and leave.   Overall, I would come back here because the restaurant has a lot of space and I love their appetizers and meat. $20 for unlimited appetizers and BBQ during dinner is a bargain. They just need improvement on continuing to take care of their customers after the servers switch shift."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here to eat Korean bbq quite often. I'm writing a review finally for a great service Kailin provided for us today. She always had a smile on her face with friendly and great service! Thanks Kailin! We will definitely sit in your section again and ask for you :)  Things to order: Cajun shrimp Pork belly Bulgogi Galbi Beef brisket Calamari"}
{"text":"I mean...they're still only charging $22 for dinner and they'll seat my fata$$ solo (meaning they seat parties of one).   My personal pro-tip. If you want a side of fried chicken or japchae have at least three other people to split it with. They say the portions are small but the portions are too big for ppl who want to use their most of their stomach space for grilled meats and seafood.   Another (possibly obvious tip) stagger your marinated and unmarinated meat because the only thing they have to grease up the grill is unmarinated meat. They're very liberal and quick with the grill changes but if you go unmarinated then marinated, you won't have to ask as much.   I like spice and calamari so I recommend the cajun calamari as something different to try here that you probably won't find or try other places. I don't recommend it if you don't like calamari. I don't think it'll convert you but If you do it's tasty.   The quality of the meat is good for the price. It's the best I've had among ayce places and they don't overdo it with the marinade on the marinated meats.   I was in the mood for soondubu. I'm not an expert or aficionado. I just like it. But while I liked mine as an owner, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to the discerning or the newbies. This is tofu soup for someone's who's thinking, \"yeah, tofu soup from an ayce kbbq place seems like a good idea tonight, and goodness that's a long sentence, and why am I still talking to myself?\"   Lastly, I guess I went during the grand opening. I can understand you want a lively atmosphere, but I don't need the bass booming during my meal. I don't know who does. \"Time to eat, let's turn up the music!\" said no one ever, \"I want to have to nurse a headache after my meeeeaaal!!!\"   Now, after all that. You might be baffled by the five stars. But the service was good, the food was good, the price was good. And after complaining four times (two before being seated, and twice after being seated [they asked]) the music got low enough that I didn't try to run to Walgreens and get ear plugs.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Absolutely Favorite Korean bbq place to go here in Las Vegas and California. But this location especially, they have absolutely great customer service. George was our serve but a few other servers helped us out as well Kaithlyn I believe was one. They all work together and I love that cause it helps give you the best experience.   The food here is always delicious. From the salad to all the appetizers and the meats. Our favorites are the chadol (beef belly), the beef brisket and beef bulgogi. We always get extra brisket sauce and salad dressing sauce to dip our meats and gyozas in.   We often come during lunch because it's such a great deal. It's only $16.99 for all you can eat which is awesome, we get around 8 plates of meat for the both of us usually and come out more than satisfied.   I'm so glad they built this location, it's a lot closer to us and local to anyone that comes to the strip. We live up north and it's so much nicer to drive only like 30 minutes vs an hour to the Henderson location."}
{"text":"Gen is probably one of my favorite Korean BBQ places because their selection of meat, their amazing salad and AYCE is a great deal. I'm from Cali and they have several locations out there and I have to say their Vegas location is just as good if not better cause they have great service here. Every time you come in everyone always greets you and I LOVE how large this restaurant is cause there's hardly ever a wait here. Many of the other Korean bbq blacks I've been to are much smaller and only have like 12-15 tables. This place has like at least 30 tables which helps out a lot. Specially on weekends.   My favorites are the Beef Bulgogi, Hawaiian Steak and the Beef Brisket. I also like getting the gyoza, the pork fried dumpling  things. Very good. Also I love the salads they're very basic but the dressing makes it amazing. I even get a side of the dressing and dip my meat in it. They have a ton of complimentary sides like kimchi, edamame (which you can order a whole side order of) potatoe salad, Cole slaw, tofu, and more. And these are unlimited as well. Some Korean bbq spots charge you extra for these sides. The strawberry lemonade is amazing btw, probably the best I've ever had right next to Lucille's.   This is definitely a great Korean BBQ spot especially if it's your first time, I think you'll have a great experience."}
{"text":"I never write a review although I often use Yelp to find the \"Gems\" of Las Vegas .. Well I have not only  found a gem of Las Vegas here at Gen, but also found the best waiter I've encountered in a while. I don't say this lightly, being that I have waitressed for many years myself . In description a good waiter is, pleasant, sincere, swift with service, engaging, presentable in dress, and mostly goes beyond their descriptive duties to satisfy the customer and give them an enjoyable dining experience. Well, Eugene, my waiter, encompasses all of this and more.  I say this because I have now had him as a waiter twice, and his enthusiasm for serving is contagious ... He suggested that we try \"new\" items, which I enjoyed. He finds out what you really want in your dining and goes the extra mile ... We never had to look around for service, drinks were always full, and we left feeling we got what we paid for and more... So, if you want that dining experience that I have just shared, go to Gen and ask for Eugene!!! I will! .. You Rock Eugene!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Korean barbecue, this location blew me away. I have been to their California locations, they are great and this one is very much the same. What stood out was the service. I honestly could not tell you the last time the service was so incredible. Drinks were refilled before they were halfway empty, everybody was friendly. Overall this place is absolutely outstanding. The server, Jan, was incredible"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's always my first place that comes to mind for Korean BBQ. Very large AYCE selection for a fair price. Jan is always a wonderful waitress! She's so hardworking and attentive, not to mention funny! $20/dinner, $15/lunch. Atmosphere is clean and modern. Doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Idk should I compare it with those Gen in CA, I have ever been to Bc this is Nevada. We asked for table for 11 people on phone and They said don't take reservation. We ask do they have big table for 11 they said they have it. We got in and they divided to 2 tables 10 and ... and then they told us he AC is broken. Why T heck didn't you tell me on the phone when I called in. Made me drive for 35 mins now tell me that ????  Moreover, when I got to the address I called and asked I can't see their store? The one on the phone said find your way here. I said I had the address. I'm here and I saw Jc penny n Macy's but I don't see Gen. she replied there are so many Jc penny n Macy's. Find ur own way to get here. I'm like WTF???  We got in they said 2 hrs for each table but looked what happened they took 30-45 mins for the food after our first round. It wasn't that busy.  Will you come here? Again?   Am I too picky? Of course not  They we were being rude to us first."}
{"text":"Our visit to Gen started off very well.  We were seated right away and had an amazing waiter with a great personality.  We came during happy hour and he said we would be charged the happy hour price for drinks.  Unfortunately he left without any notice and it was hard to get service after our initial order.  When we finally waved down somebody they were a little rude and acted like we were an inconvenience for trying to order more food.  We ordered more drinks about fifty minutes before happy hour ended as well.  When we got the check only our first two drinks had the happy hour price.  I would have gladly given this place five stars had we had our first waiter the whole time.  Our waitress just seemed unconcerned and stingy after he left.  She was also kind of rude when she brought our second round of drinks because she almost tossed the glasses and straws on the table.  I teach first grade and deal with rude children all day long, and I expect to be treated better when spending 100 dollars on dinner."}
{"text":"Mizzo and Seong were amazing when it came to customer service! Definitely will come back next week"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is pretty good too.  But my recent visit to this restaurant was for lunch and we decided to order a la carte instead of the bbq.  We ordered lunch boxes and wanted to order fried squid legs and we were told that we couldn't because we weren't ordering the Korean bbq...okay....then after our meal we asked for to go boxes since we didn't finish our food.  We had two boxes with no plastic bag because they have a policy of not giving out plastic bags...I mean, c'mon! If our server wasn't so nice I would've been upset about the whole experience. So three stars for the senseless policy.  I probably won't go back there anytime soon.  I will eventually...once I get over it."}
{"text":"This place is in a perfect location and the price is hard to beat. We went on a weekday afternoon and it wasn't very busy, the place is decorated nicely and very clean. Our server was very attentive and nice but left halfway through to go on a break and his replacement wasn't very attentive so we were waiting to order more food but no one came around to check on us so we spent a good bit of time waiting for more food. You can order lunch or dinner during lunch time I guess to get the extra items that aren't offered on the lunch menu but you can't order lunch for dinner I guess. The brisket is raved about here on Yelp a lot but I guess it left more to be desired as neither of us liked it very much. You cook your own food of course but the KFC comes cooked already and is delicious! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This is my very favorite KBBQ in Vegas. Dining area is super clean and staffs very friendly. This is definitely a fun place to go if you are wanting the true Korean BBQ experience. Amazing place and amazing choices of meat! Service was also pretty good. Food was delicious, What I loved was the meat quality you can tell immediately they are serving quality meats."}
{"text":"NEW FAVORITE ALERT! I went for AYCE lunch, and to keep it short, this is what I got out of the experience: amazing service (which is surprising because this is hard to see at most AYCE places), awesome menu selection (even for lunch), great price (so worth it!), and good food. I wish they had steamed egg and daechang (large intestine) in addition to their side dishes and meat, but overall, it's hard to see such an expansive menu with such a nice price. I'm so glad that this place is nearby because I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"We definitely ate more than we expected! Everything was delicious and on point when it came to the food. They have a variety of things that make just want to keep eating! I loved the garlic chicken with the jalapeño cheese sauce and the brisket!   Our service did not start off great with a server who knew she was going to be off shortly after we were seated. I usually feel my dining experience starts off with the server. She did not seem happy to be there and when we asked her for something it seemed to be a bother to her. The server that took over for her was 100% better named Ozzy. Ozzy was enthusiastic and very nice to make sure we have a wonderful dining experience. He made great recommendations to try and definitely convinced us to come back in the future.  I am glad Henderson has a place like this now. Great ambiance and great food! Look forward to coming back. :0)"}
{"text":"Easily the best Korean BBQ in the Henderson/SE area. On second thought, it might be the ONLY Korean BBQ place in the area :P Anyways, this is a very chic, contemporary restaurant; The interior is dim with blue lighting by the sitting area. I would say that the setting is nice for a date or a family outing. I haven't been to their CA locations but its a nice restaurant all around.  The prices are very reasonable, AYCE for under $25 and no choice A, B, C here - $25 gives you everything on the menu. The Red Wine Samgyupsal is to DIE for! This exclusive meat is by far my favorite selection on their menu. They have all the tried and true selections such as galbi, bulgogi, briskets and beef tongue. TIP: Order at least three dishes of the brisket and beef tongue. They give you literally 7-10 pieces per order, like what...That's not even enough to feed a small hamster. So make sure you order at least three at a time ;) The quality of the meat is very good and tastes fresh. The meat is chopped thin and nicely so they are easy and quick to cook.   The service is pretty good considering how busy it is. I've been there 4 times now and everytime it is a packed house. Still, the servers are diligent about refilling drinks and taking orders. To get seated, expect to wait at least 15 minutes if you have no reservations. On a busy night you might wait up to 30 minutes or more easily. Book a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"1st time at Gen today, it was a very pleasant experience. I was welcome by a hostess named Marisol. I felt so welcome because of her smile and attitude. I felt so welcome I will be returning with some friends."}
{"text":"i guess this place is a hit and miss when it comes to service depending on which server you get. The very last time I was here I was so disappointed with the service. First our server was a female and she was nice and after our first order she told us she's clocking out and that we are going to have a new server (she mentioned his name but I couldnt remember because this guy never introduced himself nor tried to serve us) and then I noticed this server that's serving the table next to us, which by the way had the same female server that finished her shift, so I assumed that this guy is our server too. But we kinda waited and he never approached us and he kept serving the other table asking them if they need something else, so my bf called him and asked we could have some more of the sauce (or dip) the server is polite and all, but he never came back with the sauce, and he brought more food to the next table, so we called him again to order more food and to ask for that sauce again, and he did come back with everything we asked for, but after that he never approached us again, he kept passing by and serving the other table but never once asked us if we need something else, when we needed a new grilling pan we had to call him again just so we would get help, and this is how it was the whole time, never once did he try to actually serve us, at this point I was so mad I was close to going to the front desk to ask who really is our server, although I know it's gotta be this guy orelse someone else would have already approached us. We still tipped accordingly out of respect but honestly I didn't wanna go back here after that night.. I don't know.. Maybe I will get a better service next time.. But im still very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go with a group of friends. We had a party of 6, and ordered the randomest things we could off the menu. It's fun to cook your own food and have a nice time with friends. The staff were friendly and service was quick. The dining room is very nice, new, and stylish and comfy chairs! Perfect place for family, date night, girls night, anyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I would give zero stars if that was an option. The first time I came it was amazing but I brought my family this time and we had a party of 7 they seated us a small table with one grill, we had to hold some of the places and side dishes as there was no room. We asked to be moved and felt like we were being punished. They seated us by the kitchen door and we were lucky if anyone came to ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything. We had dishes on the table that needed to be taken away and sat at the edge of the table table for 15 minutes before I was finally able to flag someone down. We were literally right by the kitchen door.  I waited half an hour for an order of gyoza. Will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Quality of food is decent. The attitude given by the hostess who seated us pissed my friend and I off completely. My friend and I walked in your restaurant each holding a milk tea we got while walking around the shopping mall under the 40 degree heat yesterday. Both of the drinks were 2/3 finished already as we walked in, and since we never had problems taking in personal drinks into any other restaurants, we simply didn't think of that there would be an issue with it. We walked in and were directed to our seats by a hostess with long hair and of Asian decent. After we were seated, suddenly the hostess yelled out, \"Umm we don't allow outside drinks...\" Well no one said anything as we walked in or as we walked all the way to our table toward the back of the restaurant. So not wanting to throw away our drinks as my friend and I just don't like to waste food, or walk back to our car under the horrible heat, I responded, \"This is our first time here, I'm sorry and I promise we won't do it again next time.\" The hostess, instead of giving some suggestions on how to deal with these drinks, rolled her eyes and made bitchy faces at my friend and I, and repeated, \" No we don't allow outside drinks.\" Meanwhile another waitress, who actually served our table, walked by and said to us that it is fine since we took seat already, just make sure to not do it next time. My friend and I nodded quickly and said thank you to the waitress a couple of times. You think this is over? Of course not!! So I looked over my shoulder, wanting to thank the hostess as well, thinking that she would agree to let us keep the drinks, but I saw her rolling her eyes again and walked away. A minute later a manger looking lady came over and insisted that they don't allow outside drinks. But she was very polite and kind and said we could keep our drinks at the front desk so they didn't have to be thrown away. I am not complaining the fact that they didn't allow outside drinks because my family owns a restaurant and they restrict outside alcoholic beverages. Although my friend and I had non-alcoholic milk tea drinks, I understand that each restaurant has its own rules and standards. But the whole communicating experience with the front desk hostess was just disgusting and she is perhaps one of the rudest hostess i've ever encountered. Maybe it is because she didn't get enough education on how to communicate properly with others, especially the group of people who help pay for her job!!! For the past fifteen years I've been in Phoenix, It is not uncommon for me to bringing my own bottled water or drinks into restaurant when I dine out. I have a very sensitive stomach and will get very bad stomach aches if I drank tap water, or drinks that are too cold. So I normally just take my own water or drinks as it has the perfect temperature and won't upset my stomach. And I have literally NEVER had a problem at any of the other restaurants, EVER!! Again, I respect that every restaurant has its own rules, and while I'm not going to argue if it is proper for customers to bringing half finished drinks that they did not want to throw away, I just want to say, one bad and rude hostess can really ruin someone's mood and dining experience. For the fact that even after another waitress said it was fine for my friend to keep our drinks, that hostess still turned around and reported us to the manager just so my friend and I couldn't keep our drinks. Really??? I just really hope that in the future, make sure to select well-rounded servers who received enough education and trainings to properly communicating with customers instead of rolling eyes and making  faces! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Gen Korean BBQ is a beautiful restaurant with great food.  So many delicious choices - Steak, Chicken, Pork Belly, Shrimp, Calamari and more.  My personal favorites were #4 Signature Pork Steak and #21 Cajun Shrimp.  Yuhao and Brian were incredible servers and food was Amazing! What an fabulous dinner deal $19.99 AYCE.  Brian, Assistant Manager Trainee, came over to check in on us at the end of our meal.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Richard, good hustle! You rock!!  We had a great experience at Gen KBBQ. Thanks for making the experience even better. Great food too."}
{"text":"I left hungry.   We came here on a busy Saturday night and completely expected the long wait time as we were regulars... before tonight's atrocious service.  The estimated wait time was 2 hours and we prepared our stomach's for this, so it was alright. We had barely been through our second order when they attempted to bring us the bill -- 30 #$^@ing minutes in. We are aware of the 2 hour rule and the 4 limit per order!   The front desk even tried to tell our waiter that we requested the bill when we did not. Uhm no.   After the 3rd order, they actually just dropped the bill on our table even when we were still actively grilling our food. You really wanted us to leave so soon?! We were only ordering brisket and spicy octopus :'(.   The food is great considering there is not much competition in the whole city as the Phoenix metropolitan area is still practically new to the world of KBBQ. The service here leaves much to be desired.  Come at your own discretion. I'll come back... maybe. One day Manna BBQ will start serving spicy octopus and I wouldn't have to deal with this!   Tldr; It's bad service because I felt rushed and I left hungry."}
{"text":"good food, nice place! there is a mall beside. Why yelp keep saying my comment is too short?"}
{"text":"What a great Korean BBQ place with perfect pricing! I highly recommend this place, all you can eat for $19.95 for dinner and $14.95 for lunch. Can't really beat that price! This place also has a bunch of appetizers you can choose from.   JJ was our server today and she was absolutely phenomenal as a waitress. Very attentive and friendly! She always go above and beyond and made sure we had enough food. She also constantly checked on us to make sure we were satisfied. Overall, service was good, food came out quick and we were seated right away.   San Diego needs to have one of these places!"}
{"text":"The food choices were very good. Their seasonings on their meats made the cut. I went here for my birthday dinner with some friends. The night club aesthetic was a little unexpected but not too bothersome. They didn't have that many choices in soju for being a Korean BBQ restaurant. They should market it with more of an American twist, as it is. My biggest concern was the wait staff. After being asked if we wanted refills, we had to ask an additional two times to get said refills; had to ask three times for more kimchi; and twice for mung bean noodles. This wouldn't be my first choice to head to, even though it's the closest to me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in their opening week and have had good experiences both times. It's really packed at lunch, so it's convenient that Galleria Mall is right next door. They'll text you when a table is ready so feel free to shop around or even gamble for a while right across the street.  Something I've noticed is that their pork belly has a noticeable amount of cartilage in it.   They seem strict with their two hour rule and they will also charge for any food you didn't finish within the time limit. They also give small portions at a time (which takes a while to come out), so I wouldn't recommend coming with parties larger than 6.  I know that they just opened, so I have faith that they'll do much better in a few months. Hopefully they keep the prices low as well (1 time charge for refillable soft drinks & $19 for their 32 item dinner menu + appetizers.)!"}
{"text":"I am the guru of Korean BBQ.   Let's start with the Initial entrance. Greeted promptly, sat right away, also Informed of Price differential Up front instead of After the fact.   The place has a modern and very contemporary ambiance, also it is Very fun, loud, and happening.  It's clean and The Tables have a Specific set up that  I really find Amazing.   It took our waiter a minute to come out, but we did Need some time to turn on our grill. Apparently The vent that sucks the smoke interferes with the Grills starter. But none the less we got our grill going and waited for service. Our server was very nice, very prompt, met all my request. Got all orders out to us in a timely fashion. He did forget some things however it is busy.. as usual, so it's not a big deal that he forgot some things.   The food: my favorite part.  The marinades are Very tasty, bulgogi was very tasty, beef chedol , Hawaiian Steak and chicken of course was Amazing, the Ban Chan refills were Endless. All pork products were amazing.   Prices: Dinner prices on Weekends  Recommendations: Have a little Saucer with Oil and A brush to Brush a Little on the grills to minimize Having to switch them out so much and Also Prevents food from sticking to much.   Love this place. Until Next time.    Four stars given cause we had some grill oning issues ( waiter or Hostess should be turning them on )"}
{"text":"Always love coming here! The music is great,the food is amazing,and my food server is awesome. If you ever have Luke as your serve just know he will treat you good! Keep up the good man!"}
{"text":"A good all you can eat restaurant for people who like to enjoy Korean BBQ. 2 hours to have meals there, so you can try as many meats and dishes as you want. The price for lunch is fair, merely $14.95 per person. There are 29 choices of meats and dishes for you to enjoy, as well as some side dishes. The flavor of dishes ordered by us is good. Meats are fresh and juicy. It's a good place for group gathering."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean bbq in Arizona!!! The only thing I would recommend is getting piece of fat to grease the tray so that the meat doesn't get stuck. Other than nothing it's amazing. Their kimchi is TO DIE FOR. All of their meats are really good as well. Never had any issues with this place. So glad it's so close to home as well!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good! Service was so fast! Habram is the best!! For sure we'll come again for more!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I tried out this awesome spot today for lunch... Such a rad place for lunch! Every item we tried (and we tried a lot) was so good!!!! And our waitress JJ was the sweetest and super quick to bring our orders, clear our empty dishes and change out our grill. She made a few menu item suggestions and was on point every time! We will be back... Soon!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Korean barbeque...it was a fun experience. The menu is fairly big...basically you can order 2 things at a time to cook at your table. The salad and dressing that comes with dinner was really good. I tried another Korean bbq after this one I would only recommend this one. The hawaiian steak was my favorite."}
{"text":"Ok now that I have time to write this....see I have been here plenty of times but this most recent time (Saturday night on 06/04 ) our service wasn't so great. We literally had to remind our waiter more than 7 times for our appetizers and sides. If it was once then I wouldn't be as irritated but seriously more than  7 times ? Barely checked up on us even when we were ready for more meat with our menus in our hands. That's just ridiculous we spent most of our time waiting. When our waiter found the time to take our orders the people who brought out the food were great and made it out in great timing. I mean I get it ,it can be busy and hey the guy may be new. But I honestly don't think those are excuses on just our one little table. To be reminded on orders that many times as if he didn't have a little book to write it just seems to be a little unprofessional to me. Made our dinner very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Wow, a Korean bbq place I can take my wife to.  This place is great.  I have been here a lot and have  Been impressed every time. It's clean, fast, trendy, and good.  A lot of the Korean barbecue places I go to are not \"general public friendly\". They are authentic, but that doesn't lend itself to a great business meeting or dinner out with my wife. I am a huge Korean barbecue fan, and so I try any new one in or around me. I believe I have been to every one in the Phoenix area.  This place is all you can eat, they do make sure you understand the rules and tend to repeat them a lot. Don't order a bunch of food and not eat it, or they will charge you for it.  This place is the biggest Korean barbecue restaurant I have ever been in. And they have a line on Fridays and Saturdays that is two hours long. I recommend going for lunch and getting there around 1130. You'll get seated right away, get a little bit better prices, and have the same good food. Lunch service is fast, and they do check up on you regularly to make sure you're not waiting for more items.  The servers are nice and efficient. The food is good, although some of the meat selections are less flavorful then other places in the valley.    Overall this is highly recommended for both the Korean barbecue aficionados as well as beginners. The only drawback is the sides they bring including kimchi are small to start and you have to ask for refills quite often. They also have a much smaller selection of sides then most of the other places I've been."}
{"text":"Wait time for 2 was 5-10 minutes, not bad for an all you can eat spot. When we got to our table there was a pretty late amount of food on the floor that the hostess said she would get cleaned up but no one ever came. Minus half a star for cleanliness.   Portion sizes were moderate, but you can order as much as you want so I guess it's not that big of a deal. Food quality was excellent and flavors were on point. Would recommend the beef short plate and the garlic or miso pork belly.   For two dinners and a soju plus tip I spent about $75, which is pretty pricey in my opinion for kbbq. I've had similar experiences in LA for a third of the price. Minus half a star for price-value relationship.   Our server JJ was BOMB. Extremely friendly and helpful with suggesting food options. Definitely recommend asking for her as a server if she's working."}
{"text":"Love this place. I swear my boyfriend and I come here every two weeks. The foods amazing. the price is great for the quality of not only food but service. Defiantly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Service was great Julian was an amazing server. Also as usual the food was fresh and fantastic. If you ever come in which you should make sure to teybthe KFC it's awesome."}
{"text":"We've been to Gen about 5 times already. Every time, it gets better! After the 1st couple of times, they have added more staff and had quicker services. One thing that I really like about Gen is the ambiance. I've been to quite a few Korean BBQ restaurants and I would say that Gen is #1 when it comes to ambiance and cleanliness of the establishment. The food are served in nice looking plates. The only thing that is stopping me from giving it a 5 star is the fact that sometimes, it is extremely hard to get a table and they do not take reservations. Another is the fact that they don't have fish cakes, which is OKAY because what they're missing with the fish cakes, they make up for in their large selection of appetizers. So all in all, this place is pretty great! I highly recommend it, especially during lunch! Great price and less crowded. :D"}
{"text":"Finally a GEN opens in AZ. Just like the California locations except tofu soups come in a plastic bowl instead of the stone pots and no rice paper. Other than that, service was on point and food was great! Only \"annoyance\" is only being able to order 4 proteins at once regardless of how big your party is. When you are at a table of 6.. trust me we'll kill a plate of brisket in 2 minutes."}
{"text":"The five stars are for yuhao aka Howard and the manager who made up for the service. Howard made sure to check on us often and check with the kitchen to see what was up with the wait for the food. I asked to talk to the manager and scared him a bit. I told the manager about the experience, our great server,and the rude.bartender who had false advertised price for a sake bottle. He hooked it up with a free karaft for the table with sake believe soju,was delicious! I am from California and my Rancho Cucamonga location is the best but for the first location to be out of California its good but needs some turn up music and a stronger team. I'm routing for you!(:"}
{"text":"Very welcoming when you first come in.The staff was very attenitive and our drinks were never empty. Food was great as always.Get the Hawaiian pork belly!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I would definitely reccomend this place if you're around the Henderson area and craving for some good korean BBQ. I would also like to shout out Kailin for the fantastic service!!"}
{"text":"Ive been here few times and I cant believe I never wrote a review lol.    First of all the ambiance is great!!! I also like the fact I dont really smell like Kbbq unlike other places because the vent is underneath.   The meat is fresh and theres a lot of selections.   I wish they still offer seaweed salad and squid legs for appetizers :(  Our server OZZY is AWESOME!!!! He is soooo nice and always check up on us. Ive never had a server that attentive at this place."}
{"text":"Uhm no. Terrible service, small portions, bad meat quality, and did I say terrible service? Stay away!! Don't waste your time.  Other than what I had already mentioned, there was an incident during our dining experience where I accidentally spilled water. If I had not waived down a server/bus person endlessly, they were not going to do anything about the spill on the table even though they were walking by our table multiple times ignoring the situation. They didn't even offer a new glass of water when everything was half-ass cleaned. Only the floor was wiped but not the table. The food that had water in them was not replaced or taken away. I know it was my fault to spill the water but accidents do happen and I was once a server so I know what level of service is to be expected when drinks are spilled as it happens more often than not.  I can only see this place getting 4 stars because people that are giving high ratings are not used to going to real korean bbq places so Gen blows their clueless minds."}
{"text":"On Monday, my friends and I decided to go and try this new place. We were celebrating our friends birthday. We had a short wait for our table which isn't bad. When the hostess sat us down, she let us know how it worked. Our waiter Kevin came over and went through it one more time and asked if we were ready to order. He kept the food coming and always checking back with us. He was super attentive to the table. All the servers were really on their game. I would definitely be going back and letting my friends & family know about this place. The price wasn't bad and the variety of meats and appetizers were"}
{"text":"Our server was Alodia. She was really great. She suggested some stuff that like the japchae, it was real good. I think this has been like the second or 3rd time I've gotten her as a server.  She made our experience a positive one. :)"}
{"text":"Great Up & Coming Korean food. For a good AYCE lunch/dinner for 15/20. I enjoyed the modern atmosphere Gen was going for. This place is about to be a challenge for Sura & Honey Pig on Spring Mountain. I hope to come back if I'm in Henderson. The staff is excellent."}
{"text":"AYCE is great and good place to be among friends. 4 people is good. Having a huge group might not be good because it takes a long time to cook your food and waiting is not that great."}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars if I could. It was hotter than hell in there when we went. The AC was broken and we were seated by the doors (this was in summer) the broken AC isn't why I gave ZERO stars.  I gave zero stars because the menu reads as this marinated wondrous meat and you get plain beef. Apparently, you season yourself which is fine but they only provided you with 1/2 tsp of salt. Lol anyone who seasons their meat knows this amount of salt for all the proteins we ordered is useless. We also ordered the pork belly... joke was on us. We got bacon (I know punny since bacon is tech pork belly). And this \"pork belly\" was awful it tasted old and just plain BLAH! Costco thick cut bacon has everything on that trash. We asked our server to stop our time (20 mins maybe) and that we weren't enjoying ANY of what we ordered. He didn't say much just got the manager.. the manager was THEE absolute most unprofessional manager I've ever been in contact with. We asked if we could just pay for what we ordered. He stated it didn't work that way. I said we wouldn't be paying full price because we took one bite of our 3 proteins and HATED them all. He screamed \"get up get up!!! Get the fuck out\" so we did. My husband and I stood outside the front doors just looking at each other shocked. Lol what a joke."}
{"text":"This was a great eating experience! We had excellent service for our party of 15 by Soeng! He delivered a professional and orderly service of drinks and food. Defiantly gonna come back..."}
{"text":"The bulgogi was one of the best and our server Howard and luke were generous"}
{"text":"Went over here for the first time yesterday with the family! It was really an amazing experience! Every thing tasted fresh and also they had a a wide verity of marinaded meats and al a carte choices! The staff was very nice and customer service was really superb. Our server Kalin was really sweet and nice! Overall a good first time and good start for gen! Oh almost forgot!!!! Those people who eat that kbbq know this but usually when you have kbbq you usually get a bbq smell all over you but at gen their ventilation is amazing and their grill system gets no bbq smell on you at all! It's and interesting system   Ps: get the red wine pork belly, brisket, and the Korean chicken( al a carte menu)"}
{"text":"I gotta say this place my favorite place for AYCE Kbbq. The waiters/waitresses are very involved in their customer service. Our Waitress Alodia was very fast and efficient and I didn't have to get her attention to order more. I believe was his name was Greg, he was very good and fast at clearing  our table for more space. Great place! it's a must if you're looking for some quality kbbq!"}
{"text":"Third time around!!! We sure love this place and we love our awesome waiter (Ozzy ) who gives great service with a smile!!!  We waited 3hours but it was worth the wait. Saturday night and pre-Valentine / Happy Birthday to me  Thanks Ozzy and Gen staff!!!!"}
{"text":"This place blows - don't be fooled by the 4-5 star reviews given from the freebie promotion they ran during their grand opening phase.  Please ignore the people who proclaim this is the best AYCE or Korean BBQ they've ever had.  It's not even close to that -  I would say it's the worst in Vegas.    Pro's - cheap, 20 bucks, a lot of variety to choose from, and while you wait you can kill time in the mall and dl an app that shows you your place in line which is updated frequently   Cons - oh boy.....  Gimmicky and lacks any Korean culture/experience.  Waiters aren't knowledgable of food.  You can only order 4 orders of meet and they are TINY portions.   We must have placed a good 5-6 orders.  A plate of brisket will have 9-10 pieces.  Everything you pretty much have to ask for like sesame sauce, rice.  They don't offer rice paper or lettuce.  The meats are average at most.  A few of the apps were frozen.  I could go on....  Pretty much go anywhere else.  If you wanna save money then go to Hwaro which is the same price. Or pay 15 bucks more for dinner and get much better food at Lees.  Or pretty much go anywhere else but here.  This place seriously sucks a55."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been dying to go here for months and finally got to visit the restaurant tonight. The food was good and everything but our experience was kind of ruined by our server Shirley. She asked us if we had been there before and we told her no and then she pretty much vanished for the rest of the night. She didn't explain the condiments at the table. She didn't explain anything about the meats. She didn't give us anything to eat our food with or napkins. We kept having to ask other servers walking by for things or the busser. At one point we sat at the table with our food burning because we had no plates to put it on. We pretty much just wanted to get out of there at that point because we were so frustrated. I'm not sure if we will be back although the Hawaiian steak was delicious. Maybe next time when you have people that have never been to a restaurant like that you spend at least 60 seconds explaining things really quick. We never got an apology for her extended absence and we left still not knowing what all those condiments were and what they were best used with. Pretty bummed we wasted our second date night without our baby since she's been born feeling clueless, embarrassed, and awkward at a restaurant we were so excited to try."}
{"text":"Great service Decent food  Modern looking for an all you can eat restaurant. The tofu soup wasn't warm at all even I asked to warm it up. However, the waiter was very kind to change the whole new bowl for me, it was still the same temperature as the first one. So i gave up eating it. Thats the only thing I complain for this visit.  My waitress was super nice so everyone is."}
{"text":"Gen KBBQ opening in Vegas has been highly anticipated and lives up to the wait. Trendy vibe and an assortment of food on the menu! Our servers Lisa and Mizzo were great and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Decent wait. Great atmosphere. I was in town to see my brother and we tried this place. I'll try it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Just finished our weekend lunch - $22 each.   I'll start by saying everything we ate was excellent; HOWEVER, look up and around before you consider dining here.  This place is filthy!   Halfway through our meal, a clod of dust fell onto our table.  We look up and see a thick layer covering the walls.  We started looking around and this place looks like it hasn't received a thorough cleaning in years.  Isn't this a new building???  I'm really not too picky or one to complain to management, but this totally raised my disgust meter.  I decided to mention this cleanliness issue to the hostess as I walked out the door only to be met with a half-hearted,\"Oh really? Sorry.\"  No offer to tell a manager, no actual apology.  Well, thanks for raising my toddler's immune system.  Gross.  Needless to say, I can't see returning to this place.. too bad."}
{"text":"Customer service sucks.   My first visit was cool, good enough for this restaurant to get a second visit from me.  It is not really traditional Korean food. They do have the meats and the flavor of those meats have hints of Korean flavor, but its clear that their goal is for you to throw on the feedbag and chow down. It is clear that they are not interested in their patrons enjoying an authentic Korean culinary experience. I can accept that. No gochujang? Ok, It's like the ketchup of Korean and you don't have it. Might as well just have the ban chan be dill pickles and olives.  My second visit had me fuming. I had a coupon and showed it to the waitress. She said ok and told me to give it to her when the bill came around. The meal was uneventful, aside from the shame of no gochujang. The bill came via the manager and I provide my coupon. He tells me they do not accept it anymore. I point out that it is not expired and I did show it to the server; she did not alert me to what he is telling me now. The manager tells me that they do not accept the coupon anymore, nothing he can do, it came down from corporate. I pointed to the waitress and said she told me to just give the coupon to her when the bill comes. The manager told me that staff is new, they are not trained.  Long story short, they did not honor my coupon. What made me angry was that the manager was argumentative and made no accommodation for the situation. No apology. The server essentially accepted the coupon when I showed it to her (as the coupon stated) and then the manager said J/K... ha ha.  Tip: the customer is NOT always right at this location."}
{"text":"Wow! Just ate here for the first time after seeing all the great reviews and it was amazing. Austin was our server and he was amazing!! So friendly and always offering great recommendations. The staff is very attentive; always on top of cleaning out dirty plates and changing your grill top even if they aren't assigned to you table. I will definitely be coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Not Bad for the price $15 per person AYCE Lunch & $20 Dinner . The atmosphere is more hip and up to date than a traditional korean BBQ restaurant . They play pretty good music while your dining. Establishment is really clean although the restroom could use a little cleaning . Service is a hit or miss depending on the time you go I guess . Been here 2x in a matter of 2 weeks .1st time I went with my brother and my oldest daughter ,  service was very slow and they kept forgetting  items we ordered and we had to keep asking . Food was good though.  2nd time I took my husband and brother . It was my husbands first time every eating at an AYCE KOrean BBQ and he enjoyed it. This time around the service was excellent and fast . They had us seated immediately and our orders were out within 2-4 min. Our server was pretty nice and kept checking on us.  Honestly can't go wrong with this place . I've heard there are better places in Las Vegas but this location is down the street from my moms and it's connected to the Galleria Mall (after stuffing your face , you can walk around the mall)   I would come here again, I would consider this my go to AYCE korean place when I'm in Henderson .   My review of 4 stars is based on my 2nd visit and not my first because had it been then I could only give them a 2.5 for the food due to the service .   Give it a try , can't disappoint . (food wise for the price )"}
{"text":"Ive been going to gen since they opened. The other night we had a party of 5 did our first order which was 3 orders of beef tongue, 2 orders of roast beef, spicy chicken and 2 orders of shrimp. 3 glasses of chardinay (spelt wrong) and 1 mango cocktail. The wine took 30 minutes to receive mango drink never came. First order came within 10 minutes.  Did a second order and it never showed up. Asked about 3 time they said next on line. After 35 minutes decided we were leaving. I would of been happy just paying for the 3 drinks and 1 all you can eat cause that amount of food would fill 1 person up. Nope charged for 4 all you can eats and the drinks were taken off.. Very unprofessional and sad. Seems with all the new servers they have gone down hill.."}
{"text":"Food was alright, I still prefer Gangnam in Mesa. The seating arrangements are somewhat awkward. Service was slow, it was busy so I can understand that... but we got our food before our drinks."}
{"text":"Here at Gen a-gen ;) The lighting him is slightly dimmed and the neon/purple-blue lighting around the booths gives it a nice modern feel compared to other AYCE Korean BBQ places. They have a large variety of meatsfrom seafood, chicken, pork, and red meat and appetizers. I can never get enough of their Japchae noodles-- keep em comin'! Also, there soju is probably one of the better sojus I've had. I almost can't taste the alcohol, BUT it most definitely creeps on you. I recommend strawberry, lychee, mango, and the yogurt flavors.   The only thing I was not a big fan of was their dessert macaroon ice cream. It taste like it's been sitting and it's too hard. Cute ice cream though!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. Food is amazing and the price is worth it. Staff is attentive--specifically Yihao!"}
{"text":"Came here when the squad and I took a trip to Vegas -- it was a good time with plenty of food. The restaurant is spacious, seating is comfortable, and service was consistent and quick. Plenty of meat options to indulge in. I ordered mango soju here and it made for a good pregame for night time festivities on the strip!"}
{"text":"Oh Man oh man.... We went here did the all you can eat wow flavored were rockin!!! Just hard for the servers to hear to because music is so loud. My husband said tall bud however they brought a tower of bud... WASTE OF MONEY BUT WHATEVER ... Still gave a five !! Service and flavor a were on point"}
{"text":"Upon arriving - the decor was ok and the staff was friendly.   Once seated, the hostess told me about the all you can eat option, but did not advise that it was mandatory. We ordered drinks (hot tea) that did not arrive until 10 mins into my meal. My Mom doesn't eat meat, only fish, so she ordered the popcorn shrimp appetizer. I told our server about this and she didn't say anything. She also ordered the seaweed salad (which never arrived).   Upon receiving the bill, I saw a charge for 2 all you can eat meals. I let the hostess know we only had one AYCE as my Mom is not able to eat meat, so she ordered an appetizer which the server acknowledged. She let me know AYCE is mandatory and she would have to get the manager.   The ONLY reason I am giving this restaurant a 2 star rating is because the manager was extremely accommodating and pleasant about this issue. He didn't hassle me and fixed this issue. He advised that individual pricing is on the menu for appetizers only as a courtesy for lunch, not dinner (again, not explained). Thankfully though, he was great.  The food was OK, nothing like the quality or authenticity you'd receive in China/Korea town.   I will probably never return to Gen."}
{"text":"Came for the first time after its opening. The food here was very good and the service was fantastic. they had the tables with the side dishes set up before we even got there which was new because more Korean restaurants don't do this normally. They were able to bring out our meat dishes fairly quickly and took away our finished dishes as well. The kfc and the fried squid legs were surprisingly good. Wasn't expected that from a kbbq place. My server Eugene was extremely helpful and friendly. He frequently came to our table to see if we needed anything and when we did, he was very prompt in getting what we needed. This was a surprising and appreciated service I received compared to other kbbq restaurants. Thank you for the great service Eugene"}
{"text":"This Korean BBQ is all you can eat. They have good customer service and long tables if you have a big party. They do take reservations which is nice. My favorite is their short ribs. They have a pork cutlet which comes with a great sauce. They have a hip vibe to them and they have some really cool lighting everywhere. They don't have the fans that drop down which helps you to be able to see the people across from you. They have good parking and clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Great food, $25 AYCE was worth it, and awesome service. Didn't have liquor license yet, which was a bummer. Oh well - it saved us the extra calories."}
{"text":"Tried GEN AYCE KBBQ Las Vegas on Sahara tonight ... they didn't disappointment.  It's very vibrant. They cater to small & large parties.  The food was delicious & fresh! A variety of banchan at the table from kimchi, kimchi cucumbers, mashed potatoes & pickled radish.  They bring you rice, salad & japchae.  Rufio & Jason were our main wait staff, who were AMAZING.  Thanks for suggesting the flat iron brisket, it was delicious & full of flavor! Plenty of FRIENDLY & quick support staff on hand bringing food, making sure we had our water filled, grill changed & everything in between.  Keep up the exceptional service.  Currently no bar service (pending liquor license) but plenty of non alcoholic drinks to choose from.  Looking forward to our next visit when we are back in town."}
{"text":"We are so full from eating here!!! Alodia and Julian provide the best service I ever experienced in Korean restaurant. $20.99 for 34 choices! My kids loved the old and believe me they tried a lot!! Don't forget to get the rice wrap to wrap your meat! I told my husband let's come back tomorrow lol"}
{"text":"Use to be my favorite spot until yesterday. Even though it was Valentine's Day and they're trying to get people in and out, I shouldn't have to feel rushed. The waiters/busboys need communication training as they did a poor job last night. I had one busboy ask if he could remove the side dishes in which I gave the okay for. However he not only got rid of the side dishes but removed pretty much everything from our table including tools being used, rice bowls still in use, and topped it off with shutting down our grill. We barely finished our first round of orders at this point. I let it go and simply asked for another waiter to bring us New utensils and restart the grill. However all night they kept taking things without asking. Plates still being used, utensils still in use, somehow sneaking in and turning off our grill. I finally had it when another waiter came by and snatched up my chopsticks in which I kindly told him \"oh sorry boss I'm still using those.\" He snapped them right in front of me and said \"would you like another?\" in a rather annoyed voice.  Like I said I understand it's a holiday but it's hard to eat when things like chopsticks and rice bowls keep disappearing without your consent. I feel the staff need to do a better and clearer job when removing things from the table. To top it off some of the orders came in doubled, took long, or never came at all. My date and I left frustrated and will not be looking to comeback anytime soon which ultimately sucks because it was our favorite spot."}
{"text":"I am SO GLAD this place finally opened up! I go to Gens all the time when I visit California, and it's about time they made their way to Arizona! The wait time was really long, but that was expected since they opened just a couple days ago. The food and service was great! All of the employees were friendly, and the meat came out so fast. We had no issues whatsoever. The only sad part was they had no alcohol. I was told that they will after their grand opening, though! I can't wait to go back again. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean restaurant!! It didn't disappoint me! The food quality is superb! Very delicious! I've tried a lot of bulgogi, and gen's is my favorite! The service is pretty good as well. I love everything in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Realistic.... They spilled grease all over my sons pants and neck only offering a apology never really coming back to make sure everything is ok especially after they may have ruined my sons jeans .. I will do my best to get it out of his jeans if not I'll be going back with the pants they can pay for the spot larger than softball . The hosts not very nice the steak was the best thing there .. only going back for a dry cleaning bill if needed otherwise won't be back sad cause we live right there ... probably could use a little more compassion we understand accidents happen but ... customer service is key"}
{"text":"Food Was great! I loved The spicey octopus!  Thanks ozzy for that wonderful service!!"}
{"text":"I was hopeful to see a Korean BBQ place in Henderson. I've heard mixed reviews from friends that have tried this place so I decided to check this out with some friends that are Asian. I have been to many Korean BBQ including the ones in Korea.   This place would NOT be on my list to go. The atmosphere is not what I expected. The waiter we had was not friendly. They squished seven adults in a small booth with not enough table space for food to grill and eating. We basically cooked our food ourselves. The condiments were mediocre. No service. Maybe because some of us were Asian? I don't know.  The price is cheap, but so was the quality of the meat. I definitely had better. Overall, the whole experience was not that good. I was hoping I would like something to come back. I think for people who may not have experienced the whole Korean BBQ thinks this is great, but not for me. I will go elsewhere. Too bad, we need a great place in Henderson. In the meantime, I will do this at home or go to the west side of town."}
{"text":"So, overall terrible experience. I'm a huge fan of GEN in LA, but the Henderson location is one of the worst restaurants I've ever attended. They seated us promptly but then our order was forgotten about TWICE. Not 1, but 2 times \"the kitchen was overwhelmed and lost the ticket.\" The server was anything but attentive. He never refilled, never checked in. We had to ask another server where our food was and he came to let us know the kitchen had lost our ticket. I had to ask for manager, he did seem to attempt to fix the issue. My recommendation is the one in Glendale, CA - much better atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"Julian was our server and he was the shit! Two thumbs up for sure! Food here is never disappointing. Definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"We got here and they stated it would be about a 30-45 minute wait. Normal time for Korean BBQ. Had us set up with text message alerts that let us know when a table was ready. About 10 minutes later we got a text and were seated. Way ahead of time. This place exceeded all my expectations throughout the entire night. Out server was Ozzy and he was probably the best server I have had at any restaurant. Ever. If he's reading this I want to say thank you for a wonderful first experience keep up the amazing work that you do ! Gen has replaced my go-to Korean BBQ hotspot, Tofu Hut and blew it out of the water. Hope to have way more amazing experiences like I did tonight."}
{"text":"I come to Gen about 3 times a month mostly for lunch because they're less busy but today we went for dinner. Unfortunately I had the worst service from them, service is usually never a problem here, they're always great! Our server clearly hates her job or was just having a really bad day, I think her name was Jaenice. We were missing utensils, she was hard to find when we wanted to order, & I never saw her smile once. I actually saw her roll her eyes at another employee. The one good thing was the food, I can't complain about that ever."}
{"text":"So the Bf and I decided to venture out a little to try another kbbq. And what a great choice tonight! There was 34 items on the menu to choose from and a handful of seafood options. Along with that it does not include the side items and the apps which probably makes 50+ dishes for ayce kbbq for 19.95$ what a steal!  Service was top notch from our server joe then ozzy, to all the food runners and busters that was completely on point about changing the grill and getting drinks refilled!  What an awesome date night! I heard of mention that there may be one in the north side of town...someone please confirm this for me? :D ONE HAPPY DUCKY!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! It totally satisfied my love of high protein, low carb meals. The price was very reasonable for the unlimited amount of meat and shrimp options to choose from. A delicious leafy green salad was brought to our table. Our servers (we had two) took very good care of our group of 8. Cooking our own food on the grill was fun! Overall, we were very pleased with our experience at Gen (Galleria Mall Henderson location)"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Service is horrible! I am writing this review as I wait for someone to take my order... So far I've been waiting for almost 15 mins and counting. Trust me I will be asking to speak with a manager. Don't come here unless you have tons of time to waste!   ** after speaking to the manager, the server was much more attentive. When I payed the bill the hostess was very unapologetic , and actually pretty rude. I would of thought the manager would of offered some kind of compensation after our inconvenience, but I had to pay the whole bill of $147.51 (which included 18% gratuity for their bad service), probably not going to come back anytime soon **"}
{"text":"I'm sad to give this place a rating less than 5 stars. My classmates and I are frequent customers and have been returning for good korean BBQ for months now. However, the last few visits have been noticeably different as far as service, quality of meat, and overall dining experience. We literally have to ask for our waiter/ waitress to return, our empty plates are piled high at the edge of the table and bus boys will walk by without touching them, and items that we order never come out unless we ask for them repeatedly.  As far as the quality of meats go, we always order their #1 and you get a beautiful cut of steak. Lately the steak has been brownish/blue on the edges like it was the cut on clearance at walmart.  I'm not sure wether this decline in quality is due to new management or just random bad days for them, but I do know I'll be finding a new place to try for Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Pretty decent AYCE price, some good picks on the menu, and an overall unique vibe. With the huge spacious interior and counter-style seating areas, it almost feels like you're eating in a very modern adult-sized lunchroom.  My main issue was their lack of preparation and efficiency. This restaurant ran out of rice... RICE! We had to sit waiting with our ready-to-grill food for a solid 20-30 minutes before rice was served. If it was any other item, I wouldn't have knocked a star off my review - but any person who has had K-BBQ knows rice is the most necessary part of your meal. They also gave us a crazy small (and laughable) portion of edamame so I assumed they were low on that too.  I know they are reasonably new and having such a large restaurant (with so many mouths to feed) must be an adjustment, so I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and hope not to experience that same problem again. Our server was very nice to us and I'd easily come back again, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Food was so good and the staff was fast they kept coming at us and making sure we were served well.  Thank you do much for making our Christmas party AWESOME...EVERYTJING WAS GREAT and the Ambiance. Highly recommend it and were coming back againfh"}
{"text":"I live in Southern California and there are a couple in my area that I frequent, but this experience blew my local Gen locations out of the water.  First off, we were seated immediately, despite calling ahead and being informed of a 30 minute wait. The side dishes and water were brought within minutes.  Our server, Alodia, was so attentive and understanding of our requests. We had a group of 6 and we really REALLY like the rice paper, she was so great for constantly bringing us the rice paper and sides we needed. In addition, all our meat orders arrived very swiftly.   At one point we asked another server for Hawaiian Steak (which is what it is called at the Gen in my area, but apparently is not the name here) and he tried to guess what we wanted based on how we described it, but it ended up being a meat we didn't want, and Alodia was so understanding and took the incorrectly ordered meat away and explained that the one we wanted is actually called Galbi.   All around spectacular service, this is absolutely our favorite location and best believe we will be making coming to this Gen a new tradition for our Vegas trips.   OH ALSO, the playlist in here is phenomenal, my apologies to the nearby guests for the impromptu karaoke that ensued."}
{"text":"Not as good or as authentic as the AYCE Korean restaurants in Chinatown. A lot of the meat had fat on it and they were all out of shrimp. I did enjoy the signature steak, the red wine pork, and pork steak. They are awesome about changing out your grill, staying on top of your orders, and all the staff was pleasant. It's good for a nice sit down meal, but not if you are looking for authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. I've been here twice now and the service was great both times. And even more amazing food. Pretty well priced too."}
{"text":"Finally a legit place to eat AYCE KBBQ in NV!  I have always been happy with Gens quality of food and service in CA. The Henderson location staff was great. Great food and good service especially for just opening up this week.   Ok seriously for the price and what you are getting its a deal."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. They were busy but got seated fast, they don't take reservations. Server Allen was great and very attentive. He explained the menu and which items were raw and which were the appetizers- all included in AYCE. Salad and Japche (noodles) also followed. So good!  He recommended the red wine pork belly -  very flavorful, thick pieces! Also had the brisket, steak and beef bulgogi... all good but small portions.  We had to ask for better pair of scissors because it was really tough to cut the steak with the ones they gave us.  They don't have short ribs but had something similar...it's the number 10 probably my favorite.  We tried the volcano chicken - like a very spicy orange chicken, tasty but hot! They ran out of KFC chicken too. Overall service was great and would recommend it especially to those who aren't familiar with Korean BBQ as they have a lot of cooked items to eat."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service alone!  Our server was Justin and from start to finish he and all the other servers take care of you. They always asked if we were ok, if we wanted to order more or needed the grill to be changed. Also since they order direct to an iPad the meats come out so quick.  Only thing that needs improvement is a better ventilation system.    As of 1/6 they still don't have their liquor license"}
{"text":"Ok.... I'll give it a 4! Even though I want to give them a 5! Excellent food! Excellent service! Excellent atmosphere! Hip music! Definitely will be back! The price is excellent! I gave them a 4 because there is always room for improvement! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"We love coming to Gen...great food, great price, great service..especially our server JULIAN!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit and definitely won't be the last! Very good food and service. Empty dishes were constantly taken away, requested food always coming in and even changed out the grill several times. Ambiance also wonderful and our server Julian was great! Hopefully they will bring one to the Southwest next so we can visit more frequently ;)"}
{"text":"Me and my husband Love it or you can need for less than $25 I only miss the lettuce so I can do my wraps so far really good we love Korean food!!"}
{"text":"Luke and Yuhao was supper helpful for my first visit at Gen. The service was great and the food was even better I'll deffiently visit here again."}
{"text":"Tried out this new joint that people I know raved about.  The place looks nice with modern decor. We ordered the all you can eat Korean BBQ style.  The ingredients for the BBQ did not taste right or I should say not fresh.  The pork belly tasted stale like it just came out of a year long freeze.  The shrimp tasted like mud with a lingering after taste.  I guess you suppose to drenched them in a sauce before you eat them. The service was less than OK.  Waiters forgetting our orders and never came back to check on water until we asked.  We had to go to the cashier to pay our bill because the waiter never came back with the bill when we asked.  This waiter actually walked by our table several times and didn't our bill."}
{"text":"Awesome way to have a meal!  JJ was a great server too. Unlimited eats for $20!   Get the steak over and over again.  All the other stuff is super messy"}
{"text":"If your looking for all you can eat Korean BBQ th n you can't go wrong.  Gen is a very big chain restaurant, I have been to two different locations in California, the one in Waikiki Hawaii, and the Tempe Arizona location, pretty much all the same great quality food.  The only negative is they don't offer the rib meat in chucks anymore, instead you mush get the ribs, the one in Hawaii still does."}
{"text":"Great food  great atmosphere. Honestly had a really great time our server Austin was AMAZING! Very attentive suggested great items on the menu and encouraged us to try new amazing drinks! Defenitly coming back to this location and asking for Austin! Make sure you ask for him you won't regret your time here we defenitly didnt!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here probably about 8 times since they've opened. We have always received great service and very minimal issues. On our last visit we had a brief wait to be seated, but we seated pretty quick (lunch buffet) and our server came, got our drink order and our meats and we started eating, as we were still cooking/eating the hostess that seated us not 10 minutes before came over with the bill and told us our total. I was really confused as we had barely just sat and she was the one that sat us, I told her that we are still eating and going to order more meats and she said \"oh okay\" and left. About 10 minutes later she came back with check in hand, with the card reader and said \"okay you must be ready by nooooowwww!\" My Husband and I were both completely shocked but more assertive this time and said \"no, we aren't ready we just got here and we are still eating.\" She left and our server came over and we explained what happened, he went to the hostess station and inquired and the hostess had the wrong table. I wasn't very happy with her being so pushy, our server handled it well and he was nice about it. I do really love this restaurant regardless of our last experience."}
{"text":"First time eating here and our waiter was ozzy. He was super nice and took great care of us. Thank you ozzy!"}
{"text":"Ozzy is such a good server. Very attentive & knowledgeable. 2nd time here and he made the biggest difference from knowing everything and helping us try new items."}
{"text":"Food was far better than I expected. Samuel, Kristina, Lisa and the rest of the staff are very helpful and attentive. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"SPACIOUS INTERIOR  One thing that is SUPER surprising is the price point for this place! It is about $5 cheaper than all the AYCE Korean BBQ joints that i have been to so far, although all the ones i have been to may have been mainly in California. Since i have been to the GEN in Cali, i was expecting pretty much the same thing. I was WRONG.... i also decided to come here a little while after they had opened so that they could get all the trial stuff out of the way. They still have MORE to work on in my opinion.  We had one of the NEW servers take care of us which I THINK his name was YOUNG-UHN?.... ahahahha something along that line he was great service wise. Although his first day on his own he did quite well taking care of us especially w/ his up beat personality. He kept us up to date w/ anything that may have taken some time. A bit disappointed when we asked the manager for a refill on salad & did not get it right away especially when you are a manager...   The meat was OK... the best thing was the BEEF BELLY & MISO PORK BELLY. I typically love the PORK JOWEL meat but it had a nasty old stench to it & it wasn't even slices it was just the whole chunck of it =\    REGARDLESS.... I probably may be back when I'm in the area... definitely would NOT go out of my way to crave it like I would in Cali."}
{"text":"Update to my post.  I have added the same comment on FB, instead of responding  to my concern, the post was deleted.  What kind of management is this????"}
{"text":"I've been to many gen, especially in California. They are suppose to be a franchise. They should have exact items of food. The tempe location is not worth going to. Taste and quality is so different. I was so excited that finally a gen in Arizona, after going I was so disappointed. I rather go to the mom and pop all you can eat kbbq. What a sad disappotment."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the service here. Mike was an excellent server, he had great suggestions and I enjoyed every bite! If you're looking to come in and find friendly servers and overall awesome experience, come and check this place out. Everyone works as a team. Thanks again Mike for being attentive and not making me feel awkward for dining alone."}
{"text":"I love GEN but our waitress is completely rude and her customer service sucks. I don't understand how a fine dining place like this can even hire a person to represent the restaurant. I hope I never get her again!!!"}
{"text":"They shoulda built this place in Vegas. Great service and the quality of the meat was very pleasing to the eye. Our server Howard was the shit! Great job bro!"}
{"text":"Portion is small so you can order all kinds of different meats! Servers are very attentive. Lisa and Kristina did a great job."}
{"text":"I love this place each time we crave for meat. Glad they have one here in vegas now (originally fr vegas)  Why not 5 stars tho? Funny but each time we come here, even if there are so many empty seats (we try to go off peak time), we still wait. Just find it ironic. Having a toddler in a waiting area kinda sometimes ruin the mood."}
{"text":"Gen Kbbq is one the best places I've been to. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family! The food was spectacular and the service was beyond nice. I would love to come back here again. 5 out of 5 everything! Plus our server Lisa was very sweet!"}
{"text":"Pro Tip: Bring a change of clothes if you're planning on going out after eating.  I've now been to Gen 3 times.  I was reluctant to go that second time, because I did not have a good experience the first time around.  To my surprise, the menu had changed and the meat selection was definitely an upgrade.  And the best part is dinner is only $22!!!!!  You won't find another AYCE KBBQ place that serves kalbi for anywhere near $22!!!    Here my list of Gen's Greatest Hits:  Gen premium steak - oh so tender and juicy, might be my favorite item. kalbi - well marinated, tender, and very tasty.  cajun shrimp - i'm not sure what the cajun seasoning blend is, but i do  know it is delicious  spicy baby octopus - smothered in kochujang sauce, these ocotop.odes were scrumptious and not too spicy.  i highly recommend this item.  bulgogi - sliced thicker than what I prefer, the meat was a tough and put on my never order again list.  chadol - thinly sliced brisket that melts in your mouth. a must have item.  KFC - korean fried chicken was a bit disappointing.  tasted more like orange chicken from panda express than KFC from other korean joints.  japchae - this one is ok.  A bit on the sweeter side for my taste, but a descent appetizer choice.  gyoza - i admit, i love me some friend dumplings.  Especially when waiting on meats to cook, it is nice to have a cooked item to munch on.  soondoboo - thoroughly disappointed in this dish.  The broth was ok, pretty tasty actually, but they used the wrong tofu!!!!  You don't put firm tofu in soondoboo!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone knows that!!  You use the soft, silken tofu!!  Duh.  If the soondoboo and kfc were better, I'd give this place 5 stars.  As it stands, I can only do 4.  Also, I don't waste my time with pork or chicken.  I only go for beef and seafood.  For the price, service, atmosphere, and quality of food, Gen is no doubt my #1 choice for AYCE KBBQ place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and efficient service from their staff.  #Blake was our server that night."}
{"text":"This place could get a better rating if their servers and hostesses would get it together. Hostesses  are suppose to be friendly and inviting....y'all think you guys are too good...NOT everyones been there so explain to others how you work and what's available! The price you pay gets you, the employees, to hussle and serve you what you order...sad to say its not true Korean either.  Missing lots of components"}
{"text":"Great Spot For Cook Your Own Food BBQ  It's a nice and clean place that has a nice ambiance and seems to stay pretty busy.   Service was OK, but you really have to catch the attention of the servers in order to get more food... I like when people are more on the job about asking if you need anything else...   The Food was good and we will definitely go back here again. It's a Korean Style BBQ House as the name implies so you pick your meats and cook them yourself on the grill at your table.   The new location in Tempe Town is a nice location.   All in all I like this place and you will too....  GO FEED YOUR INNER ANIMAL!"}
{"text":"This place get so busy, I mean it's right next to the Galleria mall so that's given. But anyhow for AYCE it's so good! I must say this place is one of the best Korean BBQ I had gone so far. A must place to try peeps"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.  We came here last night hungry and definitely got our money's worth.  Upon arriving there was a wait of about 30-40 minutes, the hostess asked for our phone number and we were able to track through an app how many parties were ahead of us, and then we were texted once our table was ready.  About an hour later, longer than we were quoted, we received a text informing us that our table was ready.  We arrived to the host stand and there was still about a 15 minute wait and one party ahead of us.  Kind of disappointing.    We were then sat at our table and noticed the menu on their website is a little different than the menu you get at your table. Also they don't even have everything on their menu.  The waitress informed us they only have 4 side dishes.  There were about 8 on the menu.    As far as the menu went, they have a great variety of options ranging from edamame to intestines to brisket.  There is definitely something for everyone.  They have many menu options that a lot of local Korean BBQ places that are not even AYCE offer.  The food came out in a timely manner and the waitress was attentive to our drinks being empty and wanting more sides.    The beef brisket was delicous.  I also loved the popcorn shrimp, the pickled cucumber side, and the yogurt soju!    A few downsides - We were sat across from the entrance to the kitchen and just from a quick glance in the kitchen the floor was dirty and had a lot of debris.  A team member of theirs sneezed across from our table all over a counter and didn't cover his face.  In the bathroom when I reached for a paper towel probably about 15 paper towels came out.    Overall, a wonderful experience.  I mean for $20 you truly can't beat it!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time at this place today for lunch.   Food was great...once we received it.  Something happened with the power to the fryer, by the time we received the \"appetizers\", we were nearly full from the main meal.  LOL.  Didn't seem like staff was fully informed of the situation, they just kept saying it would be a few extra minutes...this lasted an hour or more.    Was out of their control, so no harm.   Will definitely be returning...HUGE VALUE dining location!!!"}
{"text":"This is far from what your ideal kbbq place should be. Poor meat quality. Slow non responsive and forgetful waiters. The grill is circular and frequently burns requiring even more frequent grill changes causing delays in cooking and therefore breaks during eating.   I prefer Hobak on spring mountain. It might not be ayce but service and quality are both top notch. Additionally the sides are wonderful and they have steam egg (not offered at gen)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Our server was awesome and so friendly!! My husband and I came here for the first time and our sever made our first experience a five star experience! He was so informative and helpful!! I wish I remembered his name! Last but not least, we had an amazing view!! We were able to eat comfortably! Will deff dine here again!!"}
{"text":"Jaenica, our server seemed overwhelmed with tables but still was able to get us drinks and appetizers as we asked and stayed cheery about it. She definitely showed a sort of passion for serving, or maybe she was just glad to be off but she still made the dinner a nice and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! All you can eat for $15/person for lunch and $20/person for dinner. The meat is so good and they have tons of food and appetizers to choose from.  The atmosphere is beautiful, clean, and stylish and they play popular music.  I would come here a lot more often if I lived on this side of town though. I wish they can open up more locations in Las Vegas/Southwest area! I hate having to drive 30 min to the Galleria Mall :/ But when I'm really craving this place, it's totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  The KBBQ here is solid all-around, and they offer a lot of choices of meat. Banchan (side-dish) is decent, not the greatest. I really like their salad dressing tho.   My fav items include the marinated short ribs, premium top sirloin steak, brisket, cajun calamari, cajun shrimp, and premium pork belly.   Clubby atmosphere. It's loud and dark with electro music playing in the background. A downside for me personally to this place is that it doesn't have the authentic feel of a Korean bbq joint. I didn't see any Korean workers, and you have to ask for a lot of the little things like sesame oil, samjang, garlic, etc.   In the end, $22 for all the variety of meats makes this place worth it."}
{"text":"Not reasonable price! My family is 6 members include 4 kids! They charged 18% tip. but I couldn't satisfied their service. Very slow serving food & no helping cook meat!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. Nothing I couldn't cook myself but that's a different story. It's all about the experience. It was a fun evening out and about with my brother when we came across this gem. It had a lively vibe looking from the outside in so we though why not try out. We had a good time. I enjoyed the salad it had a nice flavor and zing to it."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent, and the service is top notch. It's a great date night spot."}
{"text":"Per other yelpers suggestion, we came slightly earlier for dinner so we wouldn't have to wait long for a table. And I'm glad we did. We arrived a little after 5 and only waited for 20 minutes.  We were seated at a booth with a grill in the middle, sides were already set, waiting for us. The sides included pickled radish, potato salad, pickled cucumber (no, not pickles), Cole slaw, kimchi, edamame, and pickled onions. There's also seasoning dishes already served as well. Our server promptly came to take our order - we were not ready for that yet, but ordered drinks. Also found out you can order unlimited sides which includes salad and rice.  He returned and explained its all you can eat in a 2 hour time frame, you can select up to 4 meats, they bring it to your table, and cook it on the grill. We ordered garlic calamari, the #7 special of marinated sliced beef, beef sorry ribs, and Cajun shrimp. I wasn't very fond of the calamari but both the beef dishes and shrimp were delicious. Our next round consisted of garlic chicken, Hawaiian chicken, sliced beef brisket, and flat iron steak. Beef seems the way to go. Just wasn't feeling the chicken - altho the garlic chicken had an awesome jalapeno fondue sauce that accompanied.  We got a third round of meats and called it good. Very satisfied and happy. The service was superb. They come by to clean plates off and bring fresh grills after you've used it for each round.  My hubby is a body builder and he ate like a champ - hard to believe 2 hours isn't enough time to stuff your face unless you're completely overdoing it.  Fun atmosphere, great service, and good food."}
{"text":"The food was decent, the flavors were good. However, they need to rethink the silverware. We ordered the steak, which came in one huge slab and there was no way to cut it other than scissors.   The garlic calamari was also good, however the beef bulgogi was amazing and definitely the star of our meal.  The service was also okay, not great.   The immediate run down of all the rules was a little off putting and didn't really set the tone for a great dinner.   The cleanliness needs some work, the floor was covered in slick grease and sticky spots under the table.  Their wheelchair etiquette was excellent and for that, I would give them a 5 star rating. They found a bench I could transfer too, no one moved my chair away, so I had access to it."}
{"text":"Customer Service is KEY. First time going to GEN Korean BBQ House and was recommended by my brother. I was under the impression kids age 5-10 was 10$ but i was surprised when they measured my son to see if he was going to be full price. They said its new. So right off the bat got a little upset because my 8 year old son who is now paying full price hardly eats as much as an adult. Not their fault but I wish kids price was still in effect. Barely no wait time on a Saturday. So with a doubtful attitude, we began to order. Terry our server definitely changed the night. Always checking our drinks were filled and recommending what to try. At no time did we feel rushed to eat and leave like many all you can eat restaurants. The manager stood out to me as well because he was constantly walking around and even picked up some plates at our table. WHAT! What manager does that nowadays! Overall 5 stars and will be a great spot to try for those who have not."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this past week and it was delicious. The servers were super fast with bringing the meat and they changed the grill very often. The only thing I could recommend is better service when it comes to filling the drinks. Overall I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Aww they totally improved on their service. I've returned a few times and I feel terrible because I jotted a few names down and I can't find them but the last two times I've come here the service has been outstanding!! They check up on you way more and everyone has been so friendly and welcoming. Great job and we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"We adore Luna, our waitress. 5 stars for service..I have very little comments on the food, because of course its korean bbq-so I am cooking it myself. Plus we have been to Gen in LA and I lived in Busan and Daegu, However Korean American BBQ has much better options on meat (unless you're in Seoul) such as the Hawaiian steak and anything beef in general.  Anywho service was phenomenal and even during waiting area we had such a good time, because the employees were nice and accomdating. Go out to restaurants for the food and stay for the service."}
{"text":"Ill start off by saying i have been to gen in L.A. This particular location is relatively less than a year old. So this review could change upon my next visit.  I went here with my girl to get the Hawaiian steak the LA locations have, unfortunately they did not have it at this location. Bummer but still hungry so lets go  Food 3/5 I had high expectation, unfortunately they were barely met. Quality was good especially on the marinated items but they did not come to par from the LA Locations. I would say the barely exceed the quality of tofu hut. Which for 5$ less i would definitely go to tofu hut.  Service 3.5/5 ...... This part is tricky, The waiters and staff were very friendly. Except we sat next to this couple and as they were paying out the host was making small talk and ASKED them if they knew what yelp was and asked them to write a good review with their servers name. Because they were having a competition. Well that definitely knocked me back. Em not opposed to the competition because that is good motivation for the team. BUT ASKING someone to write a good review and shout out the server. Very unprofessional. Had i not overheard this it would be a 5/5.  Store: 5/5 Brand new location clean everything, the grill i did not like i prefer stone grills because they tend to stay clean but that's my preference.  Ill be back once they are more seasoned and got they quality and prep down good."}
{"text":"I found this experience to be more of a social event/activity rather than a dining experience. This was also my first time trying Korean BBQ so I didn't have anything to compare it to. After reading the reviews about the four meat at a time policy our party of 3 wanted to make sure that we were gonna get the most bang for our buck at $25 bucks per person. We thought since it was just a 2 hour limit that we had to rush and put in our meat orders super quick buy let me advise you that if you come with a small party then you really don't have to rush the process. Trust me, in a 2 hour time frame you will be able to order a lot of freakin meat. The highlights of the meal were the brisket, beef bulgogi, spicy chicken, and my brother in law really loved the cow tongue. Salad was really good and so was the rice. These are also unlimited so make sure to take advantage of that. I was pretty disappointed with the following: the dipping sauces, the majority of the sides, the pork belly dishes, and the Korean fried chicken. If I come back in the future it would probably be with a large group of people for more of a fun experience type thing but I don't think that I would return with a small group of people or a date night. With this being said, it was definitely a really fun experience and I'm glad I tried it. And my brother in law found his favorite restaurant so I was happy with that!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is great and the service is awesome! i really loved our tiny waitress Kailin, so cute and prompt and super friendly!  They bring you the food but they don't make you beg like other korean bbq places here in town. Kailin was was checking up on us and bringing stuff right away. Loved it! Definitely my go to KOREAN BBQ from now on!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and has good service. I have been there several times and feel good to have lunch and dinner with friends. If you have chance, go and have a try :). Carmen Zhu"}
{"text":"I normally don't complain about service here because it normally is great. But more often the service here is terrible. Its just disappointing because the food is great, but the service quickly went from a 10 to a 2."}
{"text":"Excellent food & most importantly excellent service. Eugene & Ozzy helped us & they made us feel right at home. They were fun & exciting. You get exactly what you pay for here. I would recommend this to people who have a big appetite. Overall, everything was great great great!!! Very pleased."}
{"text":"I came here after I seen that person below me who's gonna bring out the \"fat girl in her\" posted lol...And after my friend Justin I told me about it. I had the lunch special for $15 bucks even though I wanted to order the dinner cause I love the tongue but I was pleasantly pleased and the army of hungry people trying it for the first time loved it as well!!!   Jaenica (I think that's her name) was an excellent server and very friendly and serviced us well especially me haha.   Will come back again but probably only when I'm in Henderson. This place is out there in like the boondocks  Ok now that I had time to digest the slaughter, let's take a look at this subjectively..  Tofu hut is 14 for late night and 18 for reg. sura is like 23. sura is the worst. I would not go back on my own accord. Very small selection and unappetizing presentation. Tofu hut is limited but convenient and had beef tongue which is my favorite. But tofu hut is busy, very greasy, and I leave there smelling like Korean BBQ...   Now to Gen. I was super Impressed. I wanted to order the dinner for lunch and pay 20 bucks but the people I was with didn't want that. The lunch special for 15 bucks is amazing value.   For starters their pan chan (side dishes) was great. Also all appetizers were included in the ayce price and included miso soup, sesame chicken (more like a karaage chicken), popcorn shrimp, and pork cutlet, gyoza, and many more. Already I was impressed with this.   Now on to the meats!!! Many different meat selections, a few chicken choices which is rare cause most Korean BBQ has only one. The #1 item on their list is actually a whole steak. We ordered 3 of those. They had 3 different kinds of bulgogi. Not my favorite in general but it kept my white man friends happy which is good.   Also the grill was designed like a gyukaku or Japanese style BBQ where the it was below the table a bit and holes around the grill sucked up the smoke so the restaurant was not smokey at all and your clothes are smelling like clothes still and not like ur slaving away in the kitchen.   Now the service. I had an Asian guy come up to help us 3-4 times, a one republic boy band waiter help us 3-4 times, and also jaenica who was super friendly and works three jobs come and help us about 4-5 times. So even though I like to talk to friends during this time and don't like to be bothered much, I felt the service for the general population as a whole would find this place outstanding.   Cons-  This restaurant is in Henderson, Arizona almost next to Phoenix. And I wouldn't recommend going and expect to sit more than 5 people on one table. I would recommend 3-4 people or 5 people with two of the, being petite women.   Other than that, A+ rating for value and gets the Michelin-Fuks 3star rating"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. They are not accommodating... Strict corporate rule. Made customers leave because of rule. They need be more open to all customers. Manager is young and very naive. Knows nothing about customer service."}
{"text":"The long long/wait for dinner was worth it. A good selection of meats and cooked sides to choose- meats a little in the salty side. Just four types of ban chan pickled/veggie dishes and green salad salad. Jap chae noodles not too impressive nor fresh.  Service was great, server and all staff were always there to refill drinks, take more food orders and collect empty dishes and they were pretty quick."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! Food was amazing as well. Our server Jeremiah was awesome! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Excellent service, Excellent selection, Excellent quality. The portions for for some things are huge the pork belly was one of the things me and my wife got and the pieces were huge. Cooked them up barely finished one whole piece. The Manager Jessica really lovely woman explained there were different seasonings and sauces we could get that were not served at the start. And we could order half orders. well we know that next time but for future first timers we recommend and also for people who forget. Please revamp the menu telling newbies what comes in a full order and comes in a half order. what other seasonings are there, and what else can there be that is secret menu worthy. We were told you learn these things as you keep coming. But speeking from a customer service rep for 16 years some people just wont come back if they don't like what they had or think its odd or ridiculious. Either way nothing wrong with what we had we will be back again"}
{"text":"Gen is the best! So worth the wait and price. Unlimited Korean bbq. Unlimited appetizers. Unlimited sides"}
{"text":"First of all, this place has good food and equivalent to that of Korean BBQ in Los Angeles. Gen BBQ is like the Starbucks of Korean BBQ in California; they're everywhere. They are good but there are better places in California, of course.  Arizona location, this is by far the best place for AYCE Korean BBQ, for now. Until more restaurants like this opens, this will be the top choice for now. Great quality meets and the service was actually pretty good even though they are still in their \"soft-opening\" stage. Inside was very modern, clean and great atmosphere. Don't mind the smoke and smell of Korean bbq, that is a for-sure thing if you are going to a Korean BBQ place. If anyone complains about it, then they don't know anything about Korean BBQ. Their side dishes were great too  I took off a star because at the end, when it came to paying the bill, they had a very hard time getting everything to work properly. We had 7 people and they said they only take 3 credit cards maximum which is fine. So we paid cash and 3 credit cards; Cash first, fixed amount on 2 cards and the rest on the last one. Apparently this was very difficult because of their system. I work in the industry too but Im pretty sure almost every POS system can take more than 3 credit cards but to save time (and money) it makes sense limit to 3 but, not sure why, they weren't able to efficiently carry the transactions smoothly. Guess they need more of a efficient POS. Also, they only have a very limited tables for large parties (like 8+) so if you have a party of 8 or more, you may need to wait longer for a table if its already taken.   For those new to Korean BBQ, here is a few things to consider. Ayce Korean BBQ places do not take reservations and never have or will. Its first come, first serve if ALL your party is present since there is a 2 hour max once your start eating. The maximum time frame is a must for every ayce BBQ so don't complain. Lastly, there will always be a wait so plan ahead. All the ayce korean bbq places in LA are the exact same thing when it comes to waiting."}
{"text":"Great new Korean BBQ! Really love the selection and price for all you can eat. Kristina and Kevin were our waitress and waiter and they were both very helpful and friendly. The whole staff does a great job at making sure you have everything you need throughout your dining experience.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Korean BBQ and now you can expect me here every week! The restaurant itself is huge and the interior is amazing. The lighting gives it this cool retro look. Food was amazing, but what really won my attention was the service. We were first greeted with a warm welcome by the hostesses, I believe her name was Kaley. Once we were sat, our server Criza did a phenomenal job with making my first experience here memorable. She gave me the best recommendations. The beef tongue, as strange as it sounds, was my favorite item on the menu. Criza catered to our every need! Whether it came to drink refills or making sure we got all our orders. Outstanding job Gen! If you ever dine in there, ask for Criza, you'll be in for a treat!!"}
{"text":"I love  this place my family and I stumbled on this gem back in January on one of our trips to California we absolutely love it there. The meat selection is amazing and big so many choices to pick from . We all like Korean BBQ and hated to drive all the way to china town to get our fix of it and we thought that they needed to open one in the Henderson area. So when we found out that a Gen was opening up right up the street from us we were so happy because we thought that The quality of meats, service and atmosphere that they offer is what is missing from the Korean BBQ places in china town. They've been open less than a week and my family and I have gone twice already . They have good people working there but we were treated marvelously by TOMMY & RICHARD They were both AMAZING!!! And provided great service DEFINITELY!!!  ask for either one of this gentleman when you go they will take care of you... P.s the only reason I didn't give them 5 starts is because they did not bring over one of our favorite meats Hawaiian meat so please owner please bring it here as well we love it......."}
{"text":"Awesome AYCE K-BBQ place in Henderson! They have more selection on their menu and they have a modern design unlike most K-BBQ you see in Las Vegas. I personally like the pork belly and they have a few different options- garlic, miso, regular and more I didn't get to try. Lunch is priced at $14.99 and dinner at $19.99. If you like beef tongue, it's only available in the dinner menu. There's no desserts here but they have more side dishes you can choose from. I also like that they give you small portions at a time  so you don't overwhelm yourself. It's very new, clean and really good. I gave 4 stars because their gen signature premium steak tasted really bland- it was cooked right & texture was right but I'm pretty sure they forgot the flavor. Also saw some tables (booth) were 6 people are seated but it looked like there should only be for 4. They also have the high tables which is not okay if you're going with kids. Also, this place is much smaller to the one I went to in California so there might be a wait time unless you call for reservations. They recently opened so expect it to be busy. Don't hesitate to ask for more food since the servers all run around with their tablets & they place your order there and then. Other than that, I'll still be back for more ."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here on a number of occasions.  The food has always been really good.  When we first started going the service was good and attentive.  The past few times we have gone, the service has really gone down hill.  A couple of days ago we went in for lunch.  We were created and told we would be seated in a couple of minutes.  There were a lot of tables available.  We waited for over five minutes while the two hostesses were just chatting.  No attention was being paid to us at all.  I politely told the hostess that greater us that we would come back later.  My wife and I are bqoth in the industry.  The lack of concern for the guests is the downfall of restaurants especially in a town where the choices are endless.  I doubt very seriously we will return to this location.  Sorry folks, but you need to clean up your act!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Good music the vibe is chill. I'll keep this post to a minimum because I'd prefer to keep this place a hidden gem for myself."}
{"text":"Honestly, the WORST service I have ever had in a restaurant. And it's the same servers. This place has been open long enough for these guys to get a good flow of things, but I guess some take longer than others to learn. Why do I have to ask 4 times in a span of 35 minutes for my rice to come out? If there's something going on that's out of your hands, that's totally understandable. But you gotta let me know so I won't keep asking! But every time I come here, it seems they just keep forgetting. Same goes for radish paper and rice paper. It's ridiculous. And it's bad when you notice that your server only has 2 or 3 tables and they're still struggling. I'd love to grab a job here just so I can empathize how hard it is to work here, because they make it look so hard.  I really wanna give this place, at least a 3 but even some of their meat options are going down the drain and it hasn't even been that long! The brisket is always too dry. They're lucky their short plate beef is good, it's the only meat I get here besides the beef tongue. So here's to you, Gen. Two stars. I keep coming here, hoping that it'll get better, but I'd rather go to Tofu Hut.   P.S. Their only good server that I've had was Seung (sp?) If you want the best service here, then ask for him."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Everything is clean and fresh, servers are all around to help and bring what ever you need."}
{"text":"Believe the H Y P E! One hour, infinite grilled meats... the happiest time of your life.  Service is impeccable. Usually I expect bottomless places to move slow so you can't actually take advantage. Here they're constantly letting you order more, they're cleaning your grill, they're refilling your waters and getting you more drinks.  None of the sauces or marinades are gluten free so if you have an allergy you can order from the many marinade-free options on the menu. I suggest the steak!  Always an amazing time."}
{"text":"Food ok - signature steak the best meat. Side dishes good - pickled cucumbers and onions, seasoned salad and potato salad plus Chix dishes. Service good by Terry and Justin. Although we felt rushed at times; management neglected to take care of slippery floor. Cleaning crew hustled to clean and close; acknowledged us when leaving unlike management."}
{"text":"Terrible. Smell of stale oil. Also not interested in cooking my own dinner when I go out."}
{"text":"This review is not based on the food. Strictly on their service and policy.   I came into this restaurant to join my party and because I was 20-30 min late joining my party they told me that I could not join my party based on their policy. I asked for a supervisor and when he came out and told me that was their policy I responded with \"what kind of policy is that?\" He replied I'm sorry ma'am that's just our policy & I continued to join party. Unfortunately, because of that so called policy we immediately asked for the check and left."}
{"text":"We decided to come here about a week after it opened because we're Americans and gluttony is our religion.   The restaurant was immediately thrown into chaos as the electronic seating system went down and the wait staff took names by hand. We were seated. And then seated again. Again, organized chaos. I do not fault them, it's hard to get a handle on my duties at work after a year, let alone a month.  Once that was settled we finally set about gorging. The sides were brought out repeatedly and in short order. They weren't half bad either. Pay attention to the menu, like most AYCE lunch is not served on weekends. The meats were plentiful and delicious and we left smelling like a barbecue.  I doubt I'll be able to convince my party to come back anytime soon for fear of bursting but I will definitely try."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came for lunch and luckily we got there before the lunch rush! The staff all say \"Welcome to Gen\" when you enter and it's nice the first few times you hear it. After hearing that several times every 15 minutes it gets a little noisy, but that's the only downside to this place! The food is great! If you've never grilled on your own before, this will be a fun learning experience! They have all kinds of meat marinated in different sauces so they're all a different taste. The Red Wine Pork Belly is my all time favorite, but I recommend picking one of each meat to try at first before deciding which ones you'd like to try different marinades of. There are also side dishes that are delicious and more can be brought out upon request, but be careful, they want you to fill up with the side dishes and the drinks so that you eat less meat! You want to get your money's worth so keep the side dish eating and soda drinking to a minimum!!! Overall, lunch is a lot cheaper than dinner and you still get a great meat selection, give this place a try if you're a meat lover like me and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"How the heck did this place get 4 stars ? It's easily the worst Korean BBQ I've ever been to, and that says a lot. If I could I'd give it zero stars.  Half the appetizers were not available. No hot tea. What ??? For 20 bucks a head, you get tiny portions of whatever you order, and when you want to re-order, the waitstaff is nowhere to be found. For three of us, one order of brisket = 5 pieces. One order of kimchi = 3 pieces. Tasteless salad dressing, and the spicy tofu soup tasted like recycled miso soup with some chili oil.  Reminds me of the Red Lobster unlimited shrimp scam, where they make you wait 20 minutes for 5 more pieces of shrimp, in the the hopes that the customers get tired of it and leave. Pick the lowest rated Korean BBQ on Spring Mountain, and it'll be heads and shoulders above this one. If this survives the next three months, it'll be only because there is no other Korean BBQ in the area. Avoid at all costs !"}
{"text":"Me and my GF like to come here like once a month and pig out. The meat selection is pretty tasty and i like the pork belly. I can eat a whole bucky of the jap chai. Some stuff isnt that good like the burnt sesame chicken they give you but i deft enjoy coming here for a cheap night out."}
{"text":"Im so glad gen is here in Vegas now so I don't have to drive to Cali for this.  It's located right outside the galleria mall facing sunset station so there's ample parking.  It is a first come first serve and your entire party needs to be present. Expect to wait for a while.  (20 min wait at 5:30pm for us) They did just open but the staff seem to be on it.  The only think they need to fix it the servers keep coming to the check in desk and this poor girl has to take names for a waiting list while splitting the check for customers and printing them out.   It's ayce for lunch and dinner.  Lunch is 14.95 for 29 items and dinner is 19.95 for 32 items.  We honestly only order the numbers 1 (steak) , 3 (brisket) , & 17 (garlic pork belly). You can only order 4 meats at a time. They do have appetizers as well and u can order as many of those  as you want.  Ask for garlic and jalapenos and sliced radish if you want.  They don't have the rice papers yet"}
{"text":"We love coming here! Great food, great service. And Luis is awesome! Very attentive and was always available when we needed something."}
{"text":"I checked out this place yesterday and it is totally the same as the Henderson location. Still all the plenty options of meat! The place is modern and clean. The service is outstanding and refills were quick!"}
{"text":"The place is not worth going to. The service was slow, it is obviously not busy and they can't  even keep up with the service. I m a foodie, I go to restaurants then tell my friends to go. The food was so so, nothing to rave about, just ordinary, I have gone to Korean bbq in town, if the service was better, that would have made the difference. My mom was on a wheelchair, for some reason, we were made to wait more than 10 minutes for a place that's half empty, hostess just told us to wait, no explanation. Our meat came and were already almost ready to eat, no drinks yet!"}
{"text":"If I could give less then 1 star I would they have horrible customer service no one knows if they are coming or going and we had a party of 11 along with another party of 11 and they got seated first! It was my sons 16th Birthday and they made it a horrible experience also 3 people in our party are allergic to seafood and yet they made NO accommodations!! If you want to have a nice family dinner and you have a big family DONT COME HERE!!! Also not to mention the party of 11 that came before us and were seated before is we're ASIAN!!! We are Italian go figure!! Oh yeah and go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience overall. The food was good! Probably the best kbbq in Arizona so far. The service was good, we had a big party and each person was continuously being catered to and the servers are all nice and we're lively. The servers definitely brought life into the place. Management seems to have trained and prepared everyone well and were on the go/very active around the restaurant which I don't see as often anymore. I'm not sure if you can reserve prior to you getting there but it would def be smart to just so you minimize your wait.  Update: You now need to have your whole party to be with you to be seated if there's no wait time"}
{"text":"A friend & I went to eat at Gen Korean BBQ just this past weekend. The service was excellent  & the food was superb. The ambiance is very vibrant & casual, I recommend this place to anyone whose looking to have a good time and wanting to get a taste of the finest Asian cuisine in town."}
{"text":"New all you can eat Korean BBQ and the food was amazing! The restaurant is so spacious and much bigger then I thought it would be. It's located right next to Kabuki and across from Barnes and Nobles. I came here on a Tuesday night and our wait was 45 minutes. They do not take reservations so don't bother calling and just expect to wait about an hour to eat. You can shop to kill time and they will text you when your table is ready.  All you can eat for $25 with a maximum of 2 hours. They offer a variety of meats and side dishes ( salads, pickled onions, potato salad, spicy cucumber, radish and kimchi etc) You can order up to four meats at a time and order more as you go. The side dishes were on the small side but you can ask for more so it wasn't a big deal.   Our server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"We always come here to eat and tonight we sat at the bar where Eddie took care of us. Eddie is super friendly and always had a smile on his face. O was very pleased with his service and y'all make sure to go see Eddie at the bar."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean barbecue place real good fresh  Meats and the  Steak is is awesome tender.   Best price in town for the food. And you have to try the salad it's really good. 2  Big bowls of salad and 2 big   Stakes"}
{"text":"Great service,  food came quickly and was delicious. I love the premium marinated steak, galbisal. All you can eat is the best way to live life.  Also Luna was awesome."}
{"text":"I love Korean bbq and I've been to multiple places before but this place was by far the worst I've been too. The meat is mostly fat and had to be chocked down and some tasted like bacon or ham when it's supposed to be pork belly. Not at all happy with this place and won't come back!"}
{"text":"Omg! I'm so excited! I hope it's the same service as the one in California and Las Vegas! Love this place! It opens this week!   I'm giving this place a 4 star because I thought their selections would be the same as Vegas and California, however that wasn't the case, pretty disappointing. But their service is still on point and their food is decent compared to the other all you can eat Korean BBQ here in Az."}
{"text":"We aren't locals but found this place on Yelp and read all the reviews so my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. It's about 15 minutes away from the strip. The location was difficult to find because they are connected to the mall. So your GPS might say go inside the mall it's actually not. It's near red robin and chevy's.  The time we arrived it was about lunch. They weren't as busy so we were seated right away. Once you are seated all the side dishes is ready and their service 5 star. They took our order pretty fast. The downside was that we didn't get our appetizer first the main meats and dishes came out before the appetizer which was okay had food in front of us to munch on. The food was excellent. We didn't care so much for their premium steak so I wouldn't advise to get that even if you are a steak lover, it was really bland. I would recommend to order from all the \"thumbs\" up listed on the menu. Their price is different on the weekend so on the weekend their lunch price is dinner price and the 14.99 is only valid on the weekdays. Overall, I would come visit this place again, their service is excellent as well as their food and the cool part is that once you pay you actually get your card back because they come to you to slide your card."}
{"text":"Get here early. Or be prepared to wait 2 hours if you're in a 5 plus group. We waited for about 2 hours which is what they set up front. They have a texting system, so you only have to be 10 minutes away when they do text you.  Nice atmosphere. They have a huge screen playing the movie Hook. They also have club music while you are eating.   The waiters and waitresses are pretty nice and they're pretty attentive to your needs. You should only ask your waiters for specific stuff, such as ordering the four plates of whatever is on the menu. There is a lunch and there is a dinner menu, which differs by 5 plates. So a meat like, galbi, is only on the dinner menu. Need dinner price for per person was about $25 before tax.  Food : The slices of meat were pretty good. Some other meats have been free slice and Frozen. But the quality overall was good. The marinated meets like the bulgogi and galbi were the right taste and not too strong.  You also get the generic side dishes and salad. Rice is included. And they have a drink menu.  The plate changing for the barbecue grill was pretty fast.   Overall, a good experience minus the wait time.  Check it out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good all you can eat Korean bbq place and are in the Henderson area (or close by), this is the place to go to.  The price for the meal is not too bad. The atmosphere is open and has a modern/hip feel to it. Our server, Shea, was very helpful with our large party.   The quality of food is pretty decent and they have a good selection of prepared foods...including the volcano chicken and tofu soup. This is my friend's favorite place,so whenever we are in Vegas, it's a must GO place!"}
{"text":"It's kind of nice to have a Korean BBQ place nearby and Gen Korean BBQ at the Galleria Mall in Henderson is a welcome addition. First off the weaknesses that other diners have mentioned are mostly all true. Service is very good, but who is who in there? It seemed like we had a main server, but then several random people would come over and help us. We ordered our drinks, but the food came before our drinks. We had already started cooking our meats, when a lady came over and asked if we had ordered drinks, we said we did, but it had not arrived yet, but she went and got them in a hurry. Now I am thinking we might get another set of drinks from the guy that first took our order, but he didn't bring them. Oh yeah, we first ordered coke, but the server said they had pepsi, we said that is fine. Then when we were asked the second time and we said we ordered 2 pepsi's the other server said they only had coke. Whatever! we'll take it! (huff!) The meats come at a super rapid pace, they must have them ready and plated in the back room. The classic standard \"Bul (fire) gogi (meat)\" was seasoned properly and the meat was tender for the most part. Lana and I both experienced a fatty inedible \"super ball\" of fat that should have been trimmed off in the kitchen, but they let it go through. The short rib meat (less the traditional bone) was really good. Lana also ordered the steak and she didn't like it, but I did. The table top grill was on full blast and we asked for the power level to be turned down and it helped the cooking process. The inherent drawback of this style of dining is that if you are not paying attention, the meats will not be properly cooked. I hardly took a single bite since I was keeping an eye on the cooking process. The food cooks fast, so take a bite and resume cooking and flipping the meats. The in table ventilation system is as reported, nearly all the smoke is captured as you grill and there is no excessive smoke or odor on you clothes when you leave. I tried some of the suggestions other diners recommended, some were good, some not so good. The agedashi tofu was soft and undercooked, it was just cooked tofu and sauce. The crispy squid was OK, nothing special, some were overcooked and I did get one bite that was delicious, the remainder was hard cooked rubber bands. Towards the end of the meal, I remembered the \"KFC\" (Korean Fried Chicken) and I ordered one to see how it was. The pictures on Yelp from other diners had it as a small side dish, but mine was like a double order and it was not all that great, akin to Panda Express orange chicken with some Korean chili pepper flavoring. The bad part was that some of the chicken was tough and kind of tasted like tough tendons and junk. I had to cover most of it up with my paper knapkin cause it was a gamble to see if the next bite was good or something unedible. I didn't complain about it and I didn't want to be charged extra for not eating everything I ordered. The various side dishes (ban chan) was good, I asked for some extra potato salad, but never got it. (I was getting full anyways). Another server asked if we wanted more kimchi and was said, \"sure\", but he never brought it either. Once again, we were about done anyhow. I noticed some guy in the kitchen slicing away with the meat slicer machine, but that is kind of a bad sign since Korean BBQ meat should take a while to marinate then be served, but it could have been he was slicing more for dinner, so I'll just pretend I didn't see that. The restaurant is very modern and stylish, it's only been a few weeks since they opened so things are clean and in good condition. We only had to wait about 15 minutes to be sat, so that isn't too bad for a Saturday afternoon. The Hostess went through her speech, but she spoke so fast I could not understand most of it, not a big deal since I know the dos and don'ts of Korean BBQ. All day Saturday and Sunday is $19.95 and I guess lunch during the weekdays is $14.95, with dinner prices after 3pm to midnight increasing to $19.95. Pretty good prices for All you can eat with a 2 hour time limit. We noticed one corner table with some big guys having lunch and they surely got their monies worth, they did some damage! Overall very good and I don't need to order stuff to try out next time, I know what to get and what not to repeat. AND they should offer rice to every diner, that is like Mexican food without tortillas! Final note as others had mentioned, we could not get our check! We said we were done so our main server cleared out dishes and he still went on serving other diners. I asked someone else and they acknowledged me, but still no check! I just left the tip on the table and we paid up at the counter. We'll be back again after a while, they still need to get their routine down."}
{"text":"Ok so someone had the bright idea of putting macaroons and mango ice cream together.  What next?  Peanut butter and jelly? Shrimp and grits? Cookies and cream?  Mac and cheese? Wine and cheese?  Chicken and waffles?   Oh..........nevermind. I just enjoyed all that juicy, fruity, flaky, scrumptous goodness in 4 bites!!!   Life is too short so I eat my dessert first, but food and service was amazing and plan on going back soon!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience here.  The service and portion of the food for a party of 8 adults sucked.  Not tiny kids 8 but full grown men and two women. I mean man from the get go it wasn't the best experience I had. We had to order many times for our party and it took so long. I was disappointed with them. I've been to the one in Rancho Cucamonga and Northridge and both had way better service with my party. I mean come one this is the one that most people go to in LA.  It's known for some good quality meat and service. It wasn't crazy busy but yes it was busy. But you think that with a huge party you would get more meat. It sucked because we had to call the waiter many times just to feed our party.   I do like the quality of the meat and the bonchon was great. But small portion for a party of 8 adults is ridiculous. I'll try this place one more time and hopefully it won't be small portions for my huge party."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing dinner!!! This is their first location in AZ. My sister had tried the ones out in Cali, so she was super excited that we now have one right here in our state. The place was so cool looking, modern, with blue decorated lights. The place was super crowded since today was their soft opening. Even though it was busy, our waitress Ejin was very nice and tentative. She made sure we are well taken care of. The servers came frequently to check on us and to replace or grill for fresh ones. The place was very nice, clean and really taken care of.   It's an all you can eat restaurant and you pay a base price of $24.99 per person, but drinks are sold separately. Many of the soft drinks are refillable. I do recommend trying the yogurt sodas so refreshing! You get to order 4 plates time, they do this so orders are paced which makes less waste. This is a great way for not wasting food. I do recommend the spicy baby octopus and the Gen premium sliced steak! The beef was tender and delicious. They have unlimited small dishes like kimchi pickled onions etc.... and salad to go along with all the meat as well. There are 37 items from the dinner menu to choose from for your protein choices. I also ordered this clear noodle dish called Japchae which tasted so good, with veggies and sauce.   Even though I live way out on the West Side, for sure I'll be back here quite often!!:) so if any of you enjoy Korean BBQ like I do, I recommend giving this place a try. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"The only Korean bbq place I love to go to. OZZY was very attentive. He checked in on us every few minutes or so. If you enjoy bbq come visit very welcoming environment great food good time!!"}
{"text":"Kailin was awesome. What a great personality with quick and efficient service. Well definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Julian, awesome server very funny and kind. But some of the meats were very bland. But the meats that were good man oh man they were like C+ at most. I'd eat here again if I had to. But Julian was a great server."}
{"text":"Grew to love this place the more I went. Loved that SOJU juice they have, recommend the peach and yogurt one mixed together! Ozzy at GEN is one of the best waiters ever, truly get service. Always kept up with us and never forgot about us one bit. Keep him around and hire people like him!"}
{"text":"Best korean bbq place out in tempe, mesa, phx , period ! Price is reasonable for all you can eat"}
{"text":"Been to this place several times and loving it... BUT not today!  Ate with the family and in the middle of our dinner - a lady named LYNETTE came and hand in our bill.  I told her we're not done yet and she informed us that there's a two-hour limit (which we know).  I told her that we were there for less than one hour and she said she will check since they clock everyone.  I told her you better!  She came back later and apologize in a very quick fashion!  Good thing that our server Neil came and did a better job of apologizing- I did tell him that I was really offended by that lady's action - only to find out that she was a manager... Wow I don't think I will pass her as a manager!  She definitely needs retraining in customer service!!!! And my advice, if you are to eat here check your watch for the time!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Korean BBQ that I have been to. Food was great, service was awesome and the price was not bad for all you can eat meat:)"}
{"text":"Meat on meat on MEAT!! Holy bulgogi, this is amazing.   From the sleek decor, to the prompt and courteous service, Gen has the system down to a T. No angry Korean moms yanking the tongs out of your hands to correct your \"cooking style.\" Don't get me wrong, I secretly love angry Korean moms, but they are not for everyone.  The meats are some of the most fresh I have ever had, and our server Lisa (along with like, five other servers) kept them coming at breakneck speed!  The buzz is hot right now, so expect at least a 45 min to an hour wait on Friday and Saturday. I'm sure some of the hype will die down eventually, and so will wait times. But even so, totally worth it. I live only 10 minuets from here, so I know I will be here often.  Lunch prices for AYCE are $14.99, Dinner is $19.99, and that includes sides as well. Gen has upwards of 6 or 7 locations, so they must be doing something right. Come see for yourself!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different and I had heard a lot about Gen. I was a little out of my element when I saw all the wrong meat placed on our table. I was expecting to cook it but once it was placed in front of me it took me back haha.   Our hostess was very helpful and knew the menus back and forth. We were given suggestions and tips. The only thing I regret getting is the baby octopus. I didn't like the texture and should have stuck with the shrimp lol.   Sadly my husband doesn't want to go back but ifs tine wants to go with me I'm happy to join. The macarons were delicious as well.  We got the all you can eat for 19.99 and we got: steak, brisket, Cajun shrimp, marinated chicken, rice, and so type of delicious noodles. It was a great experience and I hope to go again!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! I've been to a few gen in Southern California and the experience was ehh. However the Gen in Henderson was amazing. Great quality meat and the chap jae was delicious!  Mina was an attentive waiter always checked if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through friends and saw pictures of the establishment which looked great. My friends and I went there for lunch. Keep in mind that around 3pm, it was far from busy. An entire half of the restaurant was empty. Two people from our party ended up being late for our reservation. They let us sit to wait for them. This is where everything goes wrong. While we were waiting, the staff attempted to sit two strangers in the same table with us. We couldn't believe it. The manager also came out and had the audacity to tell us how reservations work and that we've already been sitting here for an hour and that we only have an hour left ( we hadn't ordered yet). One of my friends ended up having to take the manager aside and lecture her instead how costumer service works and that their policies aren't visible in the restaurant. There isn't gonna be a next time. The food isn't all that great either. The appetizers are good but the actual meats for kbbq are bland. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that's familiar with how quality kbbq should taste."}
{"text":"I wasn't really sure where this was located but everyone said it was easy!! Well it kind of is. It's located right in the \"front\" of the mall, which if you're looking at it directly it'll be to your left.   First and foremost, they're decently priced. When considering quality of the food to the price, you'll definitely be able to get your money's worth.   It's very modern inside which is nice for me! I like modern decorations and it's very pleasing.   And they allow you to be by yourself, yes yes I went by myself to kbbq! The nice thing is they don't have a minimum party requirement like a lot of the kbbq places do. It sucks when you want to eat kbbq and NO ONE wants to go with you, but fear no more! They let you here :D   They have a decent menu and everything I tried, which was one of everything was actually pretty good. I went during lunch so I didn't have the opportunity to try EVERYTHING, but next time I will!   Service is meh at best. It was really difficult to understand my server a lot of times and I do understand FOB. My server also didn't seem to understand my requests which made it meh.   They DON'T do half orders, which is a complete shame and I was pretty upset about it. Considering I'm only one person! But not really a deal breaker, just silly that they don't allow you to do half orders.   They did have radish paper, which is only thinly sliced radish, when I went. It was really tiny and pretty crappy. They gave me five slices of radish that were end pieces and completely folded over on itself. Pretty annoying to me.   All in all it's a decent place. We'll see on the next trip how it goes!"}
{"text":"There were things we liked and things we didn't.  I'll start with what we did: The Hawaiian Steak Beef brisket  Gyoza  Things that were ok: Beef bulgogi Mushrooms and vegetables  Garlic chicken with strange jalapeño cheese fondue     Things we didn't like: Shrimp (head on tail on, was messy and felt gross to shell) Red wine pork belly Sides (room temperature)  Our Server was friendly but we rarely had our water refilled, and we definitely needed more of it.  It was crazy loud and we were sat at the higher bar type seating and I did not like that.  Rubbing elbows with a stranger isn't my favorite thing to do on a date with my husband.  It took us longer to get our check back than it did to eat, no kidding.  We had to flag it down.  The servers run around frantically.  They work hard!  The interior was cool.  The menu had plenty of options.  We wouldn't go there again but it was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Two stars only because this place was good in terms of service from previous experiences. This place feels like its going downhill. Food orders took a while to come out. We had to keep asking for status of certain items ordered. No drink refills, not even an offer to refill. While still waiting on food orders to come out, the server asks if we were ready to pay. Once the bill came, we were incorrectly charged but the hostess promptly fixed it. We still tipped. Hopefully the server, didn't expect good tip after giving horrible food service."}
{"text":"9/10 When I walked in the first thing that caught my attention was the grilling pits at the bar! Than I imagined myself taking shots of Jameson as I burn my briskets and and pork belly... So I made the choice at sitting at booths. The Host at the time insisted we sat at the high chairs because there wasn't any booths available... that wasn't true at all because we counted 9 booths available at that time. Then I was advised they were all reserved for larger groups. I looked at the host and told her that I had back pains of course with my signature puppy \"wawah\" face and boom we got a booth! I guess a party of 3 wasn't large enough for a 4 seater booth... whomp!  The menu blew my mind!! I've never seen so much selection! My mouth couldn't stop drooling! My GF was overwhelmed with all the selection that lead to instantly selecting all the basics.... I wanted to explore but I also didn't want to be stuck eating everything! There is also a fun selection of appetizers. The quality in the meats I've tried are great and well portioned. Note- if you order the short ribs be prepared to tell them how many. The appetizer pictures can be a bit deceiving but it was still delicious. I can go on about details on each bite but I wont! I'll let you taste it for yourselves. Our server was a bit in the goofy side but after he admitted that he was food drunk and just finished eating before he served us, I completely understood him because the food definitely made me feel some kind of way.. A good sleepy food coma type of way lol! Overall the service was awesome, the food quality was great but the appetizers needed a little more love and perhaps a bit more selection on the side dishes as well. I'm definitely coming back for more and rolling in deep with a huge group! AlsoThanks to ummmm I think his name is Trevor? Teddy? Todd? Or Tom? Hope I got one of them right...! Lol awesome service bud! #iam3am airuzz@instagram"}
{"text":"Boy did I want to enjoy this, I am no Koren expert, I love all Asian food types and this was my first AYCE Korean, had non AYCE before and of all the Thai-Chinese-Japanese-Vietnamese, Korean just has been the one I rarely have had  It was my choice to go and my Bday, but only saying that because I was in a good mood and chose the place.  They told us there was a 20 minute wait turned out to be more like 30 to 40 minutes and all the time l saw there were open tables just sitting there why are you going to make people wait when you have open tables I just don't get it. But things became a little more clear from the hostesses but they don't know what the hell they're doing, walking back and looking at the empty tables over and over again taking my phone number to text me when the seat is ready yet not even using them just calling out my name, and you have waiters thatthat literally said please give me the number instead of the name when ordering it's easier for me. Also it would be easier for you, is to not act like no one's ever asked for soy sauce or to ask us if we are finished over and over, but at least  bring the check at the end of the meal, we had to walk up to the counter because nobody came by for 10 mins?  The food quality and keep mine I have nothing to compare it to other than a one time Korean restaurant was OK then you have the short ribs off the bone and while there was a lot of options there wasn't a lot of blow you away quality when It came to the meats and very little flavor-marinade-sauces  There is definitely value in the $20 the all you can eat and maybe they're still going to improve the service which might put three-four star which in my mind means it is worthy of a least one more shot but I'm not in a rush to go back"}
{"text":"Kailin was great at serving me and my friend. Friendly, efficient, and dedicated. She definitely made my experience here at Gen a nice place!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! it was definitely worth the wait. I was not surprised that there would be a 2 hour wait. The good thing was that they were able to text us as soon as the table was ready, so my husband and I just did a little shopping until our table was ready. once we got to our table that servers were very attentive. The food runners got out orders out quickly. They even did grill changes pretty frequently and quickly. the meats were good quality and the tofu soup was flavorful. I would probably wait until the hype goes down to go back, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the one in Cerritos, CA and loved it. So glad there's one here now. I love kbbq and this place doesn't disappoint. Tommy and Yuhao were our servers and they were attentive and gave us some great suggestions. We kept eating and food kept coming. My favorite were the marinated pork belly. Although, anything beef was also delicious. One of the rare places that serve premium beef for kbbq. We will definitely be back. Only thing was missing was dessert. But they just opened so hopefully next time we come we'll get some."}
{"text":"Update 10/28/17 : Gen needs to really up their game at this location! The meat is becoming mediocre in how they are cutting them. Literally thinner than paper! And so tiny. If we are paying top dollar, please keep your meat coming out the way you guys first started and don't jip us with that paper thin meat size. Come on!!! And rice paper, word on the street is you guys discontinued it? Come on!!! Best part to have with the meat besides rice .     Amazing place to eat k bbq!!! The decor inside is pretty awesome. The way they vent out the smoke from the grill is amazing because it does its job right and you don't smell smoke everywhere! The meat is amazing. It's fresh and you can tell it's amazing quality meat! Rice paper is always available. It's amazing with the bbq. Hawaiian steak is a must have!! I've gotta say this place is worth the wait. I did however took one star away because of the crazy wait! 2 hours long! Make sure they get your number 100% right so they can text you when your tables ready. It's super crazy in there with people waiting around in front of Barnes and nobles! LOL! Price is about 25 bucks per person, would recommend to go hungrryyy! It won't disappoint"}
{"text":"I brought my mom & dad for lunch on Mother's Day. We were on the waiting list about 11 parties ahead of us. It was good that we were able to monitor our status on the list through their website link. It did not take us long to get out table. The waiter assigned to us was very accommodating. He made some suggestions from the menu for us to try. I think his name was Jeremiah or something. It was my third visit but a first for my folks. Food was good & we had fun. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Ask for Ozzy! He was the most amazing server! Came in his first week for us everything we needed and definitely worth your money and time if you need to wait. We waited a lil over an hour! Thanks Ozzy!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Kenny and his team were very attentive. Food was great. Flat iron steak and beef bulgogi were my favorites. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Heard good reviews from friends and family. The wait was long but the food and service was great. Ozzy was our server and he did a great job at making sure our waters were filled, served our food promptly and provided great suggestions since he knew it was our first time. Would recommend asking for Ozzy when checking this place out."}
{"text":"Huge selection of great AYCE meats for a great price! At $22/pp you can't beat the price. Kids pricing is by height, under 40\" is free and under 50\" is half price.   Customer service is top notch and fast! We received our meats and drinks super fast and they were always willing to change out our grill without complaints.  Standout meats were the Hawaiian anything (pork belly, galbi, chicken) beef tongue, and brisket."}
{"text":"I initially wanted to try this place out in LA until I discovered there was a location about half an hour from the strip! Our server, Alodia, was so amazing! Super nice, constantly checked up on us and gave us phenomenal service. Not only her though, but the host and manager were also very friendly! Cajun shrimp is bomb by the way!"}
{"text":"I really love this place and was excited to find out that they finally opened one up in Las Vegas. Me and a few friends came here when we heard they were having a soft opening.  As we walked in I was surprised on how big this location is and the ambiance is to really good. Now the customer service is amazing they were very attentive to us and of course the food is amazing. I will definitely be coming here often, and I recommend anyone who likes Korean bbq to give it a try."}
{"text":"I really like eating here the place has really good food and it's all you can eat for a decent price. It does get crowded and sometimes you have to wait for a period of time but the mall is right next door so you can shop while you wait so it's really not a problem since I like to shop."}
{"text":"Always a satisfying meal when I come to Gen. Food came out promptly and their happy hour soju special is great. Big thanks to Jaenica for the solid service! Super personable & attentive!"}
{"text":"I was excited to dine at Gen in Las Vegas (Henderson) since I've been to a number of their restaurants in California. I came with my aunt and uncle who were visiting from California; they also had a friend from Taiwan with them. Even though we were only a party of four, we were seated at a table with two grills, which was nice. We came on a Monday night around 7PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Our waitress was rather nice and her shift ended during our meal, but our subsequent waiter was also quite attentive and friendly.   The menu at each Gen is slightly different, but I feel like there were less items on the menu than the ones in California. The quality of the meat was good, but also not as good as California. There were fewer banchan and no rice paper here, and you have to ask for the daikon radish sheets. Portions in general are smaller, but since it is AYCE, just ask for more.  Overall, a solid meal at a fair price, but not as good as the California locations. Also, it was a little bit warm in the restaurant during our meal; you would think they would turn up the A/C more given that it's summer in Vegas and there are a ton of barbecue grills running."}
{"text":"This place is great! Make sure you don't fill up on the appetizers, because the entrée options are plentiful and delicious. Make sure you request Ozzy as your server. He is very genuine, nice, and extremely attentive. We will definitely return!! Great food and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Place is modern. Food is soooo good comparable to the ones in LA. Service is excellent. I really can't believe we have this gem in Phoenix now. Absolutely love it and worth the price."}
{"text":"Prior to Gen, the All You Can Eat Korean BBQ scene was non-existent. There were a few Korean BBQ places that sold a la carte meat dishes but you end up spending like $70 or more for two people. Some restaurants tested out their AYCE, but their selection was mediocre at best with few choices and often slow/terrible service. Now... redemption has come!  Tuesday night on 9/12/2017 was their first soft opening night. There was no line and we were seated right away. Our server David was awesome! In fact, we had about 5 people helping us out. Three hostess kept coming by to make sure we had what we needed, and if we didn't, they would get David for us. And two other staff came to change our grill plates very often. And if they didn't come, one of the hostess that kept coming to our table got someone to change our grill plate. David and the hostesses came by so often we had trouble keeping up with ordering our food because our orders kept coming fast. That's what I called EXCELLENT SERVICE.  The food was so delicious. We were able to order about 17 items within the 2 hour limit we had. I highly recommend the bulgogi and Hawaiian pork belly and beef tongue. I personally felt the the meat quality for all items ordered was very good. You can tell by the color and the texture of the meats. The marinated flavored meats were excellent. It blew me away because it tasted really good~! Even compared to KBBQ places in LA, I thought this Gen location surpassed them in service, flavor, variety and quality.  I don't know if they overstaffed themselves for the soft open, but this was one of the best Korean BBQ experiences I had. I hope they keep their staffing level like this for the future. The place was clean, the staff was great (friendly and fast), and the food was high quality with delicious flavors. If anything, I would suggest they put steamed egg on their menu, since I usually order that when I go to AYCE KBBQ, and they can improve their side dishes by making them bigger. BUT THE SIDE DISHES DIDN'T MATTER! Because our meats came out so fast and kept coming, I didn't have time to even really eat the sides dishes. LOL. Well played, Gen KBBQ. Well played."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out that there would be a Gen KBBQ in Phoenix. It was one of my favourite places for KBBQ when I was living in LA (even though there are lot of more authentic ones in KTown there). I finally came here about a month or two after it opened, and I was so ready to cook my favourite marinated meats, wrap them up in rice paper, and savour the delicious flavour. But upon arrival, I was immediately disappointed because there is NO RICE PAPER. I know that KBBQ is all about the meat, for me, the rice paper to wrap it in is just as important, and I have never been to a KBBQ that straight up did not have rice paper at all. This was the number one thing that peeved me, and I would say that it ruined the experience. There was another thing that I was horrified about, but I can't fully remember. I want to say that it was a lack of spicy, sticky rolls on their menu. This was one of my favourite dishes to order at Gen LA. It was a perfect little dish to cleanse the palate when you are way too full of meat. But alas, Gen in Tempe lacked this too.  Nonetheless, here are some general things to keep in mind at Gen: - Come for lunch because it is a lot cheaper than dinner, and the menus only differ by 5 items, which doesn't make much difference; weekend lunch costs the same as regular dinner though. - My favourites are the beef bulgolgi, Hawaiian beef, and brisket; there are a lot of other excellent stuff on the menu, but these are staples. - I think they charge you for rice; that was probably the other thing that disappointed me (and not the lack of rice rolls). I wouldn't order rice for KBBQ, but if they're not going to provide rice paper, AND they charge for bowls of rice, that is just plain ridiculous. - Don't order more than you can eat, because they will charge you for leftovers. - Gen always plays loud, upbeat, pop music. I don't think it's good for digestion, and definitely not conducive for mealtime discussions, but that's how it always is."}
{"text":"This used to be my all time favorite Korean BBQ here in Vegas, but I'm sad to say I can no longer hold that to be true. After recently dining and seeing the menu change, and the quality and taste of our food not being up to par we now have to search for a new favorite Korean bbq. Their salad is the only thing that is still amazing, god I love it! We ordered rice and barely got any in the bowl that was served, you would've thought it was half eaten already. Our favorite fried chicken with the yummy red sauce is no longer in the menu. Red wine pork belly and other favorites were quite bland, So disappointing!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Was told there was a 15 min wait. No problem. Waited close to 40 mins but that was fine. It was busy. Sat down and ordered. Everything I ordered was good but the shrimp. I got questioned by a manager if I've ever eaten shrimp before! Really? Plus it's a 2 hr experience. Not even an hr into it I kept getting asked by my server if we were ready for our check. No! At $25 a person I'm gonna spend 2 hrs there. My daughter is only 12. On top of that I wouldn't have waited to eat there knowing your bar wasn't open.  I was letting my kid cook at her own pace. The server said this is how you're suppose to do it. She put all of our meat on the grill. I know it was busy but I wanted my child to have an un rushed experience."}
{"text":"The wait here is absolutely insane. However KBBQ houses are non existent out in Arizona so the wait was worth it. The second time I was there, there was even a wait on the types of meat I wanted. Well with that being said it was still tasty. I'll be going again for sure."}
{"text":"So good. I've heard alot of bad things about the Gens in California but damn, this place, two thumbs up for quality and service."}
{"text":"Ozzy is absolutely amazing at his job.  Food was amazing.  I will be back to see ozzy."}
{"text":"I love the place, atmosphere, the food, the wait line wasn't bad either. Only thing I could say that needs slight improvement is a bit of structure or organization with the waiters.. We had like 4 different waiters helping us besides the initial guy, so that was a bit confusing as to who to ask for stuff. But the overall experience was soooo good I can't even dock them for that! Guys... I LOVE YOUR SALAD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the concept. It is nice and very straight forward. They have a ton of options and staff is pretty good for the most part. My issue was the quality. They marinate the meat but it's less than par quality in taste and meat quality is questionable. Part of why Korean bbq is so good is because of the sauces and marinades they use. I will go back and try a few other things. This run was good, far from excellent and miles from great."}
{"text":"really good korean bbq place good ambience and design good meat, our waiter Josh provided exceptional service, attending to our needs constantly and quickly would recommend"}
{"text":"So good that we had to come twice during our trip to Vegas! Do yourself a favor and order the Korean Fried Chicken, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Some waitresses are just arrogant for no reasons. Some are nice. So good luck! We were unlucky with unfriendly ones."}
{"text":"Man what a great atmosphere. Service was great food had such an awesome flavor to it. The price is affordable. We found a new home for grubbin."}
{"text":"Food was great but service is spotty. We waited over 2 hours to get a table and you'd assume that the waiter would understand by then a customer would be crazy hungry and  would like to get their order in quickly but no, we felt like we were an inconvenience to them and they would rather we not be there. How about bringing some of the Korean hospitality along with the food?"}
{"text":"Was closed at 9:30 for maintenance. I showed up at 8 and said they were going to let us eat for 40 mins before kicking everyone out"}
{"text":"We came here for the $15.99 all-you-can-eat lunch and left feeling meh. There are a lot of options to choose from, but the flavors and food didn't feel like authentic Korean BBQ. I actually found the items that were pre-cooked (e.g. KFC) and the side items (salad, kimchi, and potato salad) to be better than the main dishes that you cook at the table.   As for the cook-at-the-table items, the beef bulgogi didn't quite taste like bulgogi and was disappointing; however, the pork bulgogi was better marinated. The Gen Chadol was also disappointing and very bland. The best item was the garlic pork belly which was tastiest when you got it a little crispy like bacon.   Overall, we left full but not quite satisfied with the meal. I think the menu is the same for dinner which raises the cost to $20.99 so I recommend trying it out for lunch first."}
{"text":"Gen is on the top of my list when it comes to kbbq. The cleanliness is top notch, which is a big deal to me. The food is great quality and comes in decent portions at a time so that you can really try everything. They also have rice paper! The staff is amazing and are always on top of changing your grill and helping you out. Our server last night, Alodia, was the best we've had so far. Alodia was always on top of our orders. We did have to wait for rice but it wasn't her fault, the rice was cooking. She made up for it 100% with great customer service and a bubbly personality. When someone asks me what kbbq place I would recommend in Vegas, Gen is number 1!"}
{"text":"If you are going to splurge this is a good place to go. Only thing is when you are bringing your young children that are a little bit over their height limit regardless of age be prepared to pay full price even if they can only eat one small piece of meat. Overall not bad for your moneys worth."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best place to get all you can eat KBBQ in town. Our waiter Bo, was an awesome waiter! He was very nice, & always made sure to stop by our table often so that we had everything we need. He told me that he felt like he didn't do a great job at serving us, but I disagree. I've done my fair share within the food industry, & know a hard worker when I see one. Now onto the food. This place was very clean organized compared to Tofu Hut or other places I have been too. I didn't even have to question myself whether or not the food was safe to eat. Their sauce to dip the beef in was absolutely delicious. It had a hint of vinegar and sweet soy sauce I believe. Many KBBQ places I have been to don't really have a great selection of dipping sauces (most of them just look like straight up oil). I also enjoyed their salad. My mom doesn't eat rice so we literally ordered like 4 plates of salad with extra sauce (cause that's how we like it). The meat was very good as well! The brisket is always good anywhere you go, but I was surprised they had the boneless Kalbi beef (we're used to getting the one with bones). Definitely get the chicken appetizer, you won't regret it. Also the bulgogi was very flavorful & tasty. I gave them 4 stars because they don't have a desert selection (which I was highly disappointed about), & they ran out of edamame & Cajun fries during the time we went. All in all, definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it. & they have a pretty cool electronic hand held device thingy to pay with if you're paying with a card. I thought that was unique compared to other restaurants I've been to. As you can probably tell I suck at writing Yelp reviews, but since I promised my waiter Bo, this is the best you guys are going to get!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences, our server kailin was very awesome and always quick with refills as well as ordering for more food. I highly recommend checking out Gen kbbq if you have not check them out yet."}
{"text":"So first off our server had to be hunt down and the wait was pretty long, also my friends are not Korean or ever been to a KBB so if I had not known how to cook the meat we could have gotten sick, flavors were good but it felt to American."}
{"text":"The service at Gen Korean BBQ was very good. Our primary waiter was very attentive and made sure the meat we ordered to grill was delivered to us in a timely manner. The quality of the meat was good. However, there were a number of \"missed opportunities\" in my opinion, the most significant of which was the lack of lettuce/sesame leaves to wrap the meat in, no red pepper past, garlic or jalapeños to include in the lettuce wrap. Gen appears to be catering to customers who are not familiar with traditional Korean BBQ, which is unfortunate. Korean BBQ is nothing to be ashamed of...it is why my family and I seek out Korean restaurants whenever we are visiting a new city for the first time. All in all, a good value, but it could be better."}
{"text":"We went last night for dinner the plus the proteins where decent the pork cutlet being excellent. The issues here can be overcome the service is poor and unorganized. No ice in the building ( get better machines) the grills I am not sure they are plumbed proper as they just cut out in the middle of grilling ( gas flow issue?) overall I doubt a return trip to Gen is in the future bummer because I love KBBQ ."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the price is reasonable. Our server Seong is absolutely great. Gonna come back pretty soon"}
{"text":"Hey there, okay so I can't believe how cheap it is only 20$ for all food plus appetizers allllllllll for 20!!! That's crazy good. Only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when they drop off the food they don't tell you which meat it is and I think they should. The guys changing the grill was quick and awesome. Their screen sucks so I don't recogmend watching football here... But yah so cheap for all that food. In California its some much more expensive for the same thing! So yah!!!"}
{"text":"Came back here to give it another try. The food is quite good. The server we had was nice, but she would take a lot of time to be able to come back to us. After everyone ordered, the stuff came out pretty fast. Except for the rice. Ten minutes later, our kind server comes to apologize and will bring the rice asap. A couple minutes later :-)))))))) \"I'm so sorry! I just checked the rice timer and it said it's gonna be about 30 more minutes.\" But about ten minutes later, \"Don't hate me but... There will be no rice at all tonight. I'm super sorry.\" I know it isn't her fault, I don't blame her at all. But how the heck do you not serve your AYCE KBBQ customers rice??? It was 8:50, mind you, they close at MIDNIGHT. Pssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........  And such small \"variety\" of banchan. It was 4 sides man. Lol. Not even any bean sprouts."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday, and it was great. Food was wonderful, the service was fast and the food kept coming.  I decided to take my girlfriend there for her birthday, because she liked it so much, and was told they wouldn't take reservations. Ok, so I called the night of and asked how long the wait would be.  20 to 30 minutes, seamed like a reasonable wait for a Friday night, so we head over. We arrive only to find groups of people hanging around the entrance. We go to put our names in, and the hostess said 2 hours at least. I tell her I just called and they said 20 to 30, and she tells me \"that's just what we're telling people on the phone.\"  As much as I like the food, I'm not sure it's worth dealing with people who'll jerk you around on a special night."}
{"text":"Came here with my family, which was a group of 6. They do apply a 18% gratuity for a party of that size, which was no problem but that means the server can lack service and they will still get almost a 20% tip. The reason for my review being 3 stars was they had barely any vegetarian options. I had to eat glass noodles (10/10) and peppers, onions and mushrooms for $21, which was there all you can eat price. My family, who eat meat, seemed to enjoy it but vegetables and noodles did not fill me up. I was hoping they had tofu, but nope. If I was a meat-eater, this place would have been better, very cool idea. Also, ventilation of this restaurant was bad, left the restaurant REEKING of bbq smoke. NOT VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend yesterday. When we arrived, we have to sign up and wait for almost an hour to have our table. My server was a guy name Kevin N, he's funny and nice to us. The food is extremely awesome, although we drive for 45 mins from Glendale to here but I think it's worth. Thank you for such an amazing dinner, and we would definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Just left with full bellies. Great food, amazing service (Kristina is a rock star) by a youthful, enthusiastic staff. Modern ambience and a downdraft grill that doesn't leave you smelling like garlic smoke. GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Jessica / Server: been here a TON of times and she's been there to serve here and there. Adored & always loved her kind service!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and my newborn. I had my baby in a stroller, the staff kindly explained strollers couldnt be allowed in the dining room so they had me place it by the front desk while they kept an eye on it :) We took the carseat to the table and the staff was extremely attentive and fast! There was no wait time for us when we arrived at around 7pm. As soon as we ordered maybe a minute later our orders were at the table. The staff kept checking up on us. I love this place its a beautiful restaurant and excellent staff! I will definitely be coming back! Thank you for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Just ate here yesterday and I think they are still in their soft-opening phase. I've been to a couple of Gens back in California and I have to say this place was just alright compared to back home. Then again, I suppose this place would be a better alternative to having no nearby KBBQ places at all lol. The place has that club-like feel with the dimness and blue lights. It actually makes you feel like you should dress up a bit, but who does that for KBBQ?   Anyways, it was cool to find out that they had a variety of appetizers which are included in the $19.95 AYCE dinner price. I tried the agadashi tofu and seaweed salad. The tofu was just alright. It could have used more seasoning and it'd be nice if it was crispier. The shell was so thin and didn't have that crunchiness factor. I'd rather just eat the tofu without the shell since it would be healthier lol. The seaweed salad was decent and a nice addition to the meal since it was refreshing and doesn't really fill you up (more room for meat!).   As for the meats, I would not order their brisket. It literally was the most fatty pieces of meat I have ever seen and eaten. It seemed okay at first, but after cooking them on the grill for a few minutes, the fat began to puff up and the meat resembled marshmallows. I think there was more fat than meat and my poor arteries cried with each bite I took. Besides, that experience, the rest of the meat was okay. The bulgolgi I've had at other places were much saucier and flavorful while this place seemed much drier and tasteless. Their steak is good and I would recommend trying their K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken). It looks like the orange chicken you can get at Panda Express, but the sauce definitely makes it worth it.   The side dishes were typical, but I was sad that they didn't have the thin slices of radishes. The sourness definitely makes the meal much more enjoyable.   The service was actually pretty good. There were people coming about every 10-15 minutes just to check up on my table. They were nice and had a good upbeat attitude which makes a big difference because I've been to some places where you can tell that the workers did not want to be there.  Overall, I would recommend checking this place out for lunch since it is a bit cheaper. If you end up liking it and think it's worth it, the dinner scene is definitely much, much more worth it."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we thought we'd give this place a chance. Upon arriving they quoted a 20 minute wait, but it was actually 50. The music was incredibly loud obnoxious club type thumping garbage. When the waiter arrived whole my friend was in the restroom, I told him to bring what he thought we would enjoy, and he ordered for us. The food arrived via busboy in about 2 minutes and I said that it couldn't be ours because I had just ordered and he said that since they order thru an iPad the food comes out right away...but before we got our drinks? What arrived was raw squid, octopus, head-on uncleaned shrimp, three plates of beef, rice, salad and 10 accompanying side dishes. It looked good but was entirely too much food for 2 people, easily enough for 4 or more and I'm a big eater. We cooked and ate about half, but the food was flavorless and watching the  eyes pop off the shrimp as it cooked was less than appetizing. When waiter asked if we wanted more, I said that we were thru but would like to try the ice cream. The macarons were delicious. When the waiter arrived with the check he then told us we would be charged $5 EXTRA FOR EACH PLATE OF FOOD that we didn't completely finish. Why would they bring enough food to feed an army for two people? Ultimately didn't get charged the extra fees. Didn't really care for this place but it did seem like others were enjoying themselves. Just not for me I guess."}
{"text":"BBQ always great as usual, but I have to give a special shout out to Kailin. We just had the best service.  She was really attentive and personable."}
{"text":"Great food & service! Also, amazing value for lunch! Wish there was one where we live. What a treat!"}
{"text":"The food is always great here. The bulgogi, chadol, kalbe, calamari -excellent. Can get noisy when it's busy - they should put out noise suppressors in the ceiling to cut down on the chatter. Service varies, when you get an experienced waiter/waitress, you'll be treated well. They know when to come to the table to take more orders, etc. we were stuck with a trainee once, and we had to prompt for service several times. Overall, food is always very good"}
{"text":"Gen was a spectacular restaurant & has a great atmosphere! Much cleaner than a lot of Las Vegas Korean BBQ restaurants. Must get there brisket, steak, & pork belly! Our waiter was Howard, he was very helpful in making selection & service."}
{"text":"Awesome food marinated steak and pork belly are to die for, Cajun shrimp is my favorite!! Best place to go when you do no carbs!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Our waiter just leaves on his break while we are waiting on more food and drinks! His relief waiter did not come serve us the entire time! Then they just tried to add 15 min to our 2 hour max for the inconvenience! Horrible"}
{"text":"I guess you can say we frequent this restaurant. We have been there about 5 time since it opened. We have enjoyed each visit but noticed that the overall customer service with reference to their servers had declined a bit. Just minor issues like servers not visiting the table as often as I think they should to check on the guests' status, topping off water glasses or checking for refills on drinks, again just minor stuff. What's worse is the place wasn't really that busy at the times that we have dined there. I have more tolerance than most when it come to stuff like this so I I won't slam them too hard. Our experience from our visit on 5/85/2016 was the worst so far but even at that, just minor things again were at issue. Really the purpose of this review is to give kudos to one specific individual, a server by the name of Shae. She was absolutely fantastic. I think she observed a bit of dissatisfaction from the patrons at our table and immediately offered her service and was prompt, courteous and friendly. She stayed consistent by coming back to out table frequently to check if we needed anything. So, just want to say \"Great job, Shae!!!\""}
{"text":"Usually when there is a lot of hype around a restaurant, I typically do not understand it. However, for this restaurant, it definitely lived up to all the hubbub. When we arrived on a Tuesday night, the wait was 45-60 minutes. This place is at Tempe Marketplace so we left to walk around. The restaurant sent us a text when our table was ready, which was well within the estimated time frame. When we got inside, I was impressed by its clean and cool interior design. The table itself was was small, considering we usually have multiple plates on top of the grill, but I definitely liked the sunken-in design of the table. It made grabbing the food easy. The service was outstanding. This was my first time eating Korean BBQ in a long time, so our server provided us with a step-by-step guidance throughout dinner. He even grilled some of our food for us. That was so nice of him to do so! It is AYCE. The menu is a set fee per person. They list all the rules on the menu. The rules are pretty standard for BBQ places, but be sure to review them before you go to town. Also, their alcoholic drinks are humongous. I ordered some flavored soju, expecting a glass of it. No. I got a whole carafe. Despite how busy it was when I came, the employees did a pretty good job keeping the place clean. They did have employees walking around constantly to pick up used plates, replace our grill, etc...  This is definitely a great restaurant, and it is a fun experience. I highly recommend it. Be sure to arrive in advance or plan for a long wait accordingly."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and usually my experience is around a four stars.  The food is solid, the price is great, and the service is ok.  Last night I went with my sister and everything was put up a notch.  The food came out fast, the side dishes were crisp and great, and the best part was most definitely the service.  We had Eugene as our server, and he went all out for us! He was attentive, responsive, very helpful, and my the experience overall a better one.  He helped us any chance he got, and answered every question we had.  Everything was fantastic, and Eugene was the best server we have had going to Gen.  When I come back I hope we get Eugene again!  Great experience."}
{"text":"A week after giving birth to my daughter, my father-in-law deserved a dinner out since he has been cooking like crazy.  Hubby and I took his parents to Gen to finally try it out.  The wait was only 15 minutes.  We don't like the fact that they already put out the slim # of banchans on the table already.  And also, though our server was friendly, she had way too many tables to get our orders out in a timely manner.  There seems to be a miscommunication somewhere when she said she will get another green tea for me (after taking away my drink), and her returning 10 mins later to see how we are doing, when I requested for my green tea.  She mentioned that someone was suppose to bring it out.  I don't know, maybe because they are still new so they still have not figure out the waiting staff logistics just yet...but this place doesn't impress me much.  The meats were good quality, but the time it takes to put in the order is very poor.  Everything comes out in very small portion too."}
{"text":"OK so I was excited to try this place because I've had great Korean barbecue back in Los Angeles. My husband had never had Korean barbecue so I wanted to take him somewhere. The food was mediocre. But let's start with a list of complaints and suggestions. The soda machine was apparently out of order I heard one waiter telling another waiter that it had been down since 10 AM, mind you we were there for dinner for about a 730PM time frame. (you would think on a Saturday probably one of their largest revenue days of the week they would have a repair man come out and look at it and get it fixed in a timely manner?). First disappointment but we moved on. They give you scissors and tongs to cook the food on the grill. Typically you are using the scissors for raw meat so it's not something you necessarily want to use again after the food is cooked. They give you Chopstix to eat with--the waiter asked if we wanted forks, we both said yes yet, they were never brought to us. No knife to cut the meat after cooked...didn't want to use the scissors that were used for raw meat...  My next complaint would be the lighting,I understand that they are trying to create an ambience and set a mood, however, any place where you are cooking your own meat and trying to see if it is still raw, this is a poor decision to have such poor lighting. The lighting is so low it was nearly impossible to check the meat if it was still raw.   They had our grill really low and our food was taking forever to cook. We asked one waiter to turn it up and every time our waiter walked by he'd turn it down. Rinse repeat. This happened 5x during our stay. The grill controls are also on an awkward place in the booths, so it's difficult to control yourself. The one I ate at in LA had them on the table so it was easy to turn down when your meat was finished cooking etc.   On a positive note, they were very attentive about drinks and changing out our grill top when needed."}
{"text":"I come here a few times and my experience is always amazing !!! Tonight we had ozzy and he was soooo nice ! He always came at the right time when we need something. Super attentive and always made sure we were happy :) Zach also came by a couple times to check up on us for extra napkins or drinks, etc! Both of them made our experience at GEN phenomenal ! :)))"}
{"text":"This goes to Shae who was originally from the windward side of Oahu, Kalaheo grad. She was our server the time we went about 2 weeks ago. Even though she was hustling 8 tables (no joke), she kept composure and helped every one, even the impatient ones! I am missing the Cajun Pork Belly ever since I returned home in Oahu. I know we have a GEN BBQ here too in Ala Moana, but you really can't beat $15.99 AYCE/person for lunch! Will come again when I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Food was awesome.  Def a must when you're in the area. But also worth the drive.  The price was the best of all."}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  My son was dying to try Korean BBQ and it did not disappoint.  it was a fun experience and excellent food and really good value especially when feeding a hungry 17 yr old boy!"}
{"text":"**This review is on the service**  Unfortunately, my family and I had a really bad experience at this establishment. We were a party of 6 adults and 3 kids. We were given the table all the way in back, right next to the restrooms, and where the servers deposit dirty dishes (actually tossed them in a big container making loud noises thus scaring our kids). Since we were a big party gratuity was already included, and I strongly feel this is why our waitress service was crap. She rarely visited our table. She would walk pass our table and as we called her she'd ignored us. When our orders where actually taken, we had to keep asking different waiters about them because they took forever to be brought out.   I left Gen Korean bbq house as a very unsatisfied customer, who spent $20.99(dinner price) along with her family. For the amount of money that my husband and I ended up paying with the additional $26 gratuity, which was added automatically, I expected our orders to be out in time and our drinks refilled.  Sadly (and I say sadly because I really love Korean bbq) I nor my family will not be dining at this establishment again."}
{"text":"The food rates a five but the noise takes it down a star. It's nearly impossible to have a conversation over the volume of the music, especially when you are sitting across from each other. The tables are wide by necessity (they each have a built-in grill) and thus you have to shout to each other to be heard.  However, the selection of meat and seafood is extensive and for what you get the price is better than reasonable. If you don't mind shouting it's a great place. Maybe my age makes me hard of hearing."}
{"text":"Wow. AMAZING! I can say for the price and quality it is great. I am a couple days late in my review. My husand recently came back from a year tour in korea and we were craving kbbq. So we decided to try here. Well for starters, when we walked in we were greeted warmly by the beautiful decor and friendly host staff. We were seating in booths that are quite comfortable. Service was amazing, we had the pleasure of having Ozzy who was supper efficient in eveything from water refills to explanation and recommendations to stuff in the menu! They even have appetizers included In the AYCE. Our meats were brought out quickly and they were delish. I will say the lack of bachan (side dishes) were very scarce and in the korean tradition (I'm half korean born and raised in korea) those are important. Non the less the appetizers did a good job in replacement of missing banchan. My son was enjoying his pork cutlet and even had 2 orders! I was too busy enjoying the food I forgot to take more pictures. Overall great environment, cost, taste, food and service! Thank you Ozzy again and know we will be back just for your service!!!!"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere, and service was great. Our server Lisa was very intentive. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Their pork ribs are tasty, totally well-marinated. The  restaurant environment is like most BBQ place, noisy and smoky. Most waiters here are helpful and nice except one white waitress with nose ring. She accidentally pulled the pork belly on my side of booth and also got on my right arm, it's really nasty. She didn't apologize at all, only randomly left on a bunch of napkins on my table's wet area. I felt that's kinda rude even she might forgot. Hopefully the manager could train the waitress more to handle any accident."}
{"text":"Excellent service!!! On the Fourth of July, all of the staff was so kind and helpful. I believe our server's name was Jessica, and she was particularly sweet and attentive and really made and extra effort to be genuinely kind to everyone at the table. She had to switch over to another server at the end of our meal, the server who helped us after she left was also very kind, and even so she really made an impression on us. The hostess we paid was also so adorable and had a great attitude. We missed her name, but I believe she had braces and her positive energy was worth mentioning. Wonderful experience and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday around 4:00 so it was dinner time. Our server was Kailin very nice server. The food was good and good portions considering there was only 2 of us. I did not really like the spicy tofu soup as it seems a bit bland and wasn't hot. The bussers were attentive with changing our grill when it was dirty. The place was very spacious and had some good old 2000s music playing. Overall for $19.99 dinner it is one of the cheapest AYCE kbbq around town. Too bad this place is around 40 mins from my house."}
{"text":"I had been in some GEN restaurants in Southern California, moved to Phoenix and have been missing It for a while. It is great that it is opened here. Lots of selections with a reasonable price although the waiting line is like 1-2 hours unless you  were here before 5pm.  Overall, my wife and I love it and will be back several times."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Great food, fast service and they take good care of us. The marinated steak is fantastic and the cheese pork cutlet is amazing!!  Ask for Ozzy to be your server - he's super sweet. The manager Eugene was our favorite server before he was promoted and still stops by every time we come in to say hello!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a week and had to get some Korean bbq. The reviews were pointing to Gen with a lunch deal for $16.99 so we head on over. In short This is a fantastic Korean bbq restaurant!  The ambiance was very lounge like with blue neon lights reflecting off of mosaic mirrored vases. The standard  Korean bbq set up with the round grill in the center of the table where you prepare your own foods was surrounded by salts sauces Kim chi, & ginger and was presented on lovely simple white saucers and plates. The menu was AYCE top quality beef, seafood, chicken and pork. The bulgogi  was so good we ate four servings of it! Not to say the servings were small they were adequate and replaced almost immediately with more by quick service! We also tried or shall I say devoured, shrimp, premium pork belly, garlic pork belly, KFC (Korean fried chicken which is prepared in the kitchen) calamari, beef brisket, Hawaiian beef steak, & gyoza. Last but certainly not least is service! All that food  was served quickly with a smile by Justin and assists. We were gratefully full and ordered the icecream macaroon sandies to go we feel so stuffed we are going now To \"walk it off!!\""}
{"text":"Perhaps these guys need to advertise that they'll turn you away if you arrive 56 minutes (yes nearly an hour) before closing time! 4 minutes after 11 was obviously too much for them to handle! Great customer service."}
{"text":"Great Service, excellent food, Great Price, Nice place new and contemporary, Waitstaff and hosts are very friendly. I've been there 3 times for dinner, trying lunch soon."}
{"text":"Great experience, okay quality. The rice was dry, the chicken was slimy and very fatty, and the meat lacked flavor. It was also very chewy even when cooked medium rare. Tried almost everything on the menu but nothing stuck out besides the side dish of kimchi."}
{"text":"First timer alert!!! Came in on a Friday night at 6:00pm. There was a 1 hour wait and they take down your cell number and text you when the table is ready. Once you sit down your greeted by your server who will give you the run down of what everything is on the table and how things works. You have 2 hours for $24 per person all you can eat dinner and you can order up to 4 items at a time. NOTE: you do have to pay for any unused/uncooked/uneaten raw meat. So once you start getting to the end and full, slow down so you don't over order or you will pay... literally. Ha   Our servers name was Shannon and she was AMAZING! Always at our table changing the grill, making sure our drinks were full, putting in our next order, and helped us at first move the meat around since clearly it took us awhile to figure it out. All the staff was INCREDIBLE though. There was multiple people that checked in on us and placed our next order to insure the protein was constantly flowing.   Now on to the food!!! They start you out with a ginger/Asian salad and each person gets a bowl of rice. Salad is good and refreshing. Then you start to order the protein 4 at time and it's raw So it comes out quick. Half the time I forgot what I was eating but it was all super good and pre marinated. The chicken is hard to cook because it takes longer and comes in big chunks. Some of the thin sliced meats were hard to cook because they stuck to the grill or cooked way too fast. Your first two orders you will mess up the cooking but then you kind of learn how to do it and what you like.  My best advice is to just take your time. Order your 4 proteins at first and figure out how to get the cook perfect before ordering another round. It can get Over whelming trying to figure it out while they bring you more food and your table is already full! We learned the hard way.... haha  Some of my favorites were the KFC(Korean fried chicken that comes out pre-cooked and taste like orange chicken), Hawaiian steak, and pork belly.   And in case you haven't ate enough yet... save room for dessert! They have $3.50 macaroon ice cream sandwiches in about 4-5 flavors. The mango and green tea were the best! It was a nice refreshing dessert after pigging out on all that food.   Overall it was a great and fun experience with our friends. Great place for people who love meat!! Lots and lots of meat! You will leave so full you hate yourself! I'm excited to come back and now that we know how it works, we will be pros! Haha thank you (:"}
{"text":"So glad are friend recommended this place it was  delicious. Ozzy was our server and took great care of us. He was very attentive and made our first time visit very memorable. Definitely recommend for u to try this place if u have not tried it out yet."}
{"text":"This place was seriously the best. The service, the food, the atmosphere. Omg. We have been to the 3 more popular kbbq spots in the valley and this is #1. The menu options are great & the price was well worth it. We came late so there was NO wait. Which we were pre warned about. We are definitely coming back! Oh & The kpop playing (BTS & Big Bang especially) +++!!! We LOVE Gen!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! All you can eat KBBQ? Yes please! I only wish i had found this place sooner. We only discovered it two weeks before we moved out out of town and now I'm super bummed. We liked it so much we went twice in the span of 3 days.   The meats are great. The seasoned ones have good flavor. I was a big fan of their soondubu BUT I would pass on their japchae. If you come hungry the $25/head price tag is so worth it. Skip the rice so you don't get full and can have more meat. Also ask for salad! And sesame oil for your salt!   Service was great too! They come around a lot and ask if you need anything else, if you want to hang the grill, etc. highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place not only because the food is so good and Jeremiah served us so well but because is fun it's an experience to eat here it may sound a little corny but it's true you'll leave a little happier then you walked in"}
{"text":"The best $22 you will ever spend on ayce kbbq!!! Im from Southern California and we have plenty of Gens around. However, none of them compare to this one. The service is unmatched & the food is just simply beyond amazing. This gen offers japchae & gyozas as appetizers before your meats arrive. Like what! That's amazing. The japchae was another level of deliciousness.   Service- hostesses and waiters were on top of their game. They constantly checked if we needed more meat. The best part was how every plate was equally fresh and delicious as the first. Other gens give you lower quality meat as you eat more but this one maintains quality.   I highly recommend this place! I'll be visiting the next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Cook it yourself pre seasoned tastes good and is a unique dinning experience   This is quickly becoming one of my go to spots!"}
{"text":"This was my first Korean BBQ experience, and I've got to give the staff at Henderson a big hand for making it a more than enjoyable experience. My hostess seated me quick and explained the process of how KBBQ worked thoroughly and most importantly simply. My waiter was David if I remember correctly and he always managed to check my table despite the place being close to a full house at the time, needless to say the service there was really good.   Onto the food, I got the 32 item dinner and ordered I think 9 different items, 5 of those being appetizers. I loved the appetizers, they were delicious and were cooked already. With that being said, if you're like me and tend to burn things when you cook because you have bad judgement, the other entrees somewhat vary on your own grilling skills. For me burning almost all of my raw entrees, they were all still really really good (I also only really ordered the spicy foods so I can't really speak on behalf of any of the other item choices) and I was so full by the end of it I ended up spending at least 15 minutes in the bathroom.  Since we're on the topic, they've got one of the nicest bathrooms I've ever been to. The dark toned color scheme and dim lights made it really easy on the eyes, I felt as if I was in Van Gogh's starry night, it was so serene. Not only that but the height from the floor to the toilet seat was perfect. I am a 5'5 male, a little short compared to Nevadans, but I swear either that toilet was made for me or I was made for it, didn't even have to go on my toes and get that awkward position where your legs go numb. Not only that but there was a side rail for stability so I didn't have to awkwardly hold my knees or hips, also thought I'd mention it was at the perfect height that just seemed to cater to the comfort of my arms. The toilet seat also wasn't one of those weird small circular seats that just cuffed your butt and suctioned it down as if that would be the spot you'd die in, but an innovative oval-esque shape ending with a pointed tip, seriously, when I call it a porcelain throne, I mean It. Don't even get me started about that rectangular edged iron cast canyon that is the sink, the possible hand washing techniques that could go on in there.....just endless. Gen/10 would eat all the spicy food at Gen again just to reclaim the throne."}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant 4 stars. Great environment and atmosphere. They don't take reservations, first come first serve so if you go on a Sat night, expect for a 30-45 Min wait! The staff has always been great, so no complaint in that category! Food is amazing! Shrimps, calamari, steak, etc.. the whole nine! The Dumplings are excellent as well and I'm not much of a salad person but the salad they give out is very good! We had the all you can eat which was about $22 per person and it's free for kids under 3 I believe. Great place give them a try!"}
{"text":"Kim chi side dishes were lower quality compared to other So Cal Korean BBQ locations. Meat was okay. Chicken was good quality, but beef steak/bulgogi was average.  Who's in charge of training? Our server's service sucked balls. Also having eaten at other gen locations, looks like Gen can't deliver the beans outside of Southern California."}
{"text":"COME WITH ME HAIL MARY HOMIE, RUN QUICK SEE WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE NOW  DO YOU WANNA RIDE OR DIE... from mediocre Las Vegas Korean BBQ.   Gen is a personal favorite of mine. The first time I had it in SoCal it felt like a 12 gauge shotty. Korean BBQ could be this good AND affordable? I literally have spoken about it as if it was a religion to my friends. All hail $19.99 Korean BBQ ($14.99 for lunch) with an extensive menu and and quality cuts.  The interior is the most \"upscale\" Gen I've been to with its blue neon lights and the layout is efficient and spacious enough for any size parties. I believe there is 36 types of meat on the menu, you can order up to 4 items and all you can eat appetizers. Service may be a bit too attentive, last visit I had servers and managers table touching back to back within minutes of each other, but is too much service really a fault? Table with banchans were all set up before I sat down, doesn't sound like a bad thing to me!  What separates this Gen from the other's in California are the only cons. First there is NO rice paper. I love rice paper, and I know others do as well, but I was informed its not possible to carry because of Nevada law requiring it to be refrigerated and that causing it to not be appetizing to eat. They have tortillas as a substitute but its not a solution, definitely don't expect to be making Kogi's or Komex table side. There are a few missing items, notably steam egg and some other favorites. Call me crazy but I feel like some meats are thicker than they should be (brisket).   Besides all of the above Gen Henderson still reigns supreme in the Las Vegas Area (even if its in Hendertucky).  HAIL MARY"}
{"text":"This place is good! All you can eat. They bring you the meats raw and you cook it at your table. There is a 2 hour limit (I've never been told to leave) and there is an extra charge is you waste food. The service is usually good, but they can get really busy during peak times.   I removed a star, because the removed my favorite item from the menu. Rib meat!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time we came to Gen, Luke was our server and he was fantastic! Not only the food, but Luke's service drew us back to Gen. Not even a week apart, my boyfriend and I came back and this time Sam was our server. And his service was terrible. He was no where to be found when we needed to order more food. We asked two different servers to find Sam and 20 minutes later, still nowhere to be found. We had to go up to the hostess to pay our bill. We still tipped him $5, but he definitely did not deserve it. So you're welcome Sam.   Overall, I would recommend the food at Gen. However, if your server is Sam, I'd ask for a different one."}
{"text":"Meh - the food's decent but the hostess and manager when our group of friends went at the time were terrible. We were next door at World of Beers when we decided our group needed some food - we knew that Gen usually has a wait list so me and a friend walked next door to reserve a table. We told Marisol, the hostess at the time, that we had a group of nine. She said the wait would be approximately 45 minutes to an hour - this was fine since we were finishing up at WOB. She asked us whether we would like a high top with two grills, or the tables which came with three grills. We opted for three, set the reservation, and waited for the opening next door. After about 50 minutes, we still didn't get a text with an update on our table so the group just walked over to Gen... apparently there was a 'mistake' and we had to wait maybe 10-15 minutes longer...fine. After the next wait, two of us asked Marisol what the deal was... and apparently now we would be getting a table with only two grills. We told her that we originally asked for the table with three grills - seeing her reaction, she knew that there was an issue.   Marisol walked over to speak to their manager Carlos and told us that if we wanted the 3 grills, we would have to wait another 30-40 minutes because another group was placed in front of us. Absolutely not - we were not waiting anymore.   In the end, our group got split up into two tables with two grills total.  I don't know what the deal was but steer clear of Marisol and Carlos because they definitively don't know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Not sure what other reviewers have seen or experienced with this place but I will not be back!  My wife was in the area and my daughter said her and a friend had gone for Korean bbq ( another establishment ) and had really enjoyed it so they invited me down to join them at Gen, what a mistake.   Approx 45 min wait which for a popular place is to be expected, but the clubby music should have been a sign of all the soul (Seoul) that was missing from this 'restaurant.'   We waited for quite a bit for our waiter to find his way out of the weeds and over to our table, whereupon we ordered drinks one of which was a hot green tea. You guessed it, said tea never arrived, although we did get a cup of Lipton and later an attempted delivery of an iced green tea from the manager.   The meats came out quickly, but the vegetables we ordered only arrived after the waiter again made his way to us after the meats were pretty well done and consumed.    He again made his way back to let us know he was leaving should we need anything else, lol, there'd be someone else taking care , again lol, of us.   The new waiter stopped by to say he'd be taking over and I again mentioned the tea and the fact that the veggies came out so late. He said the other waiter had been busy with a large party so...  This is when the Mgr came by with the iced tea, and again said the waiter had been busy,( isn't this what you want as a server? I know I did when I was a waiter.) so we said thanks for stopping by but the experience was beyond salvaging at this point.   Our new server passed by our cleared table numerous times over the next 15 minutes w/o making eye contact or bringing us our bill to end our suffering.   We finally went back to the hostess stand asked for our bill and lo and behold they were still charging us for the tea we never received. Told em we wouldn't be back with the Mgr right there. No response was the response.   Long story short, don't do it and at $20 per plus drinks, it just ain't worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food and the service in this place. The orders come out ridiculously fast and the staff is very accommodating, wether for additional food orders or just refilling our drinks. I guess the only down side is that they didn't serve steamed egg (which I always get when I go to a KBBQ place) and they don't have a dessert menu . I hope they make a dessert menu later on. I wish it was open later than midnight also, but overall I will highly recommend this place to anyone who loves KBBQ. This place definitely made it in my top favorite places."}
{"text":"Finally we havr one the west side. Nice area nice ambiance.. as always.. one of my fave Korean bbq place!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Korean BBQ place! They have tens of different choices for AYCE. Try #2 Hangjungsal on AYCE menu. I cannot still believe that I can enjoy that quality of meat with that low price. I liked both food and service. The interior was great as well. They are the best!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the price for this place. All you can eat with over 30 different choices. I recommend getting half orders of items, that way you can try more not get full. The servers are pretty good and running around to get you side dishes and change out the grills."}
{"text":"First off Shae is amazing! Best server I've had in awhile! Ask for her! Second food was semi ok it wasn't great, I don't see the hype in this place. It's rather hot my boyfriend started getting a headache  because of how hot it is in there. We all went home and had tummy problems. I'm glad I tried it but I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"This experience was amazing! The atmosphere was lively and the quality of food was great. This is my second time going to Korean styled bbq but this was by far my best experience.  The waiters are very attentive and helpful.   The music was popular and trending. Not that was important but it made the vibe a little different.   The selection of meats was great and all it's all you can eat!"}
{"text":"For November's International Supper Club, Gen Korean BBQ House was the place picked. Always wanted to try a Korean BBQ!   A few things upfront, they do not take reservations and your party needs to be there to be seated. Once you are seated your 2 hours of dinning start. Also, everyone at the table is considered a paying guest and will be charged the full price. There is a $5 charge per meat item left at the table not eaten and only 4 items ordered at a time, and yes the say its family style ordering, but the serving sizes of the meats are mainly for 2 max 3 people.  Hopefully yall are clear on the rules now, because we were not haha.    The restaurant is clean, very modern looking, and you would think if ever table was grilling that it would be smoky, but that's not even an issue, the place is clean and crisp and very eye appealing.     The grill is in the center of table and I feel our table setting was forgotten, I had noticed other tables had little condiments, like dipping sauces, spices of sorts, diced onions, pastes and oils, but our table did not. And even though we were on a 2-hour clock, 10 minutes seemed to past before our drink order was taken, and then forgotten about.  Granted it's a busy place, but you give your dinners a set time and put them on the clock, let's make sure service is on the ball.  We tried spicy chicken, garlic calamari, Korean Fried Chicken, Beef Bulgogi, Jap Chae, Shrimp, Gen Premium Steak, Gyoza, Flat Iron Steak, Red Wine Pork Belly, Hawaiian Chicken, Premium Pork Belly, and also had some white rice & salad.  The KFC was already cooked when served, it had great flavor, but it was cold, I don't really like cold fried chicken.  The beef bulgogi & jap chea were my favorites for the night!  Glad I tried Gen Korean BBQ and can see why its popular, and if I was with a group would wanted to try, I would go back."}
{"text":"People I know kept raving about this place, so my expectations were sky high... Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  [Let's start with the POSITIVES]: * Food came out very quickly after the initial order (as in, immediately after the server completed our orders since she used an iPad - or some electronic device - to take our orders to then send to the kitchen). This was AWESOME!  * Meats were fresh & delicious  * Serving size was sufficient for each order   * Beef tongue was the best, and we ordered it about 8 times (and I'm not exaggerating)   [Now on to the NEGATIVES - which could make or break the restaurant for me]:  * Macaron ice cream was $4 each, and they were just OK. Macarons were stale.  * Tables are not good for a large party w/ kids (the max they can fit in the low booths is 6 people). Tall tables fit large parties better, but high chairs aren't allowed  * Initially, we were told by 2 hosts we can have a high chair at the tall tables. After waiting 40mins, we finally got seated, then another host said we can't have high chairs & removed them (which we understand can be a fire hazard, but we wish they told us this in the first place). My siblings then had to hold their children all night as we all ate/cooked dinner  * Ambiance is very lounge-ish  * Pretty loud inside (like a lounge/bar)  * They don't take reservations, and wait could take as long as 30mins - 1.5hrs  * The hosts didn't know how to pronounce Gen & they didn't know what it meant! We asked a couple other hosts, and we were shocked they didn't know the answers as well!   Sadly, I came here with my family of 10 hoping to have a great experience for my Dad's birthday: 7 adults, 1 toddler, 2 infants. I know they tried to accommodate us as best as they could, but the inability to seat all of us comfortably, and the miscommunication between the hosts & servers to us were quite disappointing.  It's a shame it's not as family friendly as we'd hope, and the servers had no knowledge about the restaurant name (nor did they have an interest to ask management for the answer). Their food is good and their prices are really reasonable compared to other AYCE Korean places, so I wish my review was more positive.  I know they're still new, but I only hope they'll make these improvements before it gets worse."}
{"text":"It is an amazing place. I love everything food here. It is really happy to know there is a spicy tofu soup. And it is included in the all you can eat also. The beef belly is amazing and matched well with brisket sauce. This is my first time came here, and this place bring me good luck. I beat the Steelers win and it really happened! I will come back again when I beat another team. Also the service here is excellent. My service Yuhao and Bo are really helpful and nice. Our food come really fast and nice. And everything is delicious.  Must try: Beef short plate Marinated steak Pork belly Spicy tofu soup"}
{"text":"Ho bruh ya good cuz...da food was killah...good sevice da people and workahz der...ALODIA dat girl was good..."}
{"text":"Great staff , with an even better menu! Price is decent considering all of the food you get! Our server was Justin and he was really nice and helpful! The girl at the front who sat us name was Kales? I think! She was really nice! Everyone here was super awesome!"}
{"text":"It is my first time to eat here! And it is AMAZING!! kailin was my server, and she recommended dishes based on my needs. All of the dishes she recommend was awesome! Kailin is definitely an efficient and passionate server!  I like her so much! Well definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service, salad, spicy tofu soup... all good the meat tasted a little funky maybe it was a diff marinade I just didn't like it. I'll maybe try again but we will see."}
{"text":"Looked cool inside but the food consists mainly of low grade product,there's also alot of very young people working here and they spend time hanging out and telling jokes while you're waiting to be seated for no apparent reason.The menu may have been authentic but I don't have alot of experience with Korean food however being seated at a table with 8-10 sides of room temperature food I'm expecting to eat as a meal isn't my idea of a good time.However if you appreciate foods that don't really belong together and restaurant themes that's weren't well orchestrated,this may be the place for you.Ill never go back and wouldn't recommend it unless you're like 18 and it's a first date kind of thing but definitely now a place to take anyone you plan on impressing."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Tempe Marketplace, hands down! The service is great and the atmosphere is LA posh. It's my top 5 spot in AZ to eat."}
{"text":"For too long, Hendersonians had to travel to the far off lands of Chinatown to get Korean BBQ. Our prayers have finally been answered in the form of this modernized barbecue establishment at the Galleria Mall of all places. I have already eaten here twice during the soft open and was surprised by the taste and quality of the meats. The location is extremely convenient for anyone on the East side of the Valley and the price for all you can eat is hard to beat. Shout out to the bartender, Bryan, who provided an amazing experience for us!"}
{"text":"Our server, Rei, was amazing! He was readily available and acted proactively! He is an all around great employee. He will definitely be one of the servers I ask for whenever we go to Gen. Thank you, sir, for making it a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"Gen WAS AWESOME!!!! They accommodated my wedding reception dinner sooo last minute and the food and customer service was AMAZING! Definitely going back!!! We absolutely loved the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Mizzo and Kevin are so awesome!  Service was GREAT! THEY ARE ALWAYS SMILING AND SO FAST!! We are definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I have it 5 Stars cause the fact I can park and walk in and only wait a minute or 2 to be seated and place isn't crammed and the workers really move fast around that place and when you cash out they come to you to do everything...I so can get use to that yes I'll be back cause it was such good food and service"}
{"text":"Always have a great meal here and the price is right. $16 for lunch, $21 for dinner.  We've been here several times and it is a Favorite for sure. The premade appetizers and sides are so tasty.  The marinated meats are full of flavor.  We've found what we like, order our favorites, and always try something new.  2 hours of all you can eat is plenty of time to enjoy ourselves. The wait staff is SUPER friendly and know us now!  We've ate at the tables, high tops, and the bar - no change in service from one section to the next. Always fast.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because of the noise level.  WOW, it's REALLY Loud in there!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with some friends and had a good evening but wasn't blown away by the culinary experience. The best thing about Gen in my opinion is the service. I received my drink order and our first round of meats in literally less than a minute. We almost became overwhelmed with the amount of food piling up on our table. I do also like the interior here, and it's very spacious and modern chic.   As we cooked the meats over the stovetop grill, I felt that the meat was sticking to the grill much more than it should and it continued this way the whole night. Our grill actually became covered with charcoal and became unusable pretty quickly. However, the service helped us change out the stovetops promptly.   The complimentary appetizers were very standard, but I did personally like the salad. The best meat i had of the night was the premium steak and the pork belly since both of these were tender and flavorful. I really also enjoyed the tofu soup since it added some tanginess to break up the heavy savory dishes.   I did not enjoy the galbi one bit since it just tasted like sweet ambiguous meat. Most of the pieces I had were hard to chew through and very fatty. I couldn't even dip the meat in the dipping sauce to add some depth of flavor since the dipping sauce here consists of sesame oil and salt. The beef tongue was better, but it still lacked the succulent high grade quality of meat that I enjoy.   I understand that you get what you pay for. You can't expect the highest quality meat with a very affordable AYCE price. I am impressed at the large selection of meats and dishes and again I am very pleased with the great service we received here. I would come back here with a large group or for a big celebration, but I wouldn't come if i'm looking for an intimate date setting or gourmet meats."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's day and it was our first visit. Glad to say it was a great experience. Been to a couple of Korean bbq's before and this place was fast and friendly. Our waiter Julius was awesome he gave us great tips on what was tasty so we didnt waste our time on the other stuff! Everyone there was quick and super friendly which made our first experience perfect. Food was was good and they just kept bringing it out . I look forward to the next time hopefully its the same!"}
{"text":"Terry was an awesome waiter. Very attentive and great personality. He recommend a few item on the menu. Which was very helpful. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've had better!  The service was mediocre and the bulgogi was not good. Quite an expensive meal so we should've been satisfied."}
{"text":"Aww so happy they opened in Henderson! No more driving to china town for Korean bbq!Amazing food! They have have many options to choose! ^_^ our server Lisa and Kevin were wonderful and quick with our food and drinks. My new favorite place to eat :)."}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant is a great example of how much of an effect customer service can have on a dinning experience. My group and I went to dinner on a Saturday night knowing we would have to wait- we waited about 1 hour and 30 minutes. We had Daniel as our waiter. Luckily, we had a few Korean BBQ veterans to guide us through the menu and ordering, because our waiter was no help. We ordered 4 items (the max that you can do at a time). One of those items being brisket. We went through about 3 different rounds of ordering, each time asking and reminding Daniel about our brisket, never receiving it. Finally, a bus boy/food runner who had dropped off some items for us asked how we were doing, and we asked him about the brisket- and he managed to track it down for us (he was also confused when we said we had already been waiting 30 plus minutes for it- its raw meat!!). This establishment is a \"grill your own food\" place. So all waiters are required to do is take food orders and run food, and occasionally change the grill. Somehow, our waited acted like this was a huge chore for him. Luckily, the food was good. That is whats keeping this rating from only one star. The beef bulgogi is EXCELLENT. The sides and salad are delicious and endless. Someone in my group dropped her chopsticks, and we asked the first person we saw walk by for more- this turned into 4 separate people trying to track down someone who could get us CHOPSTICKS. The icing on our not so great experience was that our waiter \"couldn't take more than 3 cards\" for the check when we tried to give him 4. We did however see plenty of tables with giving more than 3 cards, so not sure if this is a restaurant policy or just our particular waiter. I read the reviews after I went to the restaurant (rookie move, I know) and saw all everyone raving about the macrons. I would've love to try one. Daniel never mentioned them to us. Perhaps he was having an off night but he really put a damper on my desire to go back and visit again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the servers especially Alodia were great! We had fun cooking our food, good portions of the dishes.   Shout out to ALODIA!!! You're the bomb!  Definitely will come back and highly recommended"}
{"text":"Good overall experience or \"foodtainment\". We went for my birthday and they gave me an ice cream macaroon that was a sweet surprise. Service was on point and checked in with us multiple times. The food quality as far as the meat goes seemed low. The cleanliness of the establishment was questionable which is why I'm giving it a 3 star. I wish I had 3.5 star option."}
{"text":"First time here, fell in love with all the food and what a great service really!  Everything is so delicious and fresh, you do have to cook it yourself but that's the fun part. As soon as we ordered our 4 meats and started cooking it they asked us for our other 4 meats. They don't keep you waiting on your meats they are so great about quickness on bringing your stuff to you. Definitely recommend and we will be back again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite kbbq place! Great service! Especially from Luna she was awesome!! Will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is fire!!! It's super nice inside, food is awesome, Lisa and mizzo gave us fantastic service and we're very attentive! This is my new favorite kbbq spot!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a few friends I had to check this place out.  I walked in on a weekday lunch, without an appointment.  No problem seating us.  The place was nice and new.  It didn't reek of bbq, which was nice.  I came here for their lunch buffet which is $14.99!  Such a good deal!   There are some items that are not available on the lunch menu, but still a lot to enjoy.  I had the steak, sesame chicken and the squid legs are probably my favorites.  The spicy pork was also good.  I could not try everything on the menu, but there is enough for me to keep coming back.  Just an FYI there is a 2 hr eating limit.  One of my gripes was at the end of the meal I asked if they have tea, and the server said they do and would bring some over.  They asked who wanted, and 3 of us raised our hands.  Then came the bill...$1.50 for each cup of tea!  I would have wished to be informed that it wasn't complimentary.  In most Asian restaurants tea is free like water.  To make matters worse, the tea wasn't very good either.  I told the hostess that we were not informed that the tea would be an extra cost, and she just gave me an \"Oh Well\" kind of look.  If I had know I would be charged I would have passed on the tea.  I didn't even drink the whole glass.  I didn't take the matter any further and just paid for the the damn tea and still gave them 20% tip.  I know I'm a idiot.  Overall, I am willing to give this place a chance again.  As some reviewers have mentioned, this place does need to workout some hiccups in their service.  We had some items we ordered take forever, or forgotten completely, but it was okay for us.  Not a big deal.  Then the tea thing just left a bad taste in my mouth, in more ways than one.  If I was the hostess, I would have taken the item off the bill and note that in the future I would be a $1.50.  The tea probably only cost them 5 cents!  It could have made the whole experience more positive!  I look forward to hearing that things will improve there."}
{"text":"I really liked dining here. All the appetizers are included in the all-you-can eat dinner. For $20 you can't beat that. Service was fast. Within 5 minutes of placing our first order of meats they came out. Vegetables were good and plenty of choices in my opinion. We were not able to get rice. Waiter said the rice cooker broke right before we got there. We were checked on by several different servers and they accommodated every request quickly, even though it was packed. We came at about 9:30pm and there were only 2 tables empty."}
{"text":"My sister & I ate here on a Monday afternoon at 1:30. No lines, we waited 5 min for them to get our table ready. Servers were attentive to us coming around every 10 min or so asking if we needed anything. They do give you small portions which I don't think is a problem so food is not wasted. Everything we asked for was delicious! $14.95 for AYCE kbbq is not bad at all. Another plus is their location. Now  I don't have to drive to Chinatown to enjoy some good kbbq. I love this place!"}
{"text":"We always come to his place but our visit today was extra special because everything we asked for was facilitated by our server Alodia. She was amazing and did not miss any of our requests and believe me, my girlfriend and I are very picky with service and she was awesome!  Looking forward to eating there again very soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! My family came last night and had Ozzy as their server and tonight we had Dakota and Ozzy. They were super super nice and we're quick to check up on us. I love their selection of food and for the price you pay it's such a steal! Also the restaurant itself is well kept and very clean and I love the modern music and the design. Such a great blend of amazing K barbs and good music and a lively atmosphere for a weekend night or just any day in general!  Also I always get their special ice cream macaroon sandwich  We dine here literally almost every month and we have a great experience every time. Can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this was in Los Angeles and let me say, both were amazing. GEN will probably be my go-to Korean bbq spot. The servers and staff were very friendly and helpful. It's a busy location, well when we went, but so worth the wait."}
{"text":"5 stars for great costume service and the food is fast, kinda pricey but it worth it."}
{"text":"This place is is simply amazing. Food was terrific it was my wifes bday and we didn't think that this place was this good but it was the complete opposite. Staff was extremely nice. I would recommend this place to anyone. My advice go before 3 it starts to get crowded. We had got there around 2. They will give you a 2 hour limit. That's more than enough time. Come eat some good food and have a good time."}
{"text":"This would had been 5 stars if our server was a little more there. We timed him to see how long it would take for him to come back and forwards to visit our table. Ive seen the bus boys more than I've seen the actual server. Which they are just sweet hearts. The price is great and so is the food. There was a lady who came and checked on us I believe she was the owner. She is very friendly, I am sure this will become number one."}
{"text":"My first time here we didn't really like it. Came on a dinner for two around 7 pm during weekday, we had to wait about 35 minutes so they took our number and texted us when our table was ready. Got there and seated right away, but the service was slow. They ran out of rice! Seriously?! Out of rice! The meat they served were inconsistent, the brisket were either really frozen or super thawed out! We got full on side dishes cuz we were starving and the meat was taking long. Nevertheless the food was tasty, just the service was pretty bad.  The second time around just this past week, I came on a weekend lunch time. Wow we got seated right away, there were three of us, the food came fairly quickly and the food was very tasty. My 6yo even liked the gyoza, fried chicken, and the macaron ice cream sandwich. I will definitely try it again. Hopefully much more consistent just like this last visit. The meat was very good! I ordered: marinated kalbi, miso pork belly, brisket, cajun shrimp, fried chicken, gyoza"}
{"text":"I first went to Gen in Cerritos (Cali) and i was surprised to see one here in vegas. Ive been to this location twice now, mostly because its so far from me and lets be honest theres a lot of kbbq places in town. I do like the atmosphere at Gen, the music and the lighting is cool.  My favorite things to order are the Hawaiian steak, premium steak, the tongue is good and the garlic calamari is sooo gooooood."}
{"text":"Love this place, beautiful interior somewhat modern lacks a Korean bbq vibe but that's fine. One of the largest varieties of meats to choose from at a very reasonable price. The brisket is amazing but the short ribs blew me away top notch! Today was mothers day so it was quite packed and it was a 45 min wait but since the restaurant is in a mall it wasnt hard to make the time pass . I do recommend so go go go!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I come here often for lunch. They offer a wide variety of meat options including my favorite the beef bulgolgi (highly recommend) and spicy pork belly. The cooking process is pretty straight forward and the staff comes by often to make sure the grill stays clean and not charred. Staff is also friendly and have great recommendations on their food. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area of Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now our server this time was Alodia she delivered great service brought me a bunch of rice paper with mad my experience even better lol I love rice paper! Thanks Alodia great food great service"}
{"text":"Only thing edible was the salad, the rice and the gyoza. Meat was too fatty, service was alright, wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Come hungry!! It is all you can eat and it is all delicious! Kalbi, bulgolki and chicken Kathy are delicious. Enjoy The fun environment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"There are 2 Gen Locations in Las Vegas but 1 is better (Sahara location)than the other in terms of service and overall quality. I went to this location with my friends a couple of times both were okay but service could have been improved.  The first time was a while back, the food was good but the service was soso. We were getting ignored most of the time but every time the couple next to us wanted to order they were serviced right away.  The second time was fairly recent (late birthday dinner). We got sat at a booth that was pretty much falling apart, keep in mind there were 3 other booths that were totally fine in the same area (left side from entrance) but we got sat at one that had crumbly seats. Also, for some reason the meet was tough and chewy."}
{"text":"I LOVED eating here. The food was so delicious and really inexpensive for how much you get. Our waiter, Ozzy, was really attentive and always checked on us to make sure we had enough food. He helped make it a memorable experience. I will definitely be back! Delicious"}
{"text":"Kevin was great!, quick service and very nice.   Food was good and kept full the whole time!  The pork chops and all the sides are soo yummy.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Like our home away from home.  My gf and I have been missing out on Gen after having it for the first time in LA.  Service is real great, and the food is second to none. Lisa and Mizzo really helped out a lot I'll definitely request them from now on.  Thanks guys it's been a great experience"}
{"text":"The only worthy Korean BBQ spot that we have come across in the valley so far. We have been to several Gen locations, as there were many in Southern California, where we are from, so it was great to see one out here! We will definitely be making the trip to Tempe whenever we are craving our Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing and the food is on point to satisfy your Korean BBQ craving. Also our server Jaenica was one of the cool people to have to help with the service and has a great personality throughout our time with our meals.  Would come here again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and got the special. We ordered a plethora of meats like brisket, steak, bulgogi, pork belly MORE brisket, and shrimp. I think all the meats were of really good quality and the staff was really helpful (including allowing us to swap out the grill plates when we needed unlike some other places I've been to). The grill itself was not really oiled well so the meat stuck sadly, and the staff told us that the grill plates were non-stick (even though they appeared to have no non-stick coating etc).  We also liked their sides and the JapChae that we ordered (all fresh and tasty). Overall, it was a good experience food wise but would advise that you go early or else you'll be waiting for awhile (you can register and walk out to go somewhere else and they'll text you but they only give you 5 minutes to show up).  I'll definitely come again but maybe at dinner to try out there additional offerings."}
{"text":"THE BEST KOREAN BBQ in town especially when it comes to customer service! Its amazing! Our server name was NEIL! Hey man thank you! We love your service. Definitely would come back here. Felt VIP. Cant stress enough how important customer service. But man this guy exceeded my standard of service. its fast, we never ran out of drink and the grill was changed 4 times, thats how this guy care of what he does.Food quality is great too fresh and tasty. Definitely recommend this place. I love eating korean bbq and this is by far THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE and Food quality. Thank you."}
{"text":"Gen Korean BBQ is open on west side of town!! I've seen it a few times as I drove by the area and finally I was able to dine at the restaurant after months of waiting!!!  The interior decor is very similar to the Galleria Mall location but this one has a more modern vibe. It's a little more dark but it gives the restaurant a very nice vibe. A great place for a date... Maybe lol   Food seems to be the same as the Henderson location but I can't say for sure since it's been a while since I've had Gen.  I'll be here more often now that it's much closer to my house and I don't have to drive 20-30 mins Henderson!   Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! I've had Gen before in California and I have always had the best experiences and I love going to gen but this Gen on Sahara in Las Vegas is the worst Gen I have ever gone to and I'm never going back.  My server was missing most of the time he had to ask other servers for help... we waiting more than 20 minutes for our receipt just to pay. And when I paid it wasn't until I was in my car that I realized the tip was already added no one told me it was added and I added more  avoid this Korean bbq place !!"}
{"text":"We lived in Korea for 2 years. This is by far the most authentic Korean Food i have had in the states. Very good lunch and it is a bargain at $16.00 all you can eat. Very good service, employees were very attentive. This is highly recommended and we will surely be back to try the dinner buffet next time. #jmsoto"}
{"text":"This is the only KBBQ I would willingly go to. Their food pushed me out of my comfort zone and I tried things I never thought I would enjoy. I love their Korean fried chicken and also their spicy tofu soup. It fills you up even though the serving size looks kind of small. Not a fan of spicy but both of these foods have the right amount of spice. They're always busy, but I never have to wait longer than 45 minutes, which I think is pretty good considering it's a full house. Servers are kind and always come to check in if we want to order more"}
{"text":"The server Damien was so awesome, he was extremely polite, he was always there to refill our drinks. Personally, he deserves a raise!!!"}
{"text":"I heard all the hype with this place from all my Cali friends and was craving kbbq real bad so decided to check this place out! & then also ended up coming back the very next day lol.  It's located outside of Galleria mall by JC Penny. Parking was a lil shit both days but they offer valet. Interior is veryyyy nice. One of the nicest kbbq restaurants I've been to (I haven't been to many). There's even kbbq stoves at the bar, I thought that was pretty freaking neat haha.  My first visit here was with one friend. We walked in and about a handful of workers looked at us then looked at each other like they didn't know what to do before a few of them finally greeted us. We only waited about 5-10 mins to be seated so it was not a bad wait. Our waiter was really nice, she already seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and didn't hesitate to explain it. AYCE Lunch is about $14.99 while Dinner is $19.99, not bad!  Second visit was with a much larger group. Waiters still all over the place but I cut them some slack since they are still pretty brand new. You know, they forget my miso soup spoon, the straws, ask us if we ordered Premium Steak as we are CLEARLY ALL getting out of our chairs to leave lol. It's all good though, I'm still coming back!!  Anyways I wanted to get this salad issue  off my chest cuz I thought it was kind of funny. During my first visit, after we had placed our order, my friend and I noticed that the couple next to us, who was seated AFTER us, received their salad before us. Or at least we though it was their salad because the way it was placed closer to their invisible dividing line so we asked for our own. Even the couple wasn't sure if it was theirs or ours so no one ended up touching it. We end up getting our own, then like 30 mins into the waiter brings out a 3rd salad all confused but just sets it by them anyway. AND THEN when we were almost finished with the meal, a different waiter finally tells us \"oh that's your guys salad btw\" I was like -___- why would you put it on that couple's invisible dividing line then!?!? Gaaah man get your salad shit together lol. Anyways, the food!!   Favorites: The brisket, spicy pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, cajun shrimp, sesame chicken appetizer  Least Favorites/or just straight up hated: Red Wine Pork Belly (hated), Miso Pork Belly, Regular Pork Chop or Pork belly (I think).   The red wine pork belly literally just tasted like wine. I felt bad because I didn't care for it at all and neither did my friend who originally wanted it. The miso pork belly was slightly better. It didn't taste like miso at all and didn't have too much flavor. Now I THINK this was the pork chop, if that was even on the menu but all I know is that I didn't like it at all. It was probably the way we cooked it though but still, I just didn't really enjoy it.  The spicy pork bulgogi is a MUST. It was my most favorite out of everything. & brisket, well, I just love any brisket. It tasted like every other brisket. Nothing special but I really enjoyed it.   Overall, the service could be better. I know they are all starting out but hopefully during my 3rd visit it will have improved. Food is pretty good for the price. Place is spacious and is a great place to eat after shopping!"}
{"text":"Great concept  Great decor  Great location and easy parking  A very good value   Food is fresh and tasty  Macaroon ice cream sandwiches should just be illegal.  Service is good, BUT even though we told the server we had never been there before and needed a little advice...none was forthcoming.    With a little trial and error we caught on to cooking times and technique.  The biggest problem was, at first, the grille was turned down really, really low so it took forever for anything to cook.   Another table noticed our frustration and suggested we tell the bus person who immediately figured out the problem.  After that is was pretty smooth sailing.   The only reason the trip to Gen doesn't get five stars is the lack of instructions re: the cooking time issue.  Okay, your thinking, \"How difficult is it to figure out how to cook chicken,  pork,  beef, etc?\" And right you are!   However, whole baby octopus, whole calamari?   A little less obvious!  The green ice tea was great."}
{"text":"If you're short like the short ribs... then this place is for you! Pricing is based on how tall you are. If you're  under 40 inches... you eat free! 40-50 inches 9.99... and 50 inches + full price...  I'm in love with this Korean bbq place.. and I'm not only saying that because the hostesses here are 11/10 but because this place is well structured.  The moment you finally get seated.. your table is set up for you with multiple little condiments to dip your meat in. In addition, there is an order of house salad which goes well with the meats!  There are 36 different options you are able to order for 21.99 ALL YOU CAN EAT... and the ones with the thumbs up are chef recommended. The stars or asterisks indicate that they are spicy.  My personal favorites are the spicy pork belly, brisket, garlic chicken and short ribs.   Service is great too. If your hungry.. you're gonna thank them... they are as quick as this year going by"}
{"text":"Food was great as always! We came here for dinner on a Wednesday. It came out to $26 total with tax and tip. I recommend getting the bulgogi and KFC! Julian was our server and kept us happy and fed. The rest of the servers were awesome too. Will definitely be coming back as a tradition after a long week."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the service that we got from Terry, I came around roughly 9pm with a party of 3 and it was pretty crowded and had a wait on the brisket, but he checked up on us and asked us if we needed anything else from sides to appetizers, thanks to him waiting was not a problem at all ! Thanks Terry !"}
{"text":"Amazing new addition to Henderson. I love this place. Shout out to Mizzo and Christina for great service!"}
{"text":"Everyone on staff was very friendly and helpful. They suggested items to try and \"at a comfortable pace\" checked to see if I how my meal was going. I had an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Jimmy down there already said everything I wanted to say.  Except that the water tastes like tempe sewage, forcing you to buy a soda, and I still don't know what mashed potatoes have to do with Korean food bc no one bothered to explain anything with out flagging and asking.   Really did have high expectations. I have made my own marinades at home before and was looking forward to experiencing the authentic version of this but really can't see what the big deal was about the food, I found it bland for the most part, no choice in the salad dressing, no kitchen items, and they should say how many pieces come per order for things because for the two of us, we felt pressure to eat more than we wanted to and only found out after that we could have ordered half orders.  No desire to come back. Will try Koreatown next."}
{"text":"First time here, i came with a big gruop. they told me to wait for 1:30 minuets so we decided to waited . unfortunately they had messed up my the table . when i asked the girls at the front desk ... they talked to me the way their acts were so rude. i we'll never come back here again. BAB SERVICES !"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect, it's definitely different than the other Korean BBQ I've been too., the spicy pork belly wasn't that good but the steak bulgogi was amazing. It's cheaper than most Korean BBQ I've had so that's a bonus Volcano chicken ridiculously crunchy, almost hard, it is hot but still has good flavor, the spice sneaks up on you. Cajun calamari isn't that great, gyoza are good but not full of meat, mostly fillers. Kimchi is quite delicious, service was excellent"}
{"text":"First time here, will probably never return. We got here at 8:30 and were quoted a 2 hour wait time, which was reasonable since it was Saturday and I could clearly see it was busy. 10:50 rolls by and we were told we would not be able to be sat tonight. It's a matter of them not knowing what their turnover time and not knowing what they are capable of handling. In addition, we were far from being the last table on the list and everyone after us was also turned away after the long wait. This is a very bad look for a nice looking restaurant. I hope they can get organized soon or they will steadily lose customers. We wasted three hours waiting for a table we should have been told would never be available up front. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg love this place! Went 3 times already. Food comes out quick and servers are generally attentive and nice. It's kinda pricey but generally good quality meat. But the wait time is a killer... make sure you plan for that!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Korean food so when I seen Gen I just had to go. Once your seated the server instructs you these is a 2 hr limit and if you don't eat the stuff you ordered they will charge you more. Oh I forgot to mention it's a all you can eat. The menu consists of 36 items with a few of the items is shrimp, beef tongue, sirloin steak, chicken. They bring what you order very quickly. You have a very hot grill in your table to cook all the wonderful meats you choose. They give you 8 sides to  enjoy as well. Kim chee, mashed potatoes with corn , coleslaw,  etc  the other great part is it's only 21$ a person. I highly recommend trying Gen it's located at the galleria"}
{"text":"Gen is one of my favorite ayce kbbq in town. The style and atmosphere of the restaurant is for sure different compared to the others in town, it's spacious and modern looking.  The wait isn't bad, even if there is a long wait on busy nights, the mall is literally right there.  They have the best tasting beef belly! They also have different flavors for their pork belly. I tried the volcano chicken and it was actually spicy so that was great.  I like their selection of sides including spicy rice cake, rice paper, gyoza, japchae, etc. I wish they have steamed egg though. Adonis and Ozzy were amazing they were both attentive."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was okay, not a place where it would be my AYCE Korean spot. The food is pretty limited... not many banchan to chose from. They did not have any gochujang. I wanted to make some bibimbap.   Food: 3.5 stars Service: 4 stars  They were attentive. They replaced our grill when needs to be changed. Checked on us when our plates were looking empty. Friendly service!  Would I come here again? Maybe, if I was shopping at the Galleria mall."}
{"text":"it's one of the better Korean BBQ places in Phoenix, but whole just doesnt come close to the Korean BBQ places I've had in Los Angeles. Service however was on point and the wait staff never let my cup go below the half empty mark."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. They have so many options to choose from. The price for lunch is good. Even though it is all you can eat. I noticed that they are bringing out smaller portions. For example, with a table of 4 they would only bring out 2 pieces of pork belly. It would be nice if they can bring out at least 3 pieces instead.   The staff is ok. It is a hit or miss with them. Some days more than half of them just stand around and talk. Other days they are amazing. I think it depends who is working. They also do not have certain items on their menu. I actually like the California locations a lot better."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here. Definitely coming back with their great food and great prices. Juan was a great server. Very kind and interactive and always bringing refills."}
{"text":"RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! RICHARD! If you behold this noble and majestic man, you will be dubbed with magic by his amazing hustle. He is a wizard/mastermind of drink memorization, and is on top of our order game. Trust me, his service shows what it's like to be VIP."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Seong was great and very professional. Alodia was also very friendly and always made sure we were okay. Definitely my new favorite spot in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Food was tasty and variety of food was excellent. Minju was helpful with menu selections.  Highly recommend! Kids 4 and under are free."}
{"text":"Very welcoming feel when you walk in. Contemporary look. Service and food was phenomenal. Waiter Dennis was all over it!"}
{"text":"Best service i have ever had at a Gen BBQ chain. I been to all the ones in Nor Cal...  Stuck up asians were horrible and service was horrendous especially at the Milpitas branch. I understand they were understaffed but the staff were full of crap to begin with. Sahara was very attentive to our table and knew what we needed."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere our server  Kailin was really sweet and helpful. She helped us order and pick stuff we haven't tried. She was absolutely outstanding, great customer service"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how bad service they have been taking care of us. We had a party and been waiting more than a hours but after we have been waiting they didn't get us a right table. The two girls front were acting so rude and didn't apologize for no reason at all. I really couldn't  believe when they talked to the customers there face were acting wanted to kill. If the yelp were have a zero star I would really to get them right a way."}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean BBQ places in town including all you can eat in Los Angeles so I had a lot to compare to and I've never gotten food poisoning at any of the other places I've been to.  The service wasn't bad here, server came around often and was easy to flag down and knew the menu well.  The food was ok. Some items were great tasting others were blah. They don't give out many side dishes but if you ask for more of a dish they will give you a big bowl of it. The kimchi did taste great!  We tried the beef brisket, the spicy pork bulgogi, cajun calamari, soondoboo, gyoza, volcano chicken, shrimp, and spicy baby octopus.   I personally ate the beef brisket, which I cooked well done, not hard to do since so thinly sliced, and the calamari which was well cooked as it shriveled up and became rubbery and didn't taste that good, as well as their potatoe salad which i ate a lot of and soondoboo which I had a couple of spoon fills because it just didn't taste right and was too oily. Between one of those four items, I got some horrible food poisoning. This was the only food I had eaten that day as we went for a late lunch and around 2am I woke up with horrible stomach pains and was throwing up like crazy. 2 days later I am still sick with food poisoning. Will never be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've consumed so much KBBQ in my lifetime so far it's actually rather scary. I've had Gen KBBQ at numerous of their locations both in SoCal and the one in Henderson, NV. The Henderson, Nevada location leaves a little bit to be desired over not only other KBBQ restaurants, but other Gen locations.   Their menu seems to be toned down here a little bit, and is rather Americanized. Growing up in Los Angeles, you have a lot of authentic choices in terms of cuts of meats and sides at KBBQ restaurants. Gen offers them, but they just taste...a little different. A little, less dramatic, should I say. And to my earlier point, is what causes me to highlight this location as being rather \"domesticated\". Which is a shame.  If you come to this location, be prepared for a wait, much as you would at any of their other locations.   The staff here is all VERY polite and friendly, and service is usually rather expeditious, which is the only plus side to this being \"Americanized\". If you've been to Korean run KBBQ restaurants that are authentic, you know good service is the last think you should expect.  All in all, good restaurant for KBBQ.   Would I come back here again? Yup.  Would I recommend this place to others? Sure, as long as they aren't expecting something too authentic."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Can't beat the price for all that good food. Wonderful service( thanks Kailin). I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I know this is a long one, but you're going to want to read it.  Okay, first problem: We were a party of 5 (for a birthday) on Saturday and came to the restaurant around 6:30 PM. We were told before we got there that the restaurant didn't accept reservations. When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us the wait would be 1-1.5 hours. We took a place in line (using their app) and shopped around the mall. After about an hour, there were still 20+ people in front of us. Instead of the 1-1.5, we were not seated until 9 PM! That is 2.5 hours, my friend! I want to kick myself for waiting that long for the crappy experience we had.  Okay, next issue. Our server asked if we wanted any drinks. We asked for waters with lemon, I asked for an alcoholic beverage. The server told me that she was underage and couldn't serve me alcohol, but she would have someone come ASAP. No one ever took my drink order the entire night, but preceded to give me their happy hour drink menu at 9:30 (when happy hour started). I left the menu on the edge of the table, but it obviously wasn't enough of a reminder (way to up-sell). I gave up at one point because I figured if they took that long to take the order, imagine how long it would take to have them serve it. We gave our orders (I ordered most of the \"recommended\" dishes.) which included a few sides of glass noodles and rice. The waters came with a plate of lemons because, according to the waitress \"the bartender was too lazy to put the lemons in glass\". WTF is wrong with your unprofessional staff? Why would you tell us that? And why is a bartender having to prepare WATER???? And isn't it ironic the bartender apparently makes the waters, but not the drink I was trying to order? Whatever, anyways, on to the next issue.   My boyfriend and I received our raw meat orders. We started grilling it up, but the 3 other guests did not receive their orders. When the waitress stopped to check on us, we pointed out that it is raw meat (therefore it shouldn't take that long) and it had not come out. She said that they were busy, and it shouldn't be that much longer. 15-20 minutes later, she came back and told us that the kitchen \"lost our order\". We ordered everything again, including glass noodles and rice.   The only plates I would recommend:  K.F.C. Tofu Glass Noodles  All of which were already prepared.   The raw meats were pure fat or tasteless and bland.  Not only that, the waitress was the only person that was slightly nice to us. The other servers were just tossing plates on our table and mumbled which dishes they were, then ran away as fast as they could. We had no idea what they had tossed on the table because we couldn't ask before they dipped out. Also, the person with the credit card machine (I really hope that wasn't the manager, because if so, this place has no hope) had a really bad attitude. The whole time we were there, we felt we had to ration our water (even tried to steal one of the pitchers for the table), the main dishes never came out with the sides (rice and noodles), and it was very difficult to get the servers to take our empty dishes. The shrimp and pork belly were the most unappetizing dishes. The shrimp had a funky taste and the pork belly was all fat.   Here's the cherry on top: I walked into the ladies room before the check came, and our server was curled up in a ball in front of the sink, next to a stall. Listen, if you're going to break down, please have an ounce of professionalism and cry in a stall where customers do not see you. Or, if you're sick, please call out. It isn't very appetizing to think you're getting sick, then serving my food.  If I owned this restaurant, I'd be pissed. The staff was extremely unprofessional, you need a complete overhaul. I'm shocked this place has the rating it does. I am so bothered by my experience, I'm going to tell everyone to never come to this restaurant and to go to Chinatown instead. I really don't care how cheap it is, I'd be happy to pay $30 for AYCE to never experience that again. Your unprofessional employees are going to make you lose customers and money. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"A sight for sore eyes here in Henderson! (Especially for those SoCal peeps that crave KBBQ like I do sometimes)  The recently opened Gen is at the Galleria at Sunset mall in Henderson. The restaurant is not attached to the mall however. It is located directly to the left of the main mall entrance.   I have been long awaiting a good KBBQ joint since I moved to Vegas. And as luck would have it, it just opened in Henderson!  I visited the second day of opening so things were still being kicked into gear with the staff and service so I can forgive some blips that we had like missed orders and the waitress dropping a glass of water on my friend. (ooops)  The AYCE menu is extensive and very reasonably priced imo. $14.95 for lunch (open-3pm) and $19.95 (3pm-close)! Appetizers are included in the price as well. The lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu with a few 'premium' items left off.   Of note, I really enjoyed the chadol (beef brisket), beef tongue, spicy rice cake, garlic pork belly and agedashi tofu! Granted, there wasn't anything I didn't like, but you get the idea. They were missing the pineapple steak from the menu, however. And I wasn't a huge fan of their side dishes :( There is no rice paper here but they do give you thin radish slices to wrap everything in!  They also serve alcoholic beverages but I didn't indulge this time around. The parking is also plentiful in the mall lot. The decor is very swanky and modern which I enjoyed and there is greattttt ventilation (which my KBBQ veterans will know is very very important)  It's a great addition to Henderson and Vegas and excited to have a place to satisfy my KBBQ/meat cravings now :O"}
{"text":"They have a bunch of soju flavors and selection. Just wish they had Kobe or short rib.   My favorite macaron ice cream sandwiches!  Unfortunately I don't think they sell well there as all of ours were stale.  Plan on a wait so arrive before you are super hungry.  Awesome deal for the price though!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gen in Ontario, California and this location was nothing like that one. First, I found it odd that they charge kids by height. We were charged $10 for my 6 year old brother to eat a bowl of rice. Right off the bat, I got a weird vibe from our server; he seemed kind of annoyed. I ignored it and remained optimistic. Our meats kept coming but the grill wasn't being changed. Our server only came around a couple of times within a 40 minute timeframe and ghosted us. I waited 30 minutes for a drink refill. Also, I was certain that rice came with the meal, but we had to put in an order for it. A different server came around and started tending to us. We eventually asked if she was our new server, which she replied yes and informed us that our original server went home. She found it odd that he didn't bother to let us know that he was leaving. She saw that our grill was completely black and changed it immediately. She was friendly and attentive, which made the experience better. However, I don't think I will return to this location. The experience was just too negative, especially when there are other locations."}
{"text":"This Las Vegas location is great!  Gen Korean BBQ is basically the same everywhere... from Honolulu to Cerritos, and Rowland Heights... the service is cheerful and helpful!  The menu and rules are similar - two hour time limit; order four meats at a time; and finish the meats or get charged for the leftovers.    The main difference here was the free and plentiful parking at the Galleria Mall in Henderson; there was no wait; and there was no loud music!  My cousins, mom, auntie, sister, and I were able to have great conversation while we cooked our own food!  We had a great time catching up and talking about all of the dishes!    They enjoyed the Marinated Beef (with the slice of pineapple on the top) the best. It was tender, flavorful and quick to cook.  The banchan, rice, and sauces complimented our meats well.  We got refills easily!  The boy cousins got the Spicy Baby octopus and Cajun shrimp - they ate everything!  We got two of the three extra items that are served at dinner only - tongue and the previously named Hawaiian Steak (yangyum galbisal).  Delicious!  Out of seven of us, only two people had been to a Gen before this dinner.  Everyone got their fill at a reasonable price ($20.99 plus tax and tip) and had a wonderful experience!    Mahalo to all of the employees who were so patient with my auntie and mom!  They were happy that they didn't have to cook!"}
{"text":"A little out of the way (20 min drive from the strip) but well worth it. I was in town for CES with a bunch of colleagues who wanted Asian food - not pseudo Asian food - so this was a good compromise. Reasonably priced, fast service, and the meat quality was solid."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a month and always satisfied with great food and service. Our server today, Alodia has been so attentive, snappy and wears a big smile. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. Hostess did not even wake up from her daydream. Poor seating arrangement"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and worth the wait. I recommend going in the afternoon because it's not as busy. This place is the best Korean BBQ in Arizona. It is also very popular and successful in California. So glad It finally made it to AZ."}
{"text":"I've been here a good amount of times with friends and family. Heck, I've been here so much that my family knows what we want to order before the waiter asks our drinks.   Okay, the breakdown is going to be feeling, service, and food. Should be simple... I hope   Feel of the place:  I love coming into this place. The color scheme is lovely and the set up is nice. The place gives you a comfy feeling but at the same time, it still feels trendy. It's pretty nice.   Service: Now usually I would give this place 5 stars no problem but the service this time made me knock it down. Now I understand that my family and I came in right as you opened. I fully understand that it was still a bit early in the day but don't blame us that you didn't get enough sleep. Our waitress was very moody with us. It was unappreciated, unwarranted, and very off-putting. Sadly, I can't remember the name of our waitress but I implore you to put a smile on if you're dealing with customers first hand.   Food:  I never have a bad thing to say about the food here. Sad to say that they ran out of things fairly fast. My server said that the kitchen had run out of fish cakes and pork belly. Maybe they hadn't gotten their shipment of supplies in but I hope it doesn't happen next time."}
{"text":"Very comparable to the ones in LA, great service and atmosphere. Wait time on a Sunday night was about 1.5 hr so fair warning to go early if you can, however it did only recently open so this may not be as much of an issue going forward but the restaurant is wildly popular (and rightly so) so still go early if you're able!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Jan was awesome. He was very hospitibal and extremely nice. He was very attentive and made me want to come back again and again. If you come definitely ask for Jan. Try the pork belly and the soju."}
{"text":"Definitely not recommended.. Been here twice now. Food is mediocre for the price they charge. I only gave it a second chance because I located a coupon on their site for 20$ off. Made the 20min ride over there only to have the coupon rejected because it was too popular. In essence they realized they are over priced yet refuse to accept a coupon they market. I rather stick to my tried and proven spots in china town."}
{"text":"After a long days work, my friends and I decided to go for some Korean bbq.  As a regular to Korean bbq, I admit this is one of the best place In ALL OF LAS VEGAS!  Pros- all the meats.  I LOVE the POPCORN SHRIMP.  I have never seen Widmer Hefe on tap ANYWHERE.  We had a great quality red wine, Red-goliath.   Cons-none.  I live in the north west side of vegas and this place was worth it.  $15 for all you can eat.  Seong was our server! Jaeinica and Tommy also served us."}
{"text":"Jaenica was the best server ever. Food was great but the highlight was the service from Jaenica and Eugene"}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago and was awesome. We went the first time last summer and didn't enjoy as much cause we had the kids and was too busy cooking for them to enjoy. This time was fantastic! Sat at our own grill at the bar and was spoiled. The food was so good especially since we discovered the seasoning. That was the best part! The service was great, the food was really great. Only thing that wouldn't do again is the shrimp it takes forever to feel. The pork belly was too die for. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food incredible but the service is next level. Shirley our server was on top of everything and Eric the GM was ..... there are no words... he was incredible! Eric went above and beyond. He found out we LOVE Korean food and he came by making sure we were satisfied with our dishes. Both Eric and Shirley's recommendations on what to order we're on point. But I really don't think that we would have disappointed even if we ordered the entire menu. It was my boyfriends birthday and he's been wanting to try this place, but since this establishment is in Tempe Marketplace, I was skeptical. I shouldn't have been! Do yourself a favor and just eat here. It's such a fun and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"Gen is the perfect Korean BBQ spot for newbies (new to Korean food) because they offer a vast amount of traditional and unique beef cuts, and appetizers besides banchan.   Meat: They have a lot of different beef cuts and pork! LIKE A LOT PLUS SEAFOOD. Some of their items include: brisket, beef tongue, different types of marinated premium beef and pork, pork loin, shrimp, chicken, beef chunk flap, calamari, pork belly, and prime steak (top sirloin). My favorites are the beef brisket, beef tongue (trust me, it may seem weird but the texture is just a little chewier and doesn't get dry even if you accidentally over cook it), and prime steak. All my meats were juicy red and never frozen (places like Tofu Hut will give you the beef tongue with icicles on there).  Banchan: DISAPPOINTING. It really sucks here and they only have 4 items; cucumber kimchi, cabbage kimchi, a mashed potato-like item, and daikon. They don't have any of the  traditional items like soybean sprouts or pan-fried breaded fish. I guess their appetizers make up for it... They have a handful of items like spicy rice cake, jap chae, garlic chicken, edamame, etc. (No more seaweed salad starting July 2016). I recommend ordering rice paper, it's an off menu item and goes great with your meat (think of it as the tortilla to your beef/pork).   Service: It depends. Sometimes their service can be amazing, even on a busy day, but generally they seem understaffed and take forever to get food out.   Overall: I am satisfied and can't complain because they do offer a lot. Lunch is $14.95 a person, and dinner is $19.95 (which is cheaper than a lot of places like Hwaro for example). I wish the maroon ice creams were included but they aren't sadly. It's $3.95 each (mango, strawberry, vanilla, and green tea)."}
{"text":"I don't get the appeal of this place.  It's AYCE; I guess that explains it. But the beef is such low quality that it's virtually like eating pieces of wet cardboard.   I take that back: wet cardboard has more flavor.  There are much better Korean BBQ restaurants in chinatown like Hobak, and even in the \"Twilight Zone\" Commercial Center."}
{"text":"Came here with family for the second and I honestly don't understand the hype.  The meat taste good however the more we ordered the thinner the cuts of the meat got. Which I don't understand as I am paying for AYCE. If this is the case then I should've just gone to another kbbq place that would not have skimped out on my orders.   The wait was long 45 minutes which I don't mind if it's for good food. When we got seated we were immediately greeted by a very rude female server. I'm a server myself so I understand what it is like being a server. However the service continued to be ridiculous. They took forever to even take our drink order and it took even longer for the drinks to arrive. Our server just ignored us the whole time. Each time I wanted to order something I basically had to go out of my way to flag down the server which at first didn't bother me because she might have just been overwhelmed but I realized she was going to all the other tables and ignoring us. Everytime I had a question she just snapped at me and was very defensive.   Food was very slow to come out so I honestly just lost my appetite in between the terrible service and the length of time I had to wait for my food.   I will never understand why this place is so popular, I'd rather stick to places that care about their customers."}
{"text":"The new Gen is definitely a place that won't disappoint. Korean BBQ will always be a great for a date night, especially since this is brand new! I was disappointed that the flat iron steak wasn't what I thought it would be. Besides that, service was great, food was great, and the atmosphere is modern and dark. My fave."}
{"text":"Ozzy is the best! Really enjoyed my first time at Gen bc of him ^^ He recommended really good food too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Come here every often with friends to have a good meal and good time. Foods always satisfying, and the service is great!  Shouts outs to Jaenica for all the help!"}
{"text":"I usually go to china town for Korean bbq. But we decided to come here for ALL YOU CAN EAT. I have to say this place is amazing !! I was really surprised for it being in henderson. $20 for dinner and $15 for lunch. The food is exceptionally delicious. However, I would stay away from the seaweed salad and Cajun calamari. It wasn't the best. Everything else - yes ! We saw reviews about the service being mediocre, but our service was terrific! It wasn't just our server who checked on us, but everyone else. Alodia, our server, was so friendly and fun. She joked with us and gave us her honest opinion on the food. I'm glad she was honest with us because her recommendations were good! (Try the premium beef short plate). They also change out the hot plate frequently. Which was surprising! Rarely happens in china town. But, all in all - a MUST try!    **update: we came with our parents and our server was amazing! OZZY! 10/10! I would seriously come back and be requesting for him!"}
{"text":"Service was very efficient and effective. Everything our group ate was delicious. Servers were very helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. By far my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"TL DR: It's worth the price because you're paying for the kbbq experience and distance if you live in Henderson.   So the service has always been wishy Washy for me. Some days it'll be on point. We get more than one drink refill and will be asked a good amount of times for meat orders. Other days I'll get one round and half of my appetizers before I feel full feel waiting for the waiter to order again. Ozzy and I think her name was Jessica. They were always attentive and I think for being the only kbbq spot I know In Henderson. I'm happy with what is here.   The four stars is for the iffy service, and the fact their bathroom floors are always sticky. I know you're busy .. But I like leaving a restaurant without worrying if my flip flop will want to stick around when I walk out.   Briskey, pork belly, steak, beef tongue, and roast beef are some of my faves !   Lord help me I think I first wrote this review half asleep, sorry for my elementary writing!"}
{"text":"I got to say the long line was worth it at the end. Waiting for about 50 minutes sure did make me more hungry than ever! With high quality meat selections and great service from Bo, he provided great attitude throughout our meal.   Hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience with my s/o and her family during her graduation! Servers were very quick to refill our cups, food was taken out promptly too! It's right across my workplace and if I had enough time and money I'd come here to eat everyday"}
{"text":"You grill your own meet. It was my first time at this location and I like Korean bbq but I love gen. We had a Vu as our wait staff and he was great gave an amazing recommendation and helped us a lot. The volcano chicken is bomb!!!! Hands down I love this! Best date night place and great for if you like taking pictures of food or cute picks when you go out. Meat is good quality. Vu was the best server ever if you can get sat in his area do it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite KBBQ places! It's the closest one to where I live so I'm glad that it's a good one. The service is usually pretty good. Last time we ate there we had a lovely young lady help us. I believe her name is Alodia, she was very helpful when it came to suggesting what to order and also answered every question we had for her. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because there was a little bit of a wait for rice but everything else is great! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"we ended up here again today (Wednesday) and brought in a business partner with us...3 days in a row, still not sick of it! Service was awesome today and way more efficient...told you they would get better! See you guys soon..."}
{"text":"I'll say this first if you go for dinner on the weekend you are going to wait for a table.  With that in mind I thoroughly enjoyed eating here.  The wait staff was excellent and constantly checked on our table."}
{"text":"Most adorable KBBQ spot I've been to ! Prices are phenomenal !! $16 lunch , $21 dinner . Lots of choices !! Meats are fresh and the marinaded ones are great ! Loved the bugolgis and brisket and premium steak was delightful!!!! And ordered drinks they were $5 bucks and they totally the spot !!! Definitely one of my favorite spots now!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Gen Korean BBQ and from the moment I walked in, it was definitely a sight to see! The staff was very welcoming and we didn't wait long at all for a table! The food came out right on time and they were very attentive.  I'm from California and they don't offer outstanding attentive service the way Gen KBBQ does!  Also, our server Lisa was very accommodating and friendly to us! Thank you Lisa! :)   I will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I feel so bad giving so few stars but I was honestly appalled with the wait estimate. I understand it's newly opened, there's a ton of hype, the wait will be long. I get it - I've lined up for hours for food before and know when to expect it.   Coming at 11:40am on a Saturday for lunch, I expected at least 1.5h of a wait. I was so pleasantly surprised to hear it would only be 45 min! After returning in 50 minutes (and having bought a small snack to tide me over), we still received no text. Going to ask the hostess about the wait time, she said it would be another hour. Which also turned out to be false bc we waited longer still... Chatting with some other groups of friends, they had very similar stories of being led on with ever increasing wait times.   I'm so disappointed with their wait estimation. I think I stay pretty open minded especially with new restaurant ooenings, but generally I'm still given ample notice. With a 3-4h wait, I could be halfway to LA or SD for kbbq...  I really wish I could give a higher star review but I think the false wait times and my hangry belly just won't let me. Maybe I'll check back in a few months with better luck :/"}
{"text":"Food was good, I like how they gave us little portion, gives you a chance to try everything and our waiter Ozzy was great. So kind and everything that he recommended, I liked it all. Thanks Ozzy."}
{"text":"$20+ for all you can eat meat, seafood AND appetizers?! Probably one of the best deals for an all you can eat Korean bbq. I do agree tho that the banchans are lacking. But they make up for everything else you can order. Service is top notch too. It's located as part of the mall, but surprisingly we were able to get a seat right away."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Korean BBQ, and this place is definitely in my top 2 list as far as Las Vegas goes.   We were seated within 10 minutes, which is unusual for a Korean BBQ place since it usually takes much longer. After being seated, we were informed of all of the menu items we were able to order. The menu, especially for the price, is a lot more that what we were expecting, ranging from beef briskets to marinated squid. All of this, of course, is all you can eat (AYCE).  After going through 5 orders, I already knew that this place was going to be a favorite of mine. The meats were delicious, and unlike some of the KBBQ places I've been too, the quality seemed excellent as well. The portions that were brought out at one time did not seem as large as other places, but since it is AYCE, this problem is alleviated. The servers were very attentive and came to us frequently, and waiting for the next batch didn't take an eternity. The appetizers and side dishes are very much appreciated and delicious, and I feel that the atmosphere was excellent.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience, and if it was not so much farther than any of the other KBBQ places from my house, I would come here much more often!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Korean AYCE! So many selections, plenty of seating, and affordable prices. The wait for a table is no where near as long as Tofu Hut at Chinatown. The customer service of the servers can be improved though. Most of the time, we had to repeat our orders twice cuz they end up forgetting to refill our meats. Will come back again for the food!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Today was the first time I've ever been there but honestly, it beats most of the Korean places I've been to.  The food was awesome and the waiter was amazing.  There's an adorable waiter named James and when me and my friends told him it was the first time we came there, he recommended us all the good food.  The service was amazing, our cups where always full and the food came fast onto our tables.  Honestly, I wished I lived closer to this place so I could come here all the time.  Not only where the waiters and food awesome, but the decor in this place was also amazing.  All of the girls I came with, fan-girled over the waiters and I don't blame them.  Every time I go to the Galleria Mall, I'll make sure to stop by this place again!!!  xD"}
{"text":"What a nice place! There were four of us and we enjoyed our meal. The ambience is awesome. The concept is fun, especially with a group. The food was good, with some items being better than others (naturally). I was a little disappointed in the service. Granted, it was a busy Friday night, but they were awfully rushed and inattentive. Additionally, they did a poor job explaining the concept and the different menu items, even when we said we hadn't been before!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere and outstanding service! First timer and my whole party was really impressed. You can't try everything because there's so much greatness to choose from. So we'll just have to keep going back again and again!"}
{"text":"First timer of Korean bbq! Service was spot on. Shea is one of the coolest ones there, and our grills were changed immediately when needed. The meat was perfect and the shrimp and calamari were prepared beautifully. Rice cakes were awesome, and the seaweed salad was equally as good. Everything came out promptly, and the atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"Grills are not greased, instructions on how to cook meat are not provided.  Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for authetic korean barbecue."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner and it was really busy so we decided to eat at the bar because I was getting Hangry lol and our bartender/Server Ozzy was just phenomenal. He made us feel welcomed and was very attentive to our food needs."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try GEN at their new location. Been to the one in LA before. It was nice of them to have one in Arizona. If you all know this is a AYCE Korean BBQ. Been open a few weeks now. Went around 7pm for dinner. I didn't expect for it to be an 2 hour wait. Me and gf gave it a try, wasn't sure how long we waited but we waited will over an hour. If you don't waiting then I guess you're not having GEN for dinner lol. Food was great favorite was the intestine. Only complaint I have about this place is their drinking water, it taste like crap. Seriously they need a new filtration system or something. I suggest you get lemon with your water to kill that taste or soda etc. Overall this place is delicious. I would love to GEN 5 stars but I can't the drinking tasted bad. But I will come back for sure! Recommend for all AYCE KBBQ lovers."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I've heard such great things about it. The restaurant is located in front of the Galleria Mall, which is convenient because unlike other Korean BBQ places, you don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown and deal with the hassle of finding parking. The place had a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. I did the AYCE and thought the food was just ok. I wish they had more sauces available because the only dipping sauce they provided was a bit too salty. I really didn't like their grills. Everything I cooked stuck to it, and the servers had to change our grill about 7 times because it kept turning black from all the burnt residue. Another thing I really didn't like was having to pay at our table. The server came to the table with their iPad and stood there the entire time to run my payment. It just made things REALLY awkward. I really wanted to like this place, but I'll be going back to Tofu Hut or the other Korean bbq's in Chinatown from now on."}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience! I love the atmosphere, electric blue lights and modern decor. The staff was enthusiastic, I could hear the staff sing happy birthday every 5 minutes it was delightful. I will be coming more often."}
{"text":"Tried during the soft opening and the service and food was place is amazing!! Some of the best Korean food I've found and all you can eat?? We will be back A LOT!!!"}
{"text":"So I had 1 good experience and 1 bad experience with GEN, and the good experience happened when I came the 2nd time.   Forgive me for this will be tediously long. LOL.   Bad experience happened first: Ok well all the hype about this place made me wanna try it. If it's good in Cali, then it has to be good in Vegas right??? Well.... The first time I went to Gen, the server and hostess were very rude. I understand it's busy, but we're not giving you attitude so why are you? There were 4 people seated with my group and I'm not even joking, we didn't get our meals worth. Why? The server constantly forgot our food, wasn't always checking up on us, and we constantly had to remind him what we ordered. And since they had a 4 item rule, me and my 4 people group always finished  our 4-items pretty fast. Out of all the limited food we ate, I think that the brisket and beef tongue were good. We left with half-satiated stomachs, because we just didn't want to deal with the service anymore. Food was bomb, really wish I tried more.   I GAVE IT A THOUGHT, and gave Gen another try.   Good experience: LETS JUST SAY BRAVO for taking all the criticism and changing some things! I went with my bf to Gen because he never been, and it was totally different. A cool thing they changed is they didn't have the 4-item rule anymore, we can order as much food as want, glorious! As always it was busy, but not one server or hostess was giving me and my bf attitude, GREAT change. Our server TERRY kept up with our orders, he was very intuitive, kind, and observational. Once he saw that we were almost done with our food, he would ask what we wanted. I ended up trying ALL the delicious food I wanted to try the 1st time: Likes: brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, octopus, salad, potato salad Dislikes: KFC  Overall, it was awesome the 2nd time. Great food with decent prices and small portions because the quality is amazing. I would like if they changed how they swipe debit/credit cards cause both times I've been there, they said my debit/credit card didn't work, but I go eat out at other places and it does -_- I think it's their cashier machine not my card."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Our server Richard went above and beyond. The only down side was the long black hair that we found either on the meat or the new grill they put in. Despite that would recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh how I love Korean BBQ! Definitely a spot I visit in my trips to Vegas! One of my top 3!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. The best AYCE. Our server Alan was great. Fresh and quick service."}
{"text":"Great service! Great ambiance. Great for large pastries too.  Food is good but wished there were more sides but of course that won't stop us from coming back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to hear about a korean bbq place opening in Henderson. At $19.95 for AYCE dinner, and cheaper for kids under 10, it is reasonably priced, and the quality of food is very good. The appetizers are included in the AYCE as well.  The banchan (side dishes) are limited, but tasty. I liked the cucumber and potato salad, but don't like that they put cilantro in the shredded daikon.  The bulgogi chicken and bulgogi beef were good.  They don't freely give sesame oil, so if you're into that just ask and they'll get some for you.  The entrance is out front outside the mall, facing south.  You can check in, and download an app that notifies you when you're getting close so at least you can visit the mall while you wait.  Being it was their second day open, the staff did okay but it'll get better with time.  We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles and Gen KBBQ is AMAZING out there. They crack jokes, get to know you, suggest different plates, they make you feel apart of the family. I've been to this location twice and both experiences were ridiculous. Tonight's experiences was definitely my last.   First experience:  - Host was rude. Didn't greet me. Looked at me and turned to the other host and continued to chit chat about weekend plans.  - Waiter was MIA. The entire time. When he was there, he was so slow. I received more help from the busser than I did with him. Went back there to find him since the grill was so charred and I just saw him chatting with another waiter. Sweet.   Second experience:  - Host was rude, again. Same host from the first experience. No surprise there. But this time she was conversing with a guy. I assume he was a manager because he was wearing an Affliction shirt and not a black button up. Go figure.  - Poor waiter, he was so busy with 5+ different tables with larger groups. Had to ask multiple different bussers for water, extra meat, napkins, etc. before I even received anything. Within 1 hour, I asked 3 bussers + my waiter for extra meat and only received assistance once with a partial order.  - Bartender was standing behind the bar singing and laughing with absolutely no customers on that side of the restaurant. Might've been helpful to utilize her assisting customers rather than chatting and singing Adele at the top of her lungs.  - The manager came over and I thought that he was coming to check in since I had continually asked the bussers and the waiter for multiple things. Nope. He came to pick up the dishes and ask for the menu. Didn't even get a \"hi, how are you?\" SMH.   When will people understand that customers are what drive your business. Not having your staff mopping and cleaning 20 minutes prior to closing time.   Here's some advice, save your money and go to Tofu Hut haha. They may not have the 90s playlist or flashing neon lights, but at least someone will greet you and serve you food. You can get Korean BBQ anywhere. But without a focus on driving your business and creating loyal customers, you'll never get anywhere.   Gen isn't on the strip, so tourists aren't even easily accessible to them. We are locals and we are your target audience. A lesson in customer service and effective management would greatly benefit this location. Smh."}
{"text":"This is an AYCE Korean BBQ yourself at your own table. I have been here twice and service was great, if your waiter was busy any other employee bringing food or walking by was happy to help. The meat and food was on average side though with a gas grill and stainless steal grates.  I have had a lot better with perfectly marinated meats and coal fired iron grates."}
{"text":"The server at my table was so pleasant and sweet. I the price was decent. Perhaps, I was there not at the busy hours, so the wait wasn't that bad. The food was delicious. the seasoning was just right, not too salty. The atmosphere was enjoyable.  I would recommend to try it out."}
{"text":"Yo this restaurant lit af. Only reason being is cause ozzy legit. Get this serverbro and you'll be good to go. No one comes close to his level of expertise.   Keep it real ozzy-bro"}
{"text":"The one thing I had been missing since moving to AZ was high quality Korean BBQ.  The banchan were varied and tasty.  The proteins were all very fresh.  The proteins were excellent.  I wouldn't mind an option other than AYCE, but it will make for a good weekend night meal.  Great job, GEN!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at Gen. One of them best Korean BBQ experiences I've had in awhile. Food was superb. Staff was fast, friendly and excellent. Atmosphere was perfect. Highly recommend this new all you can eat kbbq restaurant."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time here.. The food is great for the price you pay... The only downside is that non-alcoholic  drinks don't come with the all you can eat buffet. Other than that. I enjoy this place. There is always a wait. But this time we only waited 5-10 min I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"For the price, the food could go up in quality. We chose to come here because the location is closer to our house. Driving to spring mt gets tiresome. I think we will still keep making the drive downtown for KBBQ."}
{"text":"I visited Nielsens for the first time on a very busy Saturday night. The cashier was very overwhelmed and had to repeat our order 3 times but I didn't really mind considering he's probably had a rough day. However, they don't have any kind of system for distributing the custard, they don't take names or give numbers or anything like that. I didn't even get a recepit so I didn't even know how to ask for my order. Because of this, I watched people who were in line after me get their stuff before me. After 20 minutes of this, I finally said something and they just totally lost my order or I don't know what. Their frozen custard is good but their service on a busy night was greatly disappointing and not to mention it's rather pricy. I probably will still return when it's not so busy but beware when coming in during peak times."}
{"text":"This place is great.  All items are nicely shown on a menu.  Service was superb.  Sebastian was our server. He was great.  Very knowledgeable about all items. I will be back and will recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I came in no one greeted me I see mangers and servers just talking even employee sleeping at a table. Seriously why even work here if you don't take it seriously? I got my food first order and then after that it was obsolete. Sad face :( . It's whatever maybe my review won't get taken into consideration but the guys in blue who I were told were head servers didn't even do they job right. It wasn't even busy. Love the food but service was terrible here and I been to a bunch of locations Alhambra Torrance and Glendale are my fav."}
{"text":"Price of the meal is great $20 for unlimited food. The quality was average  ( not all items were good ) but the service was terrible.  We did like for appetizer the kfc chicken and the pork cutler.They ran out of rice in the middle of dinner and were forgetting many of our orders   Not a bad deal overall  but definitely not a must go"}
{"text":"This was a great meal for its value! The service was great, and the food was delicious! We were lucky to get there early and only have a 45 minute wait. On an average Friday night, the wait can be two hours. Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Second time to a gen restaurant and impressed again. Seated party of ten quickly and food started sizzling. Two hour limit for seating not a problem. Take good friends and have fun!"}
{"text":"Go Raymond! Thanks for your awesome service...! Hope you win, you work hard! Keep up the good work. The staff at Gen is awesome, never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"It's a great place to hang out with friends, the food was fresh, and the environmental was cozy. Definitely will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service from Eugene and Jaenica. Seriously the best meal I've had in Vegas with my friends because of the servers. They were quick, always checked up to see what we needed, and just overall friendly to our table. Literally everything on the menu was delicious so long as you use the side sauce/seasoning. I loved it with sesame oil.   Definitely recommend this place for great meal and service."}
{"text":"Worst gen franchise. Servers were awkward, the sauces were different or not even there than other gen places. Brisket was cut thicker, not ideal. Even down to changing our grill! They didn't even want to change it till ALL the food was cooked?? Even though it was clearly super black and smoking endlessly while cooking!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Coming from Los Angeles, we have no shortage of Korean BBQ but I have to say, this place beats a lot of places I have been to in KTOWN.   Interior: Unlike most KBBQ place which has a pretty casual vibe inside, the inside of this place was so fancy! It was also really cool and not smoky like some kbbq places.  Grill: The ventilation of the grill is great! Usually when I am at kbbq, I have smoke blowing in my face at some point. Not here!  Selection: so many different selections for a great price! I love that they have various type of sea food instead of just one. Most places I have been to, have different menu set with increasing prices so I always feel like I am missing out by going cheap. Or if you go to a cheap kbbq place you get like five selections.  Side Dishes: I usually don't eat these and they didn't have a great selection (some places gives you ten different dishes). I did love the potato salad and the fact that they had pickled radishes. They ran out of rice paper when we went :(  Price: Reasonable lunch and dinner prices. I went for lunch and loved it. I would say lunch price is most worth it for me.   Service: Really nice service! Water refills! They changed out grill so often and was always asking if we need something. Paying was super easy because they brought the electronic payment system over so we can pay. We didn't have to wait for the check or anything."}
{"text":"service is good. However, Meat quality is no good. No marble; bad cut of meat; low quality of meat. Dry and non flavorful. Look around, mostly non-asian customers;young couple for their date nights. It already explains. Side dish is sad.   Not real deal. The worst part is they use heavily on MSG which not only kill your brain cells but also keep you thirsty for next 3 hours. For $20? Not really worth it."}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this place?? I was so happy j came! I'm a big kbbq fan. Came for lunch and the special was $14.95 per person that came with a big selection of all you can eat meats AND all you can apps!!! So good. Very clean. Grill smoke was not all up in my face. I didn't leave smelling like my food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever! We were meeting some friends for a late dinner and they had shown up first to grab a table. We get there at 11 pm and by the time we got to the door it was 11:01 then the snobby host Kevin comes over and tell us we cannot sit. Mind you our friends had already started ordering tons of food and alcohol. But we could NOT sit!?! What kind of a place are you running! So I tell him to grab his manager and by this time it's 11:03! The loser of a manager with a mountain man flannel (really) comes over and squats by the table to tell us we can't stay because his floor manager won't allow it. Our friends quickly get up and we all walk away!! So disappointed since we had heard good things, BUT I will never be returning to this establishment due to poor quality customer service! Petty as people run this place, it's disgusting. This place deserves ZERO STARS! Everyone knows customer service is what sells the place."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place after she had a horrible experience in it about a year and a half ago. Long story short, some manager was very rude to her and her coworkers and kept trying to rush them out even though there was barely anyone else there for lunch. Fortunately we didn't see that same manager. This time around, the staff were very welcoming and polite. Our waiter was a little slow even when it came to getting our check. The quality of the meats are average or even below average. The briskets, the staple of kbbq, don't taste that good without the brisket sauce. Three stars since they have good appetizers and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken)."}
{"text":"Why go to a place where people hate their job? Service is lousy unless you are at the bar. They take 30 minutes to get your order and get mad when you call them out for the slow service. The lemonade is watered down and the cleaning crew have a bad attitude. The menu should have pictures and the steak was 90% fat."}
{"text":"Great selection from meats, seafood to vegetables! Fun place to go to with family & friends. The service was decent, the food came fast but getting a refill for drinks, grill changes took some time. I come here with a big appetite and always come out satisfied. Eat your money's or go home!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I eat AYCE A LOT. Like once a week a lot. Like sometimes twice a week a lot.   Gen has been on my radar for a few weeks now and I did I enjoy my dinner there this week. I have to admit that it was more for the experience and the great service standards they keep that made me enjoy it. The food ended up being very average. Is it a contender for a go-to Korean BBQ spot? They did have a lot of pluses, but in short, no. I'd describe this as KBBQ for the masses like Olive Garden to Italian food. At $15 for their lunch menu and $20 for their dinner menu the price is pretty average for Las Vegas.  I'm going to assume everyone understands AYCE Korean BBQ: you cook your own meat on a grill and eat the meats with a variety of mostly pickled side dishes.  Gen is in a beautiful space outside of the re-vamped Galleria Mall. There is no entrance to and from the mall through the restaurant. The servers and hosts use a tablet to check you in, place orders, and ring up your meal. This made the meal enjoyable as the tablet sends tickets to the kitchen in real time. That means that food is coming to your table before your whole order is taken.  The restaurant has a lot of open and shared seating to accommodate small parties and large parties if necessary. I think one of the high counters can seat 12 people on 3 grills or 3 groups of 4 on those same grills. It was so annoying to me that nothing separated some tables because figuring out who gets what space. Also the staff would bring stuff and I wouldn't know who it was for: us or them. They seemed annoyed that I kept asking if the food was ours or theirs lol.  They boast a 30+ item menu which is completely AYCE. They have appetizers like chicken karage and fried spicy squid tentacles that set them apart. KBBQ can get boring even if you love meat. Having fried appetizers really add something to the meal that satisfies my taste buds. With that being said, most of the appetizers were just okay. We tried the agedashi tofu, fried chicken, KFC chicken, sea weed salad, squid tentacles, gyoza. Everything was a-okay, but nothing stand out, nothing special, and nothing I'd order all night.   The seafood proteins they offer like whole shrimp, baby octopus, and squid are unique to me and were my favorite part of the meal. The spicy shrimp was very good! Flavorful and spicy. The garlic squid was also good- tender and flavorful.  Out of all of their sides the one I liked most was their salad. Their dressing was very good and I asked for refills a couple of times. Their spicy tofu soup was also good. A lot of tofu and the perfect amount of spice.   Now that the good is out of the way here comes the down side.  Although the list of meats they offer was extensive, none of them were anything special. There was nothing I'd order a second time. We probably ordered everything and I found their meats to be some what off. Average quality? Or maybe just not what I'm used to. The end of all of their pork belly meats were cute way too thin. They all had a hard rubbery cap too that was almost plastic-y. I also commend their \"signature steak\" to be a nice offering but it was just boring and bland. Their short ribs were also a miss.   The meats I thought were okay: red mine marinated pork belly and of course the shrimp and squid.  I did enjoy my experience at Gen. I like what they're doing by introducing Korean BBQ to the masses outside of China Town. Im pretty sure it's a chain as I've seen friends in other states post about it. My highlights for this place was the great service, the \"ambience\", and the variety in their menu. With their pretty big seafood selection I'm sure anyone can find something to eat here.   I did make It a point to try the meats I was interested in as I concluded I probably won't go back. I give it four stars because I feel like I just personally didn't like it. There wasn't anything BAD that happened and there wasn't any BAD food I just didn't like the food as much as I like other KBBQ places. They did have a few service missteps like forgetting things and then never coming back at the end."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I love coming to this restaurant, I am always happy walking in the door even if there is a wait. But this evening all my expectations were let down. I ordered a variety of meats like I usually do, and of course it's a little busy, so a wait time is to be expected. But what really disappointed me was waiting 30 minutes for an appetizer, KFC chicken. When we started seeing multiple plates of it being served to other tables we asked what was going on? We were informed the fryer was not working and they were down to one. Eventually our chicken came out and it was cold.   At this point, we asked to speak to a manager. He came to our table and we asked him if he knew if the fryer was down. He seemed very confused. So not sure if a fryer was down or they just forgot about our dish. But either way, neither the manager or the waitress apologized/tried to make things right. Overall disappointed in how this was handled."}
{"text":"This place was more than I expected. I was suggested by so many of my friends to go. This is the best AYCE KBBQ I've been to in all of Vegas. I am definitely planning on coming back. Our server Alodia was so sweet. She was always right there when we needed something. The service was super fast. She made this a great experience"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Korean BBQ I've ever had.   They have a great selection of quality meats and I love how you can order appetizer which is including in the AYCE price.  Service was good.  Few things our server could have done better but he was still attentive.  We're going to try the Northridge location in the near future!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Very good for groups. it was very busy but I never felt rushed.   Food was delicious. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Lots of food choices. Very comfy place. If your a big eater meat and seafood lover this is the perfect place to go. Their appetizer are so yummy. Love the tofu, crispy sesame chicken, pork cutlet and their crispy squid. The dipping sriracha aioli sauce is awesome. I dip all my meat on it. Love it."}
{"text":"I love all kinds of food from street food to 5 star. However, I'm not always that adventurous when it comes to new and different foods unless I know what it is. I have learned to try more things the older I get and tonight was a perfect example of why we should try new things. The dinner was amazing and I lost count of my new firsts. I think I'll be full for the next few days! There were 7 of us and we tried at least  1/2 the menu items. There was nothing bad and some liked different items over the others. Quality ingredients and so many different flavors. One of our favs was the Volcano Chicken and they warn you but I'll add to that - it will clear your sinuses and we joked it made it so we could appreciate all the other flavors! I kept going back to it. One word of advice - start out with a few dishes at a time. Yes, it's AYCE but you don't want your table loaded with dishes and it's hard to cook and serve and worry about which plate had raw food. I watched other groups that did the few at a time, immediately dropped the meat/seafood/etc on the grill and handed back the empty dirty plate to the awesome servers and ordered more. Also, you can request new/clean cooktops which do get blackened after cooking. We weren't told this but saw other tables and then they replaced it several times. We will definitely be going back. The price for what you get is an added plus. When you're offered so many options, try something new. I'm so glad I did."}
{"text":"Oops..I did it a Gen!  All you can eat meat,  What can I say? Priced just right,  takes my breath away.   I first tried Gen in October this year, It's all you can eat,  so it's quality I fear.  No fear no more, The food is just good. I came back multiple times, like I knew I would.   As for the meats, So, here's my take. The Signature's my favorite, it's their premium steak  The beef bulgogi is dry, the Chadol's too thin. The KFC is a winner, but the Signature still wins.    I'm a fan of meat, The service is great. Are they the best KBBQ?   Now that's the debate.  3 stars they earned, Qualities' okay. I would give more stars, But wasn't blown away.  So, who's my favorite? Does it really matter?  Just keep the food coming, with meat on my platter.  I've been here for dinner, and even for lunch. I will come back, for that protein punch.   So who am I? A Yelper with rhymes on the loose, Call me Mel C, Not Yelp's Doctor Seuss.  Peace!!"}
{"text":"So when we heard about the new location on the West side we were happy and eager to visit.  What a letdown. The thing we noticed right away was that the ventilation, it was either working poorly or nonexistent.  Smoke was so bad that it made us think twice about staying. But we wanted to give this location a chance. So we sat down and ordered. I really have to say, the serivce was on point. Grill was always changed and our tea was always refilled, the server was really attentive. The food on the other hand, different story. One item we always order is the Galbi. Too plain. it was not marinated at all. It tasted like someone just dipped it in sauce and brought it out.  Very disappointed! We would love to order more and enjoy the ambiance but the smoke was too much so I just wanted to hurry up and eat and get out. I truly hope Corporate/Management takes this seriously.  My wife and I visit Gen in Henderson at least twice a month and we love this place and we want to come back."}
{"text":"Best place every! When this place open up I was pretty excited because I've seen them in California but never here. I am a big k-pop and kdrama person so when this place opens I told my boyfriend we needed to go. When we got there it was about an hour wait so my boyfriend was a bit annoyed because we were both hungry. Finally when we got call and we sat down our server explained things to us and took our order. Well everything was amazing! My boyfriend loved it and he loved it even more because they had great music playing. We will definitely will be going back and very often!"}
{"text":"The newest Gen Korean BBQ house is doing things right, I'm a fan..=)  Gen Service:  Great great service to get our party of 10 seated within 10 minutes on a Friday evening.  Our meats were brought to us quickly upon ordering and banchan replenishes were quick as well.  Our lead server was great with changing the grill and keeping everyone's drinks fresh.  All the staff in general had a upbeat and positive attitude, fantastic.  Gen BBQ: Everything we ordered was above average but the premium steak, bulgogi and pork stood out for so these received repeat orders.  The salad was really fresh and paired well with our meats.  The usual banchan side dishes were good but the servings were tiny.  I especially enjoyed their Jap chae noodles.  Ask your server create the Gen Dipping Sauce as it doesn't automatically come with your orders.  This is a delicious in house dipping sauce that I will request at future visits.  Gen Ambiance:  A large dining area smartly designed with multiple tables, booths to accommodate large crowds that are popular with ayce Korean BBQ.  The open room restaurant dimly lit with some great Tron blue accent lighting but you're eating area is well lit for dining.  At an initial glance, you could mistake this place as a high end cocktail lounge.  I frequent the Gen House in Green Valley which I enjoy and they're doing well with their newest location.  This is another great option in this great foodie city of Las Vegas and I'm sure i'll be back.  See you under the blue lights! =)"}
{"text":"Great time and a lot of fun.  Our guys Mizzo and Kevin kept us well fed.  This is a great way to experience Korean style BBQ in a new way.  For a soft opening the staff did a great job.  I think they really go out of their way to help the new customers to this style of food.   Good stuff , give it a try."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends on Monday. We drove from UNLV and it was really a tough trip. The highway entrance was closed and the road was super crowd because of the road construction. Everything was bad until we met Ozzoy. He is really a kind waiter. My friends and I were very comfortable with his service, his facial expression, and his voice, soft and gentle. If I was the manager, I'll promote him. The guy who helped us change the BBQ plate was also nice.  My friends and I were very happy after dinner.   Except the service, I am the big fan of beef tongue. The garlic chicken, I liked it but my friends didn't. The pork, we all liked it. The octopus is sweet but tasted nice. Considering the price, I can't require more.   I will be here again."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly and very professional!  When I go back I will ask to be served by Kailin! The food is so fresh and delicious I must add!"}
{"text":"Gen is always good but sometimes it can be super crowded and they try to fit 6 to a grill. This time around there was only a 5 min wait and we got a 3 grill table for 7 of us which was really nice. Julian was our server and he was super nice and attentive. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The last time I had Korean BBQ was in Baltimore where I lived in a short period of time and this was by far one of the greatest overall restaurant experiences I've ever had!! So full, so happy and amazing service! Definitely will be back soon and more times over!! Huge fan!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here and we love it and will be back! Hostess explained how it worked and our server Dennis further explained and was so kind and attentive! Dishes come out quickly and food was delicious. Cheaper than eating at a regular korean restaurant! Looking forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"Used to have a 5 star review here but my recent experience was completely different! It seems like service has gotten worse.  We came in at 10:30 and during the first round of our meal the hostess brought out our check saying \"were closing the register soon so heres your check.\" They close at 12am not 10:45pm. I work in the restaurant industry and can understand wanting to close the restaurant in a timely manner, but an hour and 15 minutes early when the register is most likely closed last is ridiculous.  When we came in, a table next to us left and a huge piece of chicken fell on the floor (see photo). It was left in the walking aisle the entire time we were dining in. I stepped on it once i forgot about it and so did my boyfriend. The server would accidentally kick it, but still not pick it up. It was disgusting.  Also, the appetizers sit out on the tables until someone comes which is gross and not fresh. At least other kbbq places plastic wrap them until someone comes. I took a photo of an empty table with appetizers waiting. No one ever sat at this table and they took the appetizers out probably to reuse them to sit out the next day.  Our water was not refilled once due to everybody being too busy closing. We finally got a water refill after we asked after we paid our bill.  Our server was one of those people that just took orders, but didn't provide any customer service.  2 stars for food. Food was good and quick and came out before our waters hit the table."}
{"text":"Would definitely give this place a zero star not because of the food quality but the service being provided. I've had Gen before but this was our first time dining at Gen in Las Vegas. We had a party of 10 adults and 1 baby. First the waiter asked how old is my baby and I told him he is two and he gave me the look as if he didn't trust my word for it. He asked me once more and I gave the same answer.   After we all sat down, my son started to have a bloody nose, and I asked for extra napkins to attempt to stop the bleeding, but they took their time and said please use the restroom because he was bleeding too much. I didn't say anything and did as they asked. After coming out from the restroom, took my son to the car to let him rest up with his mom. I went back to let the group to start ordering the meat without my wife and I. I assumed that the Gen in Orange County had great service before and will be able to accommodate my group without me, but they provided terrible service. The grill wasn't changed not till upon request. We ordered veggies but they took their time bringing it out.  After the group ate for about 30 minutes, since everyone was concerned for my son, I asked for the bill so that we come back to the hotel, and they charged is for 10 people!! I was shocked since my wife was out in the car and she didn't even get to sit to dine. I asked them why they charged for 10 rather than 9 since my wife didn't even had a bite to eat, their initial response was unfortunately you told us 10 adults and 1 baby they have to charge. I asked but she didn't even eat anything or even touch her plate, she used the restroom to tend to my son and left to the car right away. They then said that once she comes inside the store they will charge. I asked to speak with a manager, and she said the samething.   Worse experience at Gen ever!!"}
{"text":"Took the family to Gen this afternoon for lunch.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant modern and the sound level was acceptable. The problem was the service.  This is a 'concept' restaurant in which you basically cook your own food table side on a grill.  The idea is similar to the Melting Pot where you cook your own food in a variety of fondue sauces.    I won't even talk about the first waiter who was a complete mess.  He was so bad, I called the manager over and she reassigned the \"lead\" waitress to our table.  From there on, the service was quick but it entirely missed the point of the restaurant.  By way of example, they place a three chambered sauce/spice tray in front of each diner. That said, nobody bothered to explain what the spices were or how they should be used on the proteins and veggies.    We ordered several proteins and a few veggies and they all came promptly. But here again, nobody gave us a clue about how they should be cooked.  As another example, we ordered the strip steak (number 1 on the lunch menu).  It appeared to be a nice cut of marbled steak.  So, as one would expect, I put in on the grill not realizing that (since no knives were provided) that I should have cut it into bite sized pieces with the provided cooking shears (not a great way to cut a steak, btw).  Similarly, while I know how long to cook squid, I don't know anything about octopus.  We ended up with several pieces of tire rubber.  Ultimately, this restaurant relies entirely on the waiters to make the experience.  If they aren't engaging and helpful, it doesn't matter how fresh the ingredients are (and, to be honest, all of the ingredients did indeed appear quite fresh).  The fast service is appreciated and if I told the waiter I knew what I was doing, then that might have been enough.    Bottom line, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The service was great considering the amount of people here. In hindsight, they warned us that it might take a while but service was as usual as a slow day. Something you have to try is the chicken bulgogi  and the red wine pork belly. Those are the must have in the restaurant. Also the service was great by Lisa, Blake, Kristina, Raymond and Samuel"}
{"text":"Great experience brought my friend here for his first ever experience at a k BBQ place. Great food, at a great place. Howard and mizzo were great at keeping the food coming. Great place to have a great meal with friends."}
{"text":"Great concept with a great price! Great interactive date place. I wish they had better air flow though. The grills at each table take up some oxygen. The shrimp came fully shelled which was super hectic.   But great service and great foods."}
{"text":"This place is so great. Been many times and have never been disappointed. Ozzy is the best server I've ever had. Willing to give his personal recommendations if you don't know what to get. Very knowledgable and always has a wonderful smile. The quality of food, drinks and service is superb."}
{"text":"I am re-writing my review which was previously a 4-star review. The reason for this update is completely based on service. Even more specifically, Eugene and Ozzy in particular! These guys are AMAZING. I can't express enough how good of a server they are other than that they are the best servers I've had the pleasure in meeting. Eugene made great menu recommendations (e.g. Beef tongue, Gen sauce, etc.). I have never been a fan of beef tounge in my life, but Gen's tongue is my new favorite on the menu. He also hooked me up with chili sauce and their special Gen sauce and i didn't even ask for it. All I told him was that I like their \"salad sauce,\" and BOOM, he's bringing all kinds of amazing sauces out to our table! In conclusion, if you go to Gen, ask for Eugene or Ozzy because I know I will!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and was surprised to see it was open! For opening week, the service was great and everything seemed pretty organized. Quality of meat was good as well! The only feedback I would give is that the dinner price of $25 is more expensive than typical all you can eat KBBQ places and communication/updates of when this place would open wasn't great - I couldn't find much online."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the service is phenomenal! All the meats are very fresh and quickly served. Things everyone should try: spicy bulgogi, beef bulgogi, spicy octopus, beef tongue, brisket, pork belly. These are my top favorites but of course, there are more. The seasoning sauce they have are actually seasoned as well! For the first time, I didn't get a side of oil for my meats! It's a great time eating there! Definitely should eat during happy hour(lunch time), it's less than $20(i forgot how much)."}
{"text":"The meat quality is pretty good here and there are a lot of options on the menu to choose from. Although some may be worried about the 2 hour time window, it was ample for our visit. The service was a bit spotty and we had to wait a little bit to flag down our waiter for the next order, so make sure to decide on the next round of dishes ahead of time. They will change your grill if requested. Compared to Manna BBQ, this restaurant has smaller portions (which are more manageable) and less banchan, but is still delicious overall. I also thought the bulgogi here was better than Manna's bulgogi. The Korean Fried Chicken tasted like Panda Express Orange Chicken; nothing too special. Try the Gen Signature Premium Steak instead!"}
{"text":"I've had Korean from some of the dirtiest old hole-in-the-wall places ever... This place is not that.  The place was clean and modern looking.  The food wasn't quite authentic Korean, but it was decent and most very tasty.  The best was the spicy pork and the smoked garlic pork belly.  The ban chan was mediocre.  The jap chae a little dried out.  Waiters were were fast and friendly.  The hostess was slow, paying the bill even slower...  For the price point of $15(lunch) and $20(dinner)...this ayce was well worth it."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Korean bbq! It's a pretty interesting experience since you are supposed to cook your food yourself.   The restaurant is pretty new and very spacious. It has a modern, industrial feel to it.  The hostess who greeted us wasn't really friendly but our server Mizzo made up for it. He was attentive even though it got really busy for dinner.   Tips for anyone wanting to try out this place:  1. Make sure you're very hungry! This place is an all you can eat place.  2. Make sure you finish all your food or else you'll get charged extra.  3. If you order anything chicken, just know it takes awhile for you to cook!"}
{"text":"TIP: it's located next to Kabuki, across from Barnes and Nobles. Your clothes and purses will smell like bbq afterwards so don't wear your favorite fancy clothes if you plan to eat here :)  I came here the week after their opening with a Korean friend who's visiting town. She moved to MN for school and was dying for some KBBQ. We're both USC alumni so we've had our fair share of bomb kbbq in LA's KTown.   Pros: -Lots of parking (mall parking) -clean and new facility - very attentive staff - fair prices (same prices as the other Gen locations in CA) - meat quality is quite good (LOVE the tongue, hawaiian steak, brisket, pork belly, and baby octopus)  Cons: (Why I only gave this location 3 star) - a little hard to find since it's in the middle of the mall - we had several dirty plates and bowls with crusty dried food on them :( - The soups (bean paste and soon du boo were luke warm when served) - the wait is pretty long since they're new, yet they won't allow reservation. - they don't have any hot sauce, this is like a crime against asian food lol  Overall, decent spot because the KBBQ is new to Arizona and there's not much competition (Took this trend long enough to catch on =.=) For the same price, I've had much better kbbq in CA, BUT this will definitely help me satisfy cravings if I can't go back from for my meat fix :)"}
{"text":"Hard to find if you don't live in Henderson.  Food is excellent.  Adequate parking.  Handicap parking not very close.  Service was good.  Large, clean and well organized.  Prices are reasonable for all-you-can eat Korean BBQ.  Mainly one price.  Numerous seasoned meat and fish choices.  Plenty of side choices.  About $20 for adults.  Your stay is limited to 2 hours.  Children less $.  Restroom very clean.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've waited a long time for a restaurant opening near Galleria / Sunset Station that I can really get excited about. Well, I'm finally excited.  This is Gen Korean BBQ's 12th location, but they're a chain due to its success, not for being \"chain restaurant\" quality. This one is in the Galleria Mall building but not directly connected to the mall. It's near Red Robin and Larsen's, but it's at a higher elevation than Bravo.  I actually ate for free (+tip) due to their public grand opening promo. It fell within dinner hours, which normally costs a very reasonable $19.95 for all you can eat (AYCE). The AYCE lunch is even more affordable at $14.95 and still includes everything except items #7, #8, and #10 (see below).  This may be AYCE, but expect good-quality meats from the kitchen each time you order. Each table is allowed to up to 4 appetizers and 4 meats (8 total) per order. If you have 3-4 people in your group, go for it. But if you're solo or have one companion, don't do this! The time limit is two hours (not flaunted since the place wasn't packed), and you can order as often as you want, so order just a few dishes at a time so that everything is as fresh as possible. On a related note, don't cook all of your meats all at once if you're solo...  Some AYCE KBBQ joints have an employee cook or at least start your order for you, but it's all up to you here, so get familiar with your brown and pink colors really quickly and pick up the tongs and scissors. There are small gas-powered grills no matter if the table seats 2 or 4, and my experience is that meats cook really quickly here. There's plenty of table space for plates even though the grill is prominently fixtured in the table's center, and they will change your grill cover often because \"sticky\" meat residues often coat the grill after a round of cooking.  Time to talk about the food? I think so. The banchan (side dishes) were already at the table, and they included a rather sweet mashed potato salad, kimchi, spicy cucumber, spicy radish, and pickled cucumber. They all complement the meats well at some point, although the potato salad does seem out of place until you get really full. They also bring out a chopped lettuce salad with the first round of orders. The lettuce is fresh, but you can tell that they poured the sweet dressing onto the plated lettuce because a huge pool forms at the bottom.  They have several appetizers, but the only must-order that I've had is the crispy squid legs, with their light crunchy batter and a good salty flavor. The KFC was a large portion of fried boneless chicken pieces with sweet and spicy sauce. I'd skip it in favor of proper meat texture here, which the sesame chicken does have. The seaweed salad and agedashi tofu are both pretty good. The popcorn shrimp and pork katsu are fun but not thematically consistent. The japchae is a good complement to any meat, but Gen's version seems a little harder and less silky than another delicious japchae that I recently ate across town.  I got a bunch of grilled meats, listed as follows:   #3 Gen chadol (beef brisket) is thinly sliced and comes in a relatively large portion. It's tasty and has the \"beefiest\" flavor.  #5 Gen beef bulgogi also is largely portioned. It's nicely marinated and ends up tender after cooking, but it's a little messy to lay flat on the grill and flip. It's well worth it though.  #7 Roast beef (premium beef chuck rib eye) comes in just 4-5 thin slices and cooks really, really quickly. Maybe 8 seconds at most on each side will suffice. The marbling really comes out in the great flavor and soft texture.  #8 Premium beef tongue is around 5 rolled-up thin slices per order. Like the roast beef, it cooks really quickly. Another item with great flavor and tenderness, assuming no overcooking...  #10 Gen yangyum galbisal, aka marinated premium steak, is about 5 squarish cuts per order. It's a boneless version of the popular short ribs. It was tender and well-flavored, and was a multiple reorder on my second visit.  #15 Spicy pork bulgogi is also fine, and it's mild-medium at best. It's good but not special.  #17 Smoked garlic pork belly and #19 Miso pork belly both come in two large, thick strips. Cut them up after cooking. The smoky flavor was a little unusual and perhaps should be left to the American BBQ context, but I enjoyed the miso version.  #20 Shrimp and #21 Cajun Shrimp were both good, shell-on shrimp, 4 per order.  The sweet dipping sauce and the salt and pepper mix are both useful for the non-marinated meats.  Service issues seem to be a theme with new Gen openings, including the recent one in San Jose. Luckily, they were fairly minimal for me, with an average of 1.5 forgotten requests (all corrected after prompting). As I mentioned above, the restaurant wasn't full, so I didn't experience much slowness in order fulfillment.  Overall, you'll find a delicious and worthwhile meal even at the regular price. I'll most likely be back soon for more meat gluttony."}
{"text":"It's great to see a few Korean BBQ places popping up all over the valley. We were excited to try this one but left disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food is decent, though a bit on the saltier side. It would also be nice if they have more veggetable options for the grill. What really got us was the cleanliness of the place. It looks trendy and all, but the floor is very sticky. Moreover, we can't believe that this place doesn't have venting hoods over the tables -- for a BBQ place where you grill your own food at the table! I didn't notice any other ventilation setup either. When we first got there before the dinner rush, the place was already a bit smoky. When the dinner crowd hit, the smoke became a bit intolerable. I can't imagine it is good for your health either. We will not go back to this place unless the conditions are improved."}
{"text":"Meat was excellent. Service was also great. Definitely recommend harami miso and the prime kalbi. High quality"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try. Food was pretty good and had a lot of selection. Servers were friendly. Cool environment. Would come back again soon."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Gen in California and remembered it being great so you can imagine how excited we were when they opened out here! It was absolutely delightful. AYCE Lunch is 14.95 and dinner is 19.95 but on the weekends, it's dinner pricing all day. We did not mind because they have such a huge selection that it really satisfied both of our palates albeit being very different! It's honestly the best kbbq in town. I am also one for service and our server, Seong, made the experience all the more pleasant! He was so attentive and quick. I told him I drank a lot of water so he came by every 5 minutes with fresh water. When we come back, we are definitely requesting his section again!!!"}
{"text":"Great price for AYCE. $19.99 can't go wrong. Nice seating. If you like a lot of meat this is a great place to go. Was going to give it a 5 star but they need to ad some different type of vegetables as well on the menu and maybe some more shrimp options. Plus our waiter was a tad bit slow other then that good food, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got there was a little early went to the bar had some unfiltered saki recommendation of the bartender so good! Then got sat down at our table they served us these some Kim chi, then got to order the meat shrimp, pork belly, short ribs so good highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 13, and got quoted an hour and a half. Ridiculous amount of time, but we were set on Gen BBQ, so we decided to wait. And although it was closer to 2 hours before we were sat, our server Samuel and the delicious food made the wait well worth it. Let's just start off with a big ollll' round of applause to Samuel. We were probably one of the most obnoxious crowd, with hungry and needy people,  but he was able to not only accommodate every single one of our requests, but also had such a good attitude and everyone brought out our food so quick. He even sang happy birthday to my brother with everyone! :) So now the food. Over 30 different, all delicious, selections for only 20 dollars. Whaaaaaat. Our party was put on two tables. Our table had 7 people. We ordered 18 briskets, 2 pork bellies, 11 beef tongues, 8 bulgogis, 2 orders roast beef, 1 calamari, and the list can go on. Every single dish was delicious and you bet we finished all of our orders. The only reason for the 4 stars was because the hostesses quote inaccurate wait times, and a party of 13 can get super impatient, super quick. And also, the tapas were very minimal.. I've never had gen bbq in california, but I've heard everyone rave about it so I didn't really know what to expect. But they are by far the best kbbq in town, even if it is a good 30 minute drive, it is all worth it!! Samuels the best!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a meat utopia for those that like the concept of AYCE (2 hour limit).  The various items we tried were well seasoned.  The service was pretty good though, they come through and change out the grill plate regularly, which is nice.  Since I am not a huge meat eater, I wouldn't frequent this place often; however, if you like Korean seasoned meats, I definitely would recommend this place.  They do offer some prepared foods that you can order off the menu as well like jap chae and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), which is part of the AYCE.  The music is a bit loud, which makes it hard if you are here for good conversation with friends, etc...  But the place is beautifully decorated and clean."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Beef tongue is amazing there! Went through 13 orders and got strawberry and lychee soju! It's was great! And to top it off, our server Ozzy was awesome! He gave us the best service that we could ever ask for! Just a great place all around!"}
{"text":"A nice place for a fun dinner. Not quiet, so don't come here for a meeting. Ventilation is horrible as smoke builds up at your table. Been to Korean bbq places in NY and each table had a vent, sucking smoke. We left the place smelling like bbq.   I don't like the fact that it's not a buffet style where you get your own food and start cooking, not sure if it's an AZ health code thing or what, as it is my first time in az at a Korean bbq. Servers will bring only 4 items at a time, you pay flat $25 for all you can eat, but service is slow and by our third round we were tired of waiting. I don't know if I'd try it again, it was an OK experience but will have to go to another Korean bbq when I go to NYC"}
{"text":"Our friend has been raving about this place since they came to town.  He came from LA and has eating it there many times.  So we finally trekked across town (40 minute drive) to give it a shot.  After we got there we knew there would be a wait but it was another hour! OMG this had better be good.  We were finally called and sat down.  The first part of there service seemed slow, we asked for water and a few things to start but it was our first time so we need some time for the rest.  By the time we ordered our next round our first round had not come yet...  All in all I think is was just a really busy night and the lull slowed them down a bit, pretty understanding of that.  When it did come it is small portions so it is good for the AYCE setting but please don't under estimate or they will charger you for not eating.  We paced ourselves, one if the things I really liked is the variety of meat they had.  I am a Bulgogi so give me that with one other thing and I am happy.  Here I tried so many things it made the experience fun for me again.  The different kinds of meat I tried was great, the service was great, some of the appetizers were good.  A few downfalls in my mind is they seved the lettuce chopped on the side (like a salad) I like to warp my BBQ in lettuce with all the toppings.  They were also missing the soybean sauce one of my favs but because they serve the lettuce chopped it wouldn't matter anyways.  They do have a Radish wrap our friend loves my man liked it I am not a fan but that is only because I don't like radish, so that has nothing to do with the restaurant.  The other wrap he loved was a rice paper wrap.  I tried it was amazingly difficult to work with and all my food fell out anyways (horrible), not a fan but whatever that is a personal choice.  I am still giving 4 starts because all the things I disliked besides the lettuce wrap and the soybean sauce was a personal choice.  The restaurant is Really good the meant is great and some of the specialty meat is absolutely amazing!  I like the small serving sizes because it is an AYCE they portion it on the small side so you can eat more kinds!    All in all, Great service, Good timing, could be a bit better expelling the menu if new even if our friend has been, food delivered quickly after the first lull, flavor of the meat and cuts of meat very good!  Could add non chopped lettuce, could add soybean sauce.   Pretty good stuff I might be back if on this side of town again!  If I lived on this side, well 100%"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The brisket is my favorite but everything is really good. We tend to only order beef or pork because chicken takes too long and when you have a med size party no one likes to wait for food to be cooked :) Our server's name was Greg. He was a young kid and was so accommodating. His service was impeccable and we were a pretty needy table. He definitely made our time last night enjoyable. Unfortunately, he had to leave and another waitress served us and wasn't the best. We waited 15 minutes for her to even come and introduce herself and had no food to cook so we were just waiting. Then we waited another 15 minutes for the food to come out. I wasn't too bothered but what really got me upset is we told her it was someones birthday and if they can sing and she completely spaced out and forgot so it never happened. :( Nonetheless, food is great!"}
{"text":"Very fun place to go. Great for a group dinner or date night. All you can eat and you grill it at your table. Drinks are big which always adds to the fun. I recommend the premium pork belly, spicy chicken, and any of the thinly slice meats.  It was very busy but the great thing is food comes out quickly. Great atmosphere and music"}
{"text":"With the addition on Gen, I find myself missing CA less and less. I used to go to Gen in CA pretty often, so I was STOKED when I heard one was opening in AZ. Congrats AZ you making it in life   Okay so this is your typical AYCE (All You Can Eat) KBBQ spots. We came for lunch which was $15.99, a pretty solid deal and selection of meats. Dinner is I believe 24.99 with more variety.   If you don't know what to get or you're pretty new to the whole KBBQ experience, here are some tips.   Chadol - the brisket, the OG of all KBBQ meats. It's really hard to go wrong. It's thinly sliced perfection of a marbled steak.   Steak - not bad here, pretty basic. Nice fat cap on the top.   Hawaiian Steak - basically anything marinated here is not bad. Make sure you cook it like last in your batch. That way you can keep your grill from charring up too quickly.   Pork Cheek - (Pork Jowl) this is like bliss in a bite. It's even chewier than pork belly. It takes a bit of time to cook but trust me, it's soooo worth it. TRY IT!!!  Smoked pork belly - it tastes like ham. Yea... not my favorite. :/  Octopus - worth the try if you like seafood. Put it all in the middle and grill for a little bit. Let the water from the sauce steam the octopus for a bit. Then cut it in half from head down. And cook on the side. Open and flatten the head even better results.  What you end up with, perfectly cooked octopus. But a super dirty grill. Cook this last.   Get the tofu soup, and try the side dishes (eat it with the meat to give your meal another dimension of complex flavors)    But YEAH! Come on down here, AZ has finally been graced with the presence of amazing KBBQ."}
{"text":"Yes, the first  Gen BBQ in Nevada. Arrived on a Wednesday evening. Located at the Galleria Mall, the entrance is on the exterior.  I was solo and opted to sit at the bar which was completely empty since it was an early evening.  The entire staff here was really friendly and several of the employees transferred from So. Ca. to train new hires since they've only been open less then a month.  For those of you who aren't familiar with Gen they are a AYCE KBBQ.  Weekday lunch is $14.99 weekdays and evenings  and weekends are $19.99  The price includes salad and limited banchan but they offer additional appetizers for an extra cost each.  I ordered the signiture steak, baby octopus, cajun shrimp, marinated beef, beef tongue, beef brisket and miso soup. Being solo, the portions were large and filling to the point that I was plenty  full although I wanted to check out the dessert menu. Unfortunately  they didn't offer desserts yet - because they're so new.  After speaking  to the friendly manager from so Cal - he advised me there's several more Gen Bbq's coming to the Las Vegas area which will be convenient."}
{"text":"They were great in accommodating my party of 7 celebrating my mother in law's birthday. Staff was excellent and courteous, food was awesome! They even allowed us to change some appetizers. I highly recommend this establishment!!"}
{"text":"Austin is the Best!!! He was on top of things. Very prompt and attentive.  Food was was awesome!! Definitely would come back again"}
{"text":"Food is great but their service needs a lot of improvement. The servers need to be more efficient and attentive especially when you can only order 4 items each time. With this implemented the servers should be prompt and check on your table as soon as your order comes out. Instead, we've had to wait A LONG TIME to put in another order to where we don't even have anything to put on the grill anymore."}
{"text":"I have been to Gen in California.   So was excited when they opened here in Arizona.   Great food.  Service was great.   Very fast once we got seated.  The wait was 1-2 hrs.  But worth the wait.  Only thing disappointing is the price listed on website is different than what they charge at the Tempe location.  California is $20.99 for dinner which is what is listed on the website and this location charges $24.99. Recommend the spicy pork bulgogi, Gen beef bulgogi, Gen signature Galbi and Hawaiian steak.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Our server Blake was really attentive and hospitable! Dinner was delicious and fast service. The wait time is a little long but hopefully they'll expand one day."}
{"text":"Ozzy was amazing! He kept asking how we're doing and if everything was okay. He took the time to explain to us how it worked and which items to order and etc. We'll deff come back! Thank OZZY !! (;"}
{"text":"This had to be one of the most interesting and best service I've had our server as Alodia she was absolutely amazing. She seems to be a very valuable staff member to this location. If you ever get the chance to dine at this location ask for her she will make you experience one to remember. The management here also seemed very kind. Alodia was very tentative to our needs and check up on us quite often which was always great for the service."}
{"text":"Thank you Ozzy for all your services! Dinner was great!!! I can't wait to go back and hopefully you will be our server again!"}
{"text":"We've had a wonderful experience here! The meat is of top quality and our server named Yuhao is fantastic. It is much better than lots of Korean barbeques I've been to. We will surely come back."}
{"text":"Great service, even better wait staff. Our server, Shea, went above and beyond to make our time here unforgettable. We will definitely be coming back after the excellent service she provided!"}
{"text":"Did NOT like the attitude of the employees, the hostess & one of the bussers were rude for no reason. We asked the busser to bring a new set of Tongs because the old pair were touching raw chicken. Once he brought it back he said \"better?\" then rolled his eyes. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"After having it in Vegas, I always wished for something like this to come to AZ and my wish came true! Hands down the best place for all you can eat Korean BBQ. The atmosphere is so nice and chill, also super new and clean. The service is spot on, there are always waiters and waitresses catering to our needs. Will easily recommend this to everyone I know."}
{"text":"OZZY!!!! The best server we have ever had. Thank you for your great customer service and constant up keep with our grill change and getting our food out so quickly. OZZY you were great :)"}
{"text":"2 and a half hour wait  you expected something heavenly good  !!! Food is alright,  taste the  same as other Korean places !  There are plenty around mesa  I don't like going through all this hassle never again ! Not worthy the time and the long hour drive. On a second note their water tasted like sewage water nasty"}
{"text":"Expensive but so worth it! If you're in Vegas, definitely the place for Korean food! Everything on the menu is all you can eat! Definitely coming back when we're back in town! Parking is a little crazy!"}
{"text":"I'm being super generous with this review by giving them 3 stars.  The food here is good. It's all you can eat Korean food. It's not great, but def good. Having all you can eat Korean food with good quality adds a big star.  The restaurant itself looks nice, modern, and clean.  Sounds good? Yes that stuff is good.  Now here's where it takes a turn. The service and the staff. Wow. I was looking around like this has to be a joke. I was referred here by my cousin who said hey you gotta try this place it's awesome. So I came in happy to eat here. I walk in and there are maybe 5 tables seated. There were 3 hostesses there and they greet me kind of like I was bothering them. I let them know how many were in my party since they didn't know how to ask. They said they needed to set up a table. We waited about 15 minutes and a crowd was now building up waiting. My wife and I started to joke with each other about how the hostesses looked like they were afraid to make eye contact with anyone waiting. There was even a moment that the 3 of them formed a circle looking at each other so they wouldn't have to look at anyone.  Another 5 to 10 minutes went by and we were seated. The hostess starts with her presentation of the menu by asking if we have ever eaten Korean bbq. I said yes I'm actually Korean. She looks at me and it's like nothing registered in her brain except for her trying so hard to remember her script, and so she explains to us what Korean bbq is.  The waitress comes up literally within 10 seconds and asks if we are ready to order. Lol. We actually haven't even had a chance to open the menu. I say could you give us just a second so we can review the menu. She comes back and so we order. I also order a beer and my wife ordered some type of mango drink. A lady comes back to the table with the wrong beer. So I send it back. Then she brings my wife's drink out and it tasted like warm jello. We got our food and were relieved that it was actually good. So we ate, and our waitress never once checked with us. I sat there waiting to try and get some more food and she never came back. I just figured oh well I guess we will go. I really couldn't take it anymore. I had to ask a busser how we pay. They went and got a hostess who didn't know how to work her pay machine for my card. She was waiting on printing a receipt after she had already clicked the no receipt button. Until I finally said I don't need a receipt it's ok.  It's a cool place to try because the food is good. Just be prepared for the most disorganized service you have ever had and you should be alright. Set your service expectations to 0 and you won't be disappointed. I told my cousin this morning that I tried Gen, and he said what did you think? I said wellll it was good, and he finished my sentence with...but the service sucked didn't it? I will try this place again and hope it has improved or it'll be off the list unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is place is great!  There really is not one waiter or waitress assigned to you because they all help everyone which is nice.  You do cook your own food but it is well worth it for all you can eat for $20 (dinner) and $15 (lunch)."}
{"text":"First time was last night.  We got there at 4;15pm and there were 6 tables occupied.  Then we were asked to wait like 5-7 minutes which I didn't understand why.  Then we were seated and presented menus.  We only ordered premium steak which was good, KFC chicken yuck, pork cutlet, terrible, bulgobi my favorite and garlic chicken which I would not eat because it took so long to cook.  Servers were nice and friendly.  I wouldn't go back and I am glad we had a $20 off coupon."}
{"text":"I love this place. All you can eat for $25?! What's better than that! They switch out the hot plates often and the meats are great!"}
{"text":"If you love Korean BBQ or BBQ in general, you'll LOVE GEN! This place is awesome. You pay $20 and receive unlimited amount of Korean BBQ. That includes brisket, beef belly, beef tongue, galbi, and chicken! I personally don't eat seafood but they even have that! The atmosphere is just amazing... makes me feel like a high roller when I eat at Gen! Professional Korean BBQ on a whole different level."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my group. The first time was amazing, then they are getting worse. I agree they have very great selections, the staffs are okay, the place is cozy. The food portion is smaller and smaller after a few times you order it. I love to eat the Tofu soup, and they make it taste so bad, it is not hot enough at the time they brought it for me which is really disappointed! I would love to come back to give them a try because they used to be so good!"}
{"text":"Best service ever. Not sure if they are going above and beyond because they just opened, but I had any amazing experience. Fresh food and a fast and friendly server. I highly recommend the volcano chicken if you like SPICY food. So glad to have a location closer than the one in Henderson."}
{"text":"I've been to the locations on Bay Area and the food is great!  But here, their rice is hard and old.  We asked for a replacement and they replaced it with soggy rice.  Ew.  The shrimp smelled bad/old.  The sides were not fresh and cold.  Too much dressing in the soggy salad.  Oh, and they tried to charge my 7 year old a full adult price and my 3 year old a kids price when he should be free.  They measured our kids, and my kids are taller than average, but come on, 7 year old for adult price?  And a toddler who barely eats?!?   And to top it off, when we asked for the bill, the sever came and rudely said \"we can't give you the bill until you finish that.\"  Wtf?  Are you forcing us to finish?  Damn.  We don't mind paying the $5 penalty fee.  Charge us the extra $5, but you can't force us to finish our plates.  Rude."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant.  I went with a large group of people. We were told before we sat down that we could only use 3 credit cards for the entire table of 27 people.  Since each of us are pay for your own, it was a hassle to scramble and find cash. In 2018...wake up Gen Korean, you are  running a business...credit cards are in!   Management worked it out, so we state down to eat.  I was unaware that this was an ALL YOU can eat in 2 hours place.  $ 25 per person with very little explanation on what to order or what the side dishes were.  The entire meal seemed very rushed. We were done in an hour. When it came time to pay the bill, the wait staff picked up our money/ credit cards and we proceeded to WAIT for 40 minutes before the wait staff could make change or process credit cards.  They must have dial up because it took so long and they were immensely unorganized.  DO NOT come here as a large group. DO NOT pay with credit card. Taste of food was just OK.  As for me...I'M DONE!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on Sunday 11/05 and had a horrible experience! We had never been to Korean BBQ and thought it would be fun. From the beginning to the end, it was a terrible experience!   When we walked in we were informed it would be about a 20 minute wait so we asked if we could head to the bar, which we did. We had a difficult time choosing a drink because they were out of everything we wanted! They didn't have Kirin and the only local beer was Four Peaks Kiltlifter. We asked for their featured drink (something Martinez) and the bartender informed us they have never been able to make it and he didn't know why it was on the menu. The condition of the bar was atrocious as well. Boxes of beer stacked in plain view in the bar, most of them damaged because of a wet floor. Dirty glasses and coffee cups on the bar. AND the liquours all had saran wrap around the spouts, implying they have an issue with fruit flies. We decided to continue with the lunch because we know they are new and we wanted to try it and give them the benefit of the doubt.  After about five minutes, we received a text notification that the table was ready. We grab our drinks and walk to the front, where the hostess politely informs us the table isn't actually ready. So we walk back to the bar, drinks still in our hands and sit down again. The hostess is there almost instantly to say our table is ready. A lot of back and forth for nothing; they need to get organized!  We sit down and tell our waitress (when she asks) it's our first time. We were informed we had to order the dinner menu (at dinner price) and that any left over food would constitute an additional $5/plate upcharge!!!! She also told us we could only order 4 items at a time. All of this information is important, but we still didn't know how to eat a Korean BBQ and we received NO instruction! We asked a couple other people who worked there, and they all seemed clueless and unable to provide instruction. The food was amazing. The marinades and meats were amazing; if you love meat, you need to try Korean BBQ (just not here!) No one explained the sides or how to compliment the meats with them, so we felt like we missed out on the full experience. We also received no instruction on how long to cook the meats or seafood which seemed odd.  Lastly, the worst experience of them all came when we paid. For two of us, it was a $75 tab. My friend put down half in cash, I was paying the other half on my card. Suddenly, my card was charged $190!!!!!! After finally flagging someone down after a good 5 minutes to say I wanted to talk to someone about the charge, the waitress comes over to confirm that my card was mischarged, the manager was fixing it and that she would be by in a minute. She still did not come by after several minutes so I went to her at the front cash register. She had several receipts and it was very obvious there was confusion on how to fix the error. She did not speak to me at all, she let her hostess at her side do the talking. The hostess said they had credited my card $190-$38 which was approximately $152 and then they handed me $38 cash and were about to swipe my card for the entire tab of $75!!!! At this point, I said no way and took my card back and said they shouldn't have handed me the $38 cash and that it was theirs to cover my bill. Now, they said I owed them an additional $3 (I'm not sure how and I should have asked at the time) but I was so unwilling to hand my card back, that my friend dug in her purse for the money. At this point, I was frank with them and said that I thought it was BS that they charged my card incorrectly, did a poor job fixing it and then were being petty over the $3!!!!! She didn't apologize, she didn't say I was right, she didn't backtrack on the request. Her manager never looked at me or spoke to me or apologized. No one tried to fix this!!!!!! We walked away very upset.  I called my bank yesterday when I didn't see any changes in the charge. My bank confirmed that at the very least, they should see some activity on their end of a debit/credit and there was none so I had to dispute the charge to make sure I get my money back.  If you decide to go, you'll have a wonderful meal but hopefully you'll know how to cook it and get the full benefit of the meal and cooking. Take cash!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time to visit and dine for my brothers bday and it was pretty solid.  The menu is basically a selection of different cuts of meat that you can get your grub down on its pretty straight forward.  If you're a picky eater you should go travel the world more because this place offers some items that could upset your sensitive palate hahaha!!!!  The server was on point but an introduction to the items along with the process could've been helpful but we gunned forward to just eat and enjoy.  We went on a Wednesday night and it was FREAKING PACKED.  The music plus the capacity of the restaurant made it seem loud but it was energetic and worth the experience.  You are charged for food you don't eat but for $25 all you can eat, just bring your appetite and be ready to leave full!a"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Korean BBQ I've had since moving to Las Vegas. Coming from Southern California, i grew up spoiled with cheap but great quality all you can eat Korean bbq. For the past 8 years, I've been looking for a similar experience here on Vegas. Well, Gen Korean BBQ is definitely the place. First of all, the price of 19.99 for dinner is a steal for the quality of food. They have a wide range of meat/chicken/seafood selection. The brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly are all on point. The different seasonings for their pork belly were all excellent. Their side dishes and appetizers were all really good as well. My fiancé and friend especially loved the rice cake. The salad is good, and they have rice paper!! That was a huge selling point for me. I got to have rice paper with my Korean BBQ. Bean paste was also great.  The service their was excellent. We were told the wait was 30-45 minutes, and was seated at about 41 minutes into our wait. Side dishes were already waiting for us when we sat down. We got our orders taken within 5 minutes, and even before we were finishing our first order, they were already bringing out our meat! Throughout our dining experience, the servers were quick to refill our drinks, take our orders, and brought our food within 2 minutes of ordering. We asked for a ton of rice paper and salad, and each time they were quick and accommodating. I cannot rave anymore about the great service we got.  I do wish there was a location closer to the southwest area, as the drive out to Henderson took about 30 minutes. But it is completely worth it. The wait looks like can be pretty long, as we did hear some people being quoted up to 90 minute wait time for seating. But in my opinion, if you can make the drive and wait, then you will be rewarded!  This is the Korean BBQ I've been looking for in Las Vegas. 5 stars Gen. 5 stars.   Right up there with oyster bar palace station, soho sushi, and tbones steakhouse."}
{"text":"Good place to get KBBQ, if not for anything but the price.  $20 a head for all you can eat KBBQ is not bad at all. The restaurant is large, tons of seating, and clean. The grills suck the smoke through the sides, so you don't get so much in your clothes.   Another plus for me is their appetizers. I love the deep fried squid legs and the KFC (Korean fried chicken). The place gets really busy, so don't be afraid to place a large order at the start, since more than likely you'll only get checked on a few times. If I go in a group of 5, I'll start out with an order of 5 or 6 of everything (brisket, pork belly, beef tongue, etc.), then add on more later as needed. In terms of dessert, they offer those macaron ice cream sandwiches.   All in all, not a bad deal, just try to be prepared for your order."}
{"text":"What a good place to have dinner with your family and friends. A little bit pricey but it's worth it! A lot of food and lychee soju is one of the best here. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with fast service. We got there a few minutes before it opened so just a short line. We had several dishes both for the grill and for the table. Korean fried chicken and cheesy pork cutlet are to die for. I also like that they changed the grill quick and often."}
{"text":"We have a Gen in California but we stopped going because it was darn hot In there . This one is no different . I guess they don't believe in their guests being comfortable so we left . This seems to be a constant problem here according to other reviews but I had to see for myself . Bye bye gen we are going to another kbbq spot."}
{"text":"Mina was an excellent server, he was really nice and made sure that we were take care of throughout our experience there. We had plenty of food to eat and we received everything that we ordered. I thought that this experience was a very positive one and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to so many ayce Korean bbq's and this has to be the best value for your buck. $20 for dinner gets you unlimited appetizers and meat to choose from. What place does that? None. They need to open another location in the southwest area of Las Vegas please.   I can order their KFC chicken and japchae appetizers all day. Along with the pork belly, beef tongue, beef brisket and spicy pork bulgolgi.  I also love how there is no overhead exhaust fan and instead inside the table so you don't leave smelling like crap all day."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! A delicious Kbbq spot in Las Vegas! I mean if you're a Cali person (like myself) then you know what good quality beef at a Korean bbq restaurant tastes like. I've eaten at other Kbbq joints in Vegas and this is NOTHING like those average places. Gen Korean BBQ House has premium quality beef and meat! Did I mention, it's all YOU can eat for a great price! The service is on point. Everyone from servers, to bussers, to the meat delivery staff, and the hostess are all so friendly. I will admit when my husband and I first walked into this place, it was super busy the hostess told us there was an hour wait. We were pretty bummed out by the wait but we decided to stay because this location is kinda far from our house since it is located in Henderson. Aside from the wait time, the food was  scrumdiddlyumptious! We came for dinner which is only $20 for all you can eat Korean BBQ PLUS all you can eat appetizers. How great is that? Such a good deal & so much food for a great price. I'm super stuffed! Our server, Yuhao aka Howard, was a friendly young gentleman. He was helpful, answered all questions, even noticed when our drinks & rice needed a refill! I'm very pleased with such great staff members for a premium Korean BBQ location. We will definitely be back and this will be our go to spot now that we live in Vegas! We didn't eat kbbq for about a year since we moved here and now that'll all change :)   Dishes I recommend were: Beef brisket Beef bulgogi Marinated premium steak  Dishes we ordered were : All the recommended ones && Spicy chicken Cajun shrimp  (Those ones weren't as delicious & shrimp takes too long to peel off when you just want to stuff your face!)  Appetizers we ordered Fried Gyoza Popcorn shrimp (delicious!!)"}
{"text":"I can never go to another Korean BBQ anymore because of this place. Why? For the simple fact that it looks much fancier and much cleaner than literally any other Korean BBQ in Vegas. All the other ones give me memories of flies and dirty tables. This one does not. Their alcoholic drinks are nice, had me all giggly.  I do hate how fries are on their menu and every time I've gone there they have not had it. Also, NO dessert...what? Nothing at all? Another thing I did not like was how service each time has been all over the place, with people taking orders and then forgetting food. This happened each of the 5 times I have been there. But, as I mentioned before, this is the cleanest and nicest looking Korean BBQ you will find here, so I'm torn."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. They had so many little delicious extras that make the meal amazing!"}
{"text":"Recently moved in to Vegas and ate at the restaurant for my birthday. The servers were amazing especially Ozzy! He definitely showed the most hospitality and always helped us with whatever we needed. Can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"I really liked this. I just wish they had another option other than all you can eat for $25. because us ladies can't get our moneys worth. The big football dudes at the next table did. They win, us ladies lose. But really, everyone wins because the food is great. One word of advice, watch out for exploding octopus, blinded us all."}
{"text":"This place has all the right set up and menu items along with great customer service. However, the quality is subpar from the rest: Magal, Hobak,Tofu Hut. Their signature steak was tough and their sides were dry and lacking juice. It was poor in quality, but great in quantity."}
{"text":"Soooo happpy to finallly have a cheap and good korean bbq spot here in Arizona! I came in on a Friday after noon around 2:30pm and got sat right away. The service was prompt and attentive! Ly was our server and he did a great job! Loved it and will definitely be back soon! 15.99$ for lunch and 24.99$ for dinner with over 30 choices!"}
{"text":"Very cool hang out place with friends or family. The food is good, but could be better if the meat was fresh and not frozen, but for only $25 dollars all you can eat, it is a good deal. Overall, it's very nice and clean place to just eat and hang out."}
{"text":"It has nice, fancy interior like bar. also it was so cheap to eat plenty of korean bbq. I enjoy it :)"}
{"text":"I didn't think I was going to like this place because it involves me having to cook and it takes away from me getting pampered.  It was quite the contrary.  It was FUN, you get involved with your partner and the  food is so good!!!  You can cook meat or shrimp or squid!!!! We now frequent this place at least once every two weeks. The Five star is not solely about the food, but the great service we always receive.  Thank you so much for giving us a great experience every time we've been there."}
{"text":"We also decided to give this place a try even after seeing some of the reviews. We were seated way faster than the wait time they gave us. They took our order quickly and brought everything out pretty fast too. The food was good, but not amazing. The fact that it's all you can eat makes it a good reason to come back. My favorite was the boneless galbi. Most of the meats were tender, but they lacked a little flavor...maybe some more seasonings like sesame seed oil and sesame seeds would help and a sweeter more flavorful Korean BBQ sauce. There were several different waiters coming by our table making sure we didn't need anything, but we did have to ask a couple of times for a fork and to get more spicy cucumbers...but that might have been because of the number of people that were tending to us. Our main server, Kevin, was awesome!!! He made suggestions and had pretty good knowledge of everything on the menu. He was super polite and friendly too. If there was something he didn't know, he quickly went and found out.  The atmosphere was good, even though they had people working on the bar and by the door. They had music playing, but not too loud, and when happy hour started, they all cheered and yelled out, \"It's happy hour!!!!\"  All in all, it was a good experience. My friends and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I been most of Gen Korean BBQ from California and I was so happy that they open near the strip in Las Vegas. They are at this huge mall front of Sunset Station Casino.   I think their decor is so far, as best as you can get as a Kbbq restaurant. Probably they are more comparable to main restaurant located in the heart of strip, one those inside high end casinos.  Also, their have same great tasty food as their sister stores in California.  This is bargain, there no place you can even compare in Nevada. Also, this place has some of fancy appetizers that are not included in California location.  So good. One more, this is not your average Asian Theme restaurant. This places matches with American Standards."}
{"text":"I love Gen! It is a great date night or night out with friends. Food is great for the price you are paying ($15.99 Lunch/20.99 Dinner). So thankful for finding this place. Clean restaurant, good location, and mostly nice servers! We had Alan tonight and he was great. Super helpful and attentive! The hubby and I come here at least once to twice a month!"}
{"text":"I know it's just opening but there was a bolt in my vegetables. Of course I sent it back, they apologized, they forgot to bring the vegetable dish back. Generally speaking management sends out a little im sorry dish or takes something off of your bill but instead the kid just dropped the bill, winked at my wife and said he had to clock out.   I'll try again in a few months, I guess."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, seated immediately, fast service, drinks were priced nicely and the server was knowledgeable and friendly. The AYCE is priced reasonably as well and you can leave leftovers. The atmosphere is also super cool, I'd go again!"}
{"text":"There is a long wait here since it just open. Food is self cook and it's really good if you don't mind waiting and cooking. The service is good, as the servers around often to ask if you need anything. I like how they have people walking around changing your grill often cause then you won't have burnt food. The atmosphere is great for a group of friends and a chill night out. Lunch specials are amazing, it's about 15.99 all you can eat but you do have to finish all your meat or else you'll be charged $5 for left overs."}
{"text":"This is my favorite korean bbq of all time! They set a fairly good price for an all you can eat and have a big variety to choose from. Every time I go, I'm always trying something new. Definitely top 5 ratings!"}
{"text":"Out of all the KBBQ places, I was most surprised by this place.  I've been to Honey Pig, DJK, Sura, Mothers, Tofu, the list goes on.  I felt that this was my favorite sport for the speed and the price.  I'd recommend trying it out"}
{"text":"The food was great.  Fantastic fresh high quality ingredients.  But if you're looking for an authentic Korean experience this isn't it.  If you are a fan of pan chans(Korean side dishes). This isn't your place.  A great Korean restaurant is a smorgasbord of delightful side dishes so plentiful there is no room on the table for your entree... Here you get 4... You're also cooking yourself.  Which is great if you have experience cooking Korean food, if you don't... This Isn't for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I have experienced many Korean restaurants which have truly lacked quality - but Gen came highly recommended so we figured we'd give them a shot.....  IT WAS GREAT!!  and AYCE (all you can eat!); only downside is the weekend is dinner prices all day (still reasonable!)  #1 - HUGE restaurant! with a super great vibe and well decorated :)  #2 - Amazing venting system - nothing is worse than getting smoked out at a Korean BBQ, leaving stinking like it - so impressed by the tables and how the venting was integrated into the grill #3 - The meats were fresh and flavorful! ...and if memory serves there were like over 30+ choices! Our fav was the Pork Bulgogi!!! #4 - Service was very attentive; and this was a first - they changed out our grill top so we didn't have to cook on a charred grill halfway through :)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Korean BBQ out here in Nevada so far! 1. Great variety of selection. 2. There are sauces and taste on the variety of food!!!!  Hard to find. 3. Service is great, I love the staff there what a difference in treatment compared to Las Vegas. When it first opened, it was so busy I could not get in until an hour or two later.   Waiters and waitresses are very attentive to your requests, if they have it they will get it to you asap. Drinks are average price, it's understandable-they run out of special cocktails sometimes.  The decor is sleek and modern, the audience is very diverse. I would give it five if they start developing a customer's promotion system, give me a free meal for how many meals I already had at the place.  Fresh, modern, and tasty!"}
{"text":"The waitress Jaenica was really nice and helpful~! The food was delicious and the meat had big proportion."}
{"text":"This is me and my boyfriend's FAVORITE dinner spot. It's so fun that you can cook your own food right there at the table! It's all you can eat for 2 hours and there are so many different meats to choose from. Not only that, but you get bottomless white rice and salad and traditional korean sides included in the meal. The food itself is so good! I find myself craving it all the time! If you're looking for a different dinner experience, I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Goodbye Spring Mountain. Gen in Henderson is where I'm going for my Korean BBQ fix from now on.  Yeah sure, parking in the Galleria Mall Parking lot kills the authentic feeling other BBQ joints in China Town have (Yes, it's in the mall BUT it has an outdoor entrance so don't worry, shopping addicts) but you'll feel better once inside. The inside is designed to look sort of like a club, slightly obnoxiously loud pop music with a giant projector showing music videos in the background. I read a study once that eating with fast paced music makes you eat more. That was definitely the case at Gen today.... Or maybe it was that the food was too good.   $14.99 for lunch, $19.99 for dinner. (Dinner price all day on the weekends!) The dinner menu includes a couple of extra plates, many are the same meats, but have the word \"premium\" in front. Lunch for me it is.   Gen Chadol: Aka Brisket. Aka MY FAVORITE. Thinly sliced meat with a bit of visible fat, but none of that chewiness everyone hates.  Beef Tongue: Small portion, very similar to the brisket, less fat than brisket.  Bulgogi: Chewy, flavorful, chunks of meat with some onions. I don't need to explain it, it's a must for every trip to Korean BBQ.  Smoked Garlic Pork Belly: We opted to order the garlic version rather than the plain pork belly, simply because it had a \"Chef recommended\" stamp next to it. It didn't have much of a garlic taste. It was basically thick slices of bacon. A little dry.  Cajun Shrimp: Yes, yes, yes. Small portion! Peeling the shrimps a hassle, but totally worth it.  Japchae: A little too oily and gooey for my liking. It did not have any meat or much of anything, but noodles. Skip it and save room for the meat.   They have the usual small plate appetizers ready to eat on the table. Kimchi, cucumbers, pickled onion and mashed potato? Whatever, it was good.  Rice is included if you ask for it."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim and we are glad we did. We had the lunch and we tried the #1 steak, shrimp, brisket and the beef bulgogi. We also had the mushrooms and vegtables. Great experience and the severs were on top of things. I couldn't remember all of their names except Seong. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Finally...Gen is open in Las Vegas!   Gen is one of my go to places when I'm in SoCal and I am so excited about it being in my hometown!   The low down dinner is 19.95 for 32 items and appetizers?! Sign me up. The quality of the food is amazing. There are so many kbbq places in town, but I've officially decided this is hands down my favorite.   The only downfall is the long wait to be seated, but I expected that on weekend and around dinner time it was about an hour and a half. There was some miscommunication between some servers and our party, but in the end Christina turned it around.   All in all we had a great meal. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Eugene is the man! The guy can read our minds before we can even order. Highly recommend this place! The spicy pork bulgogi is our go-to! If you're daring, try the octopus and/or the tongue!"}
{"text":"I tried Gen for the first time today and I had an amazing experience! Alodia was my server and she did an outstanding job!  her service was excellent and she is very kind and friendly. I'll definitely be back and hope to have her as my server again"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent and the service is what gets the 5 stars. Try the spicy pork belly"}
{"text":"We came in to enjoy it sad to say their customer service is very poor! They should have better ways to accommodate their customers. It's not because there's only two of you, they can't sit you cause their booths are for large number of guests. The food is not also good."}
{"text":"Been here twice now great food best Korean bbq in Vegas in my humble option service was great the first time second time it was horrible I will still go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Ozzy over trump for president! Every Gen needs an Ozzy now! Why is he not management yet? If Ozzy was coaching the Seahawks they would have different results today... If every store had an Ozzy I would walk in and automatically throw them money... A side from Ozzy being Awesome the food was pretty good!!! The choices of pork belly was the best part. #Ozzyforpresident2016 #mangoyogurtsoju #iheartporkbelly"}
{"text":"Although, they have the best japchae I ever tasted, this place doesn't deserve all the praises what so ever.   First things first.... The service is horrible! All the staff were young and have no idea what they're doing! All they're good at is walking around. Walking like they're all models for us to watch. They did not tend to any of our needs, it took multiple waves for us to be noticed. Honestly, we only saw one person who was actually doing work and that's the guy who delivered the meat. The restaurant looked pretty overstaffed, maybe they need to focus on hiring people with experience first then I'll go ahead and give it one more shot."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite All you can eat Korean BBQ restaurant,Every meat has  high quality and we got awesome service from Jessica.Ill be back."}
{"text":"May the all you can eat Korean BBQ be ever in your favor. This place is reasonably priced, cheaper on weekday-lunch prices, & on the weekends it is dinner price all day. Soju is great, appetizers are a nice touch & the BBQ is good as well. For any pollo-pescatarians out there, the chicken and grillable seafood is good as well. I highly recommend the Cajun shrimp! They only give 4 per order so order lots!"}
{"text":"Good quality Korean BBQ that is Americanized. For $19.95 a person for dinner, can't argue with that!!!  Service is a little slow but still worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The food was better than K town in LA. We got 3 kinds of red meat and they were all delicious and lean. Also the service was great. Alodia was our server. She was so sweet and helped us order as it was our first time. Definitely coming back here anytime I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"TAMARA was awesome this evening! She was very good at explaining the menu to us and was able to answer questions. It was the first time here for my fiancé and I after many recommendations from friends. Very clean and classy atmosphere. I really liked the cool blue lighting throughout the place. The large array of options on the AYCE menu makes this place a great location for fair-priced Korean BBQ. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Korean bbq in Las Vegas now!!! This is the better location versus the one in Henderson. For a new restaurant to have such amazing service the first couple weeks being open is rare! Quality of meats are amazing too, Our family's favorite is Kalbi and red wine pork belly! Looking forward to bringing more friends to this spot!"}
{"text":"I have to give a 4 star only because it was so miserably hot inside the restaurant. The food was amazing, service was average but it's hotter inside the restaurant than outside which makes you feel awful while eating . My party of and I were all sweating like crazy asking our server to turn up the air, but there was no change in the environment. I guess go in the evening when it's dark out since you get any air during the day."}
{"text":"First time at a Korean BBQ place. Went with a couple of friends. We ordered most of the chicken dishes as well as the shrimp and pork belly. Also ordered a flavored Soju pitcher. Most of the chicken dishes were well marinated and very flavorful. However, the \"volcano\" chicken which was supposed to be really spicy was borderline sweet! In fact?, it tasted suspiciously? similar to the Korean Fried chicken, with minimal chili? flakes sprinkled on.  My other complaint was that the waiters didn't really help us out with the food - even though we made it clear that this was our first time having Korean BBQ. We later figured out that we're supposed to use the scissors to cut the bigger portions of meat - would have been so much easier if someone told us that!"}
{"text":"I had great time here with my girls. I like their pork belly, steak, bulgogi and Jap Chae. But the service was kinda slow because the restaurant was crowded."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Blake our server was extremely attentive and made our experience totally enjoyable.  Great place for date night or time with friends.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. About $20 dollars a plate,  but it's all you can eat, so come ready to eat your heart out. Great flavors awesome for a group date or double date. You're not going to get an amazing experience from the staff, they are more of just runners to bring you your uncooked meet. It will be the people you bring to eat with that will make the night amazing. Order all the different meats you want and they bring them to you. They crank up the grill at your table and you cook it your self. It's way fun and again... ALL YOU CAN EAT LOL"}
{"text":"Excited to try out this popular LA chain that's finally migrated to my home in Las Vegas, the impressive interior attempts to portray a higher quality establishment but fails with mediocre quality of meat.   Came here with a friend on a decently busy Wednesday night and was impressed with the decor of the restaurant. Typically kbbq places are pretty plain with poor ventilation and leaves one suffocating in smoke, and clothes soaked in kbbq sweat; however, gen knows this and did a great job at it.   Service: Friendly greeting by the hostess, attentive staff, and overall a pretty pleasant experience with the employees. Meat came out quicker than expected.  Apps: I wanted to save my room for the meat and only got the K.F.C. which are boneless yangyum style chicken thats marinated in a more tangy/sweet than spicy sauce. Like a much crispier orange chicken that was very good  Meat: We got the sirloin, brisket, tongue, pork belly, pork belly garilc, and galbi. All of which was pretty disappointing. The brisket lacked a good amount of fat that resulted in dry meat within 20 seconds of grilling, the galbi's marinade was a bit weak and didn't have the sweet goodness i'm used to enjoying. The pork belly garlic was very salty....  Bill: They do the tablet checkout method when it came to paying with a card (no discover accepted) but what i didn't like was the manager holding the tablet and watching me leave a tip which made me uncomfortable. I felt an unnecessary pressure for something I should be comfortable about doing.  Overall: Las Vegas lacks good kbbq and this one is no exception. I'd come back if i'm deeply craving it but otherwise wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"If you don't know much about Korean food then this is the place for you! They don't have a lot of traditional dishes on their menu so that kind of stinks. They need to add poricha (unsure of English sp/translation) but it's basically corn & barley water.  The food is decent too. I enjoy it. The only thing though is their wait staff do not \"mother hen\" you like in traditional Korean restaurants, so you have to basically do your own cooking. Which is fine but sometimes it's nice not to. Also, if you do not happen to know how to cook a certain dish, say squid for example, & you ask your server, they usually respond with, \"oh I don't know\". If you like traditional Korean BBQ, don't go here, go elsewhere. Unless you're just desperate for kimch like I am often!"}
{"text":"First time here for a school field trip and the food was amazing! Servers could have a been a little more efficient with getting orders out but it was great overall. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was great as always and offers the best appetizers for a KBBQ place. Our server Luke was amazing, fast, and extremely attentive. He came exactly when we needed refills and never had us waiting to order more. Such a great vibe for a lunch with family! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is the by far the best Korean BBQ I've been to. Came here with the boys after a squat day and ah man was this place good for my gains. Nice atmosphere, awesome service provided by Kailin, and on top of that, great food to fuel these muscles with my brahs."}
{"text":"One of my favorite  places!  The food is great and a it's a lot of fun.  It's the place my granddaughter and I sneak off too whenever we get a chance. She loves cooking her own food and ordering whatever she wants.  She always finishes with the Mango macaron!  I always ask for chili sauce, garlic and such to season my food with as it cooks.  Just ask. :)  The beef bugogi is the best, in our opinions, but I also love the chicken with garlic (comes with cheese sauce on the side.... just try it - trust me!)  The KFC is great and granddaughter adores the crispy rice rolls.   My favorite thing is the japchae - our waiter - who we always ask  for - brings it over to our  table as soon as he sees us!  lol!  Highly recommend...  ask to be seated at one of Terry's tables!   Oh.. did I mention it's AYCE?  Reasonable, too!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the fam I was glad to see that they finally opened up one here in Vegas, as I'm accustomed to the one in SoCal. Food is good, service is good. I'd say the service exceeded our expectations, but after the 9th time of different servers always checking up on us & asking if everything's ok gets kinda annoying especially when your trying to enjoy your food. The only thing I had a problem with was the way their checkout system works, they do it on a tablet which relies on wifi signal for credit/debit card transactions. So if your card doesn't go through once they'll do it again. My card was charged twice, but hopefully that'll clear up. Overall good place & atmosphere, being that they're relatively new in town they can make some tweaks."}
{"text":"I like coming here between lunch and dinner to avoid the wait. The quality of meat here is consistently good but the ban-chan side dishes are kind of a joke.. I'm not Korean but if you brought a Korean person here I bet they would say the same. The service is great, they have one server to take your orders and an army of other people to march over to your table with the meats  you never have to wait long to get your raw meats.   I wish they had just a little bit more selection on the meats (I heard the Cali locations have more?) but otherwise the service is great. Their building had some issues with AC when it was 100+ outside but hopefully it's fixed.  I also appreciate the ventilation that's built in to the table. It's quiet and does a good job. You don't go home smelling like what you ate like in some other places.  If you need a quick Korean bbq fix and service with a smile, this is the place for it. I would just push the side dishes aside."}
{"text":"My party of five came in on Monday evening after work. The host informed us that we would not be able to be seated until all members arrived. At first I was annoyed but when she informed us there was a two hour time limit at the table and they wanted to ensure we got the most out of our time it changed my tune! They had an expansive list of options and explained the procedure of ordering raw/prepared food. There were some rules in regard to how many can be ordered at one time and they strongly discouraged wasting food (or there will be a fee). We had a blast, customer service was great, and the food was delicious. I'm going to be sure to come again!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner ended up having food coma so this review is late. LOL Okay, I just wanna let you guys know that I've been coming here since 'd 1st month they opened but just decided to give a review now because of 'd great service we got from this upbeat caring server girl named Alodia! That's what 'd five star is for. Being in 'd food industry myself, I know what I needed from my server so I can completely enjoy my time 'nd food. She had to take care of a group (9ppol) 'nd she didnt just left us there hanging but took 'd time to let us know ahead of time that she might take a minute to check up on us again if we needed more food.   Well about 'd AYCE KBBQ, $20.95 for dinner is worth it. I give it 4 stars based on the number of meats 'nd seafood you can choose from including the appetizers. 'd 5th star is probably lacking on flavor comparing to all other kbbq I have tried. But all 'nd all it's not bad. The ambiance of the place is great too. Try it!"}
{"text":"This is a place to go if you want cheap. The meat quality was not good. The Tofu soup was lukewarm and flavorless.  The service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The beef bulgogi and the premium steak were my favorite. I loved all of the sides and appetizers. Highly recommend! Great place to go with a group or on a date. My server, Alodia, was especially great and made really good recommendations for food."}
{"text":"Blake was an awesome server, very attentive and quick.  We really enjoyed our dinner and feel it is the best ayce Korean Bbq in Las Vegas/Henderson."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. The food is pretty good and decently priced compared to other Korean BBQ places. The service has been the highlight of my visits here so far, Seong has helped take care of the group i have been with both times and each time he has been on top of making sure we have everything we need."}
{"text":"It is nice to have another attempt at Korean BBQ to try in the valley.  The food was above average.  Service really lacks.  We tried bulgogi which was good.  The panchan department suffers as well--only 5 side dishes that come out but great flavor."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great, but the service is impeccable! If your lucky enough to get Alodia as your server she will not disappoint! She is attentive, polite and super friendly!"}
{"text":"I think I been here like 3948838457 times already. This place is my favorite ayce. I turn into a pig when I'm here. The servers are excellent here. They're friendly and fast. Food is delicious. Everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"Though it's not a Korean restaurant per say, it is a great place to get good Korean food. It is an all you can eat, Korean Grill basically...that for the price, is a great deal. If your looking for more than grilled meat, this is not your place... The brisket, fast cooking slices of beef is great, especially if you eat it with the salad like Ssam. The bulgogi is tasty, but you need to order multiple orders, as the portions seemed too small for 2 to share. The spicy pork, again was tasty, as was the Dakgogi (chicken).  The banchan is only kimchi, oi kimchi(cucumber), radish & mashed potato(??? Must be for folks who dont usually eat korean)  They do have some beer & wine. The iced green tea is very good.  To end it all, the macaron ice cream is very good."}
{"text":"First time here, Julian was awesome and so was the food! Ayce was a very good variety! Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE KBBQ SPOT!! I always go here for AYCE KBBQ because of the many options to choose from and what makes it even better is all you can eat apps! My boyfriend and I went this evening and sat at the bar. We had an awesome experience, especially because of the bartender, Blake. He was working the bar alone but still managed to keep us happy and stayed on top of everything. He also recommended different meat options that we would enjoy and yes we did! Thank you for everything Blake!"}
{"text":"I went to gen with friends on my bday. Ozzy was our server and he was fantastic. He helped us with questions and suggested many great entrees"}
{"text":"Kailin and Terry were great servers. They service is pretty quick and efficient if you know what you want. There's about 15-ish different meats you can choose from, and my favorites were the garlic pork belly and the beef tongue. All the meats come out pretty quick, so you don't end up sitting there for ages before you get to eat. Like other Korean BBQ places, there are the side dishes, but the side dish selection isn't as large as other places. Side dishes aren't too important to me as the actual meat selection, so i'm not too broken up about it.  We had a 15 person party for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night, and the only thing that's important when having a large party here is that they do not take reservations. Because of this, try to all be there on time so you can get seated as it can get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Gen is a great BBQ restaurant! I went there with my friends, and all of them does like Gen's food and  service, especially a waitress whose name is Kailin! She did an excellent job that was  attentive with us, and provided quality service that exceed our expectation! She just came up with an unforgettable night for us! I love Gen, and say thank you to Kailin!"}
{"text":"Had to update my review for couple reasons. 1- had a text that said my table was ready. Went up and the girl said it would be a minute till we get seated. Ok fine. Waited another 10mins while I see people that checked in after me got seated. Ok what's wrong with this picture? I went up again to ask the hostess if our table and she said yeah your table is being cleaned. I looked around and saw no one cleaning a table besides the fact that I saw at least 2-3 tables opened and already cleaned. Again I told the girl well u said that 10mins ago that it'll be a min till we get seated. after I said that THEN that's when all of a sudden our table was ready. Weird.  2- they discontinued the fried squid legs and agedashi tofu. Those were my favorite appetizers (well me and the rest of my party)!Minus a star for that as well. Why did they delete those two items? Please bring them back otherwise they'll for sure lose a loyal customer. Now that only brings 4things for their appetizer and their \"seasonal\" ones that they never seem to have because I've been coming here at least once a month and they never seem to always have them.   Other than that shoutout to JAENICA for the awesome service. She was killing it last night in her section. Always checking up on her table and refilling drinks promptly. She is definitely an asset to Gen with her Great service."}
{"text":"Finally good KBBQ in AZ! The food, price and service is worth it! I prefer coming here on the weekdays for lunch, not as crazy busy as their Cali locations."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this was a new experience for us and we should have done our homework first.    That being said, our server seemed nervous and had difficulty answering our questions about the seasonings, how to cook the food and what combinations were common.  The premium steak was good, but the flank steak was disappointing. We did try a few of the seafood items, which were fresh.  The restaurant ambiance is nice, but the romance dips every time a new guest arrives and is loudly greeted with welcome to Gen.  For us the cost didn't meet our dining experience."}
{"text":"This place was really good and fun! It was a new experience and all the food was very good. I would have given 5 stars but the service was very slow. Our waitress showed up maybe twice and we had to keep tracking different staff members down to have our necessities met. By necessities I mean straws, napkins, refills, and even placing new orders."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and our server was very good always tending to what ever we needed and not once had to ask for refill. Kids loved it along with their deserts. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"First time trying the Korean BBQ concept, great experience! This place was packed, yet the wait time was short, and the service timely and very friendly. There's a large selection of meats and cuts to choose from, and it's all you can eat for 2 hours. I didn't retain the names, but you'll find beef, pork, chicken and seafood. Some are marinated in delicious and variably spicy sauces. Grilling your own food on the table is fun and entertaining, although there is a risk to overdo some cuts like I did! I left with the firm intention to return."}
{"text":"Food was great for the price! I mean \"All you can eat meat\" , for less than most all you can eat sushi. Our Waitress Jessica was very attentive and was there for all our questions and wants. Definitely a thumbs up on this place! Oh yeah and the ice cream macarons are the bomb don't forget to get some for desert!"}
{"text":"Christina, sam and Lisa was helping us ! This place is the tofu hut killa ! I will come back here fur sure !"}
{"text":"Gen is doing their job in joining the AYCE scene on Sahara. They have a great selection of meat on their menu.  At a price of $22pp is not bad at all, my main gripe is how they charge the kids by height.  My daughter is tall, but skinny and eats like a bird.  So buyer remorse just hit reality, it's the same feeling you get after you buy a car.  Tons of rolled brisket is always a hit at my house.  Hawaiian steak was the winner as the kids kept fighting over the one slice of pineapple.  So we had to order two more Hawaiian steak to make everyone happy.  Gen Signature Galbi for this price NICE!  Must order the onions and mushrooms, garlic, jalepenoes, and bean paste.  Tons of banchan and the service was amazing as my cup was never emptied.  What's most impressive is how fast the food came.  No complaints whatsoever.  Not my top place for kbbq, but ranks top three when compared to AYCE kbbq joints in town."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a lively meal with friends and pricing is fine."}
{"text":"First time here a friend recommended. Everything was great at first all our orders were quick to our table no problems. Our first round of food was great and on time, then things went downhill from there. The kitchen ran out of rice server said it would be 20 minutes and we never got it while we were there. We never got our spicy calamari it was given to the wrong table. We ordered 4 more plates of steak since we thought it would come quick. We ended up waiting 15 minutes for our food. Our server finally came and she didn't know we never got our food, she sincerely apologized however the damage was done and we were very pissed off at this point. It was a shame this happened this was a nice place but after we seen some of the staff get off of work, order their food and receive it quickly without any problems we were soo done with this place.  We had to ask for our check from another server or manager since our server never came back to check on us. We got our check and the guy didn't even ask if everything was ok,  because clearly he knew we were upset. I would never come back and will not recommend this place. How do you run out of rice in an establishment like this is beyond me."}
{"text":"I literally just ate Gen with a group of six, paid, left to pick up another guest of five--they were hungry, so I figured what's better than AYCE k bbq. I let the hostess know beforehand that I wasn't eating because I literally just ate with them. They wouldn't accomodate us and stated they were still going to charge me for sitting with them. Wtf. I literally have a receipt from an hour ago, and staff even recognized me. Welp guess it's economical to lose a table of 5 than to believe someone is incredibly full but still brought support to their business. On to the next kbbq @Arirang, which they btw accomodated us perfectly fine and have more authentic Korean selections for my guests :) Left two stars simply because Tau was a cool server from earlier, otherwise y'all ain't getting no more than one. Smh @ management."}
{"text":"I've been there 4 times since their opening and I love it. The food in general is pretty darn good, sometimes the service gets a little slow but I haven't had any major complaints about it.  All in all, I'll probably be back but not until 2018, I think I've had my quota of Korean bbq for 2017.  Stay away from the fried pork cutlet. It's not awful but it tastes a lot like a thin piece of pork loin wrapped in a giant churro (but not as sweet), it's just weird."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Gen KBBQ in LA, so I was very excited for them in open in Las Vegas! Because they just opened, expect a very long wait, regardless of your party size. A table for two at 8pm on a Friday took 1.5 hours to get seated. Fortunately, they have a very innovative check-in system where they take your phone number and text you when you are almost ready to be seated, so you can walk around the connecting mall to kill time. They even have an app so you can monitor your place in line.   Dinner - $19.95/person - 32 items + about a dozen more items from the appetizer menu! Very good price (considering a lot of KBBQ AYCE joints are over $20), wide selection, and qualify food. I especially loved that the jap chae (glass noodle) is included because most places account it as a separate item outside of their AYCE menu.   Service is in progress. Our guy forgot simple needs like white rice and waters after being prompted twice, and I was sooo thirsty in between eating all the salty dishes. But I won't ding them on that because he seemed new, and I applaud him for keeping his composure amidst a very busy night! Things should pick up after some months.  Gen is definitely my go-to for KBBQ in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time here and I took my 7 year old niece for her birthday. The person explained how it worked so we chose 4 different proteins. We started cooking them two items were seasoned the other two were shaved meat no sauces or seasonings. She asked if we wanted salad or rice and she brought us white rice. I asked for soy sauce. I think the meats would be better it they had a sauce to dip and than cook or cook and then dip. I used soy sauce once the meat was cooked. I saw sauces at a table but was never offered and nothing on the menu. The shrimp and octopus was wonderful."}
{"text":"No complaints here! Loved my experience here. Very good food, great servers and beautiful interior"}
{"text":"Gen from outside the entrance looks like a really quiet restaurant. Yet as soon as you emerge through the front doors the fun environment, the colors of the lighting and the beats from the music just fill you up with this awesome vibe that is Gen. The decor of Gen is very modern yet has slight classy aesthetics of the Korean culture sprinkled through the layout. It's actually very eye catching once you come through the entrance. For the style alone I give Gen 5/5 stars.  Let's get down to the main part of the review here. The food, the comfort,  and our help/service.  Gen is all you can eat...and the pricing is actually very reasonable. $20 per person isn't bad at all! Especially if you have 34 choices of meats and items + any of the appetizers + all of the sides. All of that for just for $20! My wife and tried as much as we could. We started with appetizers: gyoza(fried), edamame, japchae, pickled veggies, potato salad, and a salad. -Only gripe was the edamame which was a little over cooked but didn't stop me from enjoying them. Everything else was delicious! Now the main part....MEAT! So many wonderful choices!  We ordered: Beef bugolgi, garlic chicken,garlic calamari,steak strips,pork cutlet,cajun shrimp, roast beef, bugogli chicken, and I know more just can't remember it all. Everything was freaking delicious! The portions were not too much nor too little. The plethora of flavors kept my dance buds dancing all night. Gens good easy get 4/5 stars  All this yummy food was accompanied by the awesome booth seating we asked for. The booth was comfortable, soft and supportive. The tables had a nice feel to them, like a mixture of vinyl and marble. The table was large enough for our multiple plates, our drinks, the sides and our entrees; with plenty of elbow room to spare. Oh and I almost forgot the cooking pan sits dead center of the table! So all in all the comfort level was indeed a 5/5 stars!  Now onto the icing on the cake , the service. Adolina was our main service of help for the night and she was awesome!  Really attentive and friendly. She made recommendations that were awesome! She always had our glasses full and prompt when making sure our cooking pan was replaced immediately when it started to have all the excess burnt food sizzling on it. It's easy to express that Adolina was just pure awesome sauce; friendly, fun, informative, and an all around suburb waitress. We will be back for her service and friendly smile along side the food!  Adolina services alone help give Gen a 5/5 stars.   So to sum it up for you yelp readers, Gen is fun, has great food, energetic atmosphere and has amazing service. Let Gen be your next Kbbq experience!"}
{"text":"Waiter was Julian ,  Service was good because we are demanding as a table of 4. We enjoy coming and Julian make it easier."}
{"text":"I love KBBQ and when I found out Gen was opening up in phoenix I about died I was so excited! I'm such a fatty I know, but Gen did not disappoint. The service was okay but it was no big deal because the vibes were still cool and the waiter was nice. My friends and I went on a Saturday at 5, waited only 45 minutes and when we got done (8pm) the wait was 2.5 hours. Sooo go early!  Anyways, I'm so excited Gen has finally opened! Definitely will be my go-to!"}
{"text":"This place is very good! Hubby and I wanted to try this since one of our kids said it was good. We have absolutely no regrets!  We will definitely be coming back very soon! Hubby said he sees a new addiction here!  Seong was our waiter and upon learning we had never been he made sure we understood how everything worked, and even offered up delicious choices to go with his amazing service! He was the kind of server you want to have everywhere you eat!  PS: I read that the rice cooker was broken yesterday, it is fixed!"}
{"text":"Great environment & atmosphere. Excellent customer service and the food is delicious!! I've been to the Honolulu location and I'm pretty amazed that they have several locations in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my first review, hearing about this place from recommendations I have to say I was pretty disappointed...  Cons:  The waiting list, it took 2hrs to get seated... The meat was mostly bland, I feel like if it was marinated it would have given more flavor and better taste  Pros: The server named Jessica actually gave great customer service and attended to making the first time experience somewhat bearable   Due to Gen being new and not being open that long I'm hoping the next visit is a better experience and things are different"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service. Plates are the perfect size so you can try a variety of dishes. Our server, Eugene, provided excellent guest service, had great menu knowledge, was extremely friendly. Will definitely be back again.  Kudos again to Eugene."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ AYCE in town! Quality meats! Other places are too pricey, long waits, too small and the meats are low quality (Chewy) This place is worth it. Friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"KBBQ at the Galleria Mall?!  I love the location!  It's easier to get to and you don't have to drive down the busy streets of Chinatown.  The service here is always hit or miss.  The first couples of times I've gone, service was a mess.  The burners would always go out because of the AC and we would have to be seated elsewhere after asking them to light the grill 5 times.  As of late, service has gotten a lot better!  Grills work well now and the food comes out in a timely manner.  They also offer rice paper now, but I'm still waiting for them to have steamed egg.  My favorites are beef tongue, pork belly, pork cheek, japchae,and their KFC.  They also bring out 4-5 different ban chan and salad that's unlimited.  If you're interested in dessert, they also offer ice cream macarons!"}
{"text":"I had great time here with my girls. I like their pork belly, steak, bulgogi and Jap Chae. But the service was kinda slow because the restaurant was crowded."}
{"text":"First time to Gen on a Friday night, party of 6. The restaurant was clean and the food delicious! Ozzie our server was super friendly and very helpful with picking out what cuts of meat to try. Our favorite was the #10 (forgot what type it was). The beef tongue was delicious as well. They split our bill easily between the 3 couples which is much appreciated. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"food and drinks were excellent!!! Went with a group of friends and were seated promptly. Great for groups."}
{"text":"I ate there last night with my family and i received THE WORST customer service skills in my life. Our waitress Criza was super rude. Any time we had a question for her you could tell she got irritated and responded with much sass. She was not welcoming nor did she make us feel comfortable eating there. We felt rushed and will not be returning. I am not the type of person to write a yelp review but we needed to make this known."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! My boyfriend and I went on a date last night and decided to try a new place. One of his friends recommended the place, and I'm so glad they did. We went around 8 o'clock without reservations and we were seated within minutes which was extremely nice. We loved the decor and how spacious the whole place was. We got seated into a booth which was very roomy, which I personally loved. All the food fit perfectly onto the table and we ordered a decent amount. The service was astounding! As soon as we got seated our server acknowledged us and told us he would be with us shortly. Even after he walked away someone else stepped right in to make sure we would get drinks quickly. Our server returned no later than 2 minutes and recommended some great meats to try. Our favorites were the Hawaiian pork belly, spicy baby octopus, and the garlic calamari. One of the biggest things for me when going out to eat is having the water glass continuously filled, and our server made sure that it was always filled and that it never reached the bottom. We were always checked up on, made sure our empty plates were taken away almost instantly, and always had the grill tops changed. This place was all around spectacular from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. This place is a definite favorite now and we will DEFINITELY be returning!"}
{"text":"The food is good  But sometimes I feel like some of the meat went bad because I can smell a sour scent to it   The wait staff is sometimes 50/50  You'll have fast service or slow service  Even if it isn't that busy   But this place is one of my favorite places to dine   And their iced green tea is the very satisfying"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and were greeted by a friendly staff member named Dominick. He sat us and gave us a warm welcome and then our server came over to give us the run down. It is AYCE for a 2 hour limit. It comes with sides and rice. The concept and interior is very modern and inviting. I saw so many people here celebrating graduations and holiday festivities so it definitely has a warm atmosphere! The quality of the food is good! I've been to other k bbq places here in the greater Phoenix area and I can definitely say this is in my top 3! The staff is very attentive with switching out the grills and clearing dirty plates and turning tables.  The only thing that bothered me was my friend had been here before and told me she enjoyed their salad, but it wasn't offered to us. We had to ask for it which is fine, but I wonder if we hadn't asked if we would have gotten it at all. Otherwise, well done! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This Gen smaller than the one in Torrance, CA. Portion sizes are smaller, however it's all you can eat in 2 hours so it's all good for $20/person.   Wasn't a fan of the squid -- tasted squidy aka very previously frozen. However, the Octopus was very yummy that my friend and I ordered it twice.   The venue doesn't really look like their geared for large groups of people, there are roughly about 8-10 table top for large groups, but it's best for solo or 4 people max if you want a shorter wait time.   Tip: the saucy dishes will take longer to cook b/c it coats  the grill, turn the grill on max when you first turn it on so you can get a good sear then lower as necessary :)  Bon Apetite"}
{"text":"With all the talk about Korean BBQ lately, this place what somewhat of an overpriced  let down. There were a few good things about this place. We were seated very quickly, and when our food order was taken, we got our meat quickly. The restraint in general was pretty cool. It was semi \"family style\" seating and semi private seating. There was also a large tv projection on the wall. However, the food was mediocre. Because we are cooking the food ourselves, I expected the food to be better spiced. In my opinion the only thing that wasn't bland was the edamame, which the customer doesn't cook. The cheese sauce from the garlic chicken tasted like Velveeta cheese. The service also sucked. We had to ask our grill to be changed out, ask for refills and they didn't ask if I wanted change for my bill until we asked them about it.  All in all, the quick service at the beginning of the night and the \"ambiance\" of the restaurant is the only thing giving them stars."}
{"text":"The best AYCE Kbbq in Arizona. Came here on the first day it opened. If you've never done AYCE kbbq, it's worth a try. It's similar to a Brazilian steakhouse, except you are brought raw meat that you grill yourself at the table.   For my experience this time specifically, the wait staff was still being trained and it was apparent, but overall the service was decent. If you've been to other Gen Kbbq places in California you can expect similar experiences here. They didn't have the traditional Korean Barley tea or Steamed Egg, not sure if it's just an opening night thing or permanent. Dessert and drinks are separate and not included in the price. For dinner it's $24.99/person which pretty standard for a place like this, however was expecting it to be a little cheaper since it's Arizona. A note, if you leave too much meat leftover and uneaten, you'll be charged an additional fee, so make sure you're able to finish what you order. This fee is also standard among most kbbq, places to eliminate waste.  The meats were all very good, we tried almost everything on the menu and we didn't have a bad choice. The side dishes were very standard, potatoes, pickled vegetables, rice paper, Korean salad, etc. You can ask for as much as you want of these as well. Rice is included is desired.  Overall it was a good food experience, comparable to the other kbbq experiences I've had in California and other parts of the world. I'd recommend you try it at least once if you haven't had kbbq before. I knocked out down one star for service, very disorganized and got our order wrong a few times. However, it was an unofficial opening and were still training, so I didn't have too high of expectations."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is the worst gen that I've been to. Came in for dinner at around 8 and most of the food/appetizer are out. The service here is not great at all. I will definitely not come back to this location"}
{"text":"Our usual place for Korean BBQ was jam packed so we decided to try some place new. We decided on Gen Korean BBQ House, my cousin had been to the one in CA, and recommended we try the Vegas location. Upon walking up we noticed how huge the size of the place was which was good! Lots of open space made for comfortable dining especially with KBBQ since it's always filled with smoky goodness. The place is super modern and \"club like\" blue lights, new decor, the music selection is great too! Made for a fun atmosphere! The service was terrific, our server was super efficient, friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to order. He also frequently changed our grill, which was great. The price for all you can eat was way decent for the quality and service we received. I believe it was $22 a person for dinner! The Bulgogi, Brisket, and short ribs were delicious! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a Korean restaurant to open up in the Green a valley area and here it is! The food is way better quality than some of the AYCE Korean restaurants in Spring Mountain. They have a wide variety of meats and lots of sides. The restaurant is clean and trendy and at $20 for dinner you can't go wrong. This place is fkn awesome and it's gonna bring out the fat girl in me!"}
{"text":"First time here was great it was just 2 of us. Went back with more people and the service was very slow and automatic charge for tip because a large group which is fine if the service was good  but we had to flag someone down to help us"}
{"text":"finally henderson has an AYCE KBBQ! so close to home and excellent service, price is very reasonable for an ayce kbbq, and cheaper than many other you would find in China town.   however as good as the food is, it's nothing compared to the customer service. the staff is very attentive with as many as 5 people serving you throughout the night. you can really sense the team effort here.  Kristina was our server and she was wonderful! order always came out right which is impressive considering they've been open less than a week.   we will definitely be putting Gen on our rotation of fav places to eat."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.   The food was good.   Generally, when you do an all you can eat, you sometimes get lesser quality meats, but that was not the case here.   I do have to admit that service was a bit slow, but it was a Friday night and it was packed and thus I did not mark them down for such.   I think for the price, this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service was great and the place was really busy but we got served fairly quick. The AYCE is fairly cheap depending on when you go. The meat was good I didn't see any bad meat or anything, the waiter was quick at giving us refills on the banchan. The japchae and the gyoza were out of this world. I highly suggest 5 orders or more of beef tongue. Intestine while kinda awkward to cook is amazing. They had this new thing where it was pickled radish slices and you could use it to wrap your meat instead of using the lettuce which was really good too. I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Hi I'm the leery wife... This place is the bomb! Good atmosphere, nice and attentive staff for example Kristina. And their food is very good I recommend the #10 Gen Yangyum Galbisal. Definitely bring friends here next time."}
{"text":"Cheap prices for all you can eat meat? Yes please!  I had not had tongue before and I have to say, it's a must try! Make sure you use the sauce that comes on the side as well :) very delicious"}
{"text":"Great food, good service! Their short ribs and Japchae are our faves! We go at least a couple time a month and even with the new one open near us we still keep coming back for the great and fresh food."}
{"text":"The meat selection was amazing! The meat themselves were super good! There weren't much choices for sides though. Only thing is the waiting staff weren't as attentive."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time experiencing Gen's I was super nervous to try the food I'm not really open to new foods but it was great! Definitely one of my favorite korean bbq places. The host was super nice! Very pretty girl full of smiles! I believe her name was Eileen.  And my waiter Dennis was super patient with us! Overall I had an amazing experience! I will be recommending this place as well as this location."}
{"text":"Came here with 40+ other students for a Food and Beverage class field trip and their service was amazing. Our grills were swapped out when needed, food took no time to get to our table, and dishes were taken accordingly to make the room that was needed. Great prices and a lot of fun! If you're a sake lover, you definitely have to try the cucumber sake! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Meh, I don't get the hype over this AYCE KBBQ spot.  Literally everyone has been raving about GEN so I finally went to check it out with a friend who's never had KBBQ before. I was really excited and looking forward to try a newer KBBQ spot in town, especially after hearing all of the positive reviews.   It's definitely the most Americanized AYCE KBBQ I've ever been to. All of the KBBQ places are usually employed by Koreans, smaller hole in the wall type restaurants (besides Sura, which is huge). GEN is located in Galleria Mall and the inside is ginormous and quite colorful. The ventilation is great so you don't have to worry about leaving smelling like a walking piece of grilled KBBQ meat. I couldn't help but notice that they played old school R&B and love songs...(?) The menu also strayed a bit away from a traditional KBBQ menu. Some apps were popcorn shrimp, edamame, and fries (?!?) Interesting choices to say the least.  The meat was subpar. I usually go for brisket but since I was with a newbie, I ordered a variety of meats to share:   - Brisket; Pretty good! Very juicy - Bulgogi; Fatty, the marinade was so-so - Kalbi; Tender, same marinade as Bulgogi but the quality of meat tasted better  - Spicy Pork Bulgogi; One of the more flavorful meats, not very spicy but tasted good. Also fatty - Pork Belly/Smoked Garlic Pork Belly; The slices were SO thin that it cooked really fast. I've cooked pork belly enough times to know when it's time to eat, but these thin slices tasted like pure bacon - Spicy BBQ Chicken; Took FOREVER to cook thoroughly and tasted like a teriyaki stir fried chicken. Definitely not worth the wait. Took over 10 minutes for sure  - Spicy Baby Squid; We ate the legs and not the head. We both actually really enjoyed the flavor  The salad was good and tasted similar as salads served at typical KBBQs. For dipping, we each received soy sauce/vinegar and salt/pepper. I had to ask the server for sesame oil to add into the salt/pepper. The banchan (side dishes) tasted average. We also ordered Japchae (Korean stir-fried glass noodles) which was tasteless and dry and the Fried Gyoza which was unmemorable.   Overall the service was pretty decent. They changed the grill out for us frequently (which was good because the meats would burn and the grill would get black rather quickly... they didn't use any oil on the grills) and our waters were refilled whenever empty. We had to call a server over to order more meats a few times which was the only negative, especially since they weren't very busy on a Weekday afternoon.  I think I went with too high of expectations. Unfortunately I was not impressed. I would give GEN:  -1/5 for the overpowering grill which we kept trying to decrease the heat but would somehow end up burning the grill anyway  -2/5 for the side dishes and apps  -3/5 for the meat taste/quality -4/5 for the overall customer service -4/5 for the ambiance (gorgeous restaurant but doesn't fit KBBQ? The love songs also caught me off guard when trying to feast on meat and kimchi...)  I'd recommend venturing to Spring Mountain for a more authentic and tasty AYCE KBBQ dining experience."}
{"text":"I just want to say that was the worst Korean bbq dinner I never got. I will never come back to this place again and I will tell all my friends and coworkers too. 1) meat is not that good quality. 2) waiter always come to table asking \"everything's ok?\" Yeah, please I ordered side dish 20mins ago still not coming yet what do you think everything ok? 3) you may think that price is cheaper than somewhere else but trust me you can't order too much, because the Grill was so slow , finally you done cooked the meat the rice already ice cold. 4) I was looking around there was no Korean people eating there, that tells  you something! 5) tofu soup taste  horrible too. Omg many many things wrong that place, for American people maybe ok, for real Korean? No thank you!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I came in to celebrate our anniversary. Our server Ozzy, was very patient & very quick on his feet whenever we had more orders or any questions at all. Ozzy made our experience very enjoyable on our special day. He was friendly, polite, & a efficient server. The food was good as always, but +1 more star for Ozzy!"}
{"text":"Started going here when it first opened and loved it. But our last visit was just a horrible experience, one thing after another.   We were told to wait 20 minutes at first, then told to wait 30, which is no problem. We ended up waiting for an hour, which we also didn't mind because it was Sunday night but when we arrived it was empty and by the end of our wait, we've seen multiples parties with groups as large as ours get seated before us.   We were then told that our party of 8 was going to be spilt into 2 tables back to back. After waiting an hour we weren't just going to walk out. 2 tables next to each other opened up and we asked to be sat there. The hostess said \"ok, let me check for you.\" We wait another 15 minutes on top of the hour that was originally supposed to only be 20 minutes, only to be sat at 2 tables, back to back. Meanwhile, one of the other 2 tables that were next to each other was given to a party of 7 that showed up after us.  Already upset about this, the table that 4 of us were sitting at started leaking in the ceiling above the table (it was raining out). So now that half of the group had to move to a table even further from the other half.   We saw our server twice, three times maybe. We ended up ordering the majority of our food from the runners who were dropping off our orders or cleaning the table.   We chose your restaurant as a going away celebration for a friend moving to another country and now instead of spending it with 7 friends, the going away celebration was spent with just 3. No free meals or free desserts are being seeked for compensation. The plans along with the night have already been ruined. As a last get together for a friend, this is what the 8 of us will remember.  The only reason why I even gave 2 stars is because the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. Amazing staff. All I can say is amazing, I was beyond impressed. I have a new spot. It's an all you can eat place, you can sit for two hours and enjoy as much meat side dishes and salad as you want. The price may seem high but with the quality of food and the amount of food you get, it is easily worth it. You are able to order four meat selections at a time, and they are not small piece either! They have a full bar and have soju and flavored soju. It is a great place for a night out with friends or family."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a Korean BBQ lover and have been to almost all of the joints in Vegas and many in LA and GEN does it right! Jaineca was our server and her service was more than outstanding. She was friendly, warm, prompt, knowledgable and did an awesome job of taking care of us.  Not only was the food fresh, but the music was of a good variety and brought us back to places we haven't been in decades.  We highly recommend this place even though it is in a mall parking lot in Henderson.  Go Gen!"}
{"text":"A short wait to be seated. After being seated our waiter was there right away and explained the menu and operation how things worked. We ordered and the waiter fired up the grill and next came the food it was fun cooking our food. To sum it up the service was great and the food was fabulous."}
{"text":"Service and food was awesome!  I've tried Korean BBQ's in Vegas and this one tops the list!"}
{"text":"Service is never at the same level. Sides are skimpy portions and if you ask for more the portion gets smaller and smaller.   Wide variety of meat choices and appetizers.  Over all a very good value."}
{"text":"1st time here for dinner very good selection the marinated octopus sssoooo good..service was good,I'd like to try it for lunch"}
{"text":"I wish I can give this restaurant a 0 star rating. I went to go eat with a friend. The first thing I see when we get to the table is the floor being wet. WITH NO WET SIGN  at that.... then we go to our table and as we were eating we see a cricket. We called over our head server I'm guessing who was a big white guy wearing a blue shirt. All he said was \"call me when you see me again. I'll catch it next time\" bruh you didn't even catch it the first time time. Service was bad. I've been to other gens before. The one in cali are better."}
{"text":"Awesome environment and great food. Very pleased with service and location. Whenever I'm in Henderson, Gen is on my list to visit."}
{"text":"Waiter was unable to explain cuts of meat or anything else on the menu. Not to mention many items on the menu were unavailable. Waiter went on break as soon as he took our order and we did not see him again. All other waiters completely ignored us until I got up and asked for a manager because we were out of raw meat to cook. Lol. Waited 20 minutes to get the check because they only have one credit card machine. They charged us 18% gratuity because we had a table of \"6\". There was 4 adults and 2 children 2 years of age. Ridiculous and to bad because the meat was good."}
{"text":"About $25/person for all you can eat. They have a long list of items that comes for that price. With a group of three boys and one girl, we still could not go through half of that menu. Service was a hit and miss. We know this because in the middle of our dining there, we had a server change. The second male server were much warmer and attentive.   Side dishes weren't the best we've had. Salad was delicious and refreshing. We skipped the pork. Chicken, beef and octopus were delicious! The staff could have been more attentive when it comes to time for grill changes. Waiting for a grill change took time away from us cooking our food. Overall, a great experience and we will be returning. Will definitely save some room to buy their ice cream macaroons for dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Eve with which was mention it was there second day opening. It was not crowded like the one in Henderson since they were fairly new.   Customer service was an A++ Sorry, I am not good with names but everyone was working together to make our dinner enjoyable! Coming from California where Gen restaurants are everywhere now, I'm glad we have two in the area!"}
{"text":"Overall food was delicious and service was great. However, our grill fire kept going out on us and we needed the fire to be lit 4 times.  One huge reason that I wanted to eat here was like in CA location was the noodle/radish slices to roll the cooked meats in... That was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time and finally had the chance to. I've only been to one other all you can eat Korean bbq spot, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this place definitely set the bar for any future Korean bbq spots I may go to in the future!  First for all, the sides were great. The kimchi, pickled veggies, seaweed salad, and potato salad were on point. Unfortunately, they didn't have all of the sides but I was pleased with what I had.  The JAP CHAE was beyond YUMS! The beef bulgogi was super tasty, too  and I really enjoyed the kalbi (but I think it was other another name) I wasn't too keen on the pork belly or the squid. Spicy chicken was pretty tasty, but I would recommend ordering chicken first since it takes so long to cook.  For all you can eat for $20 bucks (dinner), I'd definitely recommend this place. I have pretty high standards and I definitely feel like I should have tried so much more, but that's just another reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Just came here today for lunch because friends are recommending this place and let me say,this place deserves more than 5 stars!! Quality meat products and they also serve appetizers as part of all you can eat! Awesome!!! Everything was good esp the marinated premium steak which our server Jaenica suggested. She is awesome she knows whats up! And very very nice customer service like she really cares that we enjoy our first time here! Definitely would go back here and ask for her! Thanks Gen!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Orange county and have been to the original GEN aycekb restaraunts many times. When we heard they were opening one near our home in Gilbert, we were so excited. This GEN does not disappoint. Very good kbqq!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this location on Christmas Eve during their soft opening. I usually go to the Gen in Henderson since it's closer to me, but I enjoyed this one very much. Service was fantastic - we had multiple servers and they were all very nice and quick. We didn't have to wait for meat or banchan more than a minute or two and getting our grill changed was a breeze. All the food was fresh. I was a big fan of the spicy pork bulgogi and Hawaiian pork belly. I didn't remember having the green tea sea salt at the other location, but it was super good here.  Only downside when I visited was that they didn't yet have their alcohol license, but they said they would have it soon. I'll definitely be back if I'm craving KBBQ on this side of town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, a meat lover, suggested we try this place at Tempe Marketplace. Although I'm not much of a meat eater, it looked trendy and fun with good reviews, so I was good to go. We ended up waiting about 40 mins for a table on a fairly busy Sunday night.  Before you order, they will explain the very specific rules to you - set price per person ($24.99), four orders at a time, grill most things yourself, and don't leave leftovers unless you want to be charged. I was kind of put off by the last part... charged, for leftovers? But my boyfriend explained that it's more like a buffet, so if you order and don't eat it, they consider it wasted food (you can't take anything home). That being said, definitely take a few minutes between courses so you don't get charged unnecessarily.  On to the food: my favorites were the Hawaiian Steak, Gyoza dumplings, fried chicken, and the salad. His favorite was the Galbi, which is marinated bone-in short rib and available for dinner only. Since it's unlimited, portions are small, so you can order more of what you like and try as many things as possible. Even though I'm not big into meat, I still enjoyed trying most of the options. The meat is tender and marinated nicely. And since it's raw it comes out very quickly after ordered.  Finally, they offer ice cream sandwich desserts in green tea and fruity flavors - they were small and good! A nice ending to a substantial dinner.  Overall, this is a pretty cool place if this style of all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ is what you're looking for. It may not be exactly my thing, but I would come back again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We had a coupon and am always leery about problems using them. Then a bit of a rough start when our appetizers went to the wrong table. But they bent over backwards to make up for it and we had so much fun and the service was outstanding, not to mention the great food! The coupon went seamlessly and we got $20 off our delicious meal. We will be back! Oh there was a wait, but it is all you can eat, with a 2 hour limit - lots of 2 hour eaters."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ in Henderson.  The bulgogi, Gen steak and Jap Chae was delicious.  We will definitely be back. Ask for Julian for excellent service ."}
{"text":"Hate this place. I don't know why it's all hyped up even though it shouldn't be. The food is flavorless, the servers suck at customer service. You have to ask to get your grill changed when its burnt AF already and they just pass by. The portions are small that's why you have to keep ordering and bug the shit out of those damn servers which they pretend to take your order and don't show up with it for 15 min so you ask again. Hwaro and tofu hut will always be the best even though the wait time is twice as bad, it's worth it than spending money and time at Gen. The servers here really suck and a total piss off."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this place and the food is great as well as the server I had, Alodia explained everything so well and recommended some dishes for us. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"This place is great and trendy. I love their meat selection they have quite a variety. I also had thee mangotini it was not to strong and tasted great."}
{"text":"Nice location and hectic but good atmosphere. The food was a touch bland and I didn't really like the fact that you can only get the dinner menu on weekends. Sly. I am giving 4 stars because our server, Leyna, was awesome. She was attentive without being pushy and she wanted us to enjoy our lunch. The brisket was good but other dishes weren't that great. Avoid the steak. Maybe I'm spoiled by Korean BBQ in LA. I will try again just because of the service."}
{"text":"I mean here it is the place you are going to love and keep coming back to. Do they have a long wait well yes they do because the food is great and the service is wonderful! Imagine this a food paradise tangled in with glass noodles a delicious doping sauce and flavored salt to blend right on your palette. Then imagine where you could ever find such a place right here nuzzled in a quaint corner of the galleria mask right next to Red Robin. I have been here three times now and have not experienced but one bad thing when the waitress for whatever reason decided to ignore me seemingly because I was by myself but water under the bridge after I got that amazing stuff in my belly I recommended the beef tongue and filet order often and in excess it dies get crowded the glass noodles are spectacular! Also if your are of age try the soju it's delicious here and during happy hour fairly well priced too."}
{"text":"So I've been here several times with family or friends. Food has always been good.. This review is just for the service itself. Service is always a hit or miss but never this bad. But on this experience it was down right horrible. Our server took our order once and that's when we sat down. Our grill was burning black for about 10-15mins after asking 2 times from 2 different people for a grill change. Then finally the 3rd person I asked came back immediately to change our grill. Our actual server never once checked up on us, anytime we needed something we had to waive him down or ask someone else. We had to keep asking for the same thing cause they kept forgetting. So definitely not a great experience, will be considering to just drive to China town for better KBBQ experience despite the distance."}
{"text":"Went to this place prior to seeing a show at ASU. Always packed so make reservations or be prepared to wait at least an hour. Wait is worth it as it's all you can eat and the quality is good as is the quick service."}
{"text":"Our daughter took us here as a surprise & it was pleasantly. Salad arrived right away(house). Looked over the menu & my hubby started at the top & I started at the bottom so we could try as much as possible & eventually meet in the middle (next time). We had a great time trying the diff meats & cooking all the diff stuff. You cook your food in the middle of your table to your liking add seasonings & on your plate. Oh so good. They have a fork,tongs & scissors or chop sticks so next time I'll take my own knife as being lefty. Service great, servers work as a team. The place has a good vibe. They have food,  drinks (alcohol & non), large screen tv's & a macaroon/ice cream dessert. You will walk away fulfilled. Thank you."}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ place in Las Vegas! \"AYCE\" price is cheap but all food are fresh and delicious, service speed I can rate them 5 star! Also our waiter 's name is JOE,  he's friendly and super nice guy, take care our very well! All other staff are nice too, we petty sure will come back next time as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Great price, amazing friendly service, and a very clean environment. I would come and eat here again. Thank you Gen BBQ staff!"}
{"text":"Service here wasn't as good as the servers at the Henderson restaurant. We asked for a bowl of lemons 7 times. Our grill was so burnt and smoked us out and our server didn't bother asking to change it for us. They added 18% gratuity without letting us know. Henderson location is definitely better!"}
{"text":"This place was great! If you love meat you will love this place! A little loud but not to bad. The food is delicious and the service is very fast! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was in a huge shopping mall, which was a little odd BUT omg - so good!!! I liked that the serving sizes were decently small because we were able to try a lot of dishes. Galbi was great, brisket was great, beef tongue was great, Hawaiian chicken was great, squid was great...I could go on. We enjoyed this place a lot. Everyone was super nice, and the food came out super fast as well. For $25/person it was a great deal. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great price for all you can eat ($21.99/person dinner. Not sure if prices change on other days). I liked that they had the table prepped with the given sides before we sat down. Our server explained to us how it worked since it was my boyfriend's first time. The plates of meat that we ordered came immediately. There was enough meat per plate for 2-4 people, depending on what you order. The servers were prompt when it came to changing out the grill during our meal. I loved that the macaroon ice cream sandwich was in a fridge for us to look at right when we entered. Made me excite to get dessert as it was delicious and not to sweet. The atmosphere was well lit even though it was dim lighting with cool blue lights. They were waiting to get their liquor license for their bar. We will return once that happens. The service was great! Favorites: Cajun shrimp, KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), chicken with fondue jalapeño dip, thumbs up that had the ribs and #1, the mushrooms and I liked the green tea salt. Not sure if Korean BBQ places do fish, but I felt that's all that would've been a nice choice. Great place for groups or a date. BTW, they have a couple of TVs at the bar if your special someone wanted to catch up on sports."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Especially because it's close to my house. I've been here a few times already, and didn't have to wait. The lunch special is a good price, and the environment is really nice and non-greasy unlike other ayce korean bbq spots. Try the KFC"}
{"text":"Whatever you do- DO NOT PUT YOUR JAP CHAE GLASS NOODLES AND VEGGIES ON THE GRILL! My friends and I couldn't tell if the noodles were raw, and since everything else was, we grilled them. Our waiter could not stop laughing at and teasing us! It was hilarious, stupid and embarrassing but a great time!  Any how-this place was awesome. My friends and I felt it was too cool for the Galleria Mall; it really seemed like a District or Town Square-y joint. Very atmospheric, modernized intimate dining on the second floor of the mall. We also had a 20 minute wait so we left and wandered the mall until they texted me they were ready, which was super convenient. The whole experience from the moment we sat down to the time we finally left was awesome, super fun and just a great time. The meats were all delicious and it was really fun to cook and season your own food and sample the tables' creations.   I think my favorite thing was the squid bulgogi. It was hilarious watching the little white blob curl and quiver on the grill and it tasted absolutely delicious. The jap chae, glass noodles and veggies, was also really yummy, double cooked or not. I wanted to order another serving just to double grill as a joke but my friends are better at being decent adults and convinced me not to. The other fav was the soju; we got pomegranate lychee (you can mix flavors) and it was so delicious that two of us downed a pitcher in about 30 minutes.  All in all, if you're thinking about stopping by or want to try something new and are in the mood for all you can eat, do not pass this place up! It is so amazing and worth every dime!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Service is on point and an amazingly good selection of meats. I will definitely be referring this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Very nice decor and food. We frequent this location. My only big complaint is the excessive talking and gossiping the hostesses involve themselves in every time I am there. They are very catty. Also this happened a while ago but why would you have a server who you can't order drinks with because she is underage? I don't know why I had to place drink orders with two different people."}
{"text":"Best AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas! My only gripe is that the tables are too small to fit 7 people. We felt cramped in that space. 7 as in 4 adults and 3 kids. They should have put us in a larger table but oh well. Sides are nothing to talk about as they all are the norm in any Korean BBQ place. Nothing that really wowed me except for the macaroon ice cream. If they could beef up (pun intended) their sides it would make for a 5 star place. Ambiance is nice as well."}
{"text":"First time dining at Gen, and what a great dining experience it was. Without knowing what to order (first time eating Korean BBQ) the hostess was great at explaining the concept of the restaurant. Our server, Alodia, was super friendly and helpful, helping us with menu questions and giving us recommendations. Based on her suggestions, I highly suggest trying the spicy pork bulgogi, beef kalbi, and KFC! Travis, her busser, was very attentive to our table, clearing off our table, making sure our drinks were always full, and always checking in with us. Alodia was always giving us more suggestions and constantly making sure we were okay. Overall, this place is great and I highly recommend it! My friends keep telling me this is the best Korean BBQ spot in the city, and I couldn't agree more! Make sure to ask for Alodia and Travis, they will ensure you are taken care of!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it completely redeemed themselves.  The wait was very minimal, we came on a Wednesday night. It just so happened when we got seated they did their usual happy hour chant, or so it seems. My Jameson was only $5 and Sapporo $4, not bad.   For those new to Gen, it is all you can eat (AYCE) and is $21 per person. It includes all the meats you expect and their sides too. The service was really good this night always checking up on us. As for quality, this was one of the best I've seen at a $20 AYCE place. Barely any fat at all on the brisket and they were not frozen either.   This is a great choice for dinner if you're looking for something off the strip :)"}
{"text":"First time eating here & our server Alodia made us feel very welcomed! She was so helpful & friendly, I'll be requesting her as a server next time we come back. Would definitely recommend this place, it's one of the best K BBQ places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great experience eating here we had some issues but \"TOM THE GRILL MASTER\" he was able to turn our experience around. Quality of food was amazing and a perfect environment. Definitely would recommend to all locals best KBBQ In Las Vegas. THANK YOU TOM for great service."}
{"text":"Gen in Henderson has to be the best AYCE Korean BBQ spot in Vegas. It's a relief that a large restaurant chain like this can provide quality at such an incredible price. I was hesitant at first, but I am now a believer.  To start off, we were informed of a 45 minute wait time. No problem. Like a lot of other restaurants, you write down your name and phone number and they'll let you know when your table is ready. We decided to check out the mall. After working up an appetite, we received a text that our table would be ready soon. We skidaddled back to the restaurant and our table was prepared within 10 minutes.   Upon arriving at our table, I noticed how everything was neatly placed: the plates, sauces, chopsticks, the cooking utensils, the salad, and the banchan. And let me tell you a thing about the banchan (those complimentary side dishes). It's some good quality tasty stuff and we ended up ordering a whole 'nother round of it during the middle of our meal. It's a shame that most of the diners eating around us weren't even touching it.   The meats were all of decent quality. We started off with the Gen Premium Chadol and the beef tongue. Both thinly sliced cuts of meat. I'd have to say the beef tongue edged out on the chadol this time around.   Next, we had the beef bulgogi and their signature galbi. I have to say they're both the best AYCE variants within their respected categories. Galbi is my absolute favorite K-BBQ meat, and they totally did it right. So much so that I ordered another serving towards the end of the meal.   Finally, we ended it with the premium steak and spicy baby octopus. The steak was literally a whole slab of beef. We cut the excess fat, and it paired well with the salt mix that was provided to us. Just don't overcook it! The spicy baby octopus could have been really good if it weren't for the excessive amount of sauce that was lathered on the dish. It was still tasty for what it was and I thought the octopus was juicy and tender.   The only thing I was disappointed with was that the server didn't bother to replace the grill top throughout our meal. It became a charred mess by the end. Other than that, our server was on top of it.   And even though the atmosphere sort of felt like a nightclub, the food was so good that it didn't bother me. I'll definitely be coming back, and I think I just found my new go-to Korean barbecue place."}
{"text":"amazing food, some of the best quality krn bbq I've had...personal favorites are the baby octopus,  bulgogi and the kalbi (#10)!!! if you see the waitress named kailin, ask for her!"}
{"text":"Went to Gen Koren BBQ tonight with friends and family. Food was good but the service was less to be desired. Drinks were reordered twice before they arrived, several requests for items had to be requested more than once. When the fire went out and the server could not get it to work after several tries he offered to get us to another table, it never happened. After waiting for about 20 minutes in the middle of our meal we decided to pay the check. The manager gave us a 20% discount on our check but never came to the to apologize. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Jen to everybody! Ozzy and the best server slash bartender ever! Please see him whenever you come. I've been to every Korean BBQ place in town and this one definitely takes the cake. Thank you so much Ozzy for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Gen is a great restaurant! Service was great. The server was Jaenica. She would always be around just in case we needed something!  A++"}
{"text":"Julian was our server today and he provided us with great service! He was very nice. Food was great as always but they were out the steak and pork belly."}
{"text":"#31 of 2017  On our recent trip to LV, we took the in-laws out of their comfort zone and into Henderson for this AYCE Korean BBQ.  These are just a few reasons why Gen Korean BBQ gets five stars:  -Friendly staff: If you don't know what something is, ask and surely they will tell you.  Also, they are happy to provide suggestions based on your likes and dislikes -Good quality meats.  No nasty cuts. -Fast service.  Some yakiniku spots have you waiting DAYS for raw meat.  Not here! -Efficient.  Once we were ready for our check, the host came around with an ipad, swiped our card and printed our receipt.  Painless! -Yummy Korean food.  Good dobbokki, especially in LV is hard to find.  They stay true to Korean specialties while making it accessible to everyone.  Even my in-laws who are kind of picky, LOVED this place.  My FIL kept asking \"what's the catch?!\" in disbelief!  Best part is that a new one just opened in Hawaii.  Once the hype dies down and the wait isn't three hours, I'll be there!"}
{"text":"Good food and efficient. You will not leave hungry. The wait is crazy though. I suppose that's a sign it's good food but they need a better way to accommodate walk ins. We waited two hours. We hung out at thirsty lion so it was tolerable. The beef is very flavorful and the cost was what you expect. Ambience was perfect for the crowd and location."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with the International Supper Club UYE one night when it was a pretty small crowd. Our server was not very good unfortunately but that did not keep us from having a good time. All the food was delicious and it was fun to cook everything yourself. It did take us a little while to get the hang of it. I think it would be a lot easier if they gave you bigger plates along with a knife and fork. I am fine eating with chopsticks but not cutting steak with them lol. The meal was a little pricey but since it is all-you-can-eat meat you'll get your money's worth if you show up hungry.  Also fyi the floor is very slippery. I took a little tumble on my way to the bathroom since there was some stuff on the floor. Fortunately I was wearing flats so I didn't completely wipe out. But if I had been wearing heels I probably would have hurt myself. So watch out for that."}
{"text":"I have been to Gen about five times and although it is a great deal, about $20 all you can eat per person, there are cons to these pros.  When you walk inside you are met with the aroma of cooking meat, sizzling sound everywhere, lots of people talking, and the modern interior. I personally like the hustle and bustle aspect of the restaurant.   Every time I have went I did have to wait about 5-10 minutes each time because it always seems to be busy every night. My favorite place to sit is in the booth, there seems to be more table room which is handy since you'll have plates everywhere. The food selection is fairly large. Mainly just meats and the sides tend to be rice. The food is good if you can cook it right. I do feel sick a little after though, but that's because I try to stuff as much as I can into my stomach.  The service is where the cons come in. There are a lot of young people working and they aren't as friendly and excited to serve you as compared to other restaurants. They are very forgetful as well. I should not have to ask for another bowl of rice three times. Also they never seem to remember what drink you had. The service isn't completely terrible but I have had better. Another annoyance is that they always try to give us someone else's food at least three times a sitting.   The atmosphere, good. The food, good. The service, eh."}
{"text":"We had a great time! The food was delicious and all you can eat for a very reasonable price. Julien was our server and took phenomenal care of us. My husband really enjoyed the volcano chicken and the beef bulgogi and roast beef were awesome. Also don't miss the smoked garlic pork belly. Mmmmm. Will come again."}
{"text":"We were supposed to eat at the nearby resto but decided to eat here instead and it was a great decision. We love the crispy squid legs and the spicy bulgogi. Great service from lisa and krinke.. will definitely come back. Now we dont have dont have to drive all the way to spring mtn."}
{"text":"Decor is clean and very modern.  Almost feels like a clubbing experience.  Servers are friendly.  Prices are in line with other AYCE K-BBQ restaurants.  The food ... well that's another story.  Quality of the meat with and without marinades along with the taste of the marinade were enough to cause instant regret.  This is my 2nd Gen experience.  First Gen experience was in SoCal.  I heard it was better here but ...   I can only imagine that the high reviews were for Decor, Ambiance and the never ending \"buffet\" of food."}
{"text":"Gen kbbq is my favorite place for kbbq. The atmosphere is amazing and so is the staff. They have a great selection of meat to choose from at a great price. Special thanks to Jaenica, she was amazing and went out of her way to make sure we had an amazing visit."}
{"text":"I had two sub par experiences at Gen BBQ. The first time I went into Gen BBQ I asked if they had any a la carte options since I am vegetarian. The hostess (I believe the lead) said \"we only do all you can eat\". I asked if I could just order a few things off the menu and she said no and was not very understanding about it. I was disappointed because my boyfriend really wanted to go. The second time, I decided to get the regular all you can eat menu and just eat vegetables, I asked if we could sit at the bar (so my boyfriend and I could have different grills). Again, without listening to the fact that I am vegetarian, she said no because no one was serving at the bar. I said I did not want to order drinks, just food, and she said a server could not take my order over there. She was not compensating and I don't think she even listened to my question. My boyfriend and I sat at the same grill, and she failed to communicate to the server that I did not eat meat and every time my boyfriend ordered a meat portion the server would assume two orders and brought us TONS of meat. I ordered a bottle of sake, and the server did not serve it with a glass. Just the bottle itself. The food is bland and the dressings seem to not be helpful enough to sustain its flavor on the VERY hot grill. The atmosphere is nice and has a electric blue undertone which makes the vibe of the place comfortable. Unfortunately, the service was not good and the food was bland. Don't order too much food (or make sure the server doesn't bring out two of everything, in my case!) note: they will charge you for uneaten food. I will say, if you eat meat, and are okay with paying a hefty price for prices of average meat, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"I have been here on the past two Sunday afternoons and had two completely different experiences. The first was definitely a 5 star experience which was why we returned with friends for the second time. On the first visit, the restaurant was exceptional with friendly staff and fast service!  The food was great and it was so much fun!  We brought some friends for lunch today and I have to say it was embarrassing that we recommended it. The waiter introduced himself then proceeded to give us a list of several rules we needed to follow. We were to pay dinner prices at lunchtime, and he repeated that if we left any food uneaten at the table we were to be charged extra. People don't want to sit down at a restaurant and hear a bunch of rules from the waiter in the first minute after being seated. I would change that. While we were sitting at the table, my friend's husband came in for a quick visit before heading to work and sat down at our table. The waiter came over and asked what he wanted to drink and he said he wasn't eating and that he would be there just for a minute before going to work. The waiter then told him that if he was sitting at the table he would be charged the full price of $19.99 and that was their policy. Needless to say my friend's husband was insulted and left upset.  He was literally staying for a couple of minutes just to see his wife before work. It's such a shame because I really love the food and the atmosphere of gen but will probably not go back because of the service this time."}
{"text":"I'm really loving the increase in excellent Asian restaurants to the East Valley! We came here around 5:45 on a Tuesday and there was no wait for a table of 5. Yes! As we left though it got a lot busier and there was definitely a line and a waitlist for tables.   The interior is modern and quite swanky with dim lighting and glowing blue accents. When we got seated one of the servers brought over some water and took our drink orders. Since we wanted to eat RIGHT NOW we already knew what 4 items to initially start with so we placed them immediately (One table can order up to 4 items at a time). In general, the servers will keep track of what time you sat down and you have a time limit of 2 hours to inhale all the delicious BBQ your stomach can handle! With 37 items to choose from you have quite a lot to decide on! We probably did about 7 rounds before we tapped out and declared mercy on our digestive systems. As soon as our meat order arrived we'd order another round to keep the flow going. I ate and ate and ate... I was sitting in the farthest corner of our booth a bit out of reach from the grill. My friends helped me out by placing random pieces of food on my plate from it so after a while I didn't even know what I was eating but it sure tasted great! Just keep eating, that's my motto!  Out of all the items my favorites were the smoked garlic pork belly and galbi. I was also impressed by the steak. If you order it, they will literally deliver a whole entire steak right to your table! We oohed and ahhhed over the sizzling sounds, the mouth-watering BBQ aromas emerging from our grilled paradise. In general I enjoyed all the meats we ordered and I have to say I think most of the meats and marinade tasted better than at regular Korean BBQ restaurants here in the Phoenix area.   Most of the items are raw meat that you cook, but they do offer foods such as Korean fried chicken which tasted more like General Tso's chicken but it was still delicious with crispy fried batter. The japchae was also interesting, it was plain clear noodles with no additional mix-ins and had a different flavor profile than what I've had in the past. One thing to note is that if you order the volcano chicken, prepare for Mt. Vesuvius to erupt onto your gustatory senses! My mouth was on fire and after the spiciness died down, my palate felt a bit numb as if the food had chemically burned it lol. It's basically the same battered fried chicken as the KFC, but doused with a nuclear hot sauce.  Some minor points. While service was very friendly and for the most part attentive (Which is much appreciated if you're on a time limit), there were some small annoyances such as not receiving any tongs for the meat or an extra plate of sauce even though they were requested. No worries on our part since we just grabbed them from the nearby service cart. One of the servers was considerate enough to let us know about the uneaten food policy near our 7th round of food (Perhaps this is a sign we are incurable gluttons), that there is a charge for any uneaten food on your plate.  Even the banchan was quite tasty and very plentiful. Your AYCE experience also comes with a big bowl of rice which was nicely cooked, a tray of 3 sauces (Green tea salt, sesame oil, a sweet brownish sauce) and a light salad.   Overall we all had a good time and I'd love to go back again for all you can MEAT!  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here around 9pm for dinner not too busy but the food was A-ok wasn't all that great. They didn't have much as the one in Northridge, CA. They have less section than the one in the San Fernando Valley."}
{"text":"So my co-worker/wifey came here as well as my boyfriend on two separate occasions when we had a meat craving. It is conveniently located adjacent the galleria mall to walk off all the shameless flavor saturated in your gut. The marinated beef is mouthwatering. The chicken however, is a pain in the butt to cook. It takes forever. Besides that, the appetizers or sides that come with the food are deliciously simple, fresh, and crisp. My only complaint is that they don't have rice paper sheets. What does a girl have to make a darn taco?"}
{"text":"JULIAN was an amazing server! He constantly checked up on us & always made sure we had enough to drink. Our food was brought to us in a timely manner & when we wanted more rice or sides, he wasn't too far away from our table to ask. We were there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch & it was somewhat busy. Although it was busy, his service was great! When I asked for a smaller portion of Yogurt Soju because I knew I couldn't finish the 32oz they only offered, he came through & delivered a glass just enough for one person. It was his first time making that size of a drink & it was sooo good! If y'all ever go to Gen, ask to sit in one of Julian's tables, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great deal and excellent selections of meat for an all you can eat Korean BBQ.  Michalina was a great server and really attentive during the whole meal."}
{"text":"Love this kind of modern restaurant, although their meat quality is not as high as I hope. Plus, I am a bit of allergic to their sauce ingredients but I will still return and try again.   I would still perfer going to Gyu-kaku in California."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say we had a great time dining at Gen. Not just today but all the time. We live in the South West and we will drive all the way to Henderson to dine with them at least twice a month. Our server is amazing , our busser is great and we never have complaints.   However today I didn't feel so good about it after my dining experience. My husband left a hoodie at the restaurant and we didn't realize it until we got home. He called and the answer he got was \"we will look for it and call you back.\"  I know it is a busy restaurant but no I need an answer now because I can tell you exactly what my table number is and where he might have left it. I didn't like the answer he was given so I called myself. Lauren picked up the phone and clearly she was the person who spoke to my husband too. She gave me the same answer stating \"I have many checks to close and I do have to take priority of that first.\" Not a good attitude and she is probably closing a check that I paid with 20% gratuity on it. So I politely asked again if she could check the booth we just sat at. She told me again no because she was busy. Ok so I said you could put me on hold.   Approximately 5 minutes later, she came back on the phone and said \"we don't see anything, the people don't want to get up so we would have to call you later when busser is cleaning all the tables\"    And I said \"No Lauren I didn't tell you which table it is yet how do you know they don't want to get up ?\" She sighed and again with an attitude \"so what table is it ? \".  I told her the table and she came back in 30 seconds saying she got it.   So now the problem I have is what is the attitude about ?! We frequent the restaurant and honestly even it is our first time I expect better service like the server we had earlier. Also why would she lie about it ? It was such a simple task which took 30 second to check and we were on the phone for 10 mins for her to change my experience from wonderful to horrible. The vibe she gave me is she absolutely doesn't care about me and she has no intention in helping us. I mean at least pretend?!   Not good customer service. Not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out this place after driving by it a couple times. I was more than pleased with not only the food but the restaurant staff as well. They were super attentive and very friendly recommending the popular dishes that they offered. The price is also great for the endless amount of food that you get! I can't wait to come back another time."}
{"text":"Yay! A new Korean bbq place for us to try! I am always excited to try a new Korean bbq place and I was even more excited when I found out they have a franchise all over the country.  First and foremost the place looks great. It's located right next to the galleria mall and has giant signs, so you can't really miss it. The inside looks fancy and their seating is comfy. We went on a Sunday during lunch time so it was getting busy, but we got seated in no time. At first everyone was super friendly, we had a really nice guy who kept asking if we got our order and drinks in, but it just went downhill after that. After we got our first wave of food in, we waited for a waiter to ask us if we needed more, but no one came. We then asked the bus boy if we can order more food and he said \"of course\" and whispered to the waiter who was taking an order at the table next to us, but after he finished he walked away, and so we waited. 15 more minutes, no one came, so we asked another girl who walked by if we can order, and she said she would get a server to us. Then another 10 more minutes went by and with no food on our grill, we stopped another person and they were a server, so he got our order in (but forgot the sesame oil). We got our food, but still no sesame oil, until a really polite girl walked by and we asked and she obliged. When we finished we asked a waiter for our check. While we were waiting we were trying to get a water refill, and was completely ignored by a waiter with a jug of water after yelling out \"excuse me\" who proceeded to fill up the table behind us and walk. We finally got someone to refill our water and our green tea, but was still waiting for our check. About 20 minutes after asking for the check we finally decided to give up and walk up to the counter where we tried to pay, but was rudely denied by the lady at the counter who said we had to pay at our table. We told her that we've been waiting 20 minutes for the check, and she sarcastically said \"really? That long\" but luckily the lady who seated us early defended us and agreed that it was been quiet awhile since we've been here. She was happy to get our check and apologized over and over again for their lack of service. All in all their food was alright, but for a restaurant that has a country wide franchise I really expected the service to be quicker. It always may have to do with the fact that the servers pretty much have a free for all because they don't have sections and don't keep track of what stage of the eating process each table are on."}
{"text":"I can finally check this off my New Years resolution list!!  I have wanted to eat here a long time and my 4 star review is solid.  We walked into the restaurant with no wait, seated immediately. Waited 10 mins for a server so I had to flag one down and ask politely for drinks and our grill to be turned on (I had read previous reviews and knew our grill would take time to heat up.)  We quickly placed our drink order and meat order since we had time to browse the menu.  Meats came out first and drinks after 10 minutes.   The food is obviously delicious and you can order up to 4 at a time.   We ordered shrimp, premium steak, KFC, skirt steak and my Yogurt soju Capri sun."}
{"text":"Wish I didn't have to leave a rating because I do understand that it's their grand opening (aka they've only been open for a little while.) But unfortunately, I think it should be a soft opening since they didn't have a lot of items on the menu.   My body was so ready to dine at a decent kbbq in Vegas since there are really none worth mentioning around here/worth the price lol.  I was taken by surprise with the items that they had because they had Cajun fries!!!!!!!!! But of course, they didn't have it :-( They also didn't have gyoza, tofu, or any teas.   Meats are ok, but to me... the Cali locations taste a lot better. I love love love the garlic pork belly, but for some reason it just had a weird after taste lol. Brisket was pretty dry as well, even when we tried to cook it medium.   What I did like was that they serve Japchae in big portions!!!! My fav. The KFC Chicken was pretty good too, a little too saucy, but still good.   The service is A1, they try their best.   I've been to two of the locations in Cali & this one just disappointed me a little. But I hope the employees don't get discouraged because you are all doing the best you can & I see the hard work you all are putting in :-) Customers should understand that it's the grand opening and should be a little nicer to the workers for things they have no control of!   I know this place will do well though because there aren't many kbbq places in Vegas and Gen is pretty well known.   GG LV."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I enjoyed it immensely. They have the table set for you with all the sides before you even sit down. Our waitress Shea did not take long to get to our table for our order. She was very attentive and checked on if we needed refills or any extra food to order. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ozzy is the best server I have ever had. He is really friendly , attentive and made our night out really great! Definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"It's nice to finally have a korean bbq place around Henderson! Coming from Cali, I've had my fair share of korean bbq places and Gen hangs with the best of them.   Let me start off with the service. The servers were very friendly from the beginning with their recommendations. They would constantly come by and ask us if we needed anything else from new girls to new side dishes. I never felt like I was ignored or unattended too. My servers Seaver and Minju were awesome and everyone should ask for them !   Now my favorite part... THE MEAT ! My personal favorites and must tries are the beef tongue and pork cheek. The beef tongue is unlike any I've tried because of how the taste,texture, and thickness of the cut. Other good choices I tried were the garlic chicken and the galbi.   All in all my experience at gen was amazing and would definitely recommend it to friends . You would be crazy not to go !"}
{"text":"We enjoyed it, it was our first time at a Korean bbq. Very interesting I must say.  We tried quite a few things on the menu that we've never eaten.   The japchae noodles were tasty.  Pork belly was not my favorite!! I liked the fried squid legs until my third order then they were kind of burnt.    James was good, he suggested a lot of things for us to try.  Happy hour is at 9:30pm.  The ambiance is nice.  You can have a private table or table with a different party. We came on a Wednesday and we the wait was about 5 mins.  But then they sat us at a table we had to share, then we requested a private table and waited less than 10 mins.  Over all experience was nice. Thanks to Sierra L. I didn't put my noodles on the grill"}
{"text":"Came here once in a Monday and the Sunday after that.  Service is pretty good compared to other Korean BBQ place. Food is delicious and they don't give you big portions so you can try more! Ventilation is great here and the place is very modernized.  When I came here with only one other person, we were sat at a very tall and long table with two other grills. This table is meant to sit multiple small parties. Although, the atmosphere is loud, it feels a little awkward hearing the people next to you have their own conversation.  The only real down side is the payment method. When I came with a party of six, we were not told until after we were done eating, that the cashier can only do up three cards. When I was here with just my sister, we had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to check us out. Even with that, the cashier didn't even apologize for making us wait that long. Both times, the cashier asks if you want to leave a tip which is always pressuring and a bit annoying. Come here for good kbbq, but expect to have to wait for seating and paying."}
{"text":"awesome place! good food. blah blah blah pretending to do this until she walks away. poop dick. rawrrrrrr. jaenica is my hero!!! whooooooooooo soju is my number one love and stuff"}
{"text":"I can't believe how downhill this place has gone already.  I won't be back.  I was honestly shocked at how bad some of the meat we were given was, a couple plates were about 75% fat and gristle, and the rest were much more fat than usual.  The supposedly premium dinner cuts were just as bad, if not worse, than the basic cuts.  Would not feed meat like this to my cats, let alone a human.  All of the beef dishes had a weird-bad taste to them that I couldn't tell if it was rotten or just poorly stored, and I was afraid I was going to be sick later (but I wasn't).  The crowd was quite low for a Saturday, big change from all the other times I've been here before.  This place is clear across town for me, and I would pass a lot of other kbbq places to go here, but no more.  Even if it were half as expensive it would still be too much to be given plates that look like the bits that I would throw in the garbage if I were cutting up a raw steak at home."}
{"text":"We have a Gen Korean BBQ house on Oahu, but I have yet to go because of the crowds of people trying to dine in. I came up to Vegas for my friends birthday and of course we wanted to do ALL YOU CAN EAT. BBQ is also her favorite so it was perfect.  It was basically ~$20 and you get to order as much as you want. Just make sure that you eat everything because they will charge you if you have too much left over stuff.  I really love the khalbi and the Teri beef...  all their little sides are also really good. I always have to order more of them.   I think the best way to do these kinda all you can eat is to do family style and just share everything so that you get to eat a little bit of everything. Everything comes out relatively fast because you grill it yourself.    On a side note, our waiter was really cute and I thought the food runners were also easy on the eyes  so that's just a bonus!"}
{"text":"I wasn't really into the whole paying to cook for yourself. Also did not like leaving smelling like smoked BBQ."}
{"text":"We wanted to take our kids here because we thought it would be fun for them.. They really enjoyed the cooking of our own food.  They aren't super picky about meat quality either so they enjoyed the food as well.  The service was off though, we were greeted by a young man that started us off and introduced himself to be our server..  How ever he disappeared shortly after we got started.  After 10 minutes or so another male server took over and he was REALLY nice but you could tell he was slammed and was trying to handle many tables.  No manager ever came by and asked how things were and I felt the quality of the meat was low.  No chicken breasts, only thigh meat and the red meat/steak was fatty.  No many veges to choose from either.  We will go back if our kids request it but not for our own benefit.  If the service issue hadn't happened I prob would have given them 4 stars."}
{"text":"The wait was quick since we decided to sit at the bar.  But it was Fathers Day so there was a long line.  I like how the place wasn't smokey.  The smoked is sucked into the grill area rather than a vent above the table.  The food was good! They ran out of the Kalbi style meat though.  The appetizers were good.  The salad was simple and light.  They don't have much dipping sauces (brisket sauce and sesame oil) was all they had.  But over all good for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent Service!!! Dakota was great, friendly, super, super fast service! Dakota will be our waiter every time we come. I loved the experience.  First time here and he helped us alot on the menu! Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, wonderful service and atmosphere! Kaitlin was very informative and helpful! Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the people are great. I love their spicy rice cakes!"}
{"text":"Was excited to go to this restaurant until I got there.  Had a reservation but still had to wait forever for a table and then they could not accommodate the amount of people they told us they could. They split us up into two different tables with two different waiters. I was very disappointed in the food all of the meat dishes were of low-quality Grade and heavily disguised with many spices and flavors. Now I know what they mean by Kung Pow \"Meow\" !!  The bar was limited which wasn't that big of a deal but the fact I didn't trust the food was. I will never go to this place again!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst restaurants to go with a large party. We had a party of 12 on a Wednesday and were given an hour to an hour and a half wait which we begrudgingly accepted. Close to an hour and a half later, we went to check on the status of our table and were told we would have to wait even longer than our original wait time because there were no tables big enough for all of us and no two six-person booths across the aisle from each other. So, we opted to sit at two different six-person tables on either side of the restaurant. Horrible planning on the staff's part and that is why I had to dock two stars.  As for the food, it was delicious and an amazing experience to cook it at your own table. We tried the pork belly, ribeye, etc. Pretty much a wide range of the selection offered on the menu. I would definitely go back for the food. Overall, it was a good experience and our server was super nice, but the wait time and issue with the large party was frustrating."}
{"text":"Ozzy was the best server I've ever had at Gen. He is the shiznit! In all seriousness he was very genuine and we never waited for anything. He deserves a raise"}
{"text":"BS +++  Yo! Genny from the block!!!  NYC Koreatown would love to add a spot like this in their  block!  But it's Vegas  and it will remain here.  First of, it's a clubby scene so try not to dress bummy folks.  I saw some questionable outfits there.  But wait! Why would you wear your Gucci and smell like Bogogi after? Nevermind.  Just wear your Underarmour hoodies and Nike sweats.  But  seriously if you are expecting an \"authentic\" all-out-cook-out KPop BBQ spot this is not it.  It's a modern twist to Korean BBQ.  But how can you hate the fact that they offer Korean Fried Chicken?!! Bon Chon you got competition! And for $22 per person and  an all you can  eat option.. SERIOUSLY GENNY YOU ARE KILLING ME!!  Thank God I am training to bulk up because your Hawaiian beef and flat iron beef is the BOOM.COM.  I can't say anything bad about this spot except for one thing..... I hated to say goodbye.  Your staff - SERIOUSLY the friendliest.  Are they all Canadian? Super nice.  Super sincere.  Super accommodating.  Super everything.  Folks this is just a fun spot for a date or to have a night out and drinks.  Don't compare it to anything else.  The place is in a popping mall.  Again I am coming from a different angle.  So all you foodies who wants to hate - HATE - but give  others a chance to try it.  Not all experiences are the same.  I never been here before BUT!!!! and this is a big ANUS - I been so A LOT of Korean BBQ spots and this  might not be the best but it has the best customer service and best  attitude any  restaurant has.  And that  deserves a try.  If you ever come  around LV.  I am calling out all my hipsters, gangster thugged out friends.  Come through yo! This spot is hot!  Food is BOMB Customer Service  is ATOMIC Selection was ON POINT and NOT TOO OVERWHELMING Restrooms are CLEAN and toilets are RUSTIC Tables Clean and UPGRADED and COMFY Table wait time PLACE WAS PACKED but  got our tables ASAP Customer service is THE GAME CHANGER HERE! Ambiance Club like and dim. Music choices was a bit rowdy.  I didn't know whether to eat the beef or fight it!! hahahaha Kitchen SUPER CLEAN Overall experience was FUN!  I enjoyed this place.  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in the Las Vegas area. Quality and service can't be beat! With a shout out to our server Ozzy."}
{"text":"This place is new, popping and definitely delicious. A premium kbbq all you can eat, I for sure expected a wait. We were quoted a long wait each time but was seated earlier than estimated time each time. This is definitely a plus. All the servers were on point and friendly. The pouched drinks were fun and the food was good. Idk how I entirely feel about the side dishes at the moment but besides that; everything was awesome. I love the spicy pork belly!! I've been there three times already since they opened."}

The service was really friendly and they changed out the grill frequently for us. We had just returned from a trip to Korea so we treated the kids to this after picking us up from the airport. We tried a variety of everything. My husband said the tripe was some of the best he's had. I loved the bulging I and short ribs the best. We also ate a lot of octopus and calamari. My son was fascinated by the firecracker chicken which was a spicy wet rendition of friend chicken we ate in Seoul."}
{"text":"Stopped by again last night & this is still my ultimate favorite Korean BBQ place. 4 star cause it's that good! Not 5 stars cause its so far. But still! Worth the drive & our wait last night was not bad at all"}
{"text":"They supposedly close at 11pm but we were turned down at 10:14pm. Hostess said there were no open tables when the whole restaurant was pretty much empty. If you aren't going to serve people until 11pm, you should change your hours of operation. And get a new hostess who doesn't greet guests at the door with \"you have 10 minutes to eat\" and turn them down anyways."}
{"text":"Server Yuhao's service is really really good.  The price was comparable. I had a linch with my frds there and i could say it was my best korean bbq in town!"}
{"text":"Prior to departing for our vacation, I found an online coupon for $20 off a $40 purchase at this recently opened chain restaurant, but noticed it was subsequently taken down so my wife called to confirm that we could use it.  Our AYCE meal included unlimited appetizers, meats, seafood and banchan (small side dishes).   We started off with a mundane and unnecessary order of gyoza. This was followed by orders of signature steak, Cajun shrimp and spicy chicken that we cooked on the grill.  The grill was replaced a few times and we ended up ordering just 2 more proteins, though I don't remember either.   The food was good, but there was a sameness to our second order since many of the proteins are marinated in the same ingredients.   When I went to settle the bill, our waiter said he did not think our coupon would be accepted, but he would check with the manager.  Once he returned and told us it would not be accepted, I asked him to send the manager over who reiterated that only a hard copy of the coupon would be accepted and not one printed off the Zip Code Magazine website.  The obvious question that he could not explain was how does the consumer know that some coupons (originals from the magazine) would be accepted while those printed off the website would not?  He said he would confirm the policy with the main office, but I seriously doubt anyone was working at 8PM on a Monday night. Instead he just scrawled out a hand written note of apology reiterating their (his?) policy.  I decided he was anal retentive and would not budge so I just paid full price."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was terrible! My friends and I had 5 different servers and the manager could not explain to us why. Our first server was rude and I told him that I've been to this restaurant back home in California but he made it sound like they were totally different, which confused me. Then the first server had to clock out, our second server came and took our second order and then the food took too long that we told two other servers we were just waiting on the food then they brought us the food, then after receiving that food, they brought our same order but there was a confusion, they ordered our food twice which we didn't do at all and then they messed up our order. Then our fourth server came and he was nice, he kept on checking up on us to see if our food was ready, besides everyone else, then we were finished with our food and then there was another server that came and we told him that we were ready for our check. We paid with cash and card between three people, and we told the waiter that the cash is for the two people and the rest is on the card, our waiter asked if we wanted change and we said no. They bring us back the check and they charged my friend more on her card and thought we were splitting the cost which we already explained to him. Then we talk to the manager, she heard our complaint, but did not do anything to appeal to our problem, she did not offer any discount for the terrible service we received that night, she just told us sorry and also she hopes to see us again."}
{"text":"Food coma! This place is delicious. We tried about half the menu and everything was very yummy! Definitely going back. It was very packed but worth the wait."}
{"text":"However when we got our bill we were paying cash and Tori gave us a rude and displeased look when we asked for change. (A $17 tip?! Yes, change please!)  Other than this our visit was great and it was a wonderful way to start out our New Years celebration!"}
{"text":"Went on double date with my sister and bro in law. The wait wasn't too long, I guess because it was a Wednesday night. The meat came to the table pretty fast, some good and some ok. The waiter was attentive enough. The price was good, it's all you can eat for $19.99 per person. I would recommend trying it because it was a cool experience."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, and not too smoky spot for Korean BBQ. Our server Austin was on point and made sure we were taken care of. He suggested some good soju and meats to start the evening.  We started with the odds and ends first. Intestines and tongue were good, but needed quite a bit of cooking time. The volcano chicken was not as spicy as I thought it would be, but was one of my favorites. The ribs were a definite hit too. Andrew the bartender made a tasty and pretty soju mojito. Banchans (side dishes) were refilled frequently which was nice. Dinner service got busier later in the evening causing a slight delay in our table getting the meats we ordered, so some of the table mates were a little hungry in between orders.   Lastly, for large groups, you can only split the check 3 ways. They can take 2 different credit cards and the third payment would be cash for the remainder of the balance. Which made math time extra fun after we had a round of drinks, but we figured it eventually. Overall, decent bbq, good service, and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"This location of Gen is in their soft opening phase right now. We went tonight and had a great experience. The service was incredible and the food was really good. Hopefully they can keep it up because it seemed like the service at the Henderson location could be hit or miss.  It's been a few months since we went to the Henderson location but there seemed to be a few differences between this location and the last time we went to the Henderson one. This Gen had two kinds of salt vs. just the green tea salt at Henderson. The galbi at this location also came bone-in whereas the galbi at Henderson was boneless. This location is less busy for now, but I'm sure it'll fill up as word gets out.  One negative about this location is that the ventilation isn't as good as the Henderson location, at least at our table. Other than that though, for sure a great experience overall and we're very happy to see Gen come to this part of town."}
{"text":"Came at a perfect time when they offering free meal vouchers on a Monday!!! Location is in front of the Sunset Galleria Mall in Henderson!! For your cravings of AYCE KBBQ this is the spot in Vegas!!! Excellent service as well"}
{"text":"Night club setting is more important than the food. Major headaches after dining. Could be the loud club music or the massive amounts of MSG."}
{"text":"Service is good. Fast. Nice.  Food is good. Quality is good. Favorites. Hawaiian pork belly smoked garlic pork belly. Mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, hard to beat price!  Arrived around 7pm, the place was packed, party of four, able to be seated right away.  My go-to choices for meat: -premium steak -beef brisket -beef tongue -beef belly -Hawaiian steak -galbi -shrimp -pork belly All that meat with unlimited salad, can't go wrong--didn't ruin my diet, left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"**No rice paper** We love coming here because it's closer than Korea town, they have all their appetizers included in their AYCE price and the meats are pretty good, so it's very worth the price. But the last few times we've gone here, they have told us they \"don't have RICE PAPER today\" and this has been the case for the last 2 visits. It's an off menu item but we absolutely love the rice paper and I'm afraid they no longer serve it. Someone please let me know if anyone's come more reverent and have had it!"}
{"text":"We had such a great time celebrating my boyfriends bday with yummy food and great service. Austin B really went above and beyond for us. Try getting him you will leave happy with a smile on your face"}
{"text":"Came in today for lunch! It was 16.99, not bad at all! It's just like every Korean bbq joint. Their meats were pretty delicious! And their side dishes were okay, not too much flavor going on. Their side salad was delicious thought! I love the dressing ! I favorite was the garlic pork belly and spicy pork bulgogi !! The tofu soup was bland. I was sad . Maybe my taste buds were off the charts from the flavors of the meats. LOL . I wish they had more appetizers.. but who comes for appetizers at a kbbq joint? LOL maybe just me. I like variety !   The service was good. Everyone was very nice! The hostess greeted us, and told us about the menu, because it was our first time, it was helpful !! And the server pat was awesome!! Thanks you guys for the great service !"}
{"text":"Our review for today 5/18  We came in for dinner because it was my birthday ! One of the best Korean bbq that I love , the hostess in the front was so awesome , I didn't get the girls name , but she was the sweetest .   Our server was Teri or terry , lol . He was soooo awesome , awesome service , awesome attitude , overall my dinner was GREAT , and they even sang happy birthday to me , that literally made my day even better , I would recommend terry as your server. All around awesome !!  Thank you gen's for the singing."}
{"text":"The best service I had here by far, and the food was great.  I would normally rate it a 3 but today because of our server, Seong, we had a fantastic dinner.  He was very attentive and was very fast with everything we asked.  He was working during dinner hours.  I hope I get him every time I come."}
{"text":"Thanks to Server Kevin and Busser Terry for making our first time experience here a great one.  The service was on point and the busser was super friendly.  The food A+++ Great tasting :)  I will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"The best korean bbq  in the entire las vegas valley! Food was awesome and the service was great. Our server Ozzy went bove and beyond and was super friendly and gave us excellent service. Thank you for the wonderful lunch service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were on vacation and was looking for a wing place at the galleria mall in Henderson.. Found Yakiniku heaven instead! Gen Korean bbq house!! We were lucky enough to beat the dinner rush AGAIN (still on Hawaiian time)! Quickly seated and our server Ozzy WAS ON IT! Our first few dishes were our in a matter of minutes and we were on our way foodie heaven! Ozzy was alert to every need and made our experience an enjoyable one! When we get back to Vegas, we're gonna go see him and the gang at Gen!"}
{"text":"Went here on a sunday night and there was an hour wait! I don't mind waiting for a good meal and it was!  When we were seated there were some side dishes already at the table.  We already knew what we wanted to try so we ordered away. Edamame, potstickers, tofu, fried chicken for apps. Bulgogi, galbi, spicy pork, more galbi later and pork belly.  Food was tasty and better than I expected for an ayce joint. Service was great, we were checked on many times throughout the meal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've anticipated this location since I heard that Gen Kbbq has made its mark in Arizona. My boyfriend and I waited 2.5 hours before getting a table on a Saturday, which was expected. However, we came the Monday after for lunch and waited only 10 minutes. The verdict - it provides the same great service as the ones I've been back home in Northern California and Las Vegas (Yes, I drove to Vegas for my Gen fix! I was that desperate). The atmosphere was lively and the interior was gorgeous. Same great sides, meats and drinks. My only complaint is their Tofu soup, which is normally served in a hot clay pot, boiling hot.. which it wasn't. The soup was served in a bowl and came out luke warm, flavorless and disappointing."}
{"text":"Introduction: So while we were on our way to Cheesecake Factory, we saw this amazing Korean BBQ Gen.  Therefore, we decided to stop here instead of Cheesecake Factory. So excited that they put one here, WHOO HOO!  Customer Service: 5/5 So there's quite a few Gens in CA, their service is not quite as good in comparison to this one.  Which we stopped going. Everyone was on point at this location and our orders were served quite fast.  I hope they don't lose this awesome service when they get busier in the future.  That tends to happen after a business gets picked up, they lose their  loyalty to their customers that once bring them revenue to stay in business.  Price: 5/5 Omg! Finally a REAL Korean BBQ that belongs here. The Menu is outstanding with such an amazing price.  Most importantly, it's simple, in both pricings and categories.  I have a hard time locating a Korean BBQ restaurant here in Vegas that is buffet. And when they are, the meats are not AYCE or the Menu is annoyingly complicated.  With this pricing, you can only order this and/or that or, it's not a buffet. WTF? Super annoying well not at Gen, simple to the Max.   Atmosphere: 5/5 Gorgeous, cozy and Modern! I love the fact that the grill is kinda deep, therefore, you avoid the splashing. In addition, the ventilation is exceptional. I usually have to change after lunch from the one in CA. I did not have to do that here.   Quality: 5/5 One word OUTSTANDING! Everything was so freakin amazing, even the pre cooked items. I can not say that there's one item in the Menu I do not care for.  Everything we ordered were YUMMY!  Quantity: 5/5 A LOT, so much I could not walk afterwards.  They don't serve you those tiny little annoying small steam rice bowls that I always had to order two. Here, one is enough.  Every portion was super generous.    Tips to the Owner: Please ensure your TEAM don't lose their momentum, in both service and their attentiveness.  Right now, they are AMAZING, I will always be back and give you guys referrals if it stays like this."}
{"text":"Very clean and fine establishment. Probably one of the best Gen experience. I go to Gen in Cali since I live in LA. However, discovering a Gen at Las Vegas is a real treat to have. Great service and meat quality! Definitely will recommend."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of cooking my own food but I have to say this place was amazing. And the price for dinner was not bad at all for all you can eat. The service was as good as the food AMAZING!! I can't wait to bring our 3 boys here.  The cucumbers that look like pickles are to die for."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! The meat is excellent! There are a variety of choices and the side dishes are great! The staff comes around every so often to refill drinks, change the grill, and take more orders.  We never had to wait for more than 30 mins and even then, you can just look around at stores nearby. I wish the price is cheaper but for how good the food is, I can't complain."}
{"text":"Very quick seating and ordering. Portions are big- American size!  We tried beef, pork and chicken. All were very good. Wait staff are knowledgeable and always there to help. Kimchi and other side dishes were fine too, although I prefer kimchi quite a bit hotter. I like the \"Gen\" name and meaning and Chinese character.   What is missing is obviously good OB Korean draft beer- they should also serve Asahi, Kirin and/or Sapporo. They should also give us a disposable plastic apron to shield our fashionable attire from the splatter."}
{"text":"Finally! I've been to the Gen's in California and loved it, so you can bet that when I discovered they were here in Arizona I wept tears of joy. I exaggerate but I can guarantee that I was terribly excited.   Pricing is $24.99, $15.99 for weekday lunches. I really wish they were here when I was in college so I could take advantage of the lunch pricing but unfortunately, full priced it is. Their service is awesome. They are on the ball with your orders, which is crucial with your two hour time limit. They switch out your grill the moment it gets dirty, and on top of all that, they were efficient in getting us our free flowing drinks - my experience was all I could ask for from Gen's.  I should probably back up and explain all you can eat Korean BBQ: check in with the hostess, wait for a text to say your table's ready, sit, decide on a drink, order dishes of raw meat, wait twenty seconds for said raw meat, and throw it on the grill, and grill away! I believe there's a two plate limit per person per round of orders but the grill isnt quite big enough for more anyway. There's also a two hour time limit so keep those orders going and keep on grilling.  I'm so full."}
{"text":"best korean food in las vegas,our server jennifer is amazing person great service!!!!!!!she is also beautiful ....."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole this place is an oven. I understand that it is a BBQ place, but when I mentioned the heat to our waiter, he said that the A/C was broken. He did a good job letting us know that it was broken and that they were in the process of fixing it the past few days, but buy some fans! A/C aside, the food was fine, but not worth $16 per person in flavor. Plus, with it being 100 degrees in the restaurant, it was nauseating eating in the heat! We ordered a little bit of everything, but most of it was just okay. Our actual waiter was fine, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad. He walked by us a few times to help other tables without checking in on us, but I didn't feel forgotten about. Overall, it was a very meh food and customer service experience, but for the price and the heat it was totally not worth $40+ with tip for two lunches."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Horrible service. Get there before 9:30 PM even though it says 11 PM closing. They will serve you some bullshit story of why you need to get your order in ASAP. No way to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Breaking my habit of 4 star reviews. It's my second time in a week here. The meats are awesome and the service is impeccable. It was slow initially but they were changing shifts so that was probably what happened. After that, our plates were taken away quickly and drinks filled promptly like the first time. Today we had our usual fill of cow tongue, rib eye, squid, octopus, and brisket. The sides were good. Nothing exceptional but I came for the meats, truth be told. The octopus is a bit spicy though. Squid was, well squid. Not much flavor to that sucker. Maybe next time I will put some salt on it when grilling it. The meats here are really good for the price of admission.  They bring the food quick and everything seems automated. Even the check out process.they bring the cash register to you literally, albeit in a miniature way.  The edamame (soy beans) were good and the soup was tasty, not too spicy. It came with chunks of tofu today and not the squash from the other day. We also got the fried chicken and man was it crispy! And good too! You have to try it because it's not your KFC or Popeyes chicken. It's fried twice and REALLY crispy.  I give them 5 stars because the food is great but service is awesome too so all in all I give them a 4+1. I think for the price, food, quality, and service, this place wins hands down. If you want to pay 25% more, by all means, try to find a better one. I don't think you will find one as I have not either.  The service is probably the best for Korean places and among the best for all Asian places. They know what you want before you do it seems. I hope it stays that way and not because of the newness. Not that I am stereotyping Asian restaurants but if it quacks like a duck. Besides, I am one of those guys who grimaces when he sees an ugly baby and can't say it out loud \"man that's one ugly winkly baby\" while everyone else expounds praises. Yeah, if Jerry/Elaine/Kramer/George were real, I'd be in their living room/kitchen all the time.  One bit of advice, get here before 6pm if you can. The place piles on fast. I leave my number and they text you when you should start heading back. I usually mozy along the mall since there is seating for 7-8 people in the waiting area inside and I feel kind of weird staring at people after a while (I run out of expression less gazes in about 5 min....lightweight)"}
{"text":"THE WORST customer service. My debit card was charged 8 TIMES (at $130 each) because they couldn't figure out how to manage the check with a larger party. Amazing food and great table side service, but be careful with paying the bill."}
{"text":"Finally! Ayce kbbq in Henderson! Being barely opened it was nice that there wasn't a huge line like back in SoCal. Food was good as useful and Lisa, our server was great! Will definitely being coming back. Just dreading the longer lines once people find out about this place!"}
{"text":"After going to college in California, it was nice to finally get a Korean barbecue place in Tempe. The food is great, the service was good, and it's well air condition which is always a huge plus in Arizona. I would definitely recommend trying all the meats if you can. The most efficient way of decreasing wait times is to always order some cook's food in addition to the food that you will be grilling. Definitely try out the volcano chicken and the regular Korean Fried Chicken in addition to your other meats."}
{"text":"I am giving it a 2 because my Mango-Tini was about the whole thing I liked about the whole experience. I'm not sure when they opened but they do have several things to work on. I'm not really into of the \"whole own cooking\" experience but my other half thought it would be nice to try new things. They didn't really explain anything too well in the beginning. I think they should have some cooking spray at the table. Not a very good experience. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We had been to the Tustin, CA location (as we used to live in Orange County), and we always said, \"they need to open one of these in Vegas\"! We're so excited you did.  The restaurant hires great servers/staff. We had Kevin last night and he was great.  The food quality and ambiance are amazing.  We will definitely be back often. The only thing I was a little bummed about is that some of the appetizers are seasonal.  The bean sprouts in particular are one of my favorites...but at least they had the potato salad. Enjoyed our time there, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The idea seems great, and the food options were great, but the service was less than ideal. I came here on a date and neither of us knew what to do. No one explained it to us after we said we've never been here. No one helped us turn on the burner. When we ran out of rice we had to asked for more and they only brought out one cup at a time. It has potential or maybe it would have been better with another waiter..."}
{"text":"This was literally one of the most average Korean barbecue restaurants I've ever gone too. We came for early lunch and the options were very unpleasant. The waiters themselves were very attentive and the food came out very quick. But the quality and marination of the food didn't taste that great. They didn't have a lot of the menu options that general Korean BBQ restaurants offer but at the same time they had a variety of other items on their menu for lunch that are not available at other Korean bbq restaurants. If you're looking for a spot that just gets that Korean barbecue craving out of your system then by all means, but overall this place would not be my number one spot to go to While in Vegas"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the meat here. I came with my work team, 9 of us total, and we shared 2 tables. We ordered pretty much everything on the lunch menu with the exception of the beef tongue. I just didn't like the quality of any of it. Its no surprise that it is an amazing deal for all you can eat meat in 2 hours, but my sentiment is that the quality was low and low quality makes it not worth it."}
{"text":"This places is the best Korean BBQ I've ever been too. And they have amazing service. Every one here is so friendly and helpful, our server Luna was awesome :)  definitely a place to check out and you can't beat the price. $19.95 for all you can eat dinner."}
{"text":"Minju had speedy service and was very nice. I love the ambience of this place. Meat looks fresh. I'm happy that there is finally a korean BBQ place in Henderson. The smoke just gets sucked out through the grill directly so your clothes don't smell too bad when you get out."}
{"text":"First time having Korean Bbq! Although the wait was a bit long, service was fantastic. The food was really great. My favorite was the spicy bulgogi and roast beef. Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and I loved it. The cod was good and it was fun and engaging getting to make your own food. I do think thy should give some advice with how long the food takes to cook as it may be challenging for someone inexperienced in cooking.   The environment and atmosphere was very modern and clean. The service was great as well.   I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"First of all, THE WAIT TIME FOR GETTING A TABLE IS HORRIBLE, about 2-3 hours (maybe longer) on Friday and Saturday nights. This is similar to wait times at Gen Korean BBQ in Los Angeles.   That said, after you finally get seated, the food and service are amazing! The meats are marinated perfectly and sauces are simple, yet very tasty. The service is fast and accurate, and serving sizes are generous.  Despite the long wait times, I've gone back to Gen several times, both in LA and in Tempe, because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"My family and I are food critics on our own and have quite a follower.  GEN Korean BBQ house was recommended by a friend.   We travelled 25 miles from our place to try this place and it was well worth it.  The crew are so nice and helpful.  Kevin is the best.  He diligently and patiently explains the menu and he frequently checks up on you to make sure everything is okay. Food is great. Proportion is just right for an all you can eat Korean BBQ place. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Everyone is friendly and I like how one person says one thing and the whole staff yells something in return. It makes me feel welcoming!   Also love when they yell HAPPY HOUR!   Not much to say, this restaurant is great place to stop by especially if you're hungry. I don't like that the side salads are already at the table - who knows how long they've been sitting there for! But they have a great selection of meats and I love that they change their grill for you because who would wanna cook on a burnt grill anyways?"}
{"text":"The food and experience was awesome here. Went here on Veterans Day and enjoyed the great food. I love ordering the brisket and the beef tongue, but what made my experience the best was our server Jaenica. She recommended the spicy pork and the bulgogi which were amazing. Her service was on point and we also had the sides refilled without being asked. Try this place out for great all you can eat Korean barbeque with awesome service, as long as you get Jaenica as your server."}
{"text":"\"Ozzy\" was a great server! 5 star customer service! Very satisfied with the service! Very delicious and great service!"}
{"text":"This one probably has the worst korean bbq among many korean restaurant I've been to. The pork belly is nowhere near fresh. I don't want to strike too harsh on the food quality since it's ayce, and the price is pretty fair, but it could be better.  Anyway, the servers were very attentive, even though it was almost full when we were there. Very nice decorations and bar area which helps this place to retain 3 stars."}
{"text":"Found this place online and went the next day. Simply put this place rocks. Fresh ingredients along with unbelievable accompaniments. The staff was amazing and helpful. The restaurant was very clean and the decor calm and inviting. The manager came by and you could totally see his attention to detail. Without a doubt we will be back. Great experience."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight with some coworkers for the first time and it was great!!! We had fast service provided by our server jaeneca she was super helpful and fun and brought our orders super quick! Definitely coming back whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place great love the feel and food we will be coming back. Kayleigh was one of the many great servers at our table"}
{"text":"5.0 Stars  Location Overview:  This awesome restaurant can be found at the Sunset Galleria mall. The environment here felt like this high-end place and was great.   Customer Service: After living in South Korea for several years it is so great to come back to the US and see places like this live up to the food that I miss from the motherland. Being that a good friend had never eaten at a place like this we had the waitress explain how it works. The staff was more than attentive.   Quality/Quantity: The quality and quantity was so on point and I left way more full and happy.  Side Notes: Expand your horizon's and check this awesome place out."}
{"text":"It was a very busy night, but the wait staff was excellent. Fresh ingredients, delicious food. The staff was very attentive, and the price for our meal was very reasonable. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"14.95for a all u can eat restaurant is soooo worth. 5 star for the price and the decoration.  Meat was good, remember enjoy the chicken with cheese. Spicy Baby octopus was yummy which is worth order twice or more. Beef and chicken there were really thick, cut in pieces b4 or while u cooking. The spicy pork is also perfect. Need to change the grill often or if u don't mind. No oil on the grill so it always make meat over cooked."}
{"text":"First time coming here to this restaurant.  Food was good.  All you can eat for $15.99 Lunch, 2 hour limit.  Service was awesome.  Shout to our server Dakota.  Your amazing, he kepts checking up on us.  Thank you!  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this Korean BBQ spot! They have two locations here in the Valley. This one is located between Decatur and Sahara. So glad they built another location up here near my house but at the same time no because this is where I will be spending all my money lol!  Great atmosphere. Dim setting with cool blue neon lights. Plenty of decent size flat screen television for entertainment.  Once seated you have your appetizers all set up so you could dig right in!  Menu is pretty simple to read with over 30 choices items to cook on your grill. Ranging from steaks, beef, pork, chicken, shrimp and calamari!  It's an endless all you can eat! Worth every buck!"}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant for dinner if you want all you can eat Korean bbq style meat. Huge selection of different marinated meats and also yummy appetizers to choose from.  This place gets pretty busy during dinner time so be aware that the wait time for a table might be long. The atmosphere and design of the place is really nice and I enjoyed the big projector screen.  Once we got our table we were greeted immediately and our server was very nice and helped us with our order. I really enjoyed the brisket and the spicy bulgogi selections and they were all very juicy.  The meat does not take long to cool and it's a fun experience with family or friends. The servers use cool touchscreen pads to take our orders and the meat comes to our table pretty quick.  I really appreciate when one of the servers request for a grill change because over time our grill gets really greasy and dirty and we probably had our grill changed 4 times.  The overall service was excellent and will definitely recommend eating here for dinner.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to go for lunch or dinner. Make sure you are hungry because its a lot of food and all excellent. and fun."}
{"text":"This is great! We are a fan of Korean BBQ ayce and a frequent customer of Manna BBQ in San Diego. We are at our vacation home in Las Vegas and looked up best Korean BBQ and found Gen in Henderson.  So our standards started out pretty high.  The meats are delicious and a huge variety for the price! The sides are also wonderful and tasty.  They don't have steamed eggs but they offer a big selection of appetizers that are pretty good.  The environment is one of the best and very hip and trendy, with blue LEDs to create the ambiance!  Hopefully, it will be kept up and cleanliness not let go. The only negative I have is the shortness on wait staff.  They have so many hostesses up front, who btw don't seem too sharp; but waitstaff availability was a bit scarce; they were excellent but just very busy and not enough of them.  Enjoyed our meal and will return and hope they address the shortness on waitstaff."}
{"text":"By far one of the best in value KBBQ I've ever been to.  @ $24.99 per person for AYCE for 2 hrs is nothing to write home about. But at that price for the amount of entrees you can choose from is beyond awesome.  There were over 20 different type of meats, veggies, and snack items to choose from.  We tried pretty much everything on the menu and everything tasted delicious.  Only caveat to the whole situation is that they only allow you to order 4 dishes at a time.  For us it was perfect because between 2 people, it gave us a good flow of food coming and allowed us to eat at a reasonable pace.    Atmosphere in here felt like I was eating in the middle of a night club.  It was very different but in a good way.  KBBQ to me is a meal you eat while hanging out with friends and this was definitely a nice place to chill and eat with friends or family.  The blue lights all over gave this place a relaxing ambiance with the music blasting in the background and sports playing on the TV at the bar, it was a nice combo that is sure to please anyone coming to the establishment.They do offer wine, beer, and liquor here which was nice.   If everything was so great, why didn't we give this place a 5*.  First off, there were only about 7 side dishes.  I'm a huge fan of KBBQ for their side dishes and it was kind of a let down to see such a nice meal go with so few side dishes.  Some of my favorite items like the fish cake wasn't even available.  Second, there were no sauces.  We didn't ask for any but for sure there were none at the table and none was made available when they were setting up.  All we got upon sitting was a place with some seasoning salts.  The meats themselves were not dry by any means but it would have been nice to have some type of dipping sauce to curb all the salty and sweet marinate of the meats.  Wait time was about an hr so make sure to make reservations if you plan to bring a big party.  Overall I was very please with my meal and what It cost and the variety of foods I had to choose from.  OH AND YES!! GYOZA was part of the meal and you can get as much as you'd like.  Happy eating."}
{"text":"Suuuper tasty! This LA chain is definitely the best all you can eat kbbq in terms of food, service, and cook it yourself experience. Go tos would be the Hawaiian pork belly, chicken fondue, bulgogi, and KFC. Go for the volcano KFC if you hate feeling your mouth and/or want to open a deminsion to hell. I'd skip the beef tongue, nothing real special about it. I've had better in a taco. Sides are okay but really who's coming for the vegetables? Things to know before you go: - There's probably going to be at least a one to two hour wait after 5pm Fri-Sun. - Children taller than 40 inches will be charged as a $25 adult during dinner hours. Under 40 inches are $10. - Stated on the menu you can only dine in for no more than 2 hours.  ....If you're offered rice at the beginning of your meal just say no! It's all about the meat, baby!"}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas last month, and my wife and I ate lunch here. For $16.99 AYCE, wow, what a deal.  Service wAs great, our food arrived promptly to put on the grill, drinks always kept full, and the grill plate swapped out twice to make sure we could cook up our proteins! My favorite protein was the bulgogi, we ordered 3-4 plates of this. Pork belly was good, maybe could have been sliced a little thinner as it took awhile to cook and if not cooked through, it is chewy. The only thing we didn't care for was the shrimp and squid, the shrimp were fine just a bit fishy ( it is seafood tho) and re squid was way too chewy.  For dessert we each had a macaron (mango and strawberry). We love these.  I definitely recommend this place, makes me want to explore similar concepts where I'm from."}
{"text":"So delicious and the prices are so reasonable price and great customer service love their selection and appetizers great family environment"}
{"text":"I've tried the location in Tustin, CA and although this location doesn't have some of the same items, it has other unique yummy meats! Service is impeccable. Kevin was our server [we were a party of 2] he was knowledgeable about all the meats and was able to explain what each one was that we weren't familiar with. Atmosphere was very nice compared to any other kbbq I've been to. I would definitely come again and recommend Gen to my friends."}
{"text":"We took the brood there for lunch.   Upon arrival,  we were greeted by a friendly hostess. The design of the place was big and glamorous compared to the mom and pop Korean BBQ places that I have been to. The server greeted us. He seemed pretty young and inexperienced and definitely very busy. We what are the vegetables for my wife in we had to ask 3 times to get them. We decided to try the AYCE. I thought they would have had a lower price for lunch but on Sunday it's the same price as it is for dinner. That was disappointing.  The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. The kids enjoyed watching me cook the food on the grill which is always fun. But overall, I will stick to the mom and pop Korean BBQ places."}
{"text":"Hate the wait but love food! Terrible management. Rude customer service. I wouldn't be surprised if the BBB shuts them down."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was mediocre. They won't take more than three credit cards for a large party and it took over 30 minutes to get our credit cards back when we were trying to leave."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying my friends and I are so excited that a Gen has finally opened in Arizona. We would only go to Gen whenever we were in Vegas or California.   There have been a couple times where I've tried to go to Gen, but the wait was at least 2 hours. With that being said I suggest to go for lunch or an early dinner around 5pm because if you try to go at 7pm most likely the wait will be right before closing.   My friends and I decided on an early dinner and arrived to Gen at 5pm, and we were seated right away. It was just frustrating because we were seated right away but no one came to greet us or asked us for any drinks orders for at least 10 minutes. We kept looking around like is anyone going to help us? When someone finally assisted us, we immediately started putting orders in because I'm not sure if it's like Vegas or Cali with a 2 hour limit. There were multiple times where orders were missing, and drinks were missing, which I understand cause they get busy and side tracked, but it came to a point where we had 2 waitresses assist us.   When it came to paying the bill, we knew from the get go that they can only take up to 3 cards because thats just their policy. For this location that meant they can only split it 3 ways, meaning you can't have 3 cards and the rest of the people pay cash. Which was confusing cause other locations did that no problem by just splitting the check for each individual.   Other than that, the food was amazing per usual. Hands down the best Korean bbq I've ever had, and it's even better that it's all you can eat. I suggest saving your appetite before coming here then go all out and order as much as you can. I recommend the spicy bulgogi, the regular pork bulgogi, Hawaiian pork belly, and the jap chae."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite KBBQ in Arizona. Great service and atmosphere. The lines can be a little long on the weekends and during peak dinner hours, but I usually go during the weekdays from 6-6:30pm and there is almost always no wait! If you like Soju, I recommend the Capri-Soju. It's like an adult Capri-sun! You can also never go wrong with the beef bulgogi and galbi."}
{"text":"Food is great! Mizzo was very helpful and there was no wait at all with food and table. Would recommend to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner there, was Delish. We normally eat at Sura for Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, but lately the quality and choices at Sura have been disappointing for the price. So Gen is very refreshing and a welcome relief!!! Not only do the have appetizers, they have an extensive array of meat and seafood options for entrees and the price is much more appealing for only $20 for dinner!!! Kailin was our server and was very friendly and very accommodating. It was our first time so she explained every and recommended what we should try. The roast beef and spicy chix were very good as well as the Kalbi.   I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good Korean BBQ. It's a great price for AYCE and great selection of food and friendly people."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of Gen in Henderson.  The service is always excellent and fast, which if you've read my review of the Gen in Henderson, you'll know that's almost unheard of in any Korean restaurants.  This Gen on Sahara meets all my expectations and I am super happy that there's now not only one close to my house but one close to my office!  The meat is always decent, some much better than the others.  For example, the beef tongue.  No one I've introduced beef tongue to at Gen has ever disliked them.    The price is more than reasonable. Actually, it makes you wonder what kind of margin they are running at because it's just so much bang for your buck!    I don't see why I should try other Korean BBQ anymore because Gen has everything I want and need.  I highly recommend any locations of Gen."}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear they finally have a Korean BBQ in the Henderson area and was even more excited after I had a chance to eat here a few nights ago.   It's located next to the Red Robin; easy access from the parking lot.  You don't have to go into the mall for the entrance; a definite plus.   Upon arrival, I was greeted right away and the staff was super friendly and helpful.    Ozzy was our server and was very attentive and friendly, but what is more amazing is the other servers who aren't assigned to our table.  Everyone was eager to help and attentive to make sure we have everything we need.    The decor was very hip and club-like but with great lighting.    I think their selection of meats for the price is great.  They even have happy hours from 9:30 pm to closing.    I would definitely come back and recommend Gen, not only for the food but for the great service."}
{"text":"Similar experience to a couple other reviews- don't know where these favorable ones are coming from- Certainly not from usual patrons of Korean BBQ from Portland- or LA- LOL.  But anyway, like the other party of 6 we were seated at that back table. The grill was hardly warm. It would have taken several hours to cook a reasonable amount of food for 6 people. Management was downright cruel- not just rude. The meat was sitting on the table becoming a health hazard along with the food on the barely warm grill. Compared to a proper grill given at every other Korean BBQ establishments that we have ever been to (many)- this grill was a joke and one might question if they do this on purpose since this is \"all you can eat.\" There are many other much better places for Korean BBQ. Do your homework! :) Sort by low reviews!! You will read the truth!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The service is excellent and they were very accommodating.  We were here before the lunch rush, like right after they opened, and there were six of us. They sat us at one of their big booths that only had one grill. It was hard as heck first because there was six of us and waiting for food was no bueno. It would have been nicer if they sat us at their other tables that had two grills.  We requested to have us move and instead of moving us to the two grill table they split us into 2 groups of 3. I  suppose that was better than one grill.  Each time we ordered meat, we ordered some Gyoza. And they were bomb as fuck!! So while waiting for the meat to cook, we were eating something. And I love gyoza and their gyoza was bomb.   They didn't have egg which was kind of lame.  They don't do half orders of meat which was odd. It was hard because after awhile you don't know if you're going to finish the meat and they charge you for not finishing so not being able to go half order was hard.   The meat tasted pretty good there, they also had seafood which I'm not a fan of but my group was so they seemed to enjoy it.  I rate this place a 4 because they have great service, the food was great and the ambiance was nice. I would have given this place a 5 but they didn't have egg and they don't do half orders."}
{"text":"Ew: brisket, beef tongue, hanjungsal, samgyupsal, tofu soup, ALL of the banchans, service  Okay: steak, galbisal, potato salad  Great: rice paper, sapporo pitcher during happy hour  Overall, not worth paying to eat. I hope to see a good quality kbbq ayce in town soon."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how this place got average 4 stars review, but the food sucks!!!! For those that gave this place 4 stars or more, they should visit Hwaro on Spring Mountain to see the difference. I first visited Gen when they first opened in Henderson and I thought the food was mediocre, nothing worth driving out of the way for. Recently, I happened to be in the area and stopped by (after seeing 4 stars rating) to check it out again. Believe or not, the place and food actually got much worse. The meat quality was awful; the beef was so bland, looked old and dry, almost like the juice has left the meat. The place was kinda dirty and the hostesses were unfriendly. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the waitress Shea. She was the only good thing about this place. She greeted you with a smile and kept checking up customers regularly even if she got so many tables to cover. Good job Shea!!! Bad job Gen!!!"}
{"text":"This isn't your ordinary Korean BBQ restaurant! It is actually new and for the price, the service and the atmosphere, you can't beat it. If you like Korean BBQ especially All You Can Eat, I definitely suggest this as a bucket list when you're in Las Vegas, it's a little ways off the strip but definitely worth it!  The set up is pretty modern. It almost looks like a nice night/bar club, with neon lights to eccentric the visuals and seating from high top tables to regular booth tables. Unlike most KBBQ places, this place is well ventilated and doesn't hit you with that strong BBQ smoke smell. The ventilation system used here is actually different from others that I've experienced. Most other places have an overhead vent that sucks the smoke out, however here, they have it built into the actual stove. So when you are cooking you meals, the smoke is instantly sucked right back down. Don't worry it doesn't affect the taste, or smell of the food.  The price to do all you can eat was only $14.95 and that included your big list of meats to choose from, up to 20 different types of meat! You can't beat that, most other places only give you from a range of 3 - 6 types of meat. Also to add, the All you can eat also includes appetizers! So for that price and the ability to PIG OUT, definitely can't pass that up. I would definitely recommend to try everything! The different marination of pork bellies, to bulgogi, to cajun shrimps and squids.   If you are wanting to enjoy a alcoholic beverage, they also have a bar there that serve pretty good signature drinks. I had a Lychee Martini and it was on point! Especially for the price of $2.83! If I wasn't so beat up from Sin City, I would have ordered more!   The service is great, all the servers take time to come serve you and help one another out. They are also using modern technology (tablets) to take your order so that helps expedite ordering. They even use a tablet with a portable receipt printer so you don't even have to wait long to pay, they'll take care of you right then and there!  Definitely recommend! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what is going on with Gen. They took rice paper off their menu and steamed egg. I ordered the tofu soup came in just a bowl so it was cold fast most places bring it in the stone bowl so it stays warm longer. I don't think it's worth the $24.99 not to have everything on the menu. The meat was not the best either.  I didn't like that the music they play was explicit being a family restaurant. I don't usually mind old school music but use clean version especially with little kids around. Servers were friendly I can't remember the name of the girl that we had but she was good. The only thing that sucked was we waited almost 15 min for our last plate we ordered. Probably won't be returning back to Gen in Az!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here because it's generally new and clean, I love that the vents are in the grill vs a vent above. (I don't smell like Korean BBQ after) Brisket is super good and I love their spicy pork bulgogi! It's really not spicy but a nice kick and great flavor. Their side are pretty good nothing crazy, but I do enjoy the mashed potatoes they serve. The server was really nice as well, super attentive.   The only issue was with their new macaroons in the case by the check in desk. When we first got there to put our names down, I was looking at them and noticed A HAIR ON THE MACAROONS! I told the girl at the desk & assumed she took care of it. We left and came back when our booth was ready, about 45 minutes later, and the hair was still there!!!! Don't eat the macaroons."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Our waitress Jaenica is awesome. I definitely recommend her. We never have any issues or complaints while we're here. 10/10!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. So far everything that we've tried are really good. If you eat like a bird this place is not for you, you need to make your money's worth. They come out in orders of four. You get pretty full fast, so highly recommend not eating any starch. The kalbi (short ribs), pork belly I highly recommended. Definitely will be back to try others, since we got full our second round. AYCE is the place!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here. Called ahead to see if they were busy and they said no. Showed up to be informed that the air conditioner isn't working and the lady did not want us there so she continued to say it gets hot and nasty if you cook. I mean I would've told us over the phone that the air wasn't working.  And I would've tried to sell us on staying and eating. Oh wells. Saved me from eating here."}
{"text":"Bomb Korean BBQ for a bomb price. $20 AYCE dinner??? Count me in! Service is incredible and everyone is so sweet. I was never a fan of pork belly until I went to Gen, simply because no one really flavored their pork belly. But this was also back then when we didn't have all of these other KBBQ spots that have been opening up these past few years.  Their red wine pork belly is SO AMAZING!! Must try!! Smoked garlic is good too but the red wine... it's a must. I love pork belly now, way more than I used to love brisket. Which is a lot. I also recommend the Hawaiian steak I think it is..? It's some type of steak on the menu and it's so good.   They offer tons of options for dinner, including various appetizers. One being a spicy fried chicken that had me spitting fire... and I love spicy food. That chicken was something else.  I hate that gen opened up in Henderson, because it's so far so I'm hoping they open another location closer to my side of town sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Pretty sure they just gave me food poisoning. I bet those dishes on the table sit there for hours until someone sits down to eat them."}
{"text":"I reeeeeally didn't want to give this place 1 star, but I didn't have a choice. Let me start by saying this is my absolute favorite KBBQ place in LA (born and raised there, and I was so excited about its LV arrival). I live on the south west side, and am rarely ever in Henderson. Let's face it, if you're gonna cross the 15, it's gonna be a whole day event!  We tried to go in after the UNLV/UCLA game @ Sam Boyd, and figured we'd have plenty of time since they close at 12. We left the game at the start of the 4th quarter and got to the restaurant at 10:55pm, and figured we made it right on time. Unfortunately, the hostess informed us that they weren't taking any new tables. We asked them what time they close, and she said 12, but the kitchen closes at 11. We asked them, just for future reference, what time their last seating is, and she suggested we arrive at least by 10:30pm.   If that's the case, then there needs to be some kind of warning or signage or something! Unless it is mentioned otherwise, a restaurant's last seating is typically when the restaurant closes.   Definitely not sure if or when I'll be back because I have no idea when I'll be back in Henderson. I had such high hopes for this place and am really disappointed in my first visit there.   Sidebar: not sure how I feel about rumors of offering free beverages in exchange for good a review, either."}
{"text":"Not my first time on a Gen Korean restaurant so I was really looking forward to this one.  The service is a little slow but the food is definitely worth the wait. My family and I enjoyed it. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Gen is one of my favorite go to for Koren BBQ. Aaron is a new server on the floor, but he did an amazing job. So amazing that he's going to be my go to server every time I come in. Thank you Aaron for your wonderful service. Me and my boyfriend See you in again in a week. Lol"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and served with great speed, but the best part was the ambiance and service. Our server was Terry and he was great! He constantly asked how everything was and was a great people person. I would come again just for him.   I came back again and had Alodia as a server and she was amazing. She gave great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Great food. Been here a few times.but if you are not young and your over weight you get shity service."}
{"text":"This had to be one of the best Korean restaurants I have ever been too. The customer service was top notch and the food was excellent. Excellence great place"}
{"text":"Jaenica was an awesome server! Great customer service, great food, & great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a cool restaurant in a cool mall. For $24.99 per person you get unlimited meat (and veggies and Banchan) brought to your table where you cook it yourself on your own private grill plate.  You order four items at a time and they will ask if you want more before you are done cooking the previous items. The meats arrive at your table seasoned already most if the time. Almost everything I tasted was tasty and there were definitely more items on the menu I would have like to try when I threw in the towel!   My only criticism would be that the quality of some of the meats wasn't that good. And quite a few of the meats come to your table sliced so thin that they shrivel up to almost nothing after being on the grill.  The ambiance is nice, especially with the modern look and blue lights. It's VERY loud and we had to shout to hear each other at our table.   All in all, I would recommend this restaurant. Especially if you are a fan of tapas style."}
{"text":"So I was referred by a co-worker and decided to try this place on my bday.   Now before I get into my review...i need to let u know when my birthday is...yes...its on Valentine's Day!!   So normally I have to book one yr in advance at my favorite restaurants due to the fact that it's my birthday and Valentine's Day and normally it's hard to get a reservation...  But here I am one day prior to deciding to come check out this restaurant. I called at exactly 11 a.m and. a young lady answered the phone and politely took my reservations with no problems, no issues, no complaints.  Then the next day... they sent you a text message to confirm your reservation which I like so that's pretty cool..  So as my first time here ...the atmosphere is cool.. the bathrooms are clean but to me the tables were small.. You need space it's when you know what it is that you want to order... however the food was really good.. the flavor was good and even when you cooked it the meat was good..  For the menu and what you get I thought was pretty good so the only reason I gave four stars is because I wish there was a little bit more space for my dishes I don't like to rush when I eat...  All in all happy birthday to me I would come here again."}
{"text":"I was a little underwhelmed eating here tonight.  And I was pretty excited to eat here with my friends too!   Check In: First of all when they send me a text when my table was ready but they say \"your table will be ready soon\" is NOT the same as my table IS READY. It's either ready or it's not. So I didn't think anything of it so when I did check in with the hostess she said they gave my table away and that one is being bused and we'd be seated. Two other parties got seated before we got seated. First turn off.   Service: Was fine...   Food: Not much flavor and the sides were pathetic. Also, we found excess cartilage in our calamari. It's not our job to check what goes out on the table. We wanted Gyoza but they were out of that. The only memorable food item was the sesame chicken and the beef tongue.   Would I eat here again? No, I am forever faithful to Tofu Hut!!!"}
{"text":"For a new and upcoming AYCE BBQ joint this place is really bomb. I heard from all my friends that I needed to try it and I'm pretty happy that I listened.   Customer Service: 3/5  - Everybody was very nice and smiley. The issue I had was that the restaurant was super busy, instead of the waiter coming around and checking up on us we had to wave down the waiter or ask the bus boy to get him for me. I think if the staff was more prepared for the volume of customers then the service would be better.  Food: 4/5  - The food here was bomb! We ate here with a Korean local that ordered all of our food for us and let me tell you I'm glad we had her. The meats where very well seasoned and the portions were perfect for sharing and trying out all the different items on their menu. My issue comes with the rice, the first batch we got seemed like it was a day old and cold, the second just didn't taste right.  Presentation: 3/5  - The stove top that his restaurant uses is a stick top, not a non-stick top. All the meats we cooked got stuck to the stove and we had to rip it off just to flip it, not cool.   Price:  5/5  - For the amount off food and the quality of the food I can't complain about the price. For lunch AYCE is 15$ and for night AYCE it's 20$. Not a bad price at all and very reasonable  Overall: 4/5   - I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant, my wife and I loved it. If you like Korean BBQ, and if you are a fan of AYCE this place is for you. Just be prepared to wait a little bit to get a seat because this place is alway packed."}
{"text":"Ozzy has a really good smile and always so attentive! Always looking out if we needed a refill or wanted anymore orders of meat!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! The food is great and the service was even better. Eddy was very polite and I think he handled the situation very professionally especially since it was so busy. I highly recommend this place if you want a good time and good service."}
{"text":"I don't post reviews much unless I deem it necessary and this one is definitely necessary given my most recent dining experience. I have eaten here for the last time tonight after being a frequent customer for the past two years. (And for about 6 years prior to that when I lived in Cali).  Let me explain why.  1.)The menu has changed, and not in a good way.   No more rice paper..??  I've never in all my years ate at a \"Korean bbq\" that doesn't serve rice paper. It's part of the dining experience of Korean bbq. I was taken back by this as I found it appalling to say the least. I want to wrap my meaty treat in some carbs.   The salad went from basic diced romaine to this spring mix, and again never had this in any Korean bbq I've ever had.   They've basically taken the Korean out of kbbq, adding proteins slathered in sugar laden marinades as the \"star\" of the menu. They also included a \"Cajun\" marinade for the proteins as well. Still scratching my head on that one too.  Never known of Korean food to be Cajun inspired.   2.) The back of the house is awful  Every other time I've eaten here, even when busy the back of the house kicked ass at getting food out in a timely matter. Tonight, with the restaurant half empty, on a Wednesday night mind you, the food wasn't coming out quick enough to keep the grill loaded up.  I had to beg for a grill change.   I could add more to this but I'll end it here, but for 22 a head (up from 20 with a better, more authentic menu) my love with the consistency and quality that existed for years with this restaurant chain is over.  They've let the \"bean counters\" get in the way of how this company is run and have thoroughly ruined the experience. They've lost this customer for life and I'll be promptly looking for another kbbq restaurant to get my fix."}
{"text":"This is a subpar kbbq. The meat is not high quality. Somewhat bland, not marinated long  enough. The banchan provided were acceptable but not outstanding. Even the kimchi was subpar, I have had far superior kimchi from hmart. The shrimp were the best item we had, and they weren't very impressive. Ordered bulgogi and didn't even get lettuce or ssamjang. Service was polite but a bit slow.  If you are in the area and are craving kbbq, I haven't found a better spot locally yet, but it was very disappointing.  Food 2/5 Service 3/5 Value 1/5"}
{"text":"My bf and I went here on a Saturday night, and yes we do expected to wait a long time b/c so far there are only 2 Korean bbq places I can see on yelp. First of all they said the wait was from 1h to 1h30mins, both of us willing to wait because my bf really want to try out this place. We end up waited for 2hrs to be seated. The guy that serve our table was super nice, but unfortunately their food just ruin the whole experience. Meats are not fresh at all, lack of seasoning, not that much of side dishes. I can see why people are coming here, I guess because of their atmosphere. Beside that I don't see any good things about this restaurant. If you really want Korean bbq go to Manna BBQ is 10x better!!"}
{"text":"To start off, I would first to like thank my amazing server Carry(or was it Carrie?) for being the best server i have ever had the pleasure of having. She made the experience 10x more enjoyable than normal (went to Gen in LA). Also all the employees were really nice, they kept asking us if we needed anything or if we wanted to change the grill. Now to preface this I am a very harsh reviewer so a 4 star is already a lot. Without the awesome service this would probably be a 2 star on food alone. The food was alright, there may seem like a lot of selection but most of them are trash or just repeats of the same meat but with a different marinate on it. The grill cooked unevenly so we could only basically cook one thing at a time (Until a server called David showed up to teach us how to use the grill but still i like it to evenly distribute heat).  The Korean fried chicken was pretty lit tho, I suggest getting at least 1 order of that. Oh and the Kimchi!  To summarize:  Service: 5/5 Food:     2/5 Overall:  4/5"}
{"text":"Finally I have been waiting for Korean bbq is arizona for quite awhile! This place is legit and definitely brings the \"Cali\" vibe to Tempe! The environment is nice, waiters are pretty attentive at getting you your food on a timely manner! It's kinda weird that you can only order 4 things at a time, but I get it. It's to make sure they have control of their kitchen, and so that not too many plates stack up on your table!  The side dishes (ban chan) are pretty good! Nothing extravagant and they don't have fish cakes, BUT you don't really go there for the ban chan, you go there for the meat! It is excellent! Always start with the brisket! That gets your palette going, then go for then for the more sweet choices. I highly the Hawaiian steak, the rib meat, the Galbi, and the premium steak. I like more chewy stuff, so this may not be for you! The garlic pork belly is soooo good too! Just like tasty bacon!   The Seafood is alright but it's worth a try if you're still hungry! I'm gonna stick to the beef and pork options! The KFC (Korean fried chicken) is exactly like crispy popcorn chicken with orange chicken sauce! Pretty darn good! The cheese pork cutlet is pretty bomb, however my wife didn't like it! Kinda reminds me of a good street food option!   So overall, Gen BBQ, doesn't disappoint! I rate it 5 stars based off of the location we are in! It's definitely the best in Arizona! Some tips I would recommend for people is to ask for garlic and jalapeños! Just place it on the grill and let them char! It flavors the meat, and it's good to munch on! Also ask for rice paper! It's a Cali trend, but it's pretty fun to wrap your meat, some garlic, maybe some lettuce into a nice wrap!"}
{"text":"Yet another awesome Gen experience on 6/19/16.  My husband and I are approaching 40 visits to this restaurant and we still intend to come back every Sunday for brunch.  Of course, this Sunday was father's day so we arrived expecting to wait a long time for a table.  This place is PACKED almost every day of the week but especially on holidays - it's worth the wait and everyone knows it.  Surprisingly, we were seated much faster than we had expected!  We had Jaenica (I know I'm spelling that wrong, and I apologize) for a server and she was great.  I think we've only ever had her once before but she still had our usual order memorized.  There was a minor mix-up in the kitchen and we ended up with 3 orders of roast beef instead of 2 orders of roast beef and an order of pork belly but when Shae arrived to deliver the food and we mentioned it to her she hurried back to the kitchen and returned with the pork belly in no time at all.  Our meal was perfect, as always, and we had a great time.  I will say I am a little bummed to see the seaweed salad is no longer on the menu and if there is any way to bring it back I would be thrilled!  That said, putting cheese in the pork cutlet was pure GENius and made an already delicious appetizer even better!  See you all again next Sunday!"}
{"text":"First of all, THE SERVERS ARE ALL GREAT!!! THANK YOU!!! We always go to Henderson location and it's always been a great dining except that we have to wait for 30 to 1 hr to get a table but its worth a wait.Meanwhile the new location in Sahara ave. has always been a disaster.  The First time dining experience was GREAT! Second time sining experience was not so lucky, we order the kfc chicken and in the middle of our dining I was chewing on a RAW CHICKEN  and the rest of the chicken was crispy except that some of them were RAW when I cut it with the scissor. The Manager apoligize and got my meal free of charge but i got sick for 4 days. We gave it the benefit of the doubt that we went their with my 17 year old daughter and 8 year old son. Unfortunately they charge us a full prize for my 8 year old which is $21.99 coz he is above the height limit they have at the door which I even brought his birth certificate to show but they didn't even consider to even look at it, they just say, it is company's policy which is BS. We are both tall parents and our child's Grandparents are also tall which means we expect our kids to be above height average. So they should remove that 10 year old sign of the kids price for dining. We just left coz I don't want to argue and dine somewhere else. Third and last dining experience was HORRIBLE!!! Listen people we like this place so much that we put aside all the negative experience we have BUT this time we found a leg of a cockroach in my Chadol beef and I point it out to our server. Manager came and he says he things it's from the pineapple on a Hawaiian beef. We told him it didn't came from the Hawaiian beef it came from the chafdol beef brisket, he says ok I will just replace your Chadol beef order. THIS PLACE HAVE THE WORST ASIAN MANAGER  and AMERICAN MANAGER! GUARANTEED WE WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN! THREE STRIKES YOUR OUT!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place! There are more than 30 kinds of items for me to choose. My boyfriend and I came to here on Saturday night. Although there is 30min wait, it really worth the wait. Our server Yuhao made our day even better. He is really attentive , and get everything fast and nice. We will defiantly come back again. Btw, the garlic chicken is really good!   Today me and my friends came here again, our server Yuhao and Bo were very nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"From 5 stars after this experience we had to bring it down.  We very frequently visit Gen at Galleria Mall as it is a usual favorite of ours. However this time around I'm throughly disappointed that we had to wait 2hours to be seated. I understand that it can get busy. Although after seeing a bunch of other parties of different sizes from 4-6 people come in and get seated before us was beyond me. We had a party of 8 and was told that the wait would be 40-50 min. Upon finally getting seated after 2 hrs the food and server was great. Until the bill came out... We were initially told that since we waited 2 hours and we didn't get to sit with our whole party we wouldn't need to pay gratuity. Well the gratuity was charged. When it was brought to their attention that we were still charged they took it off but added 4 extra people to our bill which made it a party of 12... To us it seemed as if it was added on to make up for the gratuity they took off. Quite frankly we were a bit ticked off at this point. I mean did they think we were not going to notice?! How many other people has this happened to???? Don't get me wrong even if the gratuity was taken off we still took care of our server since he was amazing!"}
{"text":"Thanks Raymond, awesome service, great attitude, great food and drinks! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. the price is right the food is wonderful and the selection is unmatched in this town. The bad part is they do not take reservations so you have to try and time it so you do not show up in a rush. We hit it just right on a Sunday night about 6:30. only had to wait about 10 min. The look is upscale modern. they have a few types of seating from high single chairs to reg booths. The staff is very friendly and do not seem to mind questions. Our waiter was more then eager to suggest items off the menu to get us started. And he was on point. I have to say i highly recommend #10 myself. The shrimp items are very flavorful but they are peal yourself with heads on so kinda put my son off a bit.. They do have a spicy soup I would recommend trying. we where never left wanting, orders where taken timely so we had a constant flow of food to the table but not staking up. All in all a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I had high expectations due to the fact that I enjoyed my experience at the one in LA. First of all we had to wait, we've waited for almost an hour to get a table, which my friends and I didn't mind because we knew that they just opened a couple weeks ago. However, when we were sat down we asked our horrible server Sam for water and if they had hot tea. The response he gave us, I've never heard in my life. He said that they didn't have hot tea because it was too hot outside. Now, is that how you inform customers that you don't have hot tea?! You refer to the weather?!?! & so I asked another waiter and she mention they weren't serving hot tea at the moment which sounds more professional then what the other waiter said. Anyways, the meat wasn't that great. Not the same quality as the one in LA. The servers were slow and they didn't even oil our pan until we asked them to. It was just disorganized. When it was time for us to pay the bill, 4 servers came to ask if we wanted our check and we mentioned that someone was already getting it for us. We didn't get our check after another 20 min and when it came they made a mistake on our bill and so we had to wait for another 10-15 min. I was so upset I wanted to speak with the manager. Instead of the manager coming over they sent the assistant manager while the actual manager sat back and just watched. Seriously, is that how you run a business?!?! My friends and I were soo disappointed. This was my favorite KBBQ until that day we went to this location. Never again. It was sooo horrible!"}
{"text":"This place has went down hill...the meat is very poor grade quality. WARNING WARNING WARNING: it does not look like the pictures. I took one bite and was scared of getting food poisoning. The staff did not offer any type of composition and that was alright. I could not get out of this place fast enough..."}
{"text":"Wow this place is delightful  I never had such great service  At a Korean bbq The price can't be matched Anywhere in town This place is way cool  Definitely my new go to place !"}
{"text":"Aside from this location, I have been to the one in LA.  The decor here is just about the same.  The AC was not as strong as I was expecting, but it was satisfactory.  There was no wait to be seated.  After we ate here, I can understand why.    The menu here is slightly different from the one in LA.  It appears that there are less items available to order.  The dishes that we received were lacking in flavor, marinate, and sauce.  They cuts were also not as good, or perhaps we got the bad pieces.  It was all very sloppy.    Service was just okay- good.  There was nothing else particularly noteworthy.  I would not condemned and will not be back."}
{"text":"Hip and cool KBBQ spot. Large and usually lines go quickly. This is an international chain and have seen this in Cali and in the Philippines! Was surprised and I like that they expanded that far.   Anyway, this is a newer location. Used to go to the one by the galleria mall in Henderson.   The place is nice, the service is on point and super quick and the long and many choices of meat is superb. Small portions to try more meats is definitely up my alley. All for about $20? Yesssssss!! Haha.   It is a little loud sometimes but its not too bad. You can tell it caters more to the younger demographic instead of an older group of 60yrs plus. But who am I to say what people's preferences are? Grandma can eat and jam to some loud tunes for sure.   Anyway, TRY THE PREMIUM STEAK. Cuts like butter and holy hell, it so good if you know how to grill it. Brisket, thick pork belly, tiny intestines, Korean Fried Chicken, Pork Cheese Katsu!!!,Jap Chae and a lot more. The list goes on and nothing I've tried has disappointed.    Not my ultimate fave kbbq spot, but I am a repeat guest here. It's on the cheaper side, more choices, service is great and all around delicious. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Just finished up our first meal here but it won't be our last.  Food was great and our server was FANTASTIC.   We had the best server.   Thanks Dujuan for the amazing service tonight.  Will be back to see you soon"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times but I never had such a great service before like how Ozzy served us. Very nice, friendly and polite, recommended a few stuff we haven't tried. Definitely going to come back and ask for Ozzy again. This is a great place to eat K BBQ cool place cool vibe."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the hype it created. Drinks are 2.95 for soft drinks and premiums are 3.50. The only downfall I would say is that there's so much servers that you don't really know how to base your tip. But everyone helps out and asks you if you need anything. However because of the vast amount of servers they got our orders wrong a few times and ended up having to ask them to take it back or that we didn't get something. The manager came over and apologized for not having a good item which was nice. Overall great dinner experience just be firm and expect delays when you go."}
{"text":"Shouts out to the server Adrian. This isnt my first time coming to Gen, and usually the service and food is pretty average. The servers would come here and there asking for refills, grill changes, as well as for new orders my previous times I've eaten here. Adrian came almost every 10-12min or so asking us if we needed anything which was great, because my family literally needed something every 10min. He was great help and thanks again for your help!"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh yummy meats and seafood, and great modern environment. Would come here again and again! Highly recomend that you make a reservation but if you forget they text you when your table is ready after you sign in."}
{"text":"The staff refused to seat me with my 5 other friends on a Saturday afternoon with ample tables available because I was not going to be eating.  I explained that I was on a restricted diet and could not eat any of their food anyway, I just wanted to get together with my friends for lunch to chat.  I was shown the door.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Today was my wife's friend's birthday, so we decided to come here.  My wife and I have been to Gen in California, and we really enjoyed ourselves there.  Yes, that Gen had some issues that bothered me, but the food was still really good.  As far as this place, the food was still very good.  But they had issues of their own.   Reasons for only 3 stars.  - ordered food but never got it all - I ordered beer and water, and I had to remind the server 3 times to get my beer and water - they didn't have all beer that was on the menu in stock - had several things on the menu that we couldn't order  because they were out.  - took so long to get our check after asking for it.   I still gave this place 3 stars because of the food quality.  The seafood, beef, pork, and chicken were all of really good quality.  And tasted great.   If they fixed the issues that I had during my visit, I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I think i had the worst experience, there sides nothing special kimchee out of bottle? Meat from filler and hell, leaving piss and hunger never again server took almost 30 mins to get my order in, and server took 30 mins to help me understand this ordeal, what the heck should've listen to my gut screw this place im out"}
{"text":"This place is great; simply the best korean BBQ ive been to outside of korea. Honey Pig has some catching up to do."}
{"text":"We heard about this place and decided to try it as part of my 'Birthday Dinner' celebration.  The overall experience at the restaurant was good and the quality of the food was excellent.  We had two negative experiences during the visit (and one after)...Availability of servers to order more meat and the number of burners/table size provided to a party of 7.    We had to hunt down and flag multiple different servers to order another set of proteins (as they provide you with a limit of 4 protein options and cannot order more until the first has arrived).  With providing a 2 hour limit per table, they either need more servers available to take protein orders or have a way the table can order themselves.  The proteins were going as fast as they were cooked because we had a large party and only 1 burner to cook it on, which leads into the next negative item.  As a party of 7, we felt that they crammed us into one table with one burner to share across all 7 people.  We're not small people, so fitting 7 people around a table normally used for 4 was a little bit of a tight fit.  Add to that, we only had 1 burner to share across us all.  I would've thought they would have tables to accommodate larger groups that would allot for 1 burner for up to 4 people in the party, but they did not.  My son-in-law left his hat at the table (as he took it off and placed it on his knee while eating) and we called for 15 minutes and, when we finally go through, they told us they were too busy to look at the table we were seated for the hat and told us we would have to call back the next day and see if anyone turned it in (my wife was going to call today, but they aren't open as of the time of this posting).  So, to sum up, here's my overall rating for each category:  Overall Experience - 4 Food Quality - 5 Service Quality - 3 Large-party accommodations - 3"}
{"text":"Great food experience! The meat is fresh and the salad is amazing. Only thing i wish they had was more seasonings and sauces for the meat."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday and our server Mike took excellent care of us. He made sure to be continuously checking on us to ensure we didn't want to order anymore food, and was 100% on top of refills. (Bar drinks too.) The food was great, and it was so much fun to cook our own food. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I could live at this place! It has amazing food and even more amazing customer service. My daughter which is almost a year and a half loves eating here. That is hard to find sometimes a place that we can all eat and be happy. I am even more happy that they brought it to this side of town because I did not live in Henderson so the drive killed me sometimes and would take away from me going there. The even more amazing thing about this place is that when I put something on the grill they took the empty plate right out of my hand. Some places need to take some notes from this place. Keep it going guys and we will definitely be back over and over and over again!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. I'm in the industry and I am shocked at how terribly run GEN is. 30 to 45 minute wait wasn't a problem for us. However, not being called or texted and then told we are going to have to be last in line again was distressing. Oh, nevermind, we have the worst table in the house to seat you at. Please allow us to blow this freezing air on you now. Alright, let's have some GEN. After placing our order we finally got the calamari after 15 minutes but had to spit it out it was so bad. The food runner that brought our vegetables should have just carried them in his hand, oh wait, that's exactly what he did. Palmed the top of the vegetables as he's setting it down. With the table ticket in the same hand! Why don't you just go ahead and sneeze on it in front of us?? After 30 minutes the meat never came. Told the waitress that we just wanted the bill. Charged us for the entire thing. $53 for 2 ppl and just waters.  Asked for a manager, they sent the hostess over that sat us. She asked, \"Is something wrong?\" Goodness gracious. She went to get a manager. We walked out after no one came. Pathetic. The manager should be fired and that entire staff needs to be retrained. I used to love GEN but never again after that. Truly pathetic and kinda heartbreaking with how much we loved GEN Korean bbq."}
{"text":"First of all Terry. That dude is awesome! This is the 2nd time I've been here and he made the night great. I knew from my last visit that the food was great. I mean all you can eat Korean BBQ can't ever go wrong. Also the fact that this place is classy and had great service sets Gen above the rest. We had a long wait for good reason, a ten person party, which is the max for a table. We spent our 45 minute wait at the bar and enjoyed the wonderful flavors of soju. Once we were sat they brought us salad and sides. We ordered almost everything on the menu.  I liked it all but recommended you order the red wine marinated pork belly and the tung. I know the tung sounds out there but if you like the brisket you'll love the tung. At the end of our meal happy hour started (9:30-10:00) and we made sure to finish the night with the remaining soju flavors. But if I haven't made my point and the bottom line of this post is that Terry is the best ever."}
{"text":"Things people in AZ that need to understand about all you can eat Kbbq:  -Long waits to be seated (1.5 - 3 hrs dinner, idk about lunch) so plan ahead. If its getting close to closing time, you probably won't be seated. This has happened to me a few times in Kbbq places in CA. Get use to it. -You cook your own food -No reservations (usually, but I don't know if they can for a certain amount of people.10+?)  I've heard some complaints about the above, but these people clearly have not gone to an all you can eat kbbq.  I haven't been to Gen in CA but I have friends who have and I myself have been to a ton of Kbbq places since I've lived in CA for a long time. At first I had low expectations since it was a chain and it's Arizona, but I was impressed. Yes, at times they were slow, but hey they recently opened and still testing the waters.  Overall, the place is clean. Very hip decor and they played some good music. Very loud due to crowds. Probably won't recommend kids going here unless they are obedient.  Food wise I would recommend the red wine pork and the steak (the first one on the dinner menu). Also the Korean fried chicken and the volcano chicken were pretty tasty. It was a bonus that this was all you can eat too!  I hope this place is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the people that work there. Friendly and always very helpful. Food is great and so are their drinks!! Been here twice and definitely coming back. Good place for friends meeting out, date, family gathering, pretty much any occasion. No complaints."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great fun club-like atmosphere! Awesome music. Best KBBQ ever! Tastes sooooo good! I want it right now just thinking about it! Definitely going back for the pork belly!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night and the wait was an hour which wasn't too bad. My boyfriend and I just went to Dave and Busters while we waited. I wish we went before 3pm because it is $15.99 per person for lunch and $24.99 per person for dinner with over 30 choices! We also ordered the kirin pint and that was $5.50. I was surprised that this place was really good! At first I thought it was just hype. The meat is really good and you can't really complain on how it's being cooked because you are the one cooking it.   The atmosphere it self is great. It's very inclusive and great for one on ones. I liked that they played bar type of music without serving \"bar food\". Bar food isn't really the greatest. The customer service is also exemplary. I'm not the type of person that needs constant customer service, but I was surprised that the staff was super attentive and always asked if we needed anything. Our server Luna, and the staff members Jason, and Leyna were so great!  Nothing bad to say about this place, except for the wait. That's understandable though.."}
{"text":"The food choices are awesome.  There's almost so much, I can't decide.  For those who don't know how to cook or don't know when things are done, I wish there was a guide. Cause I for sure gave myself and my girlfriend, food poisoning. My bad lol But would most definitely come back.  Great variety and ice cream macaroons!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with my boyfriend because we've been craving Korean bbq for quite some time now. It was our second time at Gen and both times have been great! Great price for a good amount of choices. Alodia was our server and she was super cool! She's funny and very chill! She was good with checking up on us and making sure our dinner was everything we wanted it to be. The only downside was that I felt like there was no privacy where we sat because there was another group right next to us at the high top tables. That was the only awkward part, so if you're in a group of two, I would recommend asking for a booth. Other than that, everything was great! And Alodia, if you're reading this, I'd like my pork silver please. Haha, thank you for your service!"}
{"text":"One star... can I give it no stars. This food would be good if you starved for a week on a liquid only diet. Anyone can go to the store, buy meat, cut thin slices and cook it in a tin pan with no seasoning. Don't need any sort of restaurant for that. The only way I would go to this place again is if I was freezing and need someplace to get warm. The only way the food at this place is good is if you have zero flavor profiles. Skip it and hit the Italian place downstairs."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and I was impressed by the atmosphere in the restaurant. It had a very modern look to it and it felt very welcome. Lisa was our waitress and even though it was busy, she was very on point with our orders. I had a very good time and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked and wondered what the big deal about this place is? My sister wanted to celebrate my mom's birthday here. So we had 12 people. Oh yea, no reservations allowed. Just put you name in and wait. I don't really like this concept but understand. It's and all you can eat for two hours.   So my sister got there early, put our name in and only had to wait 30 minutes on a Saturday night. No large tables but two booths for six each.   So you cook your own food over your table grill and you can only order four dishes at a time. Let's see we had Korean fried chicken, gyoza, Beef bulgogi, steak, beef ribs, beef tongue, garlic chicken, shrimp, octopus, calamari and others stuff. Most of it is cut fairly thin so it cooks fairly quickly. All is pretty good but would have to say that everyone liked the beef ribs the best.   Someone came back all the time and had to change our grill three times because the grill gets pretty dirty after awhile.   To be honest, I don't remember our server because they were always running around. Everyone is always ordering dishes. They take your orders and off they go. Water glasses we filled somewhat okay but the server we had wasn't the same person helping us at the end. I felt like we had thee different serving by the end of our meal. So as you can tell not friendly service but they are trying to fill everyone's order. Fast service and not friendliness is their game.   The place is pretty good I would say. This is a Korean all you can eat so lots of people are always waiting in line. When there are lots of asian's waiting then you know it's a good Asian restaurant (trying to not be prejudiced but honest).  So be ready to wait. You got two hours to eat and eat til you're content cause for dinner it's basically $25 a person. Not friendly service but quick service is there game. Really good food and a great ambiance. Fairly dark with blue lights and a fairly loud environment. Had a good time and wouldn't mind coming back. Enjoy we did."}
{"text":"First off where the heck is our waiter (Michalina)? She's come four times and those four times took forever and we had to call her to come. Then the waiter that was bringing our food started getting mad because we were asking him instead. Thankfully AUSTIN came to the rescue and started serving us. This isn't a good place for big groups of people. Not sure if coming back. So far no."}
{"text":"I'm totally diggin this spot. It's across town from me but definitely worth the drive. I went on a group outing so naturally we were making a lot of jokes. Our servers were fun, witty, and played along. The food was great and everything came out in a timely manner. They were also really good about switching out the grills. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the henderson location because it's closer, but I will definitely be going here more often! We were seated faster and my waitress I believe her name was Criza? I don't know if I spelled right, but she was the sweetest lady ever! Best customer service I've ever had, she filled our drinks without asking and even consistently checked on us even though it was quite busy! A plus experience, hope she's my waitress every time I go here."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for lunch every here and there. Really good customer service I've been here multiple times and they know how much I love my potato salad and brisket sauce!!. Favorite servers are Terry and Asotou!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Amazing food, great atmosphere and even better staff. Luke and Terry were super. Very attentive, great personality and they made the dinner very enjoyable. In terms of food, the beef belly, roast beef, pork belly and beef tongue were great. The spicy tofu soup and KFC(Korean Fried Chicken) were delicious! Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"my favorite ayce korean bbq in town, ozzy gave us an excellent service!!! i sooooo love this place, would probably be back again soon"}
{"text":"Boooomb!!!!!! But would give it five stars if it had a few dishes that the Anaheim restaurant has! But everything was great,  food, drinks, and service!!!! Go early, go hungry then go hard!"}
{"text":"It was alright .. Plain and simple .. The place looks nice first time came here was free all you can eat just paid for the drinks overall it's the same I really didn't like the side dishes .. Service was good !! I'm not going to lie but it's mostly the same kbbq"}
{"text":"My visit was amazing to gen. The food couldn't have been better. The only reasons my food came out so quickly was because of a woman named Alodia and two men named Alan and Raymond. Thanks to these three people my visit went more smoothly. I'm very grateful to these three. I hope they stay with gen for a long time. Hopefully they can become managers and help this company grow stronger. I hope when I come back they are the ones to serve my table again."}
{"text":"Love the food. Great food for Korean bbq. Worth the money for all you can eat. The wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be since it was packed."}
{"text":"Pretty darn dericious, the Hawaiian pork belly is about as tasty as it gets, and if you like spicy then definitely get the volcano chicken. I would definitely recommend this place for a tinder date. Grilling to yourself provides so much natural conversation and compromise so that no one will get bored."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaaaazing!   I love Korean BBQ and my boyfriend tells me this place is Cali based (correct me if I'm wrong) which is even better! The brisket was on point (it's my favorite) and the rest of the food was delicious as well!   The place has a nice ambience as well and very spacious. They are very hospitable throughout the entire restaurant.   The customer service was awesome!   I had Lisa as my waitress and she made us feel comfortable and was very welcoming. She had a great smile and her eye liner was on point!! There was Ramon as well and he was on top of changing our grill every time it was charred. We ended the night in a food coma! (:"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean BBQ places in town. Service, selection and quality of food will bring you back.    Menu items include beef brisket,  chicken bulgogi, roast beef, premium steak(comes with pineapple) pork belly and baby octopus.   Appetizers include gyoza, KFC( Korean fried chicken)   All taste quite a bit better with the dipping sauce and salt. I recommend the Soju perhaps a strawberry/mango combination to wash the meal down.   Weekend afternoons are quite a bit less hectic and you can enjoy the meal and company without feeling rushed like an evening with people waiting 20 to 30 minutes for a table.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved since the last time I visited.  The main problem in the past was the service; however,  last night the service was excellent.   Even with the challenges of the Father's Day crowd, we got seated relatively fast, and they were quick to bring out our multiple orders.  When you combine that with their good food, which has always been good, you really have a place you want to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Cute place. There's not much I can say about the food because it's just like any other Korean BBQ--not better or worse."}
{"text":"The price is very good. The meat most of them are good quality and nice favor. The decor is beautiful and modern but the service was very slow. You have to be very patient when you dine in this place. A lot to improve on the service side but we will be back."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ.   Really enjoyed all of the various cuts (except brisket - no real flavor and the shrimp - they were a pain to peel).  The service was friendly and timely.  No wasting any time here.  I do wish the place was better vented.  The air conditioning came on every 10 to 15 minutes and really made the place bearable.  Why not just keep it on the whole time?"}
{"text":"Hip, modern decor.  Food not so great.  Some of the meat was old and nasty tasting.  Warning: Stay away from anything \"marinated.\"    Also, they bring you tiny portions.  If you want more you hunt down a server, which can take a while, and then prepare to wait a long time for your next tiny platter of thinly-shaved, spoiled, tough, old meat.   Weird policy too with requiring you to eat everything or you get charged more money.  I've only been to one other Korean BBQ, Tofu Hut; the meat and service was substantially better at Tofu Hut even though the decor wasn't as spiffy."}
{"text":"For the price the quality is by far the best in AZ at the moment, we went for their soft opening got amazing service from all servers and manager and our grill was probably changed 3 times too.   I recommend the top sirloin (shockingly better than most ribeyes) and all pork bellies especially the one marinaded in red wine.   Hype or not this will be my go to for KBBQ"}
{"text":"I'm just going to keep it real about this Korean BBQ place. First off, if you are looking for the restaurant in google maps it's going to guide you to the other side of Tempe market place by Harkin's, when Gen is really located across from Barnes and Nobles.  Walking into the restaurant you can tell they put a lot of thought into the design. They have blue light running through every booth in the house with a big projector screen showing movies in the back. As we were seated we noticed their choice of music was on point. We could hear some Old school hip hop and other favorites which was awesome! When looking at the menu you will see a full list of different meats they have from short ribs, steak, chicken, pork and much more. Mind you this is an all you can eat restaurant and the price is 24.99 per person for dinner . We started of with the Hawaiian chicken, spicy chicken, shrimp and bulgogi. The meat all comes out raw and you cook the meat on a small grill in the middle of the table. The quality of meat they bring out is pretty good. We were impressed with every style meat we ordered. I think my fiancé and I sat for about 2 hours and enjoyed about 10 or 15 different marinated meats along with salad and rice. The service in this place is very good, they are very attentive and friendly and they make sure you are well taken care of.  If you haven't got a chance to have Korean BBQ I would defiantly recommend this place. I know there is only about 2 of these restaurants in Phoenix that have popped up this year. If you're open minded with trying different food give this place a try, just make sure you get here early cause the wait can exceed 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Food and value is good. No free desserts included in the all you can eat and was ignored halfway through dinner because our servers shift had ended and no one had communicated with us, leaving us unattended. Staff seems unhappy, service and attitudes are lacking"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food taste great and the service is usually very good.  You have the option of grilling beef, pork, chicken, seafood and vegetables. My favorite is the beef tongue, short plate, chadol, kalbi, bulgogi, and the spicy BBQ pork. Their banchan (little side dishes) is also delicious!  My least favorite part about this place is the long wait. Be prepared to wait.......sometimes an hour or more before you get seated on the weekends. Other than that, this place is one of my favorite AYCE Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"I hate to complain about service but service here for lunch time wasn't the best. I think they need a few more workers for the amount of tables they serve. My waiter was constantly busy with like maybe 6 other tables, it was hard to get his attention so I could get new orders of meat. Can't beat this price though. The Korean Fried Chicken is General Tso's chicken so don't waste your appetite on that or any type of fried chicken. The smokes garlic pork belly disappointed. The garlic calamari was very flavorful. Bulgogi was also good. Although the pineapples tasted like they were from can they helped provide the most flavor to the Hawaiian dishes. I recommend the Hawaiian beef steak, it cooked so well and tasted so good without any additional seasoning. If you try here, try to go not at peak times, the waiters have their hands full."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had been searching LV for a good KBBQ place and were disappointed until we came here. This was our 5th time coming here and I'm sure we'll be back for more! Not only is their food excellent but their service is too! Big shout out to Ozzy who kept us happy the whole night through. Anyone who can keep my husband's glass full deserves high praise. Thanks Ozzy and Gen's for a fun night!"}
{"text":"The food is good -- there are a few things that could be improved on.  But the service is great!!  We have been there 2 times and had the same waitress both times her name is Jaenica and she is fabulous.  She is very personable and attentive to her guests.  I would highly recommend people request her table when dining!!  This is a very nice date night dinner/activity as well for those looking for something a bit different."}
{"text":"Got an intense craving for Korean BBQ and heard about the newly opened Gen Korean BBQ House. Now Korean restaurants are few and far between in the valley so I had to rely on yelp reviews to decide where to go. Once we committed to Gen, we got very excited!  Aside from the to-do of the Grand Opening, we enjoyed the wonderful flavors of Korean BBQ! The three of us had the All-You-Can-Eat menu and from the appetizers to meats and seafood we were very impressed with the flavors and quality. The service was also very good! We will definitely be back and will bring others!!!"}
{"text":"SMOKED PORK BELLY!  So it was our second attempt to eat dinner here. The place just opened and the wait time grows so fast! The first time we couldn't get in because the wait was 2.5 hours. It was at 730 on a Wednesday when we got there. The second time, we decided to try to beat the crowd and went there at # on a Sunday to get a table at 5pm! So we lucked out and sat down at 530.  I think they just got their liquor license that day. I recommend the Lychee martini or the Mai Tai! They were sooo good! I love this all you can eat BBQ place because the staff are very attentive. We only encountered one snag where our server went on break and never came back, but luckily, another server picked up the slack.  You order 4 menu items at a time, and they bring it out right away. We tried mostly all of the choices. My favorites, The premium steak, and the smoked pork belly!!! OMG! so delicious! my least favorite was probably the red wine pork belly. It just didn't appeal to me."}
{"text":"Fly all the way to the Phoenix Metro area and what the heck, let us go to Korean BBQ for lunch!  Hey, I recognize that chain - \"Gen Korean BBQ\", the dance club music , modern, new - only a month old, Korean BBQ restaurant staffed by young, hip, 20 somethings.  For those concerned with smelling like BBQ after eating, you still will, but not as bad as the old style Korean BBQ joints with overhanging exhaust hoods.  At Gen, the BBQ smoke is sucked away through the vent in the grill thus the place is not hazy with smoke.  You cook everything yourself, thus a lot of time for talking and saying Whassup?  What to eat for $15.99 of the possible 32 items or $24.99 of the possible 37 items in two hours at 4 plates per order (4 limit plate per order)?  Eat it all like the pudgy NK Dictator would do!  Your server can provide suggestions and did.  Jan ( a cool guy not to be confused with a KPop girl) did a great job, keeping our protein supply going.  Had 3 rounds or 12 plates among the three of us with three changes of the grill.  All within 2 hours...actually only one and half hours as we were stuffed.  Conceptually, a table for four would be the perfect size as you could easily manage grilling 4 orders or 16 plates in two hours.  Liked it all especially with the sesame & salt paste.  We have had KBBQ many times before but had Pork Jowl and Garlic Squid for the first time.  Nice... We ordered Jowl again in the last round since we liked it so much.  The other items were great also.  Beef Steak, Pork Belly, Bulgoki, etc.. Get it all, eat it all, and expand the waist line...."}
{"text":"It was okay. I already knew this place would be busy so when they told me I had to wait an hour & 5 minutes I wasn't surprised. I really wanted to try this place out so I waited. They text you when your table is ready so me and my friends were able to walk around instead of just sitting down waiting for our name to be called. So that was appreciated. The service was awesome! Everyone we encountered was very friendly, informative & knowledgable about the menu. I was warned by a handful of people that the service was bad so that was what I was prepared for. It was a pleasant surprise for me. As we read the appetizer menu, our waiter informed us that they ran out of like 4 appetizers so we couldn't order it. Luckily we weren't planning to order those anyways & they still had the noodles we wanted! My 2 friends & I did AYCE. We ordered 2 of the briskets (number 3 I believe), some kind of bulgogi, & garlic pork belly. I feel like the brisket was too dry. I like Tofu hut's brisket better to be honest. My friends agreed with me on that one lol. My side of rice was a little dry. I didn't personally care for the pork belly but my friends said it was bomb. I liked the bulgogi. LOVED the noodles appetizer. It's called japchae or something like that lol. Anyways, yeah... It was okay. I'll probably give this place another chance later. It is still pretty new so there's lots of room for improvement. It has potential."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Our waitress was very attentive and funny!  The food was great and everyone was very attentive even to the last grill change!"}
{"text":"Our server Ozzy was amazing!!! It was my first time here & he explained everything and how it worked. We came in during lunch hours so they gave us the option of  #1 was the lunch special $15.99 & #2 was the Dinner special $20.99, with the dinner special you have more meat options but because I'm more of a chicken type of girl we ordered the lunch special. We sat in a booth that was by the window and the atmosphere was cool laid back kind of place. Now I must warn you it does get hot because everyone is cooking so expect it to be warm. As soon as we sat I know I wanted a adult beverage. I told Ozzy what type of drinks I like and he suggested the flavored SoJu I wasn't sure of which one to get and he told me we could mix flavors! YES! so I went with strawberry and mango OMG was it DELICious. We ordered the Gyoza for our 1st appetizer it's the best I've ever had! It was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. They dipping sauce was lite and tasty and didn't overpower the Gyoza. Our 2nd appetizer was the Cheese Pork Cutlet that was very good it was crunchy on the outside while the pork was tender oozing with cheese, this also came with a dipping sauce and it was good but very strong. For our Entree we had Gen Chadol (Beef Brisket) it was so tender and cooked quickly they give you a dipping sauce and seasoning for your meats. We had Chicken Bulgogi and it was marinated in a sauce that had a little sweetness to it with no need to dip it in any sauce. We did have a few more things but I honestly can't remember what we had since I let my friend do all the ordering but I must say EVERYTHING we ordered was incredible. I'm defiantly going back .... maybe next week."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed and have been for years. BEST Korean BBQ EVER. Besides actual Ktown in LA. We go our of our way just to eat here! Wish the put one in Long Beach!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time with my cousins and it's great! Cheaper than most kbbq places and just as good! Jaenica was our server and she was super helpful and attentive! Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Finally open in Vegas! Came to try out this new open AYCE Korean BBQ place! I'll try keep it simple yet detail in this review. What got my attention at first when I walk in was the layout and design of the place, inside with neon lights around and  design looks unique bar look like this suppose be in casino :)! Make sure if there is a wait, don't just put your name down, but can also ask to put your # down for notification mins before table ready so you don't have to wait inside crowded if is busy. Plus the location is right outside galleria mall, so can always go next store check around while waiting! After we got sat down at the booth, few side dishes was already prepared for us on the table! Our server got here really quick and took out drink order first. Honestly I don't really remember the name cause the fact seems our table don't have a pacific server. But however after we got our drinks we were ready to order some meat to cook:) so many choices !! 32 dishes for dinner to choose from! I guess cause they just open and the servers haven't memorize the menu, so when I order by name , the server was asking/confirming by number which I totally understand . Only can order \"4\" dish at a time which is not bad, so it prevent people from wasting food :) got our meat , start cooking, make sure when they put oil on top the pan, it enough, sometimes at first they didn't seem put enough . The meat was just juicy and delicious!! I love it, no need much flavor and every plate was great:) the steak comes with full piece too but can always cut to pieces. Basically on food over all was great, but only  reason I gave 4 star was on service (which I rather put 4 1/2 star but there is no choice lol)  is not a big deal, and I understand just open and servers still new getting use to it, many of different servers come to our table check on us like every 10mins or so, is not bad checking up but was bit too much  , and their food comes out quick so if something you order took awhile they probably forgot and just got to remind them:) their air suctioning fan right on the side of where you cooking very nice and simple! I recommend order some slice radish piece if you like to wrap small piece meat and eat it, balance the flavor and more appetite. Also there is some disharmony they only have for dinner menu. Will defiantly come back again! Hope to see you all soon!  Pros: *location *design *food *menu choices *price defiantly ( L. $14.99 D. $19.99)  Cons: Nothing major:)"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Ate here twice (so far).   Really Modern Decor and very affordable ALL YOU CAN EAT KBBQ! $19.99 for Dinner and $14.99 for Lunch.  The crew is great! Very attentive and constantly will ask if you want anything else. Yes Please!  Food is top notch! The kids loved cooking on the hot plate.  The only negative (for me) is the smoke from the burning fat on the grill. There isnt an air vent to help with air circulation. So once you walk out you'll smell like a Korean BBQ Restaurant. So for that I took off 1 star.   Go try it!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy night, waited about 5 minutes for us to get seated. Waiters are pretty attentive, requested the special GEN DIPPING SAUCE which was PERFECT! guys make sure to request it, doesnt come with your side unless you ask!   AWESOME BRISKET! very thinly sliced which i love! Flavor was good, fat to meat content was nice.   BEEF BELLY IS A MUST!  Also loved this one! Its very yummy and flavorful! Cant go wrong with it!  Price was reasonable, ventelation sucks though at busy times. It can get very smoky inside."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Taste just like San Jose's. Nothing different from other Gens, unless you compare it to SoCal's Gen locations. Service was fine, sometimes a little slow with requests. However, every Korean BBQ place has their servers overworked, so it's just as expected. A big difference as compared to other location is that it's more crowded and always loud, probably because there's not a lot of KBBQ places around Tempe."}
{"text":"Tried this place out, it was worth it. The AC wasn't working, but the good food and food service were worth it. This place is across from Barnes n Noble, nice looking spot. Lunch menu is 15.99 a person , but you can upgrade to dinner menu if you want the better cuts of meat. Finally glad to find an All You Can Eat Korean BBQ place that's tasty."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat Korean BBQ. Very clean, good food, our server Jay-Ar was great and very attentive to his customers. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to many KBBQ places and also used to work in a KBBQ restaurant, and I'm also Korean so I know what's good and what's bad.This place was a very big disappointment. I've been to many GEN restaurants in California and this one is probably the worst one...   Service is mediocre, the food choices have shrunken and the quality of the meat is honestly not good. They cut the pork jowl to the point where I have to cut it more to make it bite size and edible, and their scissors suck at cutting.   It was already annoying to know tht I had to pay dinner price because of the weekend, and they don't even have rice paper..really?   Beef belly is dry, pork cutlet is all crumbs and no pork, they didn't give us sauce with our gyoza, the tofu soup was watered down and basically just oil, and their Cajun chicken was very dry and hard to chew."}
{"text":"The food was okay and our spicy tofu soup was lukewarm. Our server was pretty bad which made the experience a little bit worse. This is my second time here and the service hasn't gotten better. However, Shay who brought out our meat was awesome. She was the highlight of the night. We wish she would have been our server. Would've made the experience much better."}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ spot in town everyone I take here has a great experience .. make sure you ask for the best/cutest waitress JAENICA ;)"}
{"text":"If you're Korean and you've had real Korean food, this is not the place for you.  Over sweetened banchan and meat cuts that are less than appealing. The brisket is cut thicker, which in turn, makes the meat tougher. The garlic smoked pork belly doesn't taste like garlic. Not even close. The KFC (korean fried chicken) is definitely adjusted for American palettes. The sauce on Korean fried chicken is bright red, thick, garlicky and sticks on every piece of the chicken. This is more closer to orange chicken? The only thing I could recommend is the premium steak. Cooked the right way, it's tender and juicy. The only thing we ordered twice was the premium steak. Overall, the experience was very ok. Would I come back? Most likely not."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place as my son was finally a little bit bigger and we were able to take him out in public more. I guess it was a good thing because it died down a bit but we also went a little bit later at night and were told we beat the dinner rush. When we entered we were seated right away. I didn't like the fact most of the tables were already set with banchan on the tables. I know they're prepared in advance but I don't like the fact they're set out In advance. Ambiance has a club type of interior with a bar and high tables on one side and booths on the other side. I was actually impressed at the service. They had adequate staff and we were checked on multiple times not just from our server but others as well. I liked most of the meats we tried. Rib eye was an obvious choice but they also had garlic chicken with fondue. Not quite garlicky, the chicken didn't have much flavor and the cheese was more like nacho cheese from a can. For the price point the meats were pretty good and I like the fact you can order appetizers as well but was surprised there was no steamed egg. I don't mind because I don't eat the steamed egg but my other half lives steamed egg. Solid KBBQ not the best or worst. Tofu hut is still my fav even though it's not everyone else's first choice I would choose that place over and and again. This being closest to me I'd still rather go to Tofu Hut or DJK."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff was excellent and really considerate. I didnt know what to order and was given a great recommendation."}
{"text":"The best places are found spur of the moment.  My wife and I have been on a personal trek to find the best Korean BBQ.  Invariably, the services comes at a cost of ambiance or service.  Not so Gen.  they've stepped up their game by offering a massive 36 item menu for an AYCE - reasonably priced at $21.99.  Their premium steak is served in 12-16 oz cuts 1/2 in thick.  All the fixins you can expect from a Korean BBQ.  The ambiance is bathed in blue hues - we'll have to come back at night instead of dusk.  Service is over the top.  As you'll have guessed, I am impressed by the sixth sense good servers have - realizing before you do, that you've finished your pop or need a refill of bean paste.  Special mention goes out to Prince, who did just that.  Have I mentioned that their hosts announce party size and the line cooks cheer?    I recommend this place and give it 5 stars for service, ambiance, cleanliness, and for the delicious food.  We'll be back.  Update: Mothers Day dinner.  Consistency ranks high with me.  This place delivers.  Having worked through the food coma this place put me in last time, I was able to take my time with dinner - I'm ex-military, so I eat like it's my last day on earth with one plate I'm sharing with a fat kid.  The crew here is the envy of any 5-Star, Michelin rated establishment.  When was the last time I seen a cleanup guy really put some elbow grease to a particularly stubborn stain?  I did.  Tonight.  Everyone works.  In a full service restaurant, table turning is key.  The faster you can have an available table the greater it is in profits to the owners.  They trained their crew exceptionally well here.  I had the privilege of being part of a tightknit unit during a particularly exhausting mission.  We were on point.  Finish each other's sentence, already done, sixth sense on point.  These guys reminded me of that tonight."}
{"text":"$20 all you can eat - ok! I didn't have any complaints. Server was nice and attentive, food came out quick, and the sides were tasty."}
{"text":"Being new to town I had never been to GEN . My brother and some friends highly recommended it so I decided to stop in and try it.    I have today the food was great and the speed and quality of service and environment was excellent. Our server Jessica was fantastic.  Great personality and very attentive.    I will definitely be back.   Try it if you haven't!!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give them 0 stars. I came here about 5 times at least.. every single time something just has to go wrong, service, rudeness, gas grill not working (twice), neglect, ignoring, dry rice paper and now they charge each person in a party of 5 a fee for getting a booth. Some good things are a few servers that work there though.  The quality of the Gen here is extremely low compared to the ones in SoCal. Man I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Geez, 600+ reviews?!  Many of these reviews lack merit, but...   True fact: A LOT of people do come here. It is very busy all the time. Even on this unassuming Tuesday evening.  Friends that I know are not Yelpers are repeat customers.  Pro-tip: Be smart about the time you come or be prepared to wait. I have never waited more than 15-20 minutes the two times I've been here.  Arriving Tuesday at 6:40 PM. Seated at 7:00 PM. Dined 7:00-9:00.  I could see the hangry folks waiting from my table. The waiting area was packed from 7:00-9:00. Meaning diners like myself ate for 2 hours. No table turnover. Duh. So come early or come really late. You're welcome.  #1 - Gen signature steak - Want to feel like a pro chef? Season that baby with the salt and pepper from the little dipping dish. Bam!  #3 - Gen chadol - thinly sliced brisket. Get this. Like at least two times. It cooks very fast!  #5 - Gen beef bulgogi - thinly sliced, marinated sweet and savory. We got this twice. It comes with onions, get those on the grill too!  #8 - Beef tongue - Not bad!  #10 - Gen yangyum galbisal - marinated premium steak. Pretty good!  #15 - Spicy pork bulgogi - Great flavor! Not too spicy.  (In general, not a chicken fan when it comes to KBBQ)  Pork belly options:   #17 - Smoked garlic pork belly - Least favorite. Garlic flavor was weak.  #18 - Red wine pork belly - Yummy! You can really taste the red wine.   #19 - Miso pork belly - Yummy! Very tasty!  Seafood options? Too full to consider, but we did try the #22 garlic calamari and it was okay.  Other food items: - Salad - Very good and fresh tasting - KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) - A bit sad. Not my favorite. - Tofu appetizer - Looks nothing like the photo on menu. Grossly heavy breading. Skip.  - Gyoza - Not mind blowing in any way. We got three times though. The kiddos enjoyed the crunchy treat. - White rice - Needs a lot of improvement. For an Asian establishment, do not serve hard rice okay? - Jap chae - 2 orders were sufficient for 5 adults. Not bad, not the best. - Rice paper - not available. Boo! - Radish paper - pretty good actually. - Spicy tofu soup - It was okay. Did not taste \"authentic.\"  Did I enjoy my meal? Yes. Would I come again? Yes.  This really is a generous 4, considering some flaws with customer service. I liked the food, so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"With all the surrounding hype and negative publicity regarding their reviews it was time for us to finally visit Gen. It has been almost 3 years since I last set foot in a KBBQ place since leaving California, there was always that hesitation that nothing could ever compare lol.  All that changed when I tried Gen for the first time last night. The food itself I would give 4 stars, more on that later. What really sold me on this place is the crews dedication and quality of service. TOP NOTCH. I have never seen a group of people work so good together, everyone was in sync. It wasn't like, this is your table/area you deal with it. They all pitched in as far as clearing your plates, asking if we needed anything else, can I replace your grill? And all with courteousness and smiles to boot. It was fine dining caliber of service for sure! Our waiter Ozzy was wonderfully pleasant and friendly, almost giddy lol like he truly enjoyed being there. I think that speaks volumes on how management runs this place. Though it was busy on a Wednesday night it wasn't chaotic.  For starters we ordered their crispy sesame chicken and pork cutlet, both moist and flavorful. The banchan offered were tasty though I wish there was more choices, I would've loved to see some bean sprouts and fish cakes. The meat selection was plentiful, too much choices if you ask me. We settled with the crowd favorites:   -Gen Yangyum Galbisal (marinated premium steak) only offered during dinner AYCE which is $19.99 by the way. Delicious marinade that you can really taste.   -Spicy Pork Bulgogi I'm a weak sauce and a sissy so I didn't enjoy this as much but hubby loved it. The beef bulgogi on the other hand was melt in your mouth goodness!  -Gen Chadol is my go to in every KBBQ place, it cooks very quickly and it's scrumptious wrapped in Rice paper (another HUGE plus for this place is they carry rice paper, brings back such great memories of home) and dipped in sesame oil and salt. Ahhhhh I'm craving this again!  -Smoked Garlic Samgyubsal (pork belly) is the least of my favorite, though it was good and tasted like bacon, the garlic flavorful was not prominent at all.  Of course we couldn't leave without trying their Macaron ice cream sandwich. It was tasty but not worth the $3.95 price tag in my opinion with its minuscule portion. Definitely looking forward to going back, it's a great place to eat and be merry with friends and family. Only bad thing is it's quite a trek for us to get there but maybe that's a good thing or else we'll find ourselves here a little more than our waistlines would like."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is THE BEST Korean BBQ spot in town! I have been here three times and every single time has been nothing but great experiences. The service is outstanding. If it's not our server coming around to check on us, it's somebody else asking if we care to order more or if we wanted a grill change. Service was absolutely excellent. As for the food, EQUALLY AMAZING. Everything is always so tasty. I literally crave this place. And you can't beat the lunch and dinner prices for AYCE! ($15 for lunch & $20 for dinner) The ONLY downside for me was that if you wanted dessert, it's not included with AYCE so they charge extra for it. But it was delicious nonetheless. Gen Korean BBQ never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I have gone to gen twice and the first time was amazing despite the two hour wait. After being seated, the waiter was amazing and we ate plenty of food despite not being offered bowls of rice.   The second time was during the week for my birthday and the service was horrible! The waiter barely came to the table and let our grill turn black and didn't even offer to change it. My friend had to ask another waiter to refill our waters despite the waiter walking past and forgetting about us. Worst experience and now I feel very indifferent about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Gen is always a great place to dine into AYCE Korean BBQ. But my most recent visit was a cut above the rest. Our waitress Jaenica was quick to address our needs and provides excellent service. She was also very sweet and friendly! A special thank you to her for making our visit spectacular."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time. Ask for OZZY!!!! Best server that I had there!!!!! Food was awesome. All you can eat. Can't beat that for 20 bucks"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food.  Its very clean and amazingly you don't walk out smelling like food.  We tried almost every meat on the menu and liked it all.  My favorite is the brisket and pork belly."}
{"text":"Swanky Korean AYCE BBQ, what else do I need to say?! My friends who live in Vegas decided to take a few of us visiting from Oahu to this awesome restaurant. I saw one will be opening at Ala Moana Shopping Center within the next few months & I wanted to see what the hype was about.  Luckily for the 5 of us we only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Tuesday night. For $20.99 you can choose from an abundant amount of meats, sides & seafood to fill you up. Each party is allowed 2 hours to chow down & drink up. The food came out really quickly so we didn't feel like we were wasting our 2 hours waiting for our food. Everything we ordered was delicious & I don't remember exactly what we ordered because I was just so hungry. Your set up comes with 4 sides to share (potato salad, kim chee, picked daikon & cucumber kim chee), salad, 2 sauces & rice.   The staff were very attentive. They always checked on us if we wanted to order more food, have our waters filled or just see how we were enjoying everything. I liked how they asked us if we wanted to change our grill often because it kept everything neat & not burnt.   The 5 of us got a pitcher of strawberry yogurt soju which was delicious. I think happy hour starts at 9 with a ton of drink specials.   If you love to eat, socialize & drink this place is the place to be when in Vegas. Now I have high expectations for the Honolulu location!"}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place since I've been to the Torrance location. I must say I love the Tempe location even better. It's definitely a long wait but worth it. It's good to call ahead and see what the wait time is and it's better to go slightly early rather than wait till dinner time. The staff are wonderful and come to us as soon as we're seated. Food is brought out less than 5 minutes after ordering and they always ask if I wanted to change the grill. The food is so great, fresh and great quality. I hope the line dies down but with this value in food and service, I don't think it will."}
{"text":"I yelped this place and it says they close at midnight. I showed up with my boyfriend at 11 and didn't get sat because they said they stop seating at 11. It was literally 11! We left and tried out 8oz instead on the other side of town and they we're awesome and super nice and open till 2am and have much more sides than this place."}
{"text":"Starting off, the food is very good. However, the service was abysmal. We were informed that they can only run 3 credit cards for a table of 5. The waiter frequently forgot what we ordered, and then avoided us. We often had to hail down the hostess for assistance."}
{"text":"Gen gets all the stars for delicious food! They lose a star for servers who are less than attentive at times.  I've been there for dinner and lunch on busy and off-times (even came opening night!), but somehow I always end up hailing a waiter for something that is very basic. Basic server duties are lacking like: after being sat we won't be served sides unless we ask, or having to request they pour sauce into the dishes.  Everyone is usually very nice, but I wish they would just remember the little things. It would push the experience to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely unimpressed. The meat quality is so poor that I had a hard time trying to finish anything so that I wouldn't be charged for the leftovers. The wine pork belly looked and tasted like literal crap. I don't understand how they can charge for any of this?? The service from our non-server, Austin, was the only amazing part. I think our server thought he was working in a Chinese restaurant because he said \"I don't read Chinese\" when we accidentally pointed at the Korean portion of the menu.. he was always not really around which was unimpressive because the other table's servers were around a heck of a lot more. Also, we asked to change the meat pan and he threw away pieces of our meat without asking if we wanted it.. this was our first course so we were pretty freaking starved after waiting for an hour after they told us it was a 30-45 min wait.. Everything we ordered was appalling. I cannot believe I wasted my calories and money on such mediocre food.. it makes me so sad!! My friend said \"it was edible..\", but I disagree.. I forced myself to eat it with copious amounts of sauce on everything.. that is a disgrace to my Korean heritage.. I'm sorry, mother."}
{"text":"Pros: Really good quality of meat, much better compare to Hwaro. The servers were friendly. Definitely the best Korean grill in Vegas.    Cons: once forgot to type in my order, once brought my order to another table and theirs to mine. Range hoods are placed too high, making the place a bit too smoky."}
{"text":"My second time here and I can confirm my positive first impression of this place wasn't a fluke...  4 Food 5 Service 4 Value  The food was good...we stuck mainly with the thin ribeye, bulgogi and the galbisal out of the dozen or so options offered. The spicy pork bulgogi was also a hit.   I like my Kimchi a little more funky/strong but I'm an unusual white boy. I also wish they offered full lettuce leaves with which to make an Asian lettuce wrap with the grilled meat rather than the lettuce strips in a bowl.  Appetizers:  STAY AWAY from anything that is fried/breaded as the breading was way heavy. Popcorn shrimp: 80% breading (seriously could not see the shrimp) Pork cutlet 60% breading. Fried squid about 70% breading...and the breading was salty. No thanks.  DO GET the K.F.C chicken. It's like orange chicken but with a slightly spicy Korean sauce coating it.  I see people complaining on yelp about having 4 different servers and not knowing who their server was...I see this as a positive. Due to the amount of servers floating around, my glass was never half empty, the side dishes were always refilled, our next round of meat orders were taken even before the current one could hit the grill. Our grills were changed frequently without having to ask. Waiters were friendly and extremely attentive. Why would I want to hunt down \"my server\" if I needed a grill change? I felt things ran smooth.  Value was spot on. For $20 I walked out extremely satisfied. I could definitely see myself coming here monthly if they opened one up in Summerlin...driving way out to the bowels of Henderson is a schlep."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The appetizers felt microwaved. The raw food was okay after it was cooked too. I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First of all, this was not my first visit to Gen but hands down THE BEST.  I enjoyed a late lunch with my Fiancé and our server, Alodia, was the best. Truly the kind of person I love to see in the service industry. Bright, cheerful, and had a good sense of humor. She also made great recommendations. It's safe to say that she is one server who truly cares about our job. Sadly, I don't understand why she is not in a position of management here? Her skills would truly serve the restraint well.   Anyways, we enjoyed a couple servings of brisket, bugolgi, tongue, and shrimp. Everything was delicious and perfectly cut and prepared all thanks to Chef Carlos! Really nice man who I met previously at a visit to Gen.   Fine cuts of meat, excellent service and a good vibe. Can't complain!"}
{"text":"We visited a few weeks ago. My spouse, myself and our 7 year old. When we were going to be seated they checked my sons height and confirmed that he would be half price. They measured him 2 times. Same price for him every time we go. Cool. We have a meal. Service from our serve and food was good as usual.   When we went to close our check we were charged for 3 full priced meals. We mentioned it to our server and he went to go fix it. He tells us the front told him our son was full price. A few minutes pass and one of the ladies from the front..maybe the supervisor comes over. She was rude first off. We explained to her that we were told when we first checked in that our son was half price. She kept saying we had to go and remeasure our son. Keep in mind we were sitting in the back by the restrooms. It was the weekend so trays and people everywhere. At that moment when she kept insisting we get back up to have him measured for the 3rd time We got irritated. As I went to get up to take my son up there she said never mind and that he was half price.   And then to add..with it being a super busy weekend and the commotion of everything. A full tray was spilled all over my guys shoes. Food and liquid went all over and some came on the table. We got an \"oops\". Things happen I know, but with the way the night was going it just added to the frustration.   All in all we ended up being charged correctly and everything was ok. Just the whole situation and how it was handled was pretty irritated. We would frequent pretty often. We haven't been back since.   :/"}
{"text":"Loved selection of marinated meats at just the  right portions  for our group of two adults and one tall child.  Sides and dipping sauces/salty mix were set out before we were even seated.  Arrived at early lunch time on a Sunday. Dinner menu.  Loved cooking our own meat and veggies .  Would be a five if the salad and the white rice would have been excellent.  They were just good.  Really goody.  Would have been a five if all of the servers would have been present.  We wish he would have given more tips about being new there would have been awesome.  All drinks are extra.  Some special sides were brought but only after asking.  A great chain!"}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this place is that there is a wide selection of meat, chicken and seafood to grill. The grills only last about 3 grills before they have to be replaced. Our waiter was not very helpful at all. Yes he was attentive but at least explain to us what is included instead of saying 'uhh, you have to get a appetizer, it's included in the meal.' UHH, well if you don't explain this to us, then we don't know.  What killed the experience was when we ordered our second plate of brisket. Honestly, I don't think that was brisket. Usually brisket is thin and cooks quick. This took forever to cook and was chewy as heck. It was not good. And when we tired to ask the waiter if it was indeed brisket, he got all rude and said 'well that's what you order right?' Okay, thank you but I'm not coming back after that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My sister recommended this place and  I dined here for the first time. Very large selection and our server, Bo was so incredibly friendly and helpful. Definitely will come again and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to begin with my review as this place lived up to the hype for us. We've tried for dinner a few times but the wait was always 90+ mins and when you got 2 kids, that's doesn't work. I've done Korean BBQ while traveling abroad (along with Steamboat, but that's for another restaurant review) and the key thing was the freshness of the food. This place hit the mark on all items. After a few failed dinner attempts we realized going during early afternoon would be best. We dropped in around 1:30pm on a Sat (so you're paying the dinner price because it's the weekend). If you got kids, they will measure by height to determine if they pay the kids price or the adult price. Got lucky as my daughter was just under for only $9.99 but son being a bit taller rang up the $24.99 adult price.   All good... On the fine print it says you have 2 hours but I don't think they really hold you to that, but make sure you pace yourself and look around at the other tables to see what may interest you... We started off with 4 items (and they come out quick) to let the kids do some cooking and add some spices... Started with the Premium Steak, Signature Galbi (grilled ribs), Beef Bulgogi (marinated thin sliced beef) & Cajun Shrimp.... After that we moved on and ordered more Beef Bulgogi and the jumped around trying things like the Hangjungsal (pork), Chadol Baegi (Brisket), flat iron steak, Hawaiian pork belly... All were on point and we didn't stop picking items ranging from the beef tongue to the garlic calamari.   They have a few items they don't require the grill like the K.F.C (Korean Fried Chicken) and Gyoza's...   The only item we weren't snatching up to eat quickly was the Hawaiian styled steak and pork belly. It was boring compared to all the other items but still good, just not much flavor to it.   At the end, I pushed through and ordered the garlic calamari... I was stretching myself to my limits so asked for just a half order... after cooking it, we ordered 2 more as everyone go their 2nd wind as the calamari was on point!!! Definitely looking forward to my next trip here!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the hosts are horrible. They suck so bad and are very unprofessional. There's this hostess named Tori who is SO rude. She needs to be fired for the way she communicates with costumers. We had to wait to be seated until everyone was there. The tables were empty but there were many people waiting. Tori saw our last person walking to the door. We told her that they were here and she said, \"not until they're IN the building!\" WHO DOES THAT!?! Sooo rude. My whole family loves the managers there ( the two Korean men). We too, are Korean and only want respect."}
{"text":"I give it 3.5. Food is REALLY good. BUT staff could use some work. And it is always hassle getting the check because it literally takes 20 min just to get the check. So ask for it early.   And last time i went they said they'd make my drink free IF i wrote a review. I was fine with it, until they said i HAVE to put 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food and service are wonderful, but even with a reservation and a mostly empty restaurant, we waited 15 minutes for our table. Make sure to make a reservation when you go since the place is completely packed any time after 5pm."}
{"text":"If your goal in life is to eat as much Korean BBQ as possible for one flat price, this is your place!   Service is fast and variety is good.     HOWEVER, if your goal is to eat really good,  high quality Korean BBQ without over eating,   head on over to Gangnam in the CVS plaza across from the Hard Rock Hotel.   You may need to wait for a table,  but the food quality is waaaaay better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Las Vegas can finally say it has a place locals can enjoy without waking thru a smoked filled casino and getting ripped off for small portions of meat and bad service.  The atmosphere was 5 stars.  The staff all worked together including management to make sure guest satisfaction is kept at the highest level possible. Everyone smiled and wanted to assist you in anyway possible.  Cooking your own dinner at the table has never been so much fun.  Anyone going on a first date this is the place.  Paleo dieters paradise.  The menu is massive and portion sizes are extremely generous."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Korean barbecue place. We can eat, of course. Very extensive menu and tasty, good quality ingredients. Instead of the traditional rice paper side dish, they have Finley sliced pickled radish disks, which serve the same purpose but are healthier.   The food was excellent. The place looks great too, except the bar area looks like an out-of-place afterthought. Definitely not a cool place to lounge if you're just looking to have some cocktails. This is definitely somewhere you go if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Good service and food were fresh . Its a place not like typical korean buffet that offers food on the buffet table . You can keep ordering until you are full. This will eliminate the food wasting and keep fresh food coming. I will definitely bring my family and drive 25 miles to try  again . Thanks."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner. We walked in and.were seated right away. The menu was all you can eat and like most all you can eat places they will charge extra if you do not eat everything. We started.off with the Hawaiian Pork Belly, Gen Bulgogi (korean beef), and the Korean Fried chicken(KFC) which was already cooked and similar to Chinese Orange Chicken. The Hawaiian Pork Belly was awesome. We liked it so much we had a second order. The Bulgogi was good  also. We ordered Garlic Chicken and the Briskett next along with some vegetables. The Briskett was extremely thin and cooked really fast. It was goid but I thought needed more seasoning. The Garlic Chicken was also good but I'm from Hawaii and Hawaiian garlic chicken is much better than it was here.   Overall the atmosphere was great and the reataurant was very clean. The service was really good.One of the best service I have experienced in Vegas. I definitely would reccomend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night and the wait was an hour and a half. We decided to wait and had drinks at the bar. Once we were seated and ordered the meats they came out fast and service was good. Overall I would return but maybe not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great food and service, I ve eaten at other Gen locations and this one seems to be a bit different, but overall love price and selection of sides and meats!!! Defiantly a good place to go if your hungry."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price point, JJ was awesome and Adrian was quick with bussing our tables!"}
{"text":"First time at Gen & hands down, one of the best KBBQ spots I've been to in Vegas. Walked in & was seated less than 2 minutes after arriving. Service was very fast. $20 AYCE for dinner, includes a variety of meats & appetizers. Our server Lisa was very friendly & helpful by recommending some things for us to try. Two thumbs up for her choices! (:  I would definitely recommend anyone coming here if they like KBBQ & I would gladly come here again."}
{"text":"So yummy, but wish they wouldn't automatically charge an 18% gratuity for a party of 7 without a warning."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was great. We had Seong as our waiter and he was nice and got our food out real quick. Will definitely recommend this place to friends and family for great food and great service."}
{"text":"It's finally here!! It took forever for them to open, but it was worth the wait. The staff here is very attentive, you do not have just one server, everyone makes sure you have everything you need. Every ten to fifteen minutes, someone will come around asking if you would like your grill changed to a fresh new one without all the brunt parts which I think was great! Make sure you DO NOT waste your food. They charge per plate for unfinished food. You may not take food to go, so order only what you can finish. You have two hours to devour all the yummy foods! Worth the experience for sure!"}
{"text":"Joe was such an attentive server. He was incredibly nice and quick too! Awesome experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Man don't believe the hype at all. Comparing this to their cali location they're worlds apart. Not saying that this is the worst kbbq in Vegas, but it's close to there. Do yourself a favor and don't waste any money here, there are much better kbbqs in Vegas.  Ew moment of the week: Went to the toilet stall as a WORKER was coming out. Go in to find toilet seat down with pee drops all over it.... BRUHHH WTFFF?! YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO LIFT THE TOILET SEAT UP AND THEN PEE. As if that wasn't bad enough he didn't even flush!!!!! PLEASE MAN MERCY.  I've been here three times with friends and family that wanted to try it out. And each time I've went here the same problem was always there.  I find it off putting that their speech is always the same is \"3 card max. split, 4 meat per order, leftover will be charged\" I came here to eat ayce bbq and have a good time, not a speech of \"here is what you can't do\" in a semi threatening tone.  Servers here are 0/5. They have a system where you don't have a dedicated server it's just a whole bunch of servers walking around. This creates the problem of zones specifically being left out. Many many times I saw tables next to me waiting forever to get an order in, when the other side of the room is swarming with severs dicking around. The servers seem to not have the intention of helping out too, they just walk around in circles and avoid areas waiting for their shift to be over. You really have to get their attention. Instead of them asking you if you need help with anything it's you that need to get their attention. It's very frustrating when you need a simple water refill or more potato salad.  Echoing off many of the reviews here. You can only place 4 orders of meat....imagine coming in with a group more than 5... So limited!!!!! The portions are teri-freaking-bad too. So tiny!!!!!!!!!!  Literally the only saving grace at the end was one server who kind of kept an eye out for us. Mizzo was his name! He made sure our orders we're coming through and apologized if it took a long time.   This place has a lot to improve on before I make it a daily."}
{"text":"Thank the food gods for Gen to come to the valley. I left cali not to long ago and i thought this was going to be one of the things i wouldnt be able to get here. Yes I did see some other kbbq's around but none I saw to my liking. Here at Gen, you cannot go wrong with quality and service. David my server was really working hard checking mine and the other tables around.  My only dissapointment was my second round of the bone in short ribs which were kind of chewy. But really i can forgive that. Next time just have better. But overall theres nothing out there in the valley right now that i would say is overall better than Gen when it comes to AYCE Kbbq. I do miss the OG in tustin but i see this will perfectly do. Keep up the good work Gen!"}
{"text":"I tend to only eat certain items when I do Korean BBQ & really stay away from Kimchi..... Let me just say.... The Kimchi was so great I ate 2 servings. The beef bulgogi is off the chain & I couldn't be happier! My husband and I stopped here on Christmas Eve (today) to fuel up before battling the crazy crowds and it's awesome! The staff is so sweet & check up on you at the perfect at times. They make sure you know how to perfectly cook the meats and have great suggestions when you aren't quite sure what you want. They do not disappoint! I will be bringing back friends and family!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Gen Korean BBQ. We live close and I have read on Yelp and Eater.Vegas that this place was good so we decided to check it out. We were greeted immediately and our name taken. The wait was about ten minutes maybe less. This place was very busy and as we ate it got much busier. This was a Wednesday night. We were first seated with another two gentleman, but I felt like I was intruding in their loud conversation. Since it was our first time I requested to move to a more private table. I am not always crazy about places that you cook your own food, but i was wiling to give it a go. Drink orders were taken right away. (you know me) (bonus). Not much beer on tap but that is not a deal breaker. Appetizer Popcorn shrimp and Calamari. Both good tatsting, the dipping sauce was real enjoyable having a bite needed to offset the plane-Jane shrimp. Red wine Pork Belly, Thin sliced Ribeye, And Garlic Chicken. There was not a lot of instruction from our waiter on how to use the grill in our table so the meat stuck and ripped when we put it on the hot surface. The Ribeye was good but needed some pre seasoning. Pork Belly was full of great taste marinated well. Chicken was bland but thee was a sauce that was given to dip it in. We finished our meal off with Ice Cream Maccaroons, Strawberry and Mango. Both had good smooth creamy taste and a good way to finish off a meal.   Thank you for dining at Gen Korean BBQ. Overall a great experience, staff was friendly and accommodating. Could have used better instruction on the Grill. Drinks were refilled without asking. Food brought out quick. (I guess if we cook it that process is eliminated in the wait). We will go here again. If you are at Galleria or in Henderson and want a different dining experience than the norm, check this place out."}
{"text":"Really good service here!!! Shea, in particular, was spot on the whole time! She was a great server and always made sure we were taken care of. She even came to let us know when she would go on break, and if we didn't see her before we left, to have a great night! Overall, the food was great and the service was perfect! Definitely recommend this place whenever people visit Vegas! Good job Shea!!!!! Hope to have you as our server again!"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of GEN and always made it a must stop when their only locations were in California. So, I was really excited when I found out they opened up one in Las Vegas.   However, my visits here are always different. Sometimes the quality of the food is good and the service is good, but other times it's the other way around. Definitely nothing like the locations in California.   However, today's visit was excellent all because of our server Alodia. We came in with about a party of 16, and she carried such a warm and friendly demeanor throughout our entire stay. Most importantly, she was also very attentive- constantly checking up on both our tables and making sure we had everything we needed. Alan also did a great job with delivering our food, getting our grills changed and making sure we had what we needed as well.   Great job you guys! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I don't judge a book by its cover but DAMNNN this place looks amazing! While I was parking, the interior lights look so appealing! Neon lights, beautiful upholstery, staff with a smile on their face. Great indicators and atmosphere settings for the start of a great meal!  AYCE was great and definitely affordable. I didn't check if there was WiFi, although dinner was so fun I didn't bother checking my phone once. There's no bike racks or outdoor dining area. Bathrooms are gender specific and clean.  Staff was on point. My server was a little unfriendly, although the bussers and other servers were nice. They checked on my table frequently to change my grill and to see if I needed anything. They did a great job! The only reason I didn't give this spot 5 stars was because of my server being a little rude and clumsy while grabbing empty plates or placing items on the table.  Overall, I'd definitely return to this restaurant. Walking in, there's lots of space for seating. It looks like a nightclub with Korean grills placed ever so well. Grills are hot and new. Very clean place. Affordable price. There's dessert for a separate purchase after you eat. Complimentary candy while you pay for your bill. Great KBBQ spot that gives you the bang for your buck!  Oh yeah!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Wait was so worth it! 45 to an hour wait. Wish they have more chairs to seat while waiting, my kids was getting tired standing. But, Everything was good and our server Keyi was so nice, friendly and attentive! Service was great! Did not wait long until the food started coming in. The place looks classy too compare to other korean bbq house. We'll be back for sure! Highly recommended! Not sure if the current price is just an introductory price... I hope it stays the same!"}
{"text":"Settle down, you frightened children. If you don't finish, say, cuts of extraneous fats or the occasional anomaly of unbreakable bulgogi that somehow mutated into a glob of gelatinous protein, they won't peg a fine on you.   In my experience, Gen is most enjoyable with a small party. I always go with one other person, one who is capable of consuming as many dishes as I. Historically I have been proud to consume twice my body weight in Korean BBQ at the Gen in Tustin, CA. The Tempe, AZ venue, I am sad to say, does not compare.  While I appreciate the enthusiasm when I enter the building (e.g. \"So-and-so, party of two!\" \"WELCOME TO GEN!!!!\"), anyone who's visited the California locations will notice an absence of rice paper and acceptably sized portions. For your bewilderment, please order the jap chae and bring a magnifying glass to observe it.   It's an otherwise good restaurant, and probably the best we can get in Arizona, so enjoy it if you're in the area. However, the second you enter California, be joyful, for you shall be thus welcomed with far superior Gens and other Korean BBQ restaurants."}
{"text":"We were at Gen again. Food was okay, but adding desserts would have made my experience even better. Our server Julian was amazing, he was very polite, friendly and efficient, making sure that everything was alright, that our glasses were never empty. All in all, very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"It was delicious! We went for lunch and arrived at about 11am on a weekday. Prices are cheaper for lunch on weekdays. If you aren't on the first wave of ppl seated, it may take a while since customers are given 2 hours to order. Selection of meats were tasty. I'm a huge fan of all the pork belly!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best food I have ever had in my life, and i am Dominican! Prices are a little high but I have to actually say it is worth it."}
{"text":"As expected this place is awesome, all you can eat but no need to get greedy ... perfect portions and many to choose from. Service is superb, our server JULIAN is outstanding .... he s there checking on our son able to make sure we got everything we need. I live this place excellent food and A for their service."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to the Gen location at Henderson and we are happy that they opened this new and closer location. The staff delivered excellent customer service. Our waiter Anthony B. made sure we were well taken care of and succeeded our expectations!  Everyone was very attentive and worked great as a team. The food was savory and hit all the right taste buds. My favorites are the brisket and the bbq beef ribs. Don't forget to add a macaroon ice cream sandwich to top off your whole experience. I recommend everyone try this Gen Korean BBQ place. We plan to come back soon and maybe even have a party here!"}
{"text":"I've never been much of an adventurous eater, but I've been trying to expand my horizons in recent months. My husband and I decided to try Gen for dinner tonight, and I'm glad we did! The wait was long (30+ minutes on a Monday evening at around 7:30pm for a table for two), but our server, Lisa, totally made up for it. She patiently and pleasantly explained how everything worked and made recommendations for us newbies. We really enjoyed the marinated steak, and my husband loved the pork belly (the garlic and the red wine flavors). I wasn't a fan of some of the unseasoned, thinly cut beef options, but my husband seemed to like them. Lisa provided awesome service and was so nice, which really made the evening for me, especially being more than a little nervous to try this new type of dining experience. I don't know that this will be a new weekly restaurant for us, but we'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and at a great price for all you can eat!!! Go for lunch as it is about $8 cheaper per person. I loved the selection and getting to try a bit of everything."}
{"text":"I think we found our new spot! Only $20 and all you can eat meat? Uhhh yes!! We come here after the gym and pig out! My husband ordered 5 steaks and chowed down on those and I tried more of the marinated meats! The noodles and salad they give you automatically are super yummy! We also ordered edamame and gyoza that were great as well. We loved the experience of cooking your own food so then it's always how you like it. The restaurant overall has a great vibe and we will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Kinda expensive but it's completely worth the experience.  They keep you with clean cooking grates and are attentive to your order.  My wife and I had a great time exploring the book store across the way while we waited for a table.    Such a great experience."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Hugh was our waiter and was super on top of things and easy going. Loved him.  The shrimp isn't so great as it is alot of work to eat the small amount of meat in there. BUT spicy pork and beef were my favorite. Make sure to cook the chicken well as it takes a long time. We also ordered dumplings which were the bomb and also at much sides and rice as we wanted.  LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Korean BBQ places and this is the last place I'd think of eating at. Customer service makes a huge difference when it comes to an overall customer experience. I came here with three friends and we instantly fell in love with the environment. It is so modern and the ambiance sets off a good vibe, we were given drinks and our sides, and asked our waitress a lot of questions since it was our first time. Rude off the bat - she was very impatient with us and in the middle of asking her questions she'd talk to the table near by to get their order. As shocked as we were we just proceeded to order with her once she finally came back. I'm a short ribs lover as well as the rest of my party so we put in 1 order not knowing it was going to be a slice on one plate, and our waitress knew because that's all we ordered so when she came back with the one slice of rib she put it on the table as if she knew 4 people could share that ONE SLICE! Ridiculous. We had to wave her down and order 16 orders of short ribs, she stops writing down our order, looks at us, and says \"16 short ribs?!\" YES GIRL, what else did we say? We killed that one slice of short rib in a second between us 4, we want more than ONE rib to eat LOL We waited for a long time and when she came to give us our short ribs, one slice was on one plate, aka, she brought out 16 plates of individual sliced short ribs to us, why not just put the 16 pieces on one big plate?! Anyways, her service was slow and rude, we always had to flag her down, we only refilled our waters ONCE because she never came to check on us or looked our way to grab her attention. Towards the end another server helped us because she explained that our previous server had to clock out, our previous server didn't even warn us of the server switch because if she notified us then we'd we looking out for the second server instead of waiting and looking out for her instead. Our second server appeared to have more tables to cover yet she was on top of her game to try and pick up what the first server has started with us, and I appreciated that! However, upon finishing up and paying I do not think what I paid was worth the experience, worth the long waits, or even with tolerating the rude server."}
{"text":"We tried this place because of the reviews that they got.  We had Mizzo as a server and he did a wonderful job making sure we had our fill.  My favorite was the cajun shrimp.  The baby octopus gave me a stomach ache.  May have not cooked it well enough.  But this is the happening kbbq spot in town.  Five stars.  No more Chinatown for me.  Now, I am going to have to drag the other half here!  She'll drive :p."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere & food but kinda bummed they make you wait till your \"whole\" party is in the building to be seated. Patrons could order a appetizer & drink while waiting. But NO"}
{"text":"Absolutely great restaurant.  We love going there for a family night. My 6 year old son loves going there as well. The service is fantastic and the food is just wonderful."}
{"text":"We are usually regulars at Gen, but today we decided to go around 10pm and the staff were all acting like they closed in 10 minutes. The hostess has the worst attitude.   We also had water all night and we didn't even get refills on that. All of the servers and the manager just sat around the bar talking for long periods of times without even asking to see if we needed anything or to just check up on us.   If they wanted us out, since they were closing \"soon\" (last call was 11:30) they could've replaced our pans to cook more frequently to be able to cook the food faster. It was my sister's birthday and they separated our party of eight across the room. We couldn't even see each other. They took advantage of the gratuity and were completely useless the whole night. That high of a tip was undeserved with the service they gave us tonight. I'm very upset because we were looking forward to eating dinner here."}
{"text":"I came here once before today and had a great experience. The food was great, service was on point 5/5. But today I got the worst service, our waiter ignored us for 25 minutes. We were almost full and were hungry by the time he finally came to get our next order. Even after asking for kimchi and salad twice, we never got it and our waiter finally brought our kimchi after all our food was gone and we were literally about to pay. The food was great just like my first experience, but the service was not and needs improvement."}
{"text":"It was Christmas Eve and they were very busy so we had to wait about 20 minutes. All and all not too long. The service was excellent. I felt like I had 3 waiters.! The appetizers were numerous and delicious. We didn't try them all because we wanted to save room for the main items. We tried the Shrimp, Beef, Pork, Calamari, and Octopus. Which barely scratched the surface of what is available . A lot of fun cooking it yourself and all was delicious. Wanted to do more but we were so full. All this for $20 a person? We will be back...!"}
{"text":"Wow my experience here at gen was on top of the Line. Didn't have to wait at all our server OZZY was amazing! Very helpful and patient with us. Always had a smile on his face so he definitely made our experience better then we thought.    Thank you Ozzy for being so great!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! We took a big group there for lunch and they took great care of us and the food was amazing.  Alodia was our server and she handled our big group calmly and perfectly.  The manager, Eanok, came over to make sure we were taken care of.  Super nice and helpful staff plus the food was just great."}
{"text":"Cool place. The selection is enough. They also have appetizer and spicy tofu soup. The flavor of meat is really good and I can tell the meat is fresh. I like Rick cake and tofu. the atmosphere is kind of bar. Staff are very nice and always come back check our dinner. However, they don't serve dessert. The yogurt soju is good. Just a little Sweeter than other."}
{"text":"I loved this place and our server was bomb and entertaining . We will definitely make this place a regular spot ."}
{"text":"2nd time eating Korean bbq, but first time at Gen. First time was in LA, but I honestly enjoyed this place better. Love the single tables, makes for a more intimate experience. Loved everything we tried. Favorites: spicy pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, and the garlic pork belly. Our service was also excellent, thank you Jaenica (spelling?) for your wonderful service. Very personable during the dining experience. At the end, my boyfriend accidentally dropped his debit card on the side of the booth, but she and a crew member helped us retrieve the card after searching for several minutes! Extra kudos for taking the time to help :) Both got an extra tip for that. Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was awesome. Our server Seong was great in suggesting items to try. Definitely would come back. Great food and even better pricing."}
{"text":"Just tried Korean BBQ for the first time and Gen came highly recommended. It did not disappoint! Our waitress Criza was so helpful and recommended what we should try for our first time. The food was absolutely delicious, the staff was amazing and attentive, and the atmosphere was hip and fun! Definitely recommend the adult Caprisun and the K. F. C.  Fun and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few times, yesterday being the most recent.  Food is okay, not terrible but not the greatest.   I lived near ktown in Los Angeles and this would be a lower tier bbq joint.  However, adjusting for this area and it's competitors I think it's a good mid tier joint.  Reason for the two stars is that my girlfriend got food poisoning from here.  We woke up late that day, came here around 2pm for our first meal of the day. A few hours later she was vomiting on and off for the rest of the night.  The only things she had that I did not was the shrimp tempura and an iced green tea. My money being on the shrimp.  Stick to the meat and avoid the seafood as a precaution."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in their customer service. When calling about being double charged, it took two days to get a call from a manager, even then they still couldn't call to let me know that they would be refunding me. I had to call yet again for them to tell me I would get my refund. They have no sense of urgency when dealing with their customers."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean bbq places I've ever been to. From the atmosphere to their service. Phenomenal! On top of great service, the prices is affordable! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wait time was insane...and the host kept asking for our name on the list...I mean we were the only ones sitting there next to her stand for an hour.  But once we were seated...the waitress was amazing!  She recommended some great dishes and drinks!  The #4 is a need to have if you eat here! The unfortunate situation...and I saw this in another review...we found a hair in our coleslaw!!! Waitress was super nice and apologetic.  Overall, food was great...price for all the food you get is great...I would return but try to get on a waiting list sooner...or have time to kill shopping.  Don't go here for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Ok... I normally don't give too many 5 stars, but this place is TOO LEGIT 2 QUIT!  $14.95 for lunch 29 all you can eat items, and $19.95 for dinner 32 items!  The alcohol stock isn't too bad as well.  The ambiance is so trendy that you think you're having dinner in a club on the strip.  Bravo \"Gen\" on the decor, food, music, and service!  Next time we come, we'll dress to get jiggy like in da clubs!  \"Wanna make love in this Club...\""}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave reviews but this place was worthy of an honest review. Short and simple: overpriced, way overpriced for quality of meat that rivals fast food. You get better cuts of chicken from chic-fil-a. Our tab was $70 between two people and could barely eat any of the meats they advertised as they are just covered in fat. The beef brisket comes out sliced as if it was sitting in a freezer. Wow what a rip off. The silver lining was out server was really nice. Oh by the way they charge you if you don't finish your plates so unless you like eating more fat than meat avoid this place"}
{"text":"The food here is soooo good! Everything comes out in timely manner - so you're not constantly waiting for something new to cook. The servers are great! With as busy as it gets they look in on you constantly.   Beef tongue, gen chadol, and the signature steak are our go-tos. We also really liked the spicy pork bulgogi (it's a larger serving so that's big enough to really share!)   We've come 2 days in a row, lol. I think we're going to be regulars here."}
{"text":"So glad I got to check out this new location before they get really busy. They've only been open a couple weeks. Grand Opening hasn't happened yet. We arrived around 630p on a Saturday night. We were seated right away. The hostess was friendly and professional. We were promptly created by our server to take drinks & appetizer orders.   I have to say this was probably one of the best dining experience I've had at a new restaurant. They staff were all on point. Service was impeccable. The food came out quickly after ordering and servers came by our table constantly checking up on us.   This will be my new go to Korean BBQ spot. They have all you can eat for $22. Great selection of meat & appetizers. The quality of the meat was great. Two thumbs up!   They are in the process of getting their liquor license.   I will definitely be back with lots of friends & family. The restaurant is very spacious, modern, clean  and can accommodate big parties."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Staff is not that friendly. Place is very dark. Not baby friendly. I wish this place is more accommodating."}
{"text":"Came on opening night. Everything was great. Only negative was getting the check took a while.   Anything with the thumbs up on the menu is worth getting. Portions are quite small, so order more than you think you'll want."}
{"text":"Where do I start.. The hour and a half wait just to be seated for my boyfriend and I. The lack of customer service; the girl who seated us had an attitude and our server was mediocre at best (don't even know his name). While the food was just okay. By the time we finished eating we were asked several times if we were waiting for the check after about 10 min of waiting we took it upon ourselves to go up to the hostess stand to pay. With this being our first time at this restaurant it will also be our last."}
{"text":"This place was amazing as always! Last night was my second time there and our experience there have always been wonderful! Last night we came at 8pm and it was an hour wait but it was worth the wait which made us more hungry so we could eat more when we get in. Our server Shirley  was so nice and caring she checked on us multiple times making sure we had enough food or drinks. I asked her about the volcano chicken that was on the menu. It was marked as really spicy and she recommended getting it half portion. And it turned out  the volcano chicken was my FAVORITE from the entire menu. I do recommend it myself if you love spicy! Again an amazing server! Definitely will bring our whole family here for dinner and hopefully Shirley is our server next time!"}
{"text":"This place was meh. I've had way better experiences at places like Gen. The interior of the restaurant is super nice and not comparable to most KBBQ spots, the food is plated/presented in a more upscale fine dining type of way, and I love that they serve a bunch of sides/cooked items, included in the AYCE price. But let me tell you...if you're going to seat seven people with one grill, at least bring enough meat to actually satisfy everyone simultaneously. This place has got tricks up their sleeves with the plating they use for their meats and sides. I mean, one tiny little plate of kimchee for SEVEN people? You got to be kidding me! It was a joke and kind of insulting in my opinion to be served ONE side of kimchee for seven ravenous individuals. We even asked for seconds and still got served the same amount. Gen, your concept of AYCE lacks the whole idea of what All you can eat Korean BBQ is all about! I was just a tad bit baffled. Lol. I don't mean to offend the establishment but try places on spring mountain or elsewhere and see where I'm coming from.   Other than that, the quality of the meats were mediocre. I had better at other KBBQ restaurants that were a lot more tasteful. In all honesty, this place seemed more of an Americanized feel. If that even makes sense. I wish I got pictures but I had such a long day and forgot to charge my phone battery. I wouldn't suggest this place nor will I refuse to come back. You'll probably see me back here if someone else suggests it and it's out of my power to disagree. Still sticking to Doh on Rainbow."}
{"text":"Naya, who I assume is a manager, is very rude. She said \"we stop seating around 10.\" It was 9:50. Give me a break. Food was good the last time. Service was horrible"}
{"text":"It's a good place to go. They offer all you can eat with just $15.99 for lunch. Compare to the authentic Korean bbq on Spring Mountain, there is less option of meat, but you get what you pay for. Otherwise the staff is really awesome, really good service. When we came the restaurant was so busy, average wait was about 15 mins and we were so happy here."}
{"text":"i didnt like Gen when i lived in Cali, so when i heard they opened one here i wasnt in a rush to try it. one day i wanted to take a risk so i went with my boyfriend. it was somewhat difficult finding the restaurant because it was our first time and we havent been to that mall in a while. Result was a long walk to the restaurant but that wasnt an issue, it was our bad for parking in the wrong area. Interior is modern and trendy, like every other Gen. i liked the hostess because she was sweet but our server was sort of rude, im kind of bummed i didnt get her name(i wouldnt post it here and put her on blast but for next time if we ever return i would let the hostess know i dont want that server to help us). she wasnt friendly or genuine, and when i asked her for brisket sauce she said exactly these words \"in a little bit.\" and walked off to help another table. i understand we were still waiting on most of our food but we have the first plate of meat already and even the empty table next to us had their sauce tray filled, ours was empty. i didnt want to be that person to just trade it or grab it from another table. anyway, ive worked in customer service and that girl could use some lessons, something like \"sure i'll get that right out for you\" or \"oh im sorry i'll be right back with that\". Food was mediocre, it comes out in tiny plates like tapas so i felt like i was eating at Gyukaku lol. Yeah they have a larger menu and variety but what good is it when the quality isnt there? I have to say though, good choice of music playlist or at least when i was there. Welps, cant say i didnt give this one a chance, from now on I'll stick to Hwaro or the new Doh(Tofu Hut) closer to my location."}
{"text":"This is me and my husband's favorite kbb place right now. It's super modern, clean, and hands down THE nicest kbb place we've EVER been, too! Our service was amazing. Alodia was friendly and efficient. She always came back frequently to check on us. Gen, don't lose her! She's definitely one of the reasons we and many customers will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of AYCE Korean BBQ, but even more when they have a very extensive menu.   There are over 20 items you can choose from and you can even select half portions which is great when you are eating in a small group. The quality of the meats was definitely above avg for AYCE standards and the service was great. They put your menu items on an iPad which makes it easy.  However, the WAIT can be brutal! We went on a Sunday night thinking there wouldn't be anywhere there and boy were we wrong. The wait was 1.5 hours. On a Sunday night at 7pm! I can't imagine Fri or Sat night. You probably would need to start eating around 5pm.   Overall, given Korean BBQ in Tempe, this is a great spot. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"California franchises are way better than this one. No one came to replace our Grill when it turned black. And they don't necessarily even have rice wraps. I rather drive the 3 hours to Corona and eat at the one there."}
{"text":"There is an obvious lack of Korean BBQ restaurants in Henderson, so Gen has become my go-to place for a late KBBQ craving.   Environment: The inside is very trendy. Neon lights, a projector, and various sections of seating including low booths, high tables, and a full bar. The lighting is somewhat dim but the overall atmosphere is fun and the restaurant is usually full, however not full to the point where I have ever had to wait for more than 20 minutes for a table.  Food: Going to an All You Can Eat restaurant you obviously must sacrifice a little bit of quality for quantity and that's what you get at Gen. However, they do have a rather extensive menu, with stand outs being the Garlic Calamari, Signature Steak, and Premium Pork Belly. Additionally, they do have happy hour later at night which gives you a couple dollars off Beer and Soju.  Service: The service is overall good. They are typically adequately staffed and even if my server seems out of reach there are various other employees habitually checking up on us. Additionally, they are attentive in bringing all the sides I typically request.  Overall, Gen is reliable option for KBBQ if you are in Henderson and don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Gen is close to my house, and was the first Korean bbq place I tried and I have no regrets. I feel the way they do things is modern compared to the rest of the Korean bbq places I've tried. The place is hip and cool. Music is mostly r&b which I like and just sets a nice vibe. Now onto the people in the front, sigh. This is where I have to say they have work to do. I've been here more times than I can count and 9 out of 10 it takes forever for the people to greet or say anything to those walking in. They are usually busy looking at each other discussing either non work related things or just mumbling away to each other about seating and what not. If the staff at the front of the house could be trained better and not be a hassle to get their attention that would be great. Now onto the food, I always do the same thing, Cajun shrimp, steak, and the amazing pork cutlet with cheese. These never disappoint and I will order to my hearts content. I've also come alone on occasion and find that gen let's you have a solo eater as many other Korean places won't do that so I appreciate that. Aside from this I think gen is my go to when driving to Chinatown is a hassle or I want a trendier place to eat!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The food was awesome and the staff made the whole experience seamless. We were given time to finish the food we had on our table without being pestered and just as we'd be finishing up our waiter would pop up and put in another order for us. He made recommendations that were really helpful since it was our first time and was kind to us while answering all our questions.  I highly recommend it. And my husband and I will be returning...soon!"}
{"text":"Jaenica and Alodia are the best servers I have ever had in my life. The food was delicious and service was on point :)"}
{"text":"Crazy fast service.  Every time we wanted something, there was waitstaff ready.  Our drinks were never empty.  The longest we waited for anything was under 30 seconds from the moment we realized we wanted it to delivery.  We had our drink and food order in in seconds, when our sides were delivered.  At most 20 seconds later, we had our waters and our meats.  They replaced our burnt-on cooking surface twice without being asked.  I'd suggest a specific meat, but they were all great and we went overboard and tried a lot.  The spicy pork bulgogi was the best, but it is always my favorite.  We will be back."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!!! Great food!!! Excellent customer service!!! ALODIA and the rest of the staff were awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great selection of items to choose for a AYCE. A total of 36 items for a perfectly reasonable price! The service needs work, after we finished it took 20 mins for the servers to get us the check! The side dishes were too small compared to othet places I've been to. Overall its really good place to eat if you wanna stuff your belly with some meat!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can ever get used to dealing with Ron meet at the table where you're actually eating the meat when it's finally cooked not a pleasant dining experience for me Very concerned with cross contamination"}
{"text":"Omg all you can eat Korean bbq. I've been waiting for the famous California based Korean bbq to come down to Arizona and spread their love!  Delicious food, filling AF, and definitely get your money worths of food"}
{"text":"Where to start?  Reviewing a grand opening is not easy considering issues that always come with those.  There were about 3 appetizers missing, no ice tea, and they do not carry the famous Hawaiian steak here.  Not a fan of the kimchi, k.f.c, fried pork cutlet, and popcorn shrimp.  That being said we really enjoyed everything else.  The quality and unlimited amount of Korean Bbq was awesome!  Most importantly for $20!  The one thing that I really loved was the pork cheek (#2 hangjungsal) just as good as my favorite restaurants Kyara and Raku.  Service was fantastic also, especially Lisa!"}
{"text":"Customer service is lacking all around. I have eaten here multiple times and have always had an issue with service. We have had the hostess call our names after an hour wait, just to tell us that our table is not ready and we need to wait another 20 minutes. Once we were seated, we waited another 15 minutes for drinks. In general the staff is curt or non-existent. I had an assistant manager harass our table about things the manager said was ok.  I will not be back until customer service is a priority."}
{"text":"With high hope I  walked in. I was there for lunch waited 10 minutes before we got seated and we were only one waiting.  food was bad. I will never go back. Rather go to sula."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I'll probably be back at least once or twice a month. Fell in love with the Beef Bulgogi and Crispy Squid Legs. Love the modern and fresh environment. It's a pretty place to look at. As good as the food is delicious! Waiting time both times has been roughly 30 minutes. (Worth it)! If it's early enough, you can kill time walking around the mall. The place is conveniently located, and of course, parking is super easy since it is inside the mall shopping center. No hassle, like over at Spring Mountain. Waited on by Luna! She was quick to make sure we were always good!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this to open in Arizona since I first tried it in California. This place is great for any occasion and the atmosphere is really casual.  The food is awesome! They let you choose 4 items at a time, but you can get anything you want. I was thrown off that weekends are at dinner menu pricing so beware if you come for lunch and expect to pay $15.99. Service was great and everyone was very helpful and welcoming! Every server seems to be very attentive and quick. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"The service in this place was really great, especially our server Blake!  I'm Korean and have been in some Korean restaurants with better food, but horrifying service (most of them, actually).  Don't get me wrong, the food was really good (do the bulgogi) with decent sides.  Not a big fan of the Gen Chadoh, it was a little tough.  The green iced tea was really, really, green...and good!  The environment was clean, modern, and had a great bar!  We will be back for sure, especially at that price...$14.95 for all-you-can-eat lunch?  Wha?  Yes please."}
{"text":"First time at Gen this even and I have to say it is our new spot for date night! I've heard soo much about this place and we finally tried it. It being Mother's Day we expected to wait long. Longer than the wait we had. Given it was Mother's Day we actually didn't wait long. I checked in at 4:30pm and was told it was going to be a 60-90min wait. They took my name and phone # and texted me when we were close. We were seated by 5:30pm and out the place by 6:45pm! Impressive!  The service was spectacular! From the start to the end and everything in between! It was a well oil machine, in my opinion. Ordering was easy as the server had iPads (or some electronic device) that they used to input our order as we spoke and the food was out to us in minutes. They had servers to take our orders, bus persons for drinks and \"runners\" as I call them serving our food. From one order to another, wait was minimal. We even had someone offer us a grill change in between! The meat was nice and fresh. Selections of meat was outstanding and to top it off they had appetizers that were included in the AYCE price of $19.95!   The place was more of a lounge feel. Dimmed lights and loud music. It was nice! I definitely think it's more for adults because of the feel but it was still a kid friendly restaurant. They had spacious booths and walkways. I personally won't take my kids with us here but if you had to, there's no harm as several families had babies to kids with them.   Another thing I loved was the place was not smokey! We didn't leave smelling like Korean bbq like we would at any other kbbq joint. They had the new grill that had the vents on them and smoke went directly in. It was awesome!  Will definitely be back for more date nights or girls night for sure!   Great job GEN!  Btw, out server was Justin and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good meat! We did the all you can eat option, which is roughly $21 per person. This is a very good price considering the quality of meat and service provided. They give you an abundant number of side dishes, and a large selection of meats. The service was very kind and attended to your every needed. The wait for seating does take a bit. But when it comes down to ordering your meat, it comes out very fast. It's great for groups too! The atmosphere is very modern, and a tad upscale. However, your attire can be casual or formal. Very good place, recommended if you want to get a taste of Korean barbecue!"}
{"text":"Ozzy is dope, love this place. Very upscale and delicious! Tons of options and they change the grill often."}
{"text":"1 star for terrible customer service. I was there with some friends and asked my husband to pick me up. I told him where I sat and as soon as he walked over, the hostess, assistant manager, and shift manager were so quick to assume that he was there to free load the AYCE and kicked him out. They all approached us and created a scene to explain the policy. Uhh...we would've paid the extra $20 to have the additional party join us, but don't just assume he showed up eat there!  And after all that scene, the assistant manager was about to make the exception after I kept arguing with him. Sad to say, we won't be going back there again. Maybe it's time to hire more mature staff who can handle those situations better regardless of the policy you are trying to enforce."}
{"text":"Above average meat for a BBQ house and the price isn't bad either!  Don't go to Honey Pig unless you like animal grade meats and an occasional stomach ache!"}
{"text":"AYCE BBQ price is ok, service was very nice, meat quality ok, location is in henderson, i dont like the feeling there. its to loud"}
{"text":"I first tried Gen in California and I liked it. You get a nice variety of meats at a very reasonable price. There are some appetizers that are part of the AYCE menu. Price per person depends on when you go: weekday vs weekend, lunch vs dinner. We've been here for lung during the week which is probably the best time to go because you avoid the ridiculous wait during the weekend AND it's only $15 per person.  The banchan was good. From the AYCE menu, we tried: brisket, bulgogi, garlic pork belly, signature steak, KFC, and jap chae. I liked everything especially the garlic pork belly. Yuuuum!!!  The thing I like the most about Gen is that each grill has its own vent. The smoke doesn't even get a chance to go up more than 2 inches - it gets sucked in right away so, you don't end up smelling like grilled meat!  Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich - it's not part of their AYCE menu but it is available. The flavors they have include coffee, vanilla, mango, green tea, etc. They're ok. The macaron shells are very dry and hard. The ice cream in the middle is icy. Skip this and just eat all the meat!"}
{"text":"Clean environment. Good taste. Great price for AYCE Korean BBQ ($20/person dinner).   Gen is a franchise I first tried in CA. Atmosphere is consistent, but Vegas menu is different and appears catered more towards an American palate.   The (raw meat) portions are served smaller; let's call it a single person serving. No complaints about this approach (just a heads up). Quality of meat appears of \"better than average\" (for now, at least). Large selection of meats as well as a good selection of appetizers.   An \"A\" for effort on service, but they've plenty of room for improvement. Long periods of waiting for the next order, bringing the wrong things, and having to remind the server about the orders. Staff does not mind their P's & Q's, which isn't a deal breaker, but leaves a lasting impression when a tray of raw meat darts past your face without so much as an \"excuse me\".   Overall, I recommend Gen to anyone who enjoys Korean BBQ. Not your standard creature comforts, but a good meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"Heard about it but a friend and was blown away awesome bbq Korean ... the pork belly was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"First off this is not traditional k BBQ.  So don't expect it to be authentic. That being said. For what it's worth is pretty darn good.   You can eat anything you want as many times as you want.   Not like some other kbbq places (cough *honeypig).  Granted the meats are not all authentic traditional Korean marinades. They are still tasty.  Especially the smoked pork belly and the #3 sliced brisket."}
{"text":"I'm on a work trip and happen to accidentally find this place.  Its really good.  I got no 7 and 10.  Its so fun cooking the meat yourself.  The marinades are very tasty. I ate a lot of beef and couldn't stop. I would come back."}
{"text":"The meat here is super fresh and has a bunch of appetizers to choose from. Unfortunately they were out of some of the ones I wanted, but the ones I tasted were good. For an AYCE KBBQ spot, the price is very affordable as well."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of Gen. I have lost count of how many times I've been here over the past 2 years and I have never had a bad experience. The wait times are sometimes annoying but it is always worth it for the food. Unfortunately this last time I went made me question whether I should go back again. This past time I went I was with a party of 10, which of course is a large party so we knew we were going to have to wait a while. The wait time the hostess gave us was 45 minutes. Which we though was great. We had also asked her to not split up our party since I know sometimes they do that with larger parties. She assured me we would not be split up. After waiting 45 minutes we asked the hostess how much longer she thought it was going to be, and she pointed at a large group at a table and said she was going to seat us at that large table and that the guests at the table were paying and then leaving. She said it would me no more than 20 minutes. We waited another 30 minutes and watched the staff clear that table, then they called our names after waiting for a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes. When she walked us in she walked us to a different table that the other hostess said we were waiting on and tried to split us up into 3 different tables, which is something I had asked them not to do since the beginning. I voiced my frustration and after speaking to the manager she reluctantly moved us to the table we waited an extra 30 minutes for.   Once we were seated the food and service was exceptional as always. It just really bothered me that they had us wait an extra 30 minutes on top of the 45 originally and told us they were putting us at one specific table that we waited the extra 30 minutes for then put us at another table that was open the whole time!   I probably will not be coming back to this location, instead I will go back to the original Las Vegas Gen at Galleria Mall."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here by myself--prob not optimum to eat AYCE kbbq alone bec you just can't try that much variety.  I got and ate 90% of my food (bec it's bad to waste food): steak, marinated steak, Bulgogi, rice cake, kfc, tofu soup.  Everything I had was fantastic (except for rice cake--didn't care for those).  The service here is awesome--they change the grill without me asking.  My server is named Kailin--super friendly and helpful--made my dining experience wonderful."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here with my girlfriend and we had a great experience. The waiter checked up on us regularly and the food was great. If you have a lot of time to kill I would recommend this place. Cooking your own food can be time consuming though so don't go here if you are lookin for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"I find myself eating here with friends (usually a group of 6-10) when we're in the area which is usually on rare occasions because of the location being far from the university. This restaurant is located at the Galleria Mall. Service is inconsistent... there are good days and bad days but mostly good. Selections vary and the quality of the food is okay.   Theres some days when the flame of the grill can be low or hot. Whenever it's low, it takes a really long time for it to cook.   We always get the pork bulgogi, GEN premium steak, pork belly, beef tongue, and Red Wine steak. They also have appetizers like gyoza and the jap chae. Sides are unlimited, of course. Everything legit tastes better with the sauce though. Stay away from the beef bulgogi. We ordered the beef bulgogi once and it wasn't that great. Another thing is that they dont have steamed egg which can be disappointing.   In all cases, I prefer Hobak, Magal, or DOH.. Although Hobak and Magal aren't AYCE, quality and taste matters. is what Hobak and Magal exceed in. Other than that, I will continue to come back here with friends once in awhile."}
{"text":"GEN! I loved going to Gen when they were still in SoCal. They used to have unmarinated short ribs and it was so delicious. Then they switched suppliers and they no longer carried the unmarinated short ribs so I stopped going as much. Then they came to Vegas but they were in Henderson and that was far. But they are pretty much the cheapest AYCE BBQ in Vegas at $21.99 per person. And now that they have opened up on Decatur and Sahara, they are much closer and maybe we can go more often!  Came here on Thursday night for dinner with my husband and some friends after my friend told us about their soft opening. Their establishment is pretty big with similar layouts to their Henderson location and Cali locations. What we did notice is that some tables, they have a hood for ventilation while other tables, their vent was on the sides of the grill.   We ordered a bunch of their beef tongue and beef belly. They were really delicious. Just be sure not to overcook them or the meat will get tough. We also got their pork belly, brisket, steak, hawaiian, steak, bulgogi, japchae, and some other things.   Everything was pretty good. Meat was decent. The japchae was so-so .. I've had better japchae at other places. It's still nice to have though so you won't be eating meat the whole time. There's salad as well. Unfortunately, they don't have the rice paper side dish yet since they are in soft opening. Though, honestly, I wouldn't count them having it all the time regardless of soft opening or grand opening cause their Henderson location doesn't always have it.   Service was pretty good. They didn't have a limit on how much you can order, which is fantastic. They used to limit you to four a few years back but now they don't! The meats got delivered super fast but who knows if that'll stay that way.   They were actually supposed to open earlier. They were working on getting some disposable grill plates for the grills since they are really hard to clean. They figured that it may be easier for them to just dispose it after it's been used. However, the problem with disposable grills is that it causes a lot of smoke when you use it. And because of that, they couldn't pass the health department with it. In the end, they had to scrap that idea and go along with the traditional grills.   If Gen could get the adjustable hoods like the ones in Korea or the ones at Hobak and Doh, it would be so much better. Even though the establishment is brand new, their ventilation is horrible. Normally, a place takes a while for it to stink up with BBQ smell but I walked out smelling like some grilled short ribs and keep in mind that they are still in soft opening!"}
{"text":"Tracy is the BEST waitress! Ask for her if you plan on going. Super quick and is really entertaining to talk to. Experience is dependent on the waiter/waitress so ask for her if u can. Good food! Wish there were more dessert options tho."}
{"text":"It is my first time here and the food is super awesome. Jaenica was very accommodating and friendly. We would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Gen and it was an amazing experience. The server was Josh and he was so fantastic. He showed my daughter and I how to order and how to cook the meat. Josh brought us over the chop stick cheaters, which was amazing. My overall visit to Gen was perfect. The atmosphere was so chill and the music was upbeat and we vibe while enjoying the new spot. I would definitely recommend this place, definitely returning for another memorable dinner!"}
{"text":"This was a really great experience! The meat is really well marinated and the food is really tasty! We really enjoyed our server Micheal who was super knowledgeable and showed us how to cook our food well. He really was the greatest waiter we've ever had! Such great customer service! :)"}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ Restaurant in Tempe . Great and fast service. Nice interior but Foods quality and tastes are C level."}
{"text":"Jessica our server was terrific .... She quickly greeted us upon seating, got us our drinks and was there whenever we wanted more dishes....and the food fabulous!!!  We will be back!!!!  Our favorite was the bulgogi beef and the chicken.  Cooking our food at the table was rather entertaining."}
{"text":"Terry is a great server!  This was the best food and the service was by far the best I have experienced! Ashtray was really quick to clear things- loved it!"}
{"text":"It was amazing with my classmates on dinner time:)) hangjeongsal and number 7 are my favorite and servers also were awesome!!! Recommend to go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Good food. Clean.  Bathroom is a little creepy though, and the atmosphere was too much dark blue lights.  I love kkbq that has other appetizers such as Korean Fried Chicken, Japchae, and Cajun Chicken. The price for dinner, $22 was not bad.  The bannchan potato salad was so good! I would go back."}
{"text":"Yummy for my tummy!  Love this place... You have a return customer.  Get some Rice paper would be perfect!  KFC and sesame chicken was delicious.  Nice to hear everyone welcome you right before your seated!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected...didn't realize it was all you can eat. Perfect stop for my \"college boy\" son who can eat like a horse! Great menu selections, staff was cool, mini-lecture on how it's done here was not cool. Will be back and look out Gen's...the college boy will be bringing his big eater buddies!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times so far and the I've never been disappointed with the quality and variety of food Gen offers. As simple as a salad can be, I'm in love with the salad here, goes great with the meat! The meat here is super fresh and so many options to choose from! Great ambiance and friendly service. We were asked if we needed our grill changed every 15 min or so!   The only gripe I have about the place is the wait time. I've waited from 30 min to an hour and half. The place doesn't take reservations. Oh well, the food's worth the  wait. Try to avoid dinner time!"}
{"text":"If I can give this establishment a negative star, this place would win it in a heart beat.  I consider myself a Korean BBQ Courvoisier and this place blows in every way.  We arrived around five and was greeted by the hostess rolling her eyes at us. We weren't the only lucky ones that got those rolled eyes too, customers that came after us all got the same. We got sat down after five minutes which was pretty good after what just happened.   First our server didn't want to be there and as far as we could tell the other waitress's near by had the same horrible attitude. They weren't happy and nobody smiled. But here you have an energetic family smiling and being positive until they bring out the food; it was a disappointment. The portions were like for my eight year old, we had to order like the max order over and over just to make something happen.  This place is the reverse of all you can eat (AYCE).  We weren't the only ones complaining about the servings. Then to top things up, we had to remind our waitress for our drinks, refills and napkins.  Then don't let me get started with the busser's; they were just running laps, passing tables with empty plates on them, I had to literally put the plates in front of his way for him to stop.  But they were all like this, this place is far from good.  I can't read anymore of these reviews from this place from people that don't know what real Korean BBQ AYCE is and the service.  To end this horrible dining experience we were asked by our dopey depressed waitress if we were paying cash or credit? She waited until I gave her a response; to eventually have a rude cashier come up to us with a tablet asking me for my CC. I had to double check she actually worked there because she didn't introduced herself or let us know she was going to take care of our bill at our table.  Swipe, signed and was given a receipt then she walked away without saying thank you or anything like she enjoyed her job.  So food was horrible Service was horrible Environment was crappy  Will never comeback again!"}
{"text":"A few of my classmates and I came here after our exam on a Wednesday. We arrived at about 2:45pm. There was no wait and we made it on time for the lunch pricing.   The hostess seated us and said it was busy so can sit in a booth. 15 minutes goes by and our server still hasn't greeted us yet.  We had to get another servers attention to find out who our server was. She was nice enough to get our order started since we had to wait. She pointed out our server to us. Not saying any names since this is a new restaurant.'  Finally, we see our server walk by had to get his attention for him to even come by. \"he needs to work on his server skills\"   Every time we asked for something he just dropped it off and left. Couldn't even get a word in.  Two manager came by and asked how our food was. So that's a plus and then the nice server took over for the one that was incompetent.  The food was good, obviously is self serve all you can eat Korean BBQ. It was only $15.99 for lunch. It has almost has the same amount of items for dinner which is $25.99.  Cool atmosphere, blue lights everything and white booths."}
{"text":"It's really good and I'll likely go back.  The good:    The flavors, the ambiance, the experience, the service, the variety    The bad:   You don't really know everything you can get. The menu is just a portion of what's available. It would have been nice to know we could get vegetables and noodles.  The price. $25 per person is a lot for this. You have to be a serious eater to get close to eating that much worth of this type of food.  The smoke. It's a bunch of little indoor BBQs. They need better ventilation IMO.  The fact you immediately get greeted with a threat that if you don't eat all your food they will charge you an additional $5 per person. Yea...no. Fuck that."}
{"text":"They're really fast at serving food but you want to make sure that you don't order too much right in the beginning. If you order 4 orders of pork belly, they're going to bring 4 plates of pork belly which takes up so much space on the table. I've been to so many different korean bbq restaurants and not gonna lie, this place is not authetic at all. I ordered their spicy tofu soup and it was just very blend and they served it when it wasn't warm at all. Their meat quality is alright. Don't expect too much if you've been to other Korean bbq restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Came here with my family Their food is delicious, their service is great and unlike most Korean BBQ places this one is actually clean . The servers are amazing great customer service ."}
{"text":"Fair price for all you can eat Korean bbq; however, there is reason to mention that this place lacked the authenticity of Korean bbqs I experienced in Korea. The meat is average quality and you're definitely getting the quality that matches the price. The portions are relatively small, but each person in your party receives up to 34 menu selections - including the sides. The steaks and galbi are pretty decent and probably the best value of the all you can eat menu. If you are a fan of Sundubu (spicy tofu stew) like they have in Korea, I don't recommend their side of it. It was pretty watery and not hot at all. My friend ordered the sesame chicken and it was overcooked, extremely dry, and lacking in sauce and flavor. The samgyupsal ( pork belly) selections were absolutely delicious, especially the pork belly marinated in red wine. I would also recommend the chabol (thinly sliced pieces of beef). Service was divided in quality in aspects of who was serving you. Individuals check in periodically to see what you'd like to order and also change out the stove (whenever you feel) to maximize the flavor of the meat. The menu was lacking in the side selections in comparison to other korean bbqs, such as steamed egg and bean paste stew.   Overall, this place doesn't even come close to other Korean bbqs I have experienced. If you are in the mood to eat a ton of meat, want to ease into the korean bbq experience,  or looking for an easy place to fill yourself up, I recommend this place to satisfy those desires. You can't expect highly of all you can eat bbqs, but this one is pretty decent. It does beat the other restaurant selections in the galleria and is a nice place to stop after shopping and running errands. It really depends on what you're ordering, but personally I'd invest in a better quality bbq if it was a nice occasion."}
{"text":"I had a blast cooking on the grill at the table and the food options were awesome. Great service and even despite our grill going out 5 times it was Saltillo a fun experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Korean BBQ and it was a great experience. The staff was really great and attentive. The all you can eat special is really great and it provides so many options. The food quality was very good and I definitely will be back here again."}
{"text":"Oh man, F I N A L L Y!!! I'm obsessed with Gen back home in Orange County and now it's offcially in Las Vegas! I am so happy since Vegas doesn't have a decent Korean BBQ restaurant. Gen have the best all you can eat deal.   My favorites are always the Hawaiian Steak and Joomulluk. The table is equipped with five side dishes which are bottomless of course. I think what makes Gen stand out is their outstanding service. Regardless of how busy the restaurant is, I feel like they are always well staffed and the employees are very quick and helpful. I can't wait until my next visit, so I can stuff my face with more prime meat!"}
{"text":"Food was good kailin was our server she was great first time here satisfied so full had tons of meat lots of choices definitely Coke back again"}
{"text":"I really want to rate them 3.5 stars, but the lack of attention during the last half hour of our dining experience made me round down to 3. Definitely not a 4 star in my book. At first though, the service was top notch. We got our orders out quickly and the drinks were refilled promptly. After the restaurant got busier our waiter disappeared. We ordered meats and never got them. Finally we just gave up and asked for our check as the waiter was delivering food to another table. Now for the food:  The ban chan left much to be desired with very small portions (literally 2 tablespoons of potato salad). Additionally the taste of the ban chan was meh. The fish cake strips had no flavor, the Kim Chee was very mild and the pickled onions with jalapeños had no jalapeños.   The meat:  Premium steak: a slab of beef with a huge strip of fat. Definitely wasn't ribeye but top sirloin I believe. It really didn't have much flavor but cooked nice and tender on the grill.   Galbi short ribs: these weren't as sweet as I'm used to but still tasted great with the crisp of the grill. For a party of 3, the portion was 2 short ribs, which we reordered 4 times but got 3 actual orders.   Beef belly: another tasty meat we ordered repeatedly due to the tiny portion size. This might have been my favorite meat of the meal. The beef bacon was thinly sliced and fatty which meant it cooked up quickly.   Beef tongue: thinly sliced tongue that was very tender with a strong beefy flavor. It was very lean and went well with the sesame oil with salt and pepper combo.   Red wine pork belly: tasted nothing of any pork belly I've ever had. This was more like a bland really tough piece of pork. Even though they only gave us 2 pieces of pork belly (bacon size), it was really hard for the 3 of us to choke it down. I'm not ashamed to say that I hid a portion of it under my rice!   Spicy baby octopus: the portion was nice, 3 whole baby octopuses with a spicy red sauce tossed with sliced white onions and green onions. The taste was bold and flavorful.   KFC: fried nuggets of chicken smothered in what tasted like a ketchup based sweet sauce. It was cold by the time it made it to our table and was therefore less appealing.   Overall the food wasn't bad but when you're used to eating at other bbq joints with amazing sides (like Hwaro) it just leaves something to be desired.   At the end of our meal we waited what seemed like an eternity just to get our check. This is my number 1 pet peeve. Don't make me chase you down to pay you!"}
{"text":"The previous reviews of this place had me expecting good food and crappy service. They were spot on! The crap service in my experience came from the hostess stand not so much the server. We walked in at 5:30 and the place was packed. We were told the wait for a table would be 30-35 minutes, whereas the bar would be available in 5-10. We opted for the bar, and the hostess took our name, asked us for ID and said we just had to wait for them to set up the bar seating. We waited about 15 minutes, watching the bar seats get pulled over and the ban chan placed around the burner. Meanwhile a couple walks up and I see them getting carded as well, thinking oh they've chosen to sit at the bar too. I see a short conversation between the hostess that took our name and the one carding the new couple, then she turns around and leads the couple to the seats we had already waited 15 minutes for. I immediately look to the the girl that took our name and she responds \"She didn't know you were waiting, I'm sorry.\" She spoke while rolling her eyes and talking as if she could care less that we were inconvenienced. We then had to wait about 5 more minutes for another place to be set up. I was so mad, by the time we sat down the other couple that bypassed us already had meat cooking on their grill. When we ordered, it literally took 15 minutes for our first plate of meat to come out. The spicy baby octopus was the first to arrive. I do like that the portions are small, so you can try many things without being too stuffed. The pork cheek was too thick and tough, and was void of flavor. The premium steak wasn't ribeye, but was still tasty. The smoked garlic pork belly was salty and smoky deliciousness. The red wine pork belly was good but very sweet. The pork steak and the spicy pork bulgogi might have been my favorites. The garlic calamari was flavorless. They were out of squid. The garlic chicken with nacho cheese was underwhelming. The marinated premium steak was small but tasty with a sweet pineapple ring on top. The beef tongue was a bit bland. I will say that sitting at the bar has its benefits as you're able to ask your server across the bar for drink refills and meat refills. All being said, if you show up when they're not busy, or stand far enough away from the hostess stand to not notice them shuttle in people that came in after you, you might enjoy your experience here. As for me, I'll be trekking back Hwaro to get my fix."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I went for their lunch special and was pleasantly please on the price. It's affordable and let's not forget it's all you can eat! The atmosphere is nice, they play current music and the decor is also nice. The staff was very friendly and attentive as well. My favorite was the spicy pork and the seaweed salad. But really everything was good here. No complaints here and I will definitely be going back for their lunch special."}
{"text":"The food and service was really great! Got seated right away and the whole staff was really friendly. We had Ozzy as a waiter, and he was awesome! Great guy!"}
{"text":"The best Korean bbq in Henderson!!! The customer service is very good and food is fresh and delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"This is not a korean BBQ. Don't expect any warm or hot drinks, not even hot water. They serve spicy tofu soup that you cannot drink. instead of being friendly, professional, welcoming and proud of their services and menu, the pony tailed waiter warned that they charge for excessive waste and insist the dinner buffet is American style! We hope another REAL Korean BBQ opens around this area, like SURA buffet on Spring Mountain Rd, where customers are welcome to select and choose quantities of what they want instead of getting what PONY TAIL dumps on you. Also, HOT beverages should be offered, especially when serving excessively greasy food. Sorry to say this unhealthy fatty and unfriendly place is definitely NOT recommended."}
{"text":"Really swanky Korean bbq smoke house with NO ventilation what so ever. I know korean BBQ spots are smokey, but this location tops it. Came in for dinner on a Wednesday night & it was moderately packed. The restaurant is huge with a lot of seating. The smoke that builds up in this restaurant is horrendous. The vent on top of us did not even seem to work.  The front doors were left wide open during dinner service to get some fresh air in the place.  We noticed that the host would go outside several times to gasp for fresh air & when she returned she had to squint her  due to the heavy wall of smoke. I really hope they do fix their ventilation.  Overall good Korean bbq selection, attentive & quick service.  Tips: - Hawaiian steak one of my top favorites.  - 2 hour time limit. - Mango Ice cream macaroons for the finale."}
{"text":"Hands down, theeee best Korean BBQ I've ever been in. The ambience was contemporary, elegant, upbeat and classy. It was a busy evening and the hostess still managed to seat my party of 3 instantly. Our server was Jaenica she was efficient, helpful and always had a smile on her face. The food was delicious, and reasonable for the price of $19.95 per person all you can eat including appetizer."}
{"text":"The meat was descent I actually enjoyed the beef. The chicken not so much. Didnt like how they had the sides layed out upon arrival n didnt pick them up when they seen we put it to the side n didnt touch it.Food came out fast..No line which I thought it would be at 10pm on a Saturday night. $20 for all you eat, not bad. Great place for a date. The place is lit up nice. You should try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is so highly rated. The food and service are mediocre at best. Try Gangnam for.your KBBQ fix!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to have lunch yesterday at Gen  l, we were expecting lunch rush whats so ever but we just walked in and got seated right away. They were very efficient to get us started so we ordered and got the grill going. While my husband added all the meats to the grill I glanced inside the grill and saw curly hairs and a long hairs on the grill. Right away we tried to get their attention trying to wave down anyone. Finally someone came and they offered to change the grill however the server asked \"do you want to keep the meat on here?\" I looked at him like are you really going to make us eat these meat that has hair on it! I was in awe on how they handles this situation. The server acted like it was our problem! And if course my husband didn't want to make a big deal and observed how they handled this situation. Mind you we dine many places and travel to eat so we know thibgs happen but its how you handle the situation to make it right. NOTHING WAS OFFERED, NO MANAGERS OR SUPERVISORS CAME.. no apology, nothing! We eat many places, if the food is good and issues happen and the establishment express their apology we will try them again however if food is okay and there are service issues etc. without any follow up or apology we will not be dining at their establishment again."}
{"text":"Way better than I was expecting. The ingredients were fresh and the service was attentive. Didn't want to stop... so happy there is a time limit!"}
{"text":"So I've been to Gen multiple times since moving back to Vegas in September, and tonight was absolutely amazing.  My best friend and I were greeted by very friendly staff, as always, and once seated, Ozzy definitely took care of us. He was incredibly attentive and even though we ordered a lot of things all at once, he didn't forget a single thing.  He was always courteous, made small talk that wasn't even generic, and was all around an awesome server. He wasn't at our table too often to be a bother but not often enough that we felt ignored, either. Definitely has a mastery of his job and you can tell he enjoys doing what he does - keep up the amazing work Ozzy!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went early on a Friday night and the wait was only 15 minutes. Overall, the food and service was amazing. The price ($24.95) was worth it considering the quality of the food here. The servers were very attentive and took our orders quickly. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, if you are in a Monday or Tuesday, request Ish! I've been coming to this location for years, and by far he is hands down the best server I've had here!"}
{"text":"Gen is by far the best Korean ayce around! Service is always spot on and at this location, we only had to wait five minutes for a table. Not to mention how fancy the place looks! My only vice about this place is it was hard to find. The entrance is from outside the mall, close to Dillard's and near Red Robin. Enjoy your meal folks!"}
{"text":"Today my service was great! I had lots of help from my server Julian who was amazing and offered his help in order for me to find something on the menu I could enjoy. We also made a joke about the octopus being alive, haha. I wish the desert came included into the all you can eat menu, but IT'S OK. The service makes up for it!(:"}
{"text":"Pretty worth it! Went on a Tuesday and there was no wait. Portions are big so come hungry"}
{"text":"Finally a good kbbq place in Henderson! Lots of variety in terms of their meats and appetizers. Tastes delicious!   We received great service from Howard and he was very kind about bringing us whatever we needed."}
{"text":"The convenient location in Henderson and the affordable price make Gen one of the top choices for a hungry carnivore like myself. Even though they recently raised the AYCE price a dollar (dinner $21.99), everyone including the light eaters in my family, can still get value for the cost.  We avoided the location probably the first 6 months after opening because it was so busy, but now we hardly ever have to wait, even at peak times. You can either sit in a booth in the dining area as soon as you walk in, or at a high top in the dining area to the right. Both areas are dimly lit with fluorescent blue lamps providing most of the illumination. Service has been consistently good for us with an occasional server that isn't with the program yet.  There were recent menu changes with some additions and subtractions. You'll still get the regular unlimited banchan served in small dishes with an order of salad and jap chae waiting for you when you are seated. The number of meats available has been condensed, but with 36 items, there is still a sufficient amount to find the ones of your liking. Just order by number, and within two or three minutes you'll start receiving your meats once the server enters them on the their ordering pad. Cooking your own meat is something I've become less a fan of because it takes a serious chunk out of your eating time, especially when you come with two or three other hosses that'll clear the grill before you can say, \"save me some pork belly.\"  The premium steak (#1), chadol (brisket, #4), signature galbi (#10), premium pork belly (#18), Korean fried chicken (#29), and shrimp (#31) usually kick off the feast for us. While not the highest quality meat I've had compared to other joints, there aren't too many AYCE places where I can fill up for a better price."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have been waiting so long for this place to open here. I always eat at Gen when I go to California and I am extremely happy they opened this location in Arizona.    I came in for the 'soft opening' tonight and didn't have the highest of expectations because I knew it was pretty much a trial opening. I waited for about 2 hours and when seated the hostess was extremely friendly and went over the menu with us. Our waiter Kevin was very friendly and efficient. We were helped by a few employees when it came to refills and changing our grills and they were all great! The Brisket and Hawaiian steak are great choices, also the macaroons are great for dessert.   Overall the service & food was great and exceeded my expectations. Would definitely recommend to a friend/family."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Korean BBQ, and Gen is our favorite place to get it in our 'hood!   Why? We've been to a ton of places, and I love the food, cleanliness, service, atmosphere, UNLIMITNESS and affordability of Gen!   Food: You can choose from tons of different proteins and veggies including spicy baby octopus, kalbi beef, chicken, and shrimp. There are appetizers such as gyoza and the freshest salad. There are relishes like kim chi, sweet potato mash, and bean sprouts on your table as well as spices and dipping sauces to make your food your own. For around $22+ a person, the possibilities are endless!   Service: We always have the nicest servers at Gen. We've been for birthdays and on other evenings and never have to wait long for food or drinks. They even change out the grills per your request if you want to avoid mixing seafood and chicken and beef etc.   The smartest thing to do, especially on busy weekends or evenings, is to get there early enough to put in your name (all of your party must be there to be seated) and you can even walk around the mall while you wait if needed.  Just writing this makes me want to go back ASAP!"}
{"text":"This my experience I come for dinner 10:20  At 11:20 server tell me lass call and 11:30 cashier come to us asking to pay our bills.  They close at 12 she rushing us to pay the bills I do understand u close at 12 but she come more than 3 time tell us to pay and everybody work so loud to cleaning make us uncountable to eat we have 30 minutes to eat.  Way u did have sight at 11:30 we have to pay and living restaurant.  Bad customer service and no body event change our grill and refill our drink."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife service is quick, but not very helpful. Food was very good, but would be nice if portions size was adjustable for number in your party. This is because with only 2 people you really can't have many dishes as you will not be able to eat it all."}
{"text":"Great good, great time, pricey but amazing. The waiters are nice and the food is nicely marinated. The taste is great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food was delicious, service is great!  Our server Julian was fantastic! Thank you guys for great times"}
{"text":"Ok, we are not \"all you can eat\" diners. There are 32 items on the menu and it's off the menu ordering and fantastic! We went for lunch and everyrhing was fresh, our server \"D\" was personable and helpful with ordering. The Manager is Danny, knows his stuff aand cares about thw dining experience. This was fun experience"}
{"text":"I went here to this place last night with my brothers and had a good time.  We had the lunch all you can eat at a reasonable price.  One of my brother doesn't eat meat but he will eat seafood and they had enough on the menu for him to have a variety.  We were constantly asked by 4 different people how we were doing . 2 by the waiters, 1 by supervisor Kelly and one by a person asking if we needed our grill changed. Customer service was top notch and I ended tipping them 40%.    Supervisor Kelly made us feel very welcomed and made sure we were happy with our orders.  Even though there's a 2 hour limit, they kept coming with the food non stop unlike some other places where you have to wait till the server comes to get more to bbq because they're short handed or busy.  Thanks for the experience! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good Korean BBQ EVER!!!!!, very nice server KAILIN, love her smile. Good recommendation"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Kailin our waitress was kept running and kept up veery well. The roast beef, tongue and crispy squid is outstanding."}
{"text":"Bad service always takes too long for food and meat to come to the table. The servers also limit my group and I on how much items we can order at a time and we paid for the ayce that's not cool. The grill also always burns up so quickly not like other all you eat places. They don't even offer to put oil on you have to ask. The quality of meat is also subpar. My advice go to a different place for all you can eat. My favorite is honey pig."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend. Nice classy decor. Fast service and best of all the food was Delish! Will definitely be coming back to this place. Would be even  more awesome if they had whole lettuce leaves on their menu, but the radish wraps is a good substitute."}
{"text":"Best service and great BBQ!  Seriously my favorite Korean BBQ place right now.   Some of the best service I have ever had. Staff is ultra friendly, service is super fast.   And to top it all off, the menu has so many options (some I have never even seen or had before) and is at a price lower than most other all you can eat Korean BBQ places of the same/lower quality.   Everything was fresh, great marinades, lots of options. Just overall delicious and so worth it.   Definitely recommend that you try it out!"}
{"text":"First time here! We were seated fairly quickly. We told the server we all wanted separate checks and he brushed us off and said to tell him after we were done eating. The food was decent. They kept changing out our grill. The servers lacked enthusiasm and seemed down every time they had to take our order. When we were done eating we reminded the server we needed separate checks and they said they could only split it three ways. I explained that at the beginning of our meal we were all paying separately and he admitted that he did not understand and there was miscommunication and we should speak to a manager. Overall I would give this place a second chance. Hopefully next time the service will be better."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience, vibe and service! Disliked the food choices and sides not many to choose from.. overall I had a good time and experience. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is way over-hyped, I don't see what's so great about it. Came in around lunch time since I was in the area and it was busy so we waited about 15 minutes before being seated. The whole restaurant was pretty dark and playing loud music.  We got seated at one of the high bar tables, in which there was barely any room to put our plates. There was only 4 dishes of banchan, which is really small compared to other kbbq places. They didn't even taste good, nor were they ever offered to be refilled once the plate was empty.  Our waiter came immediately to take our drink order and then our food order. He disappeared after that and we never saw him again. We had to ask the busser in order to get more food. Our water was never refilled and we had to ask 4 times.  Whoever gave our food to us didn't seem to want to be there. She just mumbled the name of the meat, slammed it on the table and walked off. This happened every time, it made me not even want to order anymore. It also took a while for our dirty dishes to be taken away. I asked for an extra bowl of rice, waited a bit and it never came - so I asked another girl. Waited again and it never came. I asked one more person and it finally came after 20 minutes. The food came out pretty fast but it was alright, nothing special.   The service here was shitty. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. You're better off going somewhere near china town."}
{"text":"This is my third times there....I was very happy the last two times....excellent service excellent food...but today....everything was terrible....the service is not good, the food quality was not good too...my server was busy...keep forgetting my food, I have to ask other servers to get things for me....the meat was not that fresh too...I love Korean food very much, but I think I will go honey pig or sura next time!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love that it's all you can eat, and the price is great too. Deff my go to when I'm on that side of town. Always loved the one in green valley, but hated driving down there. So glad they opened this new location."}
{"text":"It's good!   One of three Korean BBQ places I've tried in the valley. Good quality, good service.  Very, very busy restaurant. Good atmosphere if you can overlook the fact that you're in a mall.  Side dishes were good, glass noodles yum! Meat is meat though Ive had better, more flavourful cuts.  Gangham has a little more authentic cuts and flavor that comes from the meat vs the sugary sauce. That and their generous Sharing of those cuts for less$ makes Gangham my #1."}
{"text":"Best Korean bbq we found in Vegas. Luke was super helpful and on it. We can't wait to bring friends, family and neighbors back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at with the hubby. All though the last time I visited they didn't have the rice paper that is simply amazing to eat with you meats. I still love y'all."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  We came here after a concert at the M resort and this place did not disappoint. We ordered so much food but between the 4 of us we ate it all. The best was the KFC chicken from the apps. Idk what's in it but the sauce with the crispy chicken was great. We had 4 of those orders.  The grilled chicken was the only bad part. The spicy chicken was the best one just wish the pieces of chicken were a bit thinner because they took a long time to cook and 2 of us did it eat any beef or pork only chicken and shrimp.  OMG the Cajun shrimp was the best part we literally had 5 orders and each order came with 5 shrimp. We got our money's worth with just the shrimp.  Just beware the shrimp is with the head and not deveined, if that doesn't bother you it's a must try."}
{"text":"We decided to come here to celebrate my Dad's 67th birthday.  There's 8 of us in our party.  They said 30-40 minutes of wait time which we were ok with.  When it was time to sit us, they took it upon themselves to sit us on two tables. They didn't ask us and just assumed that it's ok for them to sit us on two separate tables. This was after waiting 50 minutes already.  We refused the 2 tables, which they didn't like when we did.  Another 45 minutes later, we are still waiting. One of the managers was rude (the chubby caucasian guy).  He said that \"you originally said 11\" which we did, but corrected ourselves within 10 minutes of signing in.  And what's that got to do with trying to sit us separately and making us wait longer than usual because of poor management and not training their employees correctly.  He was not apologetic at all, like it's our fault on why we are still waiting. Poor customer service. The food is probably good but I wouldn't know because we are still waiting!!!! Almost 2 hours now."}
{"text":"2 stars for good service and tasty beef bulgogi.the only thing that i didnt like about this place is we werent told that on saturdays its only dinner special the whole day which is $ 5 more than the lunch special on a regular day.we limit our oder because we ordered the 14.99 and the server didnt say anything."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. It's awesome to finally have a Korean BBQ place in Tempe."}
{"text":"awesome service! I like the environment. people are welcoming, food is amazing. they clean out the grill every so often. you get a lot for your money. no reservations. give them your name and number and they will text you. it's outside of the mall so you have something to do while you wait."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean BBQ my girlfriend and I have been to.   I suggest you order the marinated beef bulgogi, spicy crispy squid (appetizer), and you can't go wrong with the beef brisket. Again, there are many choices to choose from (32+ including appetizers) and the great part is $20 for AYCE!  Service was great and fast! The place was very clean and presentation of the food was appetizing.   Only downside was, their iPads kept disconnecting from their internet so they had to swipe my card three times. (The first two were voided)."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Korean BBQ, where I need to cook my own meat.  I have been opposed to this type of bbqs because, I never wanted to pay for me cooking my own food.  Yet, I wanted to do just that on my birthday!  The atmosphere at Gen, had a cool vibe. The staff was very friendly, accommodating and the service was superb!  We were seated fairly quickly in a nice booth with a hot grill.  I explained to the waiter, this was our first time at any korean BBQ.  He explained how everything worked and he gave us some recommendations, such as starting off with gyoza, which was perfect!  The server took our order, our raw meat arrived at our table in about 2 minutes.  Then it was on like donkey Kong!    We grilled our meat and all the meats and the rest of the food was very tasty...I was impressed!  This AYCE was only $21.00 for dinner, not including drinks.  The time allotted to us was 2hrs, which was more than enough time!    All in all, I was very happy with my  experience at GEN and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying the food was pretty good here. BUT I GAVE THIS PLACE 2 STARS BECAUSE OUR SERVER WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE PERSON SHE RUINED OUR EXPERIENCE HERE. I will add that we came here for a birthday dinner so yes our party was a little big but we gave this server no reason to be rude to us. I work in a high volume customer oriented place as well so I know how stressful it can get. At the end of our meal, we asked to have a check for our table of FOUR since our party was split up at different tables AND SHE SAID that we can only do ONE payment. So after paying, we asked ANOTHER server just out of curiosity if it was possible to have paid with two payments and she said we could've done 3 payments if we wanted. Our server's name was CRIZALAYNNE so if you want to have a good experience there I would ask for a different server if you end up with her. She DID NOT deserve our 18% gratuity for ruining our first experience here. For a 70th birthday dinner which we thought was going to be a memorable one, it just sucks it had to be memorable in a BAD way all thanks to our server."}
{"text":"Wait was not that long. Food was great!! My favorite was the spicy octopus!! My waiter JULIAN was fast, very friendly and had great customer service!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"So glad they open near my house! My husband and I would have dinner here at least once a week. Love their dinner menu, lots of selections. Very reasonable price for all you can eat Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Amazing food, so much for such a great value! Everything was so delicious! I left feeling so full and happy!  And I can't forget the wonderful staff! From the always present Terry, to the clean up crew, Eric and Julius.  We were also helped by Eddie, Shea, Andre, Damien, Koreena and Chris.   Thank you everyone, you made this experience TRULY unforgettable."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ if I wanted to cook the whole time i would have stayed hm. Meat is very tender med well but well done dry.  Once is enough :-("}
{"text":"This place was so good! We were just walking by and it looked like a fun place to try. Every thing is very new and Clean. Our servers Ozzy and Dahuan were very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. They helped us with all of our selections. Everything came out fantastic! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Still fairly new to KBBQ but GEN was awesome! What really made the experience was the service.  Jessica was super friendly helped us with any questions gave her recommendations. She was great! The staff always asked us if we wanted to change our grills and we were never short on drinks.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I would leave zero stars if I could. Literally went to this restaurant on Tuesday of this week, yes, as in four days ago. On Tuesday we were prepared to pay $10.00 for our 4 year olds dinner, after she lined up on the wall to check for height we were advised she would be free. Great! We had a decent meal and good service that night.   My pregnant cravings got the best of me and I wanted a repeat of Tuesday's dinner. So as of 15 minutes ago we were very pleased to walk into the restaurant and offered seating right away. Not much of a surprise when my daughter was asked to stand on the wall again, except this time her charge was $10. Come again??? What changed between Tuesday and Friday? Certainly not her height.   After having the hostess squawk at me about her being over 40 inches Gil Prado, the worlds most useless, condescending, arrogant, piece of crap general manager proceeded to explain how he had 7 kids and how they grow very quickly. He remained a stick in the mud about how they were being courteous to me about her being free on Tuesday, and that he had no idea who worked on Tuesday. I explained to him that I had no problem paying the $10 tonight or on Tuesday and I'm sure they had a schedule that would point them in the direction of whom they should be relating their coaching to. All I wanted was for him to acknowledge that it should and he would advise staff that if they give out such courtesy that they advise consumers that is one, and not to expect it in the future... especially when they visit the establishment more than once per week. He literally laughed in my face. What a piece that guy is.   In reality the restaurant just opened not too long ago he can be smug about the fact I did not eat there tonight nor will EVER spend one red penny there in the future. But, it's customers like me who not only expect good food, but stellar service as well. I don't give two craps how much I enjoy the food at a restaurant, if I receive bad service, especially from some greaseball (Gil Prado) whom had 20 other ways of handling a a simple customer issue, but chose to remain a prick instead then I'm out.   Sadly, Gil Prado watched my family walk of this restaurant and as my husband stated that he would be giving a bad review vehemently confirmed he did not care. Classy.  For the record my 4 year old is in the 90th percentile for height and stood above the line by less than a half inch. Eventually Gens service will lose them business, if jerks like Gil Prado still have any authority.   Our complaint will not end with this review."}
{"text":"We finally found a great Korean all you can eat by our place.  Good service from Howard & Mizzo.  Love the atmosphere, finally galleria got some new zing They need it.  The restaurant design is very Hip just like the strip Larry A"}
{"text":"I dont usually do a review but i went to eat at gen yesterday and its very yummy.. one of the best korean bbq ive ever tasted and our server is the best (janaqui i think is her name) she is very friendly and whatever we order we got it right away... 2 thumbs up for her for doing a great job..."}
{"text":"Really good! Ozzy was our server and he was very helpful and explained the menu really well. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this place because we love Korean BBQ's. They were busy so we had to wait a little. When we were seated, we ordered what we wanted to try and the server started our grill. After putting the meat on the grill, the burner in the grill goes off. In mid-cooking mode, we tell the server, he lights it and says \"don't cover up the whole grill because it needs air to flow.\" But it goes off again. He lights it again and props up the grill tilting it on a side and tells us to see if the air can flow better but if it goes off again, he will move us to another table. Sure enough, the grill goes off. We get his attention and he moves us to a booth. We are very patient people and we understand these things can happen but when the bus person who was moving our food asked my husband how everything was and my husband replied that we haven't eaten yet, he said \"I don't know what's going on,\" \"sorry for asking.\" Really??? Even if he didn't know what's going on, he could've said sorry for the inconvenience because obviously something was wrong if he was moving our food to another table?? But he says sorry for asking...... Customer service skills people! Don't know how the food tastes because we were disgusted with their customer service and their cleanliness. Both tables were not clean and I had to use my napkins. Very disappointed, we were hoping to enjoy Korean BBQ tonight."}
{"text":"Gen never fails to satisfy my craving for KBBQ!! Our server Ozzy had excellent and friendly customer service that made my table's experience great!! Definitely coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Here's one reason why I love Gen, it's near my place and I don't have to worry about driving all the way to china town/spring mountain just to get my KBBQ fix! The prices here aren't so bad. Quality isn't really that great but you get what you pay for. It's AYCE and I must say major kudos points for having shrimp on their menu! There would be days I would crave meat and seafood but I wouldn't be able to decide where to eat... So in the end, Gen would be my choice! Best of both worlds! Also, you must try their flavored soju! It's amazing~ The service here is okay! I would recommend coming in after 9-10pm when it isn't so busy so that the servers could focus more on you and your table. I can't imagine how lunch and dinner is though! I'm sure it's really busy. Yikes. Anyways, I would totally recommend this place to anyone. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I always seem to be disappointed in the end. The only thing I like about Gen is the server and the garlic flavored pork belly. Each time I come I'm reminded of why I shouldn't come back. Today, I didn't get a chance to finish my iced green tea because I was taking care of my baby. So I asked for a cup to take it with us at the end - why not, we paid $3 for damn tea!!! The first person I asked was a hostess at the front. Who looked at another hostess and said \"ummm ok\". Who then talked to maybe their supervisor or manager?! Then a server stopped at our table and made sure the hostess already stopped by to close our bill. We said yes and also asked her for a cup in which she responded the same way \"ummmm ok\". The first gal came back and finally told us they don't give cups for drinks to go. SOME FUCKEN BULLSHIT! WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL US THE FIRST TIME INSTEAD OF MAKING US WAIT!?"}
{"text":"The best! I have dined at many Korean BBQ places in the Las Vegas area for several years and Gen is the best that I have had thus far.  It was perfect from start to finish with some of the best service that I have ever had in my life. Both with a group of two and a group of four, each time I was blown away. It is also the best price! My servers Allen and Terry are two of the best that Las Vegas has to offer. Please go there and experience it yourself whether a veteran at kbbq or of its your first time."}
{"text":"Food is awesome I ate so much it is all you can eat and the price is fair. Visited this place several times its a really nice edition to the galleria mall. It's a really tasty. Service is OK few mistakes, it's still a new restaurant so I'm sure they are still figuring things out. The environment is cool I just think it's to dark but anytime I go here to eat its a good day."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, great prices!!! You get so much for your money! And our server Mike was awesome !!! Will definitely be making this place a regular spot!!"}
{"text":"As others have previously mentioned, this is probably the most Americanized Korean BBQ restaurant you will ever find here in Vegas. It's also part of a chain, but do not let that detract you from coming here as this is one of those cases where the quality comes in stark contrast from its low price of 14.95-lunch and 19.95-dinner (that's WTF-cheap).    Sadly enough, I was very disappointed to find that they did not serve fish cake as part of their banchan. Unlike my significant other, I'm not a HUGE fan of Korean BBQ, but I do love my fish cakes. I always order 5 servings every time I go to one.   What I found very unique was their large selection of BBQ in comparison to other BBQ places. I believe  there's 32 options, including some, but not all of the appetizers. The only thing I'm disappointed about in their selection is that they don't have steamed egg. I feel like that's an absolute must AND classic anywhere you go!  My favorite meats (and we tried everything) at this location include the premium beef tongue, red wine pork belly, and the Gen chadol. I was particularly surprised to see the red wine, as that was an option that I have never seen at all at an AYCE before, and it tasted quite savory if you ask me.   Don't come here for the appetizers even though the large amount may tempt you. Save your room for the meats as the appetizers are skip-worthy IMO.   When you come, be prepared to completely serve yourself. Nobody's cutting your meat into bite-sizes for you or starting you off with grilling the first order. You get a scissors and some tongs and you are off on your own. I thought that was the fun part if you ask me, because I absolutely hate it when the servers do it for me. I feel it detracts from the experience.    A solid AYCE BBQ place for an extremely competitive price. It's far from my area, but I really can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for AYCE. It's a great deal for the price, and the service has been pretty good. The quality of the meats is not bad, I've never ordered a dish I haven't liked. Their side dishes taste pretty good as well; although having come here just recently, it seemed like the portion of their side dishes has gotten smaller and smaller over time. Overall, the restaurant itself is very organized with adequate seating, but always with a wait for dinner due to its popularity. Love it here, would always come back when craving AYCE KBBQ."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to the Sahara branch .Food is awesome for the prize. Everybody are super attentive .Kudos to Jan assigned to our table he explained how to order right and did gave us excellent suggestions . We'll be back and bring more foodies..."}
{"text":"A couple of things about this place:   1. It always smells like clorox and oil. Kudos for being clean, but the smell is not so appetizing.  2. I've gotten sick, twice. I blame the side dishes on the table that are always sitting there before anyone is seated. I watched a table from beginning of my meal-end and saw the sides still sitting out. Is that potentially a health violation?!  3. The chairs are falling apart! If you're wearing shorts, as I do in this Vegas heat, forget being comfortable! The seats will scratch your thighs all meal long.  I want Gen to step up their game because they're in a good location with lots of people loving the food and atmosphere. Don't let yourself slip!"}
{"text":"Service is way better than the Henderson location. Kenny is a great server, but we were checked on by multiple people for drinks, sides, and more to order!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing time with my family. Alodia did an amazing job serving us! Konrad was super rad! He really helped me and was amazing, respectful young man! He really made me feel at home!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here Feb. 3.  The service was great, prompt, courteous, attentive.  Entre' selection to cook your food is extensive.  All you can eat so you will not go hungry.  Very fun, casual dinner spot."}
{"text":"Was such a great meal! So affordable and delicious! The service was great. Our server Seaver was very helpful and made sure we got everything we wanted!  definitely will return!"}
{"text":"There was Hair on my rice! I returned the rice, but it looks like they just scooped the hair out and give me the same rice. I think they're Dirty, and it was poor service too."}
{"text":"This was my first time at an all you can eat Korean restaurant and despite the 45 min to an hour wait on a Wednesday night, it did not disappoint. Ban Chan was delicious and plentiful. The servers were very attentive and constantly refilling or asking if we needed more. We went on a feeding frenzy--Galbi, bulgolgi, Hawaiian chicken, gyoza, jap chae, garlic calamari, Korean fried chicken---sometimes seconds on each item. As long as the grill is empty after 2 hours there's no up-charge and each person pays $27.99 each i believe. We were very satisfied with the food. It's a good option if you want to try several Korean dishes for a reasonable price. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! ! Amazing all you can eat food!!! Beer towers!! & great service!! Thank you Yuhao for everything!!"}
{"text":"The waiting time is ridiculous but worth the wait and definitely good food, and great service with an affordable price."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Attentive, fast, patient staff. Kailin was our server and she was absolutely amazing. Been here 3 times, would always recommend. The food is delicious, reasonable pricing, nice atmosphere. Good place for a date or a small gathering of friends."}
{"text":"The food was impeccable and the service was very outstanding. We had a great time and enjoyed everything due to the great meats and the awesome service provided by Ozzy."}
{"text":"Really liked the ambiance, the service was amazing! The food was very good. I just wish they had kpop playing on the background. That would be fun to listen to!"}
{"text":"Jaenica was our waitress and very helpful with a couple suggestions for us and was on point with drinks. Food was amazing as always, full flavor and all you can eat does not disappoint. Will be back again this was trip number 20 so far lol. Go with #1,5,10,17, japchae and spicy rice cakes."}
{"text":"Very nice kbbq spot. Quality meat. Very fast service. Totally worth the money. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is it... This is the KBBQ place Vegas needed!!!! I've tried them all! Tofu Hut, Korean Garden (my previous personal favorite), Hwaro, Honey Pig, you name it!!   The quality of all the food makes the 19.99 price an extremely great value! The brisket (which was not frozen!), bulgogi, steak and pork belly were all top notch! To top it all off the ban chan was terrific and appetizers were included!   Perhaps what really sets this place apart from all the other KBBQ places in town is the decoration (feels like an upscale club unlike the outdated, slippery floors that plaque the other top spots in town) AND the service was FANTASTIC! Our server, Howard was very attentive and we never wanted for refills. That really seals the deal in comparison to the often empty, shallow service you get from other places in town.  5/5 would come again!   Noticeable bonus: the way the exhaust fans are set up (in the grill as opposed to overhead) make it so you don't leave smelling like meat! That's enough reason to make me want to come back!"}
{"text":"Not many choices in town for All You Can Eat Korean bbq, so GEN takes the top spot in my book for this category. Prices are great and quality of meat was much better than expected which keeps me coming back. Servers are always attentive, quick with orders and changing out the grill frequently.   Getting seated seems like a fiasco and always seems to take several minutes of standing at the front  desk after we are told a table is ready  but the place is always busy ... not a big issue and understandable."}
{"text":"This is an amazing edition to the valley and the service and food are top notch. The staff are amazing and make each and every person that walks through the door feel like family. The decor is beautiful, and if you are a sports fanatic then they have you covered too with multiple tv's around the bar. The drinks are amazing..soju, mojitos, and more. If this location is too far then try the Henderson location which is just as good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their spicy pork bulgogi is my absolute favorite! Our server Mina was the best! The ambience and decor is very nice as well, definitely do recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here. Love the food and atmosphere. There is a big screen at the booth area, which makes it a great place to watch games. Even though the restaurant was full all the time, as you sit down, you won't feel it's loud or chaos. The service was quick and friendly. Our server Yuhao and Bo always check with us. Even though there were lots of AYCE policies given at the beginning, I didn't see anyone really check if we follow the policies. That makes me feel really comfortable."}
{"text":"Highly recommend ! Great food and great service. Most important, the restaurant is kid friendly!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, had an amazing experience from start to finish. Decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful. It's a very nice place to relax with friends or to bring family for a nice dinner. Service was great with the staff being very open and friendly. All you can eat menu has many tasty options and the price had us surprised at the end saying \"it's not that bad\" Experience was definitely made extremely memorable thanks to our server Jaenica. She was extremely polite and outgoing and made sure we were very well taken care of.  Looking forward to my next visit to Gen and I will be sure to ask for Jaenica to help make the experience just as amazing as this time"}
{"text":"My hubby and I wanted to try Korean BBQ for the first time and found this place pretty close. We came in with an open mind and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, ugh...everything just fell flat and I came out of there with my hair and clothes smelling like I food. The prices for lunch on the weekend were $24/ per person. It was a bit on the pricey side.  A few things we ordered: Hawaiian Pork Belly - Too Fatty with no flavor. Cheesy Pork - Yuk and stale Korean Fried Chicken - Too much sauce Gyoza - okay but it came out cold  After paying the $50 plus lunch bill we decided this type of food was just not for us. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I went here on a thursday night with my little brother and bf around 9 pm. As I walked in, the front desk girl said it would be a 2 hour wait. I figured this place has to be super yummy to be packed like that and they're new. There aren't a lot of AYCE KBBQ here in AZ. They are mostly in California. They opened the right spot which was Tempe Marketplace. That's where there's a lot of people.  Anyways, we ended up waiting an hour and twenty minutes. We ordered steak, thin sliced beef, shrimp, etc. Man oh man it was so good! We all ate so much that by the end of the night we all had to unbutton are zipper pants because that's how full we were.  Only bad thing about this place is, that the servers kept getting our orders confused with the other table.. Hey, I get it you guys are still new and you just opened so I'll give it a free pass this time. Also the service was a little slow. Oh and please have better filtration for the water you guys served. It taste so nasty like I felt like I was drinking toilet water. Not that I ever tasted that but yeah it was just really gross. Other than that, food was awesome! Will be back hope it's better with the service and water next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome food was amazing ! Music is amazing the atmosphere is fun and happy. Our waiter Lex was awesome explained everything super well and made sure us first timers knew what we were doing.  We had a lot of fun cooking our food as well! it was an amazing experience. Will definitely recommend and come back again!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was awesome.   Food was just mediocre.  Service was mediocre as well.  Went up to the bar to grab some drinks. The bartender was rude.  We went during dinner on a sunday.  Super busy.  Next time we're in town we'll most likely not eat at this kbbq spot."}
{"text":"Very much impressed with the whole restaurant. Always a fan of the one in Henderson but I like this location a lot more. For one, it's way closer to home. The restaurant space is more spacious with way more seating. Went in on Sunday afternoon and we were seated right away. We had great service. Not once did we ever go, where is our server nor did we have to ask twice for anything to eat/drink. We ordered beef belly, brisket, beef tongue (for my bf), & kfc. I LOVE that their meats are perfectly sliced. Portion wise, they serve more each plate so I would start off ordering at least 3 plates at a time to avoid wasting. We definitely do appreciate clean chairs, tablets, and restaurants (even though it's new). Props to management for also helping the wait staff and for the wait staff doing a good job of tending to your tables. It really satisfied my Gen craving until next time!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean BBQ in a very modern and upscale setting. The prices are very reasonable ($21 for AYCE dinner). There is a two hour limit so eat fast. My the kids and I brought my wife here for her birthday and everyone had so much fun (kids were too busy to fight). Our server Mike was amazing. We will be back. thanks"}

{"text":"I used to love this place. My friends and I would come all the time and it would be awesome every time. All the really good waiters got promoted and their replacements are appalling. We had the \"pleasure\" of having Julian as our waiter last night. Completely unapproachable and inattentive. We would wait patiently for refills, reordering, etc but would end up flagging someone else down because we were ignored by Julian after our first order. We would see him roaming the restaurant, chatting it up with other waiters. We eventually saw him not even in uniform anymore cleaning the restaurant, everyone was. My friends and I also work in the service industry, so we completely understand cleaning when you can so you can close. But the restaurant wasn't closing for another 50 minutes! The hostess asked if she could take our payments so she could close the register (almost an hour before close...ok?). Whatever, no big deal. But no surprise, after she took our money, we received ZERO service. We weren't even done eating! I had to go up to the hostess to ask for a simple refill of our water because we still had food left to eat and no waiters to be seen. (And no, the restaurant still wasn't closing for another thirty minutes) I will never recommend another person there."}
{"text":"We dined at Gen on Saturday November 4, 2017, with my 9 year old daughter, Adult Son, and husband. Everything was great, until we were told by the Hostess that the charge for my 9 year old is 24.99 due to her height, the same rate of an adult plate. I felt that was ridiculous! Their policy is not fair, when a 9 year old's quantity of food intake is minimal. I would not recommend anyone to take their children to this restaurant. Huge mistake!"}
{"text":"Awesome price.. Awesome staff.. Wish there was another location centrally in Las Vegas, but I don't mind taking the drive..   Gets busy during the hours of lunch and dinner..   Music goes from extremely loud to extremely soft.."}
{"text":"Called in the morning to see if we can make a reservation. They dont take reservations. The girl on the phone told us to go at 5:30 and there'd be no wait. Arrived at 5:30... for a 2 and half hr wait. Okay.. waited. 8pm.. went in for an update.. 35 minutes. Went in at 9 for an update now it's 1 hour and 30 minute wait. It's 10pm now. Still no text yet. I don't doubt the place is good. But this is just silly. Either they messed up or... I don't even know anymore. I'm just hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent service Blake took good care of us. Grill change every 15 minutes or so food came out quickly and orders were put in quickly."}
{"text":"We've been here at least 5 times since it opened. The service is typically pretty good, however on our most recent visit we had to request grill changes, ask for refills and wave him down to order. At no point did he ask if we had been there before, if it had been our first time we would have been confused. I'm giving 4 stars since this is the first time it's been that bad and hopefully the service will be better next time."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up here less then a year. I keep hearing about this place when I was in California. So I gave this place a shot, I fell in love with this place. Very clean and so many selection of meats. I love how their grills smoke observes in the bottom so you won't smell like bbq after eating. The servers explained every detail in how Korean bbq works. The only downfall is that it's super far from where I live. I always go here with my friends. A must try is the Crispy Squid legs !!! Definetly will be a returning customer here."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the most hip Korean bbq spot out here in las Vegas. Their awesome playlist of songs they play, makes you eat super fast. I usually drive 40 minutes to go to Henderson location, now i only drive 10 minutes to eat here at Gen bbq in Sahara. I say this place is a bit smaller in a older building.   Its very busy at this time when we came in. We were greeted and welcomed by the staff. They had us seated in about 5 minutes. The menu is the same just like the Henderson location. I always order the Brisket and the skirt steak. I also recommended getting the beef belly, its a different type of meat than most places.   Thankfully they only give little portion just incase you dont finish it all. The quality of the meat is 8/10. The service is 9/10, they always check up on you. This place is gold for any special occasions with friends and family. They still working on their alcohol license, all in all i will come back to this awesome kbbq spot."}
{"text":"Ok so vegas has a bunch of Korean ayce places, from chinatown to Henderson. However, you probably have never been to an ayce like this. First of all, the selections, there are 32 protein choices. I know because it's all over the menu. The choices are awesome, from bulgogi to marinated octopus. There's a surf and turf combination for U. And then the service, simply amazing. They really do work together to make your dining experience better. Everyone stops by to check on how you're doing. In particular, Tommy stands out, from carefully repeating our selections to kindly explaining the size of a beer tower, roughly 6 pints by the way. Awesome place!!!"}
{"text":"If you've never had Korean BBQ. Fine, this place will do.   If you are coming from the LA korean food scene, this is NOT the place.   1) they don't have Galbi (korean short ribs). That suuuucks 2) service is meh 3) food is meh"}
{"text":"As a service member who served in South Korea, I got to experience authentic Korean BBQ and I can honestly say this restaurant exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to try this delicious food and Korean culture."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for date night, we like to try out different things and neither of us had ever been!  It was an hour wait and we went back to the bar. I ordered a vodka and cran,tall and my husband a beer. The counter needed to be cleaned off and the bartender didn't know what he was doing. My vodka cran tasted liked cranberry juice with no vodka. I mentioned this twice and he didn't do anything. The other bartender was more helpful. They also ran out of ice that night because the ice machine was broken. All drinks weren't very cold.  Once seated, our server was to busy to explain the process of this and we had to guess at what to do and how long to cook things. They have a beautiful set up of things but if you haven't ever been and no one explains it, it's pointless.  I didn't find the food to be anything wonderful and because our server was to busy we didn't know what to order or what to expect.  We will not return and I hope that they realize that this type of environment calls for explaining and taking time with your guests, not pushing them through to get to the next table and tip."}
{"text":"The wait was over an hour long but it was on a Friday so I can't complain. It was so worth it because the food came fast and it was all delicious. Try the red wine pork belly! Our servers (Ozzy and Alodia) were great. They constantly checked on us and kept us updated on our orders since it was so busy. They ran out of rice but Alodia made sure we got some since we were waiting for a long time. & Shoutout to Adrian because he was the best crew member. He changed our grill and cleared out the table so fast. Tetris skills haha. Thank you! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The better Gen. Our server was named rufio. Pretty good food, man. No long lines. Service quick. And friendly. Go for it."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Yuhao and Amazing food overall. I would definitely recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Have tried many Korean bbq joints in Vegas. This one is good but the whole family agreed it doesn't better our favorites. They all do a decent job so it depends on your point of view, but what we didn't like about Gen was the following:  1. Banchan dishes are small and we had to order some of them repeatedly and oftentimes the waiters would just forget to bring them.  2. Their bulgogi marinade is unlike any I've tried. Seems to lack the traditional sweetness, soy and other requisite ingredients. Not sure how you can mess up this quintessential Korean dish.  3. Very loud music, too much party atmosphere. It's not the strip.  4. Full price for any kid over 7 years old, based on height. Not even my 9 year old was even close to eating $22 worth of bbq.  Thumbs up for the nice green tea salt, a nice surprise that you can't find too easily elsewhere. Banchan recipes were tasty and fresh. Garlic calamari was a hit. So was the head-on shrimp."}
{"text":"Gen is one of our families favorite spots. From the side dishes to the assorted meats and appetizers it never disappoints since we cook it how we like it. The staff is incredibly friendly specially our favorite server Alodia! She is an incredible server! She's  always been personable and knowledgeable of everything on the menu, plus a side of quirk that makes our dinner time more enjoyable and entertaining."}
{"text":"Our server, Luis, gave us great service! I would come back! Very kind, helpful, and easy to communicate with. His service made the experience that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Discovered this location shortly after I moved here. All you can eat Korean BBQ. Friendly staff every time I come here. Their may be a wait at times, but overall not too bad. The place is very clean at all times and has a modern style environment unlike other Korean bbq places. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Good Korean bbq house if you are looking for a night out.   A little pricy but that's what you pay for the nice location.   Yogurt soda and the pork belly is a must.   A little salty so try to get the plain meats.   Friendly staff and easy way to keep your place in line!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance because... I'm a very forgiving person. Mainly, hungry, but I'm forgiving too. I dragged along my brother and cousin (everyone needs a sidekick) while my five-year-old was in school. They've always wanted to try it, and so I saw that this was my opportunity to see if my first impression on this place still stands.  Remember last time I told you all that their brisket was very chewy and ew? Not this time! It was definitely melt-in-your-mouth goodness this time around! I fell in love with it so bad that I we ordered SIX of these babies. You heard (err... READ) me right! I said SIX! My brother wanted to try the bulgogi, so he ordered beef and pork bulgogi. Yo.. The pork bulgogi WINS everything! It was so damn delicious. I don't know what it was, but this is definitely the best bulgogi that I've ever had. The beef was pretty good too, but I'd order the pork over the beef all day, err' day!   Service was the same as last time. We had an attentive server. I don't know her name because either A). I forgot her name or B). she never gave it to us. She was cool, though. Let me tell you what WON my little visit there. It's the fact that they were playing old school hits. No, not Stevie Wonder or BeeGees. But I'm talking about old R&B songs from the early 2000s (i.e. Dilemma by Nelly ft. Kelly Rowland). My brother straight up told me, \"It's like they stole your (first generation) iPod and plugged it in.\" I was really feelin' myself when we were eating there. I wanted to stay just for the music.  I don't know if they changed their little SH*T \"EVERYONE AT THE TABLE MUST PAY FOR AYCE EVEN IF IT'S JUST TWO PEOPLE EATING IT\" RULE because my entire little posse and I all ordered AYCE lunch. That's why I didn't give them 5 STARS.   Definitely will be back here even though it takes 30 damn minutes just to get here -- I live in Northwest Vegas, y'all."}
{"text":"* Let me first say something, I've tried other kbbq restaurants, but this is, by-far, my favorite lbbq of them all. They give so many sides that the table is basically full and I LOVE the sides. This is probably my 3rd time eating there and it ceases to disappointment.   * Once you walk into Gen, you get a feel of the aesthetic look of the restaurant. It looks like it would be one of those super expensive restaurants you'd find at the strip, but let me tell you something, the price is great! For all-you-can-eat, it's $16 for lunch and $20.99 for dinner. It sets a great romantic mood because of the darkness and pastel lights. It's usually busy there but it's really nothing to be worried about. The wait to be seated was very short; sometimes there's no wait at all. Although, on the days it's really busy, it's kind of hard to get the waiters attention so you could order more.   * For the sides, they give clear noodles, kimchi, spicy pickled cucumbers, rice cakes, peas, salad, and others (I'm not sure what they are tbh). They all taste amazing and I could basically just eat them and get full. But anyways. We (2 of us) lasted for about 4 rounds of orders. Our favorite orders would probably be the Gen Chadol (beef brisket), Gen Beef Bulgolgi (marinated beef), and Chicken Bulgolgi (marinated chicken). Of course we've tried a bunch others and they're just as amazing. They're all flavorful and not bland like other meats in some kbbq's.   * Would I go there again? YES!!! I have and will continue to do so. So far, it still marks as the best kbbq for me.   * Rate 10/10 * $"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a while on the recommendation of a friend of mine. Make sure to get there early - they do not take reservations. (And an FYI - they only do \"lunch\" pricing on the weekdays. Dinner pricing applies all day in the weekends).  For $15.99 (for lunch) on the weekdays or $19.99 for dinner, you get an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord of appetizers (they never have the fries - ever) and specialty meats and sides. You had better know how to use a grill, or else you may have a difficult time cooking your food here - you cook it - the staff does not.  The staff are polite and happy to explain how the place works. However - if you have leftover food, you will face additional charges to your bill for wasting it. I've never had that issue, but the warning is there. You also have only two hours - or else you will get charged for another dinner if you decide to sit around! The staff are quite busy here, and it seems to be quite disorganized. We waited for almost 20 minutes for refills on water. If your grill gets dirty (read: charred) they will happily change it for you though.  I suggest the brisket and the roast beef. The marinated meats (especially the chicken) are difficult to cook right and burn easily because of the sugars involved. The pickled radishes and mashed potatoes are good, too.  I would suggest this place for the price, and give it 4 stars, but -1 star for the madness of disorganization. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"So glad there's one near me! Although still  new, staff was on top of their service. Price is decent! Sake is a must try."}
{"text":"The hype was so real when Gen first opened, and with good reason. The selection of korean bbq restaurants in Las Vegas is mediocre at best. Hailing from sunny California, Gen decided to grace Sin City with its presence. I have dined there a few times and found it to be better than any other AYCE KBBQ spot in Las Vegas.  LOCATION/AMBIENCE Its main drawback is location, which is pretty much ACROSS TOWN from most people. However, I am willing to bet all the Henderson and east side folks are happy they no longer have to travel to Chinatown.   The restaurant is HUGE and very modern. There is ample seating and weird glowy lights and random shows playing on the screen. Looks more like a lounge than a restaurant. Since the place is so large, we never have to wait very long to be seated (or am I just lucky?)  Since it's located at Galleria Mall, parking is easy and plentiful.  FOOD The selection of meats is fairly standard so I won't go over every little thing. However, marinated thick cuts of pork belly, pork jowl, and large sections of tripe, which I all love, are quite rare in Las Vegas. For that I am thankful. The standouts are definitely the pork jowl, miso pork belly, and smoked garlic pork belly for me. I just love pork belly.   Beef tongue is also good but beef brisket is sliced waaay too thin, causing it to just fall apart upon cooking.   The appetizer and banchan selection is average. My favorites are the potato salad, salad, and thin radish for wrapping.  SERVICE The other drawback of Gen is its service, which is extremely inconsistent. Some employees are obviously inexperienced or just not motivated to work quickly and efficiently. In addition, there seems to be no organization, as you will be asked the same question multiple times by different people but end up waiting 20 minutes for a plate of meat and somehow receive 2 items you did not even order.  VALUE At 14.99 for weekday lunch and 19.99 for weekday dinner and all day weekend, Gen is very much worth the price. Just make sure you have ample time allotted to compensate for cooking, driving, and slow service. Overall meat quality is average but you get what you pay for!  Tips: - Request for oil on the grill to prevent sticking (why don't they do this already?) - You can request sesame oil and salt for dipping.  Yelp 100 Challenge - 2016 [5/100]"}
{"text":"I've been here both for the free opening and I've paid for dinner. This place is not as good as their CA locations, but is much better and WAY cleaner than any other AYCE kbbq in Vegas.   The biggest problem is the service. The wait staff seems to be all over the place. Nobody seems to have tables - every person services every table - which means nobody takes responsibility for each table. Asking about missing orders is futile.  Karage is hit and miss. It's been raw, rock hard and good - very inconsistent. In general, the portions are small, which is good, so that you can try lots of items without having leftovers.  This location has the potential to be great because the food is good. They just have to give their staff some serious direction."}
{"text":"Kailin was very attentive and gave us superb service! Food was awesome and our experience was worth the 5 stars. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"How about a review written by a customer, and not a staff member? Don't believe me, check out Brian K's profile. Yelping since 2012, and two reviews? Also, his profile links to his Facebook, which shows he works at Gen Korean BBQ House.  Enough about their gaming the system, to artificially inflate the ratings for this new Korean BBQ joint in Henderson. My wife and I were unsure where to go, as she is half Korean, we eat at a LOT of Korean BBQ places, in Vegas, and on the road. Galleria's newest food additions all look amazing from the outside, and this place was busy for a Monday night! The check-in process was great, you give a #, they text you your progress in queue.   We were seated, and had the standard corporate greeting, \"Is this your first time eating here with us? Oh, great, let me explain...\" of course it is, you have only been open a couple days. Our server had minimal knowledge of the food, but brought out our drinks rather quickly. And then, a second person came to bring our drinks out. Overly efficient, or inept duplication?  Our food was ordered, after being told there is a two hour time limit for the AYCE foods. The menu looked like there was a wide selection of options. Our first round of meats came out, and only two of them were right.  So, they brought out 2x the drinks, and 50% wrong food to start. My wife ordered edamame, and was brought out a salad.   When they delivered the meats, they gave my wife her boneless Kalbi rib type option, and put down some thinly sliced meat, and said it was spicy pork. They dropped off chicken and what they said was bulgogi to me.  Spicy pork is coated in a red paste, but she gave it a try, just in case. It was beef bulgogi. When correcting it, they took the beef bulgogi, and brought out spicy pork. What they told me was bulgogi was pork. It took a while to get the right food brought out, after having our server tell me that beef turns white, depending on the marinade used. Ummmm. No. Pork turns white, beef turns brown, please try again. That got straightened out, thanks to a California trainer.    As to the flavor... the chicken bulgogi tasted like burnt soy sauce, and the beef bulgogi was just flavorless mush.  After that... We only saw our server as he spent 20+ minutes chatting with a guy two tables over. Other tables around us were heard asking random employees, \"Who is our server?!\" We waited, and waited to pay. Finally, we just got up and went to the hostess. They aren't supposed to get our check for us, but did. Upon giving them a quick rundown of how our visit went, they got the GM. He is a very nice guy, who took our feedback, as a manager should, and said he would address the issue with his staff."}
{"text":"This had to be the best Korean BBQ place ive ever ate at. I have tried the location in Ontario California but this location was by far much better. the service was excellent. our waiter was there every time we ran out of anything. it was a party of four very hungry people so he came to our table like 7 or 8 times. we never had to call for him once. the meat at this location was so tender and moist. from the chicken to beef to even the calamari and octopus which is chewy by nature. Their meat was A1. Even the location was hard to find  on Google maps. The service and quality of food surpassed all my expectations. next time we visit Vegas we will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I'd heard so many good things about Gen, I knew I had to visit. I recently had dinner there and was definitely impressed!  First of all, it's located at Galleria Mall, but you don't have to actually enter the mall to get to the restaurant, which is a plus (IMO). There is also tons of parking, which is another bonus.  The decor is super cute. It's dimly lit, but not overly romantic (unless you want it to be). It's not a small place either.  For $19.95 per person, it's hard to complain. It's AYCE and the food was all delicious. We seriously had a bit of everything. Be careful when ordering though, they will charge you extra for wasted food. I can imagine that would be pretty awkward.  My only complaint is that the service was slooooow. It took forever to get more water and even longer to get our check and pay. But it was nothing that would stop me from going back and I definitely look forward to eating at Gen again."}
{"text":"I initially tried Gen Korean BBQ in California when visiting some friends over break. The food was delicious. When I found out that Vegas got a Gen, I was literally screaming with joy. Let me tell you, Gen is now my go-to Korean BBQ place considering that I used to be a die hard Tofu Hut fan.   The service here is always amazing. When you get there and ask for a table, they'll kindly ask for your first name and last initial & phone number. The reason being for the phone number is because they text you when your table is ready. So you could walk around the mall if you wanted to, then return when your table is ready. What I found cool about their reservation service is that along with texting you when your table is ready, they also have an app called \"NoWait.\" NoWait is an app where you can see the current wait time for the restaurant you're at. It shows you how many parties are in front of you. In this app, you can also add people in your party to show them your place in line. They also have a bar where you can chill while waiting for your table.  After being seated, they are really quick with drinks and orders. Considering my friends and I are regulars here, we already know what to order. Once we get seated, we start ordering by the boat loads. We always start by getting 3 orders of Japchae, #10, brisket and pork belly. Literally 2-5 mins later, the server is back with the orders. They check up on you every 10 mins or so, so that you can re-order. We always get the sesame chicken and the KFC. So good! Considering that we're asian, we need rice....and lots of it. This is sometimes a problem because they say \"sorry we're out of rice right now.\" However, that doesn't stop us from chowing down on just meat.   I like how the place is designed. It's very modern looking compared to the KBBQ places in china town. Every time I come here, we're always seated right away and the service is always fantastic. I have nothing negative to say about this place but....MAKE MORE RICE PLEASE. I AM ASIAN AND I NEED MY RICE. That is all. oh wait one last thing:  K B B...really Q waiters/waitresses. Just sayin' ayyyyye!"}
{"text":"Okay I ate here yesterday for lunch and have not stopped thinking about how amazing it was. Seriously soooo gooooood and great service and such a great price for lunch!! I will recommend this place to everyone I know everything we ordered was DELICIOUS I honestly want to go again today lol"}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas.  Their smoked garlic pork belly tastes awesome!  Their meats are fresh and their service is great.  The atmosphere is very hip and cozy as well especially the booth seating.  Really highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's nice inside clean. We disliked our meal we couldn't identify anything we would try again. Meat was cheap and fatty nothing to flavor it. Even our chicken was full of connective tissue. We were given a dull pair of scissors to cut our meat. I just didn't find much positive to say about our meal. Sharon the waitress was very nice and attentive"}
{"text":"First time here and came in Sunday for lunch. Just a warning in case you're expecting lunch prices, they charge dinner prices all day Sunday, but you still get the advantage of ordering dishes that would've only been available during dinner. We tried probably about 8 or so different meats and order the japchae 3x's! Really yummy and definitely get your money's worth. They come around pretty frequently and also ask if you want the burner plate changed. Good service.   One star less bc seating arrangements didn't seem personal. There was just two of us and we were sat at a table with two other people that were only two feet away from us. It was pretty much just one table with two burners on each end. There was a wait to be seated so we just settled for it."}
{"text":"Service and food on point.  Plates and grill was changed often by numerous servers.  Great team"}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband and I came on Friday night and there was a 1 to 1-1/2 hour wait. We've heard good things, so decided to come back tonight. There was only a 10 minute wait, which was much better for my belly. We were seated, and the hostess explained how it works.   The server, Ozzy, came over to take care of us. He was phenomenal btw. You can choose appetizers which are included, and various meats to cook at the table. There are cold sides on the table right away. We started with Korean Fried Chicken, JapCha noodles, and fried tofu. For dinner, collectively, we had brisket, marinated steak, cajun shrimp, and calamari. The best was the marinated steak.   The service is what impressed me the most. I cannot say enough about how attentive the whole staff was. We never had to wait long for anything. Full drinks, full bellies, fabulous service. The restaurant doesn't feel like a cheap buffet because the ambiance and feel is hip and trendy. It was $49 with tax for two with sodas. I love the blue lights everywhere. I'll for sure come back and recommend this place for people who want something new."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most valuable buffets in/near Vegas. $21 AYCE dinner. However, the meat quality is not as good as the Bay Area locations. It's about an 25minute Uber ride from the strip, but worth it if you want good and inexpensive food"}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE Korean BBQ that I've been to. The service is so fast and you are never waiting without food. The portions are large which is great, but if you'd like only a half order they will do that too! That way you aren't wasting food. You can request a salad and rice to accompany the meal. My favorite on the menu is the Hawaiian Pork Belly and the Spicy Pork Bulgogi! To die for! Also, you can go for lunch during the week for only $15.99. Such a good deal! My only other tip is to get there early because they get full fast and it's a long wait!"}
{"text":"Always receive great service and food when I come here! Besides the salad, I think they have the best kbbq appetizers. Our server Julian was great and very cute lol"}
{"text":"i have eaten here so many times now and they did an amazing and great service and this time, Sunday night, i dont know why the service has changed and the food portions of the appetizers just got small. ok so with my previous visits here the service was super fast, food came out quick but now it was just so slow and to the point that i had to stand up and go grab the sesame oil i asked for like 15minutes ago. Our server was great though but i guess theyre understaff? im not so sure coz i just cant explain why their food was coming out so slow. anyways, i was just being patient and waited for our food to come and not complain. so we already ate and everyone was satisfied already. But another incident happened, so at the table located at our side, some crew members were cleaning and all of the sudden a splash of red sauce went through our table and went through our arms and hands. So i immediately turned to my left side and looked at one of the crew member waiting for him to apologize but no he just looked at me and continued on cleaning. I just think that it was just rude of him and they should be more careful cleaning too. i gave three stars for now because of the service and rudeness of one of the crew members. but im just hopeful that the next time we dine here they could hopefully have improvements."}
{"text":"Maybe it was Gen packed ( generally new restaurants are first when they open) just didnt enjoy it. Just my preference."}
{"text":"Finally! Gen is in Southern NV. This is the same one in California. If u like Sura Korean BBQ on Spring Mtn, then u r going to love Gen 3x more. All u can eat high quality food for only $15 lunch and $20 dinner.  Can't beat that anywhere! Kailin our server was amazing too!   5 stars for food, service, price and ambiance!"}
{"text":"The price was great. Quality of food is spot on for the price. The food tastes as good as what you pay for it. The service.... Awkward. I liked that we had little sides waiting at the table for us. We arrived party of two and had to wait ten minutes for our table, even though was a lot of empty tables, but there must be a shift change or something or section rules, I don't know. Lots of employees though.    The dining was nice. Except when you ask for extra settings for my friends arriving. It's all good, we just got up and walked to a neatly set table and grabbed the extra settings so they can eat. The dining was good. The food was equal to the price.   Except when it comes to splitting checks. They can only split the check three times. We spent more time waiting for the check than eating. We got up and just paid up in front no problem. The lady who takes the money usually walks to each table with an armful of electronics. She looked like she was going into an intergalactic battle.   Food was great, service was awkward with how to pay."}
{"text":"My first review since I've been MIA and I have to say this isn't my favorite Korean BBQ AYCE. I've been to better ones near Chinatown where it's a tad bit pricier; however, quality was much better than GEN. GEN's looks may be nice but isn't really matched up for the type of restaurant they are hosting.  1) GEN's interior design is sadly better than the food. The food is dry, not well marinated, oily in some cases, small portioned, and monotoned.  2) There's no sprinklers in the ceilings so what happens if a Wanna-be-chef (like me) can't cook right and accidentally 'overcooks' their food and a catastrophe happened. Yes, I saw a fire extinguisher but it's far from being reached and being reasonably safe.  3) The overhead hood that collects the smoke wasn't present and should be on top of the grill. While I was eating, I was inhaling smoke like crazy and got sicker and sicker the more I stayed. I know some veteran restaurants have vents above grills to collect the smoke and suck it up instead of spreading around the restaurant.  4) Service was okay. Their communication was on point. Once me and my partner ordered more we got it in less than a minute because they use smart tablets to send it up to the kitchen. Now that's clever way of being precise and fast for the customers.  5) So many grill changes and it was driving me crazy. Of course I'm cooking more food yet they have the audacity to ask me if I want a grill change. The other restaurant automatically does it for us because why would we cook our food on a burnt grill? Common sense. Yes it's nice to ask but do it in a way where you have to change it rather than wanting a customer to keep a burnt grill where the burner is still running.   I would personally not be back here. They don't accept discover cards (sorry folks). They don't give you forks (unless they have some in stock- sorry for those who can't use chopsticks for their life (like me)). And the prices for drinks is higher than most restaurants and they do not have HOT WATER for hot tea. They only have soda and iced water. I can see potential in this restaurant but that's in the future. They're still in their opening phase and I can't blame them. But for the meantime, I'll keep this restaurant on my low priorty list."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. I love KBBQ being a former Los Angeles native with my fair share of experiences at different AYCE KBBQ but this place has a way of making it unpleasant and undesirable. The service is slow and we came in here with a person in our party not feeling up to eating with us. He still agreed to join us for dinner because he wanted to spend time with us. Apparently they are strict on their \"head count policy\" and that is the biggest reason for the one star rating. Working in the food service industry, I can't possibly think of a reason why this hard to accommodate on a case by case basis. You really need to re-evaluate your customer service tactics. Being that both the manager and the assistant manager had a hard time understanding that one person wasn't eating thus there should be no expection/reason for a charge. Also kids are charged by height. So our 8 year old daughter was charged at $25 which is the standard adult price. That policy deserves a civil discrimination suit. Since when can you look at someone and just charge them what you feel is right based on their physical appearance?! Just because it's \"policy\" doesn't make it right nor legal."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 11-8-15 with my friend Jamie P.  I don't know what I can add that the 500+ people before me have not said, other than they seem to have worked out the service issues that they had in the beginning.   I've only been to Korean bbq one other time at Shilla BBQ here in Vegas, and it closed down.  It was really gross and dirty so with that being my only experience to compare it to, this place was very good to me.   I got the AYCE menu and a coke and my total was $28.47 with tax and tip.  I didn't realize that dinner prices apply all day on Saturday and Sunday.   ___________\\\\Things I liked:////  -The waitress did not get judge-y when we ordered a ton of stuff.  -The meat was super fresh.  -The salad was really tasty.  -Their rice was really good and sticky.  -Server was very attentive and brought refills and asked if we wanted more meat.  -Food came out really quickly. -Huge variety of meats.   -The decor is beautiful.   -The baby octopus are HUGE.  I was expecting the tiny ones like some chinese buffets have but these were like the size of my hand.   -Spicy rice cakes are wonderful.  I like them grilled.  ___________\\\\Things I didn't like://// -There was a huge spiderweb in the corner.  Didn't this place just open?  -The potato salad was gross.  Imagine cold mashed potatoes with pickles in it. Blech.   -We had to ask for rice.   -Banchan was sitting on all the tables prior to seating people.  I found that pretty gross.  What if flies landed on it, or worse, some kid comes by and sneezes on it??  Ewww.   -I asked for rice paper and was brought some chewed up sheets that wouldn't even stay together.  I think they were old or something.  -No macaron ice cream sandwiches like the other GEN locations.  BOO!!! -They were out of french fries and mac & cheese.  (like the only 2 things for kids)"}
{"text":"I give this place a 4/5 just because I think coming here before 6pm is a better experience than coming in after 6pm. Service is way better at an earlier time and the servers really keep up with you constantly.  I'm also a variety kind of guy, so I like all the options of meats, and their appetizers are definitely top notch. What does lack short though is the taste of the meats, some of the meats lack flavor, if they even have any.  As far as the atmosphere of the restaurant, I think it is very modernized in comparison to other Korean BBQs in town. The vibe is nice, background music is great, there's sports playing on a giant projector. Very fun to come in and just have a good time with friends. Overall I come here about every two weeks or so just because it's so close to me and I'm in the mood for some Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming a regular at Gen! AYCE Korean bbq and appetizers, fantastic drinks (peach yogurt soju... Don't knock it until you try it!!), reverse happy hour, great atmosphere and amazing service are only a few of the reasons that keep me coming back!! If you are lucky, you will also have OZZY as your navigator to food paradise! He makes the dining experience that much more memorable with his recommendations, positive attitude and attentiveness to make sure you have mountains of food at all times."}
{"text":"service we got from jessica the while night and ozzy take over from 10pm till we leave was amazing! we will be back for sure to this place we family and friend"}
{"text":"Had a nice date night dinner. Best AYCE Korean bbq, Julian was our server and very attentive, excellent customer service. never had to wait too long for our next order. Dinner was 20.99 and definetly worth the money. will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Kalin was dope! Very attentive and checked on us frequently. Always a great time here but this was probably the best so far."}
{"text":"I don't usually do the all you can eat. My mom and I had our own spot that we went to for years. This just opened up down the street from me! My bf has never had Korean BBQ so I figured this place would be great. We had dinner fri night and waited about 45 mins to an hour. This place was busy! They had a mall event going on so there was a line inside for small samples for those people participating. We ordered 2 orders of beef bulgogi, brisket, garlic squid, Cajun shrimp, popcorn shrimp, kimchi, spicy cucumbers, seaweed salad, veggies, fried squid and of course a Chardonnay. Warning! Orders of meat are decent sized orders. We ate almost everything because my bf took it upon himself to clean every plate. Bulgogi was my favorite, if you don't cook the brisket right it loses flavor.. There's a grill on the table and YOU cook your food.. So bring your cooking skills. I love this about Korean BBQ, the whole concept and experience... And the food is fresh and hot. Btw all you can eat dinner is $20... I was full and satisfied and well worth it. Only downfall newer businesses tend to be very busy and this place has a great ambiance but because of the busy madness we were unable to enjoy everything it has to offer. Round 2 soon for another try.."}
{"text":"Bulgogi. Bulgogi all the way. Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) is a close second. Or maybe the Hawaiian steak?   Gen BBQ is a great place to introduce your friends to Korean barbecue, because there are a lot of familiar items on the menu, such as Hawaiian steak and Cajun chicken, and even an option for simply veggies! But be sure to introduce your friends (and yourself) to the wonders that is bulgogi, which is marinated slices of beef. The sauce is the best.    I came here on Monday for lunch. When we went, it was $16 for lunch, which includes around 20 different items, which is an extremely good deal for All You Can Eat. There is a two hour limit, but that is //plenty// of time to get everything you want.   The servers are extremely friendly, the one that served us had a lot of energy and did jumping jacks in front of us! (It was adorable) You can only get four plates at a time, but the servers come around at just the right time when you're ready to order again.   Overall, a great place, but I was slightly disappointed in the lack of Korean delicacies, such as galbi and bibimbap.I heard they do a rotation of dishes, so maybe I just have to come again!"}
{"text":"Food was great, prices are great, atmosphere is excellent, decor , the ONLY thing missing is rice paper and it would be absolutely PERFECT."}
{"text":"Finally!! We stared are this place while they were under construction. Lol! We LOVE GEN BBQ! Back home in the Bay Area, we'd eat GEN like every week. You can't go wrong with Korean BBQ. It's so great to have one closer to us. For all the KBBQ lovers out there, this is a must try! When we first walked in, we were surprised to see how spacious it is and a lot of seating. We were thinking it's going to be crazy pack with a long wait like it is back in the Bay. We were happily greeted by everyone that works there. Let me tell you something, BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! They are so on it! I love it!! Once we got seated, our server, Justin, was literally there to take our orders and the food came out to cook less then 2 minutes later. They would come and check on us so often that we always had a full glass of water and more food coming in. They would seriously take the empty plates as soon as we put it down. Talk about GREAT SERVICE! I mean I can go on forever about how great they all were but I'm here to tell you about the food too! The must order is the Jap Chae, Brisket, Pork Belly, Premium Steak, Spicy Calamari, Shrimp and Spicy Bulgogi. The lunch all you can eat is $16.99! I know dinner is around $20-$26 a person but I haven't had the dinner at that location yet. I'll update this once I do! No beer or alcohol served yet but they will soon. My advice is, use the tongs to put all your meat in there slowly versus throw in everything on the grill.. especially if it has liquid on there! Some people were new and saw flames go up pretty high on their station lol. Let's please keep this location for a long time.. they just opened the end of December haha! This location doesn't have rice paper which was sad on my part because I love wrapping my meats with it but they do have daikon. The sides that they give you are great selections like fish cake, kimchee in different ways, potato and a few more that I just forget but ate. I wish I took more pictures but I was hungry. Lol next time! Enjoy my fellow foodies!!"}
{"text":"Gen has a really cool ambience. The environment just seems so chill and laid back- love it!! They have a variety of options which is great for people who love to try different food. However, I really only eat brisket whenever i go out and eat KBBQ. I think they changed a few of the items on their menu and increased their price a dollar more..  My boyfriend and I eat a lot of KBBQ and we've been to a lot of different places. We like the food here but the grills kind of get annoying because they're sticky and the meat tends to stick to the grill a lot which makes it harder to cook. The servers here are great though!! The service is excellent. Ozzy is especially great!! He's a terrific server and he's always so kind and helpful. Always very nice to us!"}
{"text":"Overall the customer service at gens was so unprofessional and disrespectful. I understand sometime it can be a little overwhelmed with customers on the weekend, but there's no need to be so rude towards my friends and I. I really don't appreciate their customers skills. I don't think I'll ever going back this place."}
{"text":"Back like I never left...  GEN?? Thats what me and the boys ask each other when we're in the mood to stuff our faces. Come hungry and leave slowly (cause you'll be wobbling out like a piggy)  All you can eat, lunch is 15.99 and dinner is 24.99 (Some stuff isnt included in lunch such as beef tongue and iron steaks). Rice is included in both.  Some waiters are cool and understand me and the boys like to keep the food coming, so they let you put in as many orders as you want. Some are more 'by the books' and limit you to four orders at a time. It's their loss because they'll be running around more. LOL  Only downside to the place is the service isn't amazing. The busboys are on point, but the waiters are okay. Me and the boys are always breaking our necks trying to find a waiter and they're all running around like chickens without a head. They probably need more staff on the floor. And the brisket always takes a while to come out for whatever reason.  But place is great. Me and the boys' personal record is 56 plates and counting between 4 people. We were told thats the #1 record right now and I got the receipt to prove it, so if you up for the challenge hit me up!!  -X"}
{"text":"This was the first time eating at a restaurant like this... The food was great and our waitress, Jaenica was helpful with how the cooking works!"}
{"text":"I love this place for its selection, price, and especially the service today!  Luke was kind, knowledgable, and easy to talk to.  Not to mention the coincidence with it being May 4th!  So Gen and Luke, May the 4th be with you!!!"}
{"text":"Hi ozzi. Youre the best server. Youre good at your job. Thank you for being patient and a positive server for us. We really enjoyed your company"}
{"text":"This place is really good for all you can eat. Me and my wife come here once a month and when my father in law is in town he always makes it a point for us to go here. He always says that place with all the meat is bad ass. The quality is good for all you can eat. If your looking for really fancy Korean bbq this is not the place for you. It's even better since they upped the bear selection."}
{"text":"This place is the place for excellent Korean bbq! The services were excellent, the foods were fresh and awesome. I recommend the beef plate because they were so juicy. I definitely will come again. Love this place"}
{"text":"1. Tongs were dirty 2. The waiter burned me with hot oil when switching the grill and didn't know how to handle it when it blistered up immediately 3. Assistant manager lied about the discount given and wouldn't admit it until he was cornered into an unrecoverable hole 4. Was told I would be contacted for a follow up but have received no contact   Good luck with this place, food is pretty good but absurd service and be ready to be burned by the grill switching as they aren't trained well"}
{"text":"First stop in Vegas for some late night kbbq. So much food for twenty bucks. And Ozzy took care of us!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for my first time. Looking at the menu, there are three vegetarian options. 1) glass noodles 2) raw vegetables 3) tofu. So I got all three. Vegg heads, DONT GET THE TOFU. IT IS COOKED AND SERVED WITH BEEF CHUNKS. I didn't realize until halfway through eating it, and now I'm sick. I don't know how they got away with that because no where on the menu does it say that the TOFU is mixed with BEEF. I'm still so confused. But whatever, I paid $25 for a plate of raw veggies and noodles. Yes, they still made me pay."}
{"text":"The staff are wonderful, they're nice and the service was super A++.  We were trying to find a korean bbq and since we got Gen in Cali, we wanted to try it out in Vegas. It was worth it and we were full !! I will for sure come back to this place if I'm in town."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in the Galleria Mall in Henderson,  but is only accessible from the outside parking lot on the 'upper level'.  It has a nice modern decor and high ceilings which makes it really comfortable to eat inside.   Service is great.  We are constantly proud to add more items to our meals or being asked for more water or beverages.  The best meat, in our opinion, was the pork belly Hawaiin style. It s tender, succulent and tasty without any more sauce added.  And the mushroom and Berthoud addition s also very good as that d the only veggie option for the kbbq.   All in all, it s a rather positive experience but not fantastic, so for stars rating.  The food overall was also a four star rating."}
{"text":"This is a must. We had amazing food with the best waiter Anthony B. He makes sure that your drink is always full and keeps that food coming out. He is the best. Ask for Anthony Boyd when you get there."}
{"text":"Not impressed! We walked in and waited almost a half hour to even get seated, after they said it would be 15 to 20 minutes. Then when we sit they tell us that on the weekends it's dinner prices only, we were somewhat okay with that, just wish it would be publicized somewhere. So we are about to order and now our server proceeds to tell us they are are out of half their appetizers/side dishes. If you want me to , pay full dinner price then don't be out of your supply, especially on a weekend; you need to be better prepared for a weekend and high demand! Not a first good impression! We were looking forward to a new restaurant at Galleria, don't think it will be an asset to the area unless they get their act together. Oh, and ALL hostesses (6) working at the front counter need nicer attitudes as they are the first person you meet when you walk in.  I think all you can eat sushi would be a better choice and money better spent."}
{"text":"Really fun experience.  Eugene offered great service!  Offered suggestions & instructions on making our dinner.  We had so much fun.  The marinated meats are really tasty and I love the little cheese cup...not super traditional but fun anyway.  The pork cutlet appetizer was really good too.  The service here from everyone was top notch and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Took my friend for her birthday she loved it the minutos are great I had a mango was delicious and she had a strawberry she love it too great food and atmosphere first time I was there for lunch great can't complain every time I'm here I have a great time and they have great customer service can't complain about that either love this place"}
{"text":"Oh my fave Korean bbq place! Lots of choices! I love that they incluce soft tofu soup. Staff are friendly and nice. They help each other out so you won't need to have a table piling up with plates. I recommend their popcorn chicken, cajun shrimp, cajun calamari, pork bulgogi (marinated really well), prime steak and japchae (noodles). They also have soju (although I haven't tried theirs yet, maybe in the next visit)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and its one of my favorite Korean bbq. Their meat selection is awesome and some just melt in your mouth once it's cooked. I love how much variety in meats that have and they're very well seasoned. One thing I wish could changed was the serving size for the side dishes. Especially if you have a larger party. Other times we've been there it was 3 or more people and we had to order multiple times for more side dishes. Service was great and were attentive. Tried the macaroon ice cream and it was delicious! A little sweet for my taste though and I'm the type of person that loves sweets but this was a tad sweeter. Would recommend others to try"}
{"text":"A fantastic experience. It is a long wait to get in, for a reason. They bring you fresh, prepared and marinated, high-quality meats of  your choice, ( there are also a few veggie and seafood choices) and you cook them yourself.   You have a little flame grill plate in front of you, and lots of little dishes of appetizers, like kimchi and  Korean potato salad, and various pickles, and salad or rice, to munch on while it cooks.  The food and atmosphere is awesome. It would be great if there were a few more veggie options, or some fruits to grill for a dessert, but I guess it is just not the cuisine.   The Hawaiian marinated options come with a single slice of pineapple, which is a prize worth fighting for, when grilled. ( yes , I shared. No, I really did NOT want to) I would suggested they offer a plate of pineapple rings as an option, or variety of sliced fruits, as that would make an awesome end to a truly epic meal.   I really hope this restaurant, and restaurant style catches on, as the food options are healthy and fresh, and truly fun. But I can only see the two hour plus wait ( Not their fault! Everybody wants to go here!)getting worse, as more people hear about this.I'd like to see lots more locations, and much less wait. Great job!"}
{"text":"It's good for Korean bbq because of all the side dishes. Quality of meat is not supremacy but not the worst like most AYC."}
{"text":"This place is great! Ozzy was our server and was super energetic even though it was the end of the night. Food was fantastic and menu was easy to navigate. Small beer selection but has an endless list of entrees for the all you can eat! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is $25 per person during during weekends while day. Order 4 stuffs every time. Foods are great. Like the free picked vegetables. The sweet potato salad is the best. Can't eat that much with one person only. The best to go with friends. P.S. There is 2 hours limit time."}
{"text":"Alodia(I hope I spelled it right) and Ozzy! Best attendees I had a great time with my brother will definitely be back. Thank you Gen staff for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and left satisfied. Server, Kailin, was awesome. She was helpful. Never ignored us. Always came by to ask if we needed anything. Great price for the amount of food you get. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came to eat here on Saturday and it was amazing! Their Customer service is perfection! I haven't had good customer service in a while and the food was fresh and delicious! We didn't even have to wait for our drinks or refills they checked on us many times and we never missed anything at our table! They were very friendly and let us take our time eating! Thank you Gen! I will be back this weekend!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for kbbq, especially since we live in the area.   Sure it's a chain and yes they recently changed the menu but all in all they have good quality meats with good service.  The recent menu change has dropped the price for ayce to $20 instead of $26 so that's great.  But don't expect to get kalbi.  That seems to be gone.   I like the side dishes and appetizers like the Korean fried chicken (KFC!) And the cheese stuffed pork.     To me they have the best side salad of all the kbbqs I've been to as well.   Overall, it's definitely where to go to get kbbq especially if you are on this side of town"}
{"text":"We came around 6pm for dinner and were seated fairly quickly. They have updated their menu several times since I first reviewed, but we are loving the new items on the menu! Flat iron steak and Hawaiian pork belly are now our latest favorites. As always we had beaucoup beef belly and it was delicious! Our server Ozzy was very tentative, remembered all our requests and checked back frequently. Definitely a spot that will continue to have our business!"}
{"text":"I visited this place when it first opened. The service was fine, but some of the servers were visibly nervous and didn't know what to do with themselves. The meat was good quality, but I hear that these all you can eat places start off with great quality meat to get people interested and spread word about the place, then slack off. We will see how good they are next time I go."}
{"text":"It was a dark and stormy night. Bolts of lightning were streaking across the sky. Grey clouds rumbled by threatening to dump floods of epic proportions down upon the slickened streets. It was a Friday.  My friend was having her birthday so her and her kids jumped into my Dodge Ram limousine and headed south to Gen Korean BBQ, located in the Galleria Mall off Sunset. As we arrived, the combination of the weather along with the Great American Foodie Fest across the street made us think that grabbing a table would be no problem. How wrong we were. It was a 45 minute wait at 6:45pm. The restaurant was filled with groups and groups of asian people. There were asian people flowing out the door onto the sidewalk. All for $19.99 all you can eat Korean BBQ. I was both impressed and thinking this was going to be great.  A text message summoned us to a table set for 5, in a comfortable booth with a low set grilling device built in to the table. An appetizer of edaname, and seaweed salad accompanied the already served small dishes of various Korean appetizers like kim chi and others. A brief flurry of ordering steak, kalbi (not called that on the menu), pork bellies, roast beef, squid, baby octopus and others. They had some interesting variations on the pork belly like smoked garlic (ordered) and miso flavored.   A tower of Widmer Hefeweizen and a few carafes of Soju got the party started. Lots of cooking and soon plates were filled with various meats. Unfortunately for me, none of it had any flavor, it was very bland and basic. A small dish with salt/pepper mix and a few drips of a liquid flavor were also given to each diner, but this wasn't going to offset the bland flavors.  Overall, it was a nice experience, but I don't think I would come back because the food was just blah. Service was hectic, but when you ordered it came out from the kitchen fast. The table was barely large enough to hold all the plates and drinks. There are other Korean BBQ places that place an emphasis on flavor. This place is popular because you can eat a lot of food for $20."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about all these bad reviews on the service! Alodia was amazing! She was busy when we first walked in, so the guy (sorry, we didn't get your name!) who helped us in the beginning was awesome, too! He's from Cali and transferred from one of the stores out there!   Pros:  -$20/person for dinner AYCE (includes appetizers) -they change the grill plate like every 2 different meats -meat was fresh -service was fantastic -don't have to go to china town to get KBBQ  Cons: -Tori (one of the hostess) was SO incredibly rude. I gave her $60 for a $43 bill and when I told her I needed change, I got the worst b*tch face ever. What?! $17 tip? Rude."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this place with my boyfriend and I was not disappointed! Food was great, especially the gen premium steak. Our servers name was ozzy and he was very patient with us, super cool dude. I really loved the atmosphere of this place. I would definitely recommend gen Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"All my California friends set the bar high for this place, so you can only imagine my disappointment when I found this place falling short.  There will probably almost always be a wait time, but the great thing this place offers is that they'll send you a text when your table is ready. I found it pretty convenient since you can kill time in the mall while you wait.  This place is HUGE! The biggest Korean barbecue place I've been to, which can also be why service wasn't up to par. We were seated at the high tables - something I've never experienced before. I'm not sure if they're still working out kinks with their burners, but our burner went out at least 4-5 times. It wouldn't be much of a problem if service wasn't so slow.   Now their appetizer menu is pretty darn impressive compared to other places. They also have a unique menu for their meats. I wasn't impressed too much by the quality though. It lacked finesse and that special \"oomph\" that sets it apart. I personally found the environment and decor more satisfying to my eyes than the food to my stomach.  I guess you can say I probably won't be returning for a while."}
{"text":"It is not how korean bbq supposed to taste like. The quality of meat is terrible. Besides the pork bulgogi, pretty much everything taste terrible."}
{"text":"Don't go here it really sucks. The staff was terrible they didn't know how to refill ice water. They were out of sake. They don't know how to make any mixed drinks. If you want to just order a beer you will be fine. I didn't like any of the food that was served and the idea of going out and having to cook for your friends at the same time was just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Whoo...... Sooo good. The meat is fresh and tasty.  We came here for lunch all-you-can-eat, lots of selections and really good food."}
{"text":"First, I have to admit that Korean food is my ultimate favorite food, so I'm a little bias. But that also means I'm a little more critical.  Gen was absolutely AMAZING! We sat quickly, the servers were very attentive, the food tasted incredible, and the price was actually very good for an all you can eat!  The Kimchi, by the way, was some of the best I've had in the states.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Really great food, had 2 great waitresses. Jaenica and Alodia, really nice young ladies. I had a good time."}
{"text":"I was really excited when Gen opened in Arizona. Having tried Gen in California few times, I knew what to expect. Having said that, I probably had high expectations. We didn't have any problem getting seated right away for Saturday lunch. We had party of 5 and one of the employees gave us a quick run down of the rules to follow (2 hour limit, 4 orders at a time, $5 charge per dishes of meat left, etc). Side dishes such as japchae, soontofu, and salad did not count towards the 4 orders at a time rule. Our meal started off great. Our waiter was very attentive, very quick to bring out the meat and change out the grill when it was dirty. However, half way through when they started getting busy, we had to flag down our waiter when we needed something. He came by less and less. My other concern was that each order was quite small. Having 5 of us eating, it was only enough for each of us to get 1 bite from each order. The size of dishes should vary depending on number in your party or allow more dishes to be ordered for bigger parties.  The quality of food and meat in general was compatible with what I experienced in California. I'm super happy about that. I will return every chance I get a korean bbq craving and $24.99 price point can't be beat."}
{"text":"So happy for them opening one down the street from my house! The atmosphere is amazing and appreciate all the workers here. They are very nice and attentive to you while your eating. I love the choice in music that brings me back to my middle school days. I wish they had the rice paper wraps like in California so hopefully they add it."}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting Gen korean BBQ house, however at a different location. The atmosphere is the same as other locations, good vibes, good music in the background. Our service was very friendly and attentive. The food is great, but it seems like its not too much of a high quality meat but then again it is an all you can eat spot. I would definitely dine here again because im an extreme meat eater and who is to pass up a good deal on all you can eat?"}
{"text":"The food and service was great. They brought out the good quickly and always asked if we were doing okay or needed anything. Our server Jaenica was really nice and friendly - funny too."}
{"text":"Kelly the manager was amazing!! Came here for my birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. If you are looking for a fun dinning experience, then this is the place. The food, ambiance and service were all Amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to Gen in different CA locations, so this one I had high expectations.   I came last Friday with three of my friends. The wait was 15-20 mins when we arrived at 6pm because there weren't a lot of people that time.   The hostesses had a hard time organizing themselves that the managers have to be there. I feel there should be more servers than hostess (some look like it's their first time working in general). We were able to get out tables and our server was very persistent with her service, in a good way! Yeah she always kept checking every time, but heck, it's a busy night and the servers showed so much effort of their service. The bus boys were great as well. They always change our grills when there is burnt residue from grilling meat and clean so well.   Food is standard Korean BBQ but what was different is their Pork Belly marinades. The red wine and smoked garlic ones are my favorites and so were the Hawaiian Pork and Gen Bulgogi. Some meats are pretty thick, so you need to have some patience to cook it well. Their fried chicken is a good starter with the meal.   Overall review: Great to Start. Food was bomb, servers and bus boys did the best service ever, but hostess need better organization with themselves when tables are ready. The building need a bit better on their ventilation system to have the AC not blow in guest with the grill smoke and mess with the heating temperature of the grill.   I don't mind coming back with friends and hopefully they have reservations soon. Compared to other Gen's, this one has the best dining service with servers and bus boys. But the interior looks a bit undeveloped."}
{"text":"So here I am, giving this place another try after having such slow and mediocre service with them previously.   This time, I actually give them a four star rating because of how impressed I was with our server Jaenica and how she took care of us. The reason why I gave such a low rating beforehand was because of how the service was and how the servers were completely confused and not communicating with one another.   The food was better this time. The portions of the appetizers now, especially the popcorn shrimp was a lot more than how it was before. The meats had more flavor this time and the service, even though it was busy, was much better.  I was fairly hesitant to come back to this place after hearing more negative comments about it. But I'm actually completely happy I went back because I'm definitely not down to drive too far again for some good Korean bbq.   Thanks Jaenica for the service! You were great to my family and I."}
{"text":"At the hostess stand we were told 35-60 minutes but \"we've been getting through the list really quickly so there's a possibility it will be only be 20 minutes.\" It ended up being just over an hour (which, had we had a more accurate idea, we'd have gone elsewhere). We ordered the Gen Premium Steak (meh), spicy pork bulgogi, Hawaiian steak, spicy chicken, gyoza, and the cheese pork cutlet (not good).  We liked most of our food, but it's fairly expensive if you're a light eater since you pay $25/person no matter what. Also, it was really loud and we couldn't figure out why. The music level was fine- maybe just the acoustics of the building? But our waiter couldn't hear us a couple times when we tried to grab him to order more food and we had trouble hearing each other over the noise. Over all it was fun to try but I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food.  My son eats here at least once a month so I had to see what was the deal.  Glad I did.  The #10 was awesome.  The pork belly and brisket, again awesome.  The pot stickers (different name on menu) were great.  The fried squid appetizer was yummy! Love the atmosphere. The price is great for what you get. The use of tech is pretty cool.  Need one of these in Summerlin!!  Would have tried it sooner if it weren't so far away..lol."}
{"text":"We came on Thursday for the Soft Opening and waited about 1.5 hours. After waiting three hours at Zero Degrees, this was a walk in the park!  First, I wanna say that our waitress Ejin was so sweet! She was working her tail off and I forced her to sit down when she took our order because, oh man, she had to have been exhausted!    So anyways, place was great. We ate so much meat! Some of our favorites were the baby octopuses, the beef tongue, brisket, and the red wine pork belly. The meats are the kind you expect at other AYCE places in California and Las Vegas where the meat comes to your table curled and ready for grilling. At one point, the pretty manager came by and cut up our meat and helped us grill once we all got to the point where we were meat-drunk. Like we were literally laughing over the dumbest things. Oh, and get the rice paper with your meat, people. Dinner is $25/pp and I think lunch is $15/pp. If you don't finish your food, it's like $4 or $5 per plate so don't waste food, guys! You order four dishes at a time to help avoid wasting food. You have a two hour limit.  Service was prompt. They changed out the grill very frequently and always made sure everything was refilled. So yeah, it was a great dinner with some of my most favorite people! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Gen Korean BBQ with my girlfriend and it's was really good! I've been to Korean BBQ joints before but I've been wanting to go to one where I cook it myself. This was my girlfriend's first time at a Korean BBQ place and she loved it!! It wasn't too busy, it was nice to have a small high top for just us. The one girl, I didn't catch her name was a great server at explaining everything and being attentive!! It was great! A lot of good options and it was relaxing!! Will return definitely!!"}
{"text":"Gen korean  bbq was very good tonight. Food was excellent and the service was the best I've seen from an all you can eat restaurant. JULIAN was by far the best server I've met in a restaurant.  He was determined to get us anything we need and very quick checking up on us very frequently ."}
{"text":"Good food....like the ambiance...excellent server Alodia...definitely we will be back ..."}
{"text":"Great food , great restaurant. Awesome restaurant. Boyd and mizzo were great service. As well as Kalee awesome host! Definitely will come again !"}
{"text":"It's ok- what really bothered me was there are literally no vegetables on the menu- as in ZERO- the only vegetable is a bowl of romaine lettuce (sans dressing) they bring you to start the meal- I mean I love being a meat eater but come on! Balance it out guys! Mushrooms, zucchini ? Anything!!!"}
{"text":"I've dine at Gen a lot but at the gallery mall location and that the location on Sahara is close to me we switch and dine here a many time but my last couple time I went here customer service suck one occasion I have a party of three going in and wanna charge me party charge which I have no clue , will I am a bartender so you wanna charge me I am ok with it , ok today May 31, 2018 I son have a craving for it and ask me if I can take he so family night out we went right off the bat they wanna charge full price for my youngest kid so I say find but my wife argue and they measure him and he was short and apologize and stated the will change him kids price will when we ask for our bill we have little meat left over with three shrimp and wanna charge us leftover fee of $5 which I said go ahead I have no problem with that but guess what buddy if 6-7 pieces of beef brisket and 3 shrimp going to cost me $5 I have no problem you charging me for it and you wanna play boss at a place you work for I am ok with it but guess what? Tip zero $0 dollar oh wait maybe you can take that $5 leftover charge and tip yourself rather then a 20% I going to leave you I and ok with that also!"}
{"text":"Repeat customer but tonight I had the worst customer service ever ! Order beef waited 15 minute for it and the waiter come back and ask did we get our meat he going to check on it , I don't mind first and second time but the third Time it happen and we order the meat before the table next to us got it before us will something is wrong finally he went back there to check on it for the third time And ask us what did we order will by then we are fed up ! Never going back"}
{"text":"It's an amazing KBBQ. Also our server Kailin was amazing too. She was so cute and nice. This is a gooood place. Recommended to everybody number 7, 8, and 9 dish~"}
{"text":"Love the upbeat atmosphere! The tablet service is also pretty neat.  Only a few items were really loved. The shrimp were disgusting... Maybe just not used to that style.  The ribeye is a must!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a KBBQ place of quality in Tempe! Came here a little late last night with my boyfriend and they were so accommodating, despite the fact that we got there 30 minutes before last call. The decor was trendy and all of the staff seemed to stop by our table at least one point throughout our dining experience. The food is awesome and the meat quality is great. Our server Cassie (I think) was so sweet and was attentive, changing out our grill every time it got dirty. Can't wait to come back and have another soju Capri!"}
{"text":"First time here. Love the location of the place. The food was really good and the staff was very attentive. A must try if you love all you can eat Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place due to all the rave reviews. I went here within 9 days of opening, and there were already over 155 reviews due to the soft opening. It speaks for their reputation carrying over from California.   I like their text messaging system during the wait, so you can walk around the mall. We were told that the wait would be 30 at most so stayed put at the bar area, but it was rather 45 minutes, and that's a lot when you're starving. I WAS HAAAAAAANGRY.   A great idea and concept that they have a variety of tapas available besides korean BBQ--there is no place like this in Vegas.   One major critique about this place is their grill pan. It's stainless, and without any oil to properly coat it, your meat will stick and get stuck, unless you constantly move it around. This was most challenging for thin cuts like brisket or bulgogi. And evidently, it would burn so quickly so the grill change had to be conducted frequently. On a side note, we had to ask them for something to put on the grill pan, and it wasn't incorporated into the server's routine. Not sure why we had to ask, since it would save them extra work (changing pans) if they came up with a way to prolong the grill pan cook cycle.   We tried a variety of meats, and I wasn't too impressed with the quality, but what can you do for $19.99/person. It's a sweet deal. Service was highly disorganized, where you'd ask for your bill to the server, but some lady would come with an iPad to do this transaction separately. I get that each person has a role, but, it took about 15 minutes for us to get the bill, and as they charged for 4 people instead of our head count of 3, we waited for another 10 minutes for them to correct their mistake.   Since they have barely opened, and are still short-staffed in comparison to the demand, there was a lot of chaos, disorganization, and some confusion, which I assume will be figured in time. I think most important is that even if the organization were resolved, I wouldn't go back due to the quality of the meats and food being average."}
{"text":"Ambience was great, food was great aside from our grill going out numerous times. I did notice that their \"kids cups\" were just regular cups filled half way which was kind of a turn off."}
{"text":"So tasty. Seriously.  We have visited Gen a few times since they opened. The food is so good. Everything is seasoned well and the glass noodles, while they look like worms, are delightfully savory and delish. The service is hit and miss. When they first opened, I had exceptional service twice, since then, not so much.  A few weekends ago I took my brother and his GF here for lunch, Sunday is dinner prices all day. No problem there, it's still a good deal with the amount of meat you can order. However, it was hot. Like the temperature inside the building was so hot. It was a hot day and I was hoping the restaurant would be cool, but nope. And we didn't get prompt water refills. We had to ask multiple times for dishes and grill changes.  I can forgive all things except the lack of water refills. If you can't quite get the place cooled off, I get it. If you are short on clean grills, I get it. But, leave a carafe of water for the table if you are prone to forgetting. Leave more than one carafe if it's hot as balls and your table keeps asking for water. We are dying, mister! I will be back again though. The food is too good to hold the heat against them for long. I'm hoping they get the air conditioning sorted out and that they can get the staff up to its former glory. If they can do that, it would be 5 stars. Yeah. Meat. It's good."}
{"text":"Seaver is awesome!! Great customer service and the food came out super quick and was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be coming back for many more occasions."}
{"text":"Got to try here for the first time this past weekend! Came in to celebrate the little bro's graduation. We had a party of 15! 5 were my in laws visiting... It was cool to not only go someplace we haven't been, but also have them experience it too. Thanks mom!   Wait for tables weren't too bad, maybe 15 minutes. Unfortunately we had to be split up. Some say at the higher table while the rest of us were at the booth. Little kids must be at the booth. It can be a little challenging because there isn't too much space, plus when you're trying to cook and hold them at the same time..   Lunch price isn't valid on the weekends. That was a bit of a bummer, but we were sure to eat up!   Service is prompt and friendly. You get your drinks fast and they're on it with refills. Ordering is simple they have a device that puts in your order, so you get your food fast.   Some of the foods are already cooked... Think it was all the fried stuff.   Can't wait to go back again! Sorry no pics this time..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch today. Apparently they don't have any lunch specials for the weekends so we were forced to pay the all you can eat dinner price. Which was fine considering you have the option of a lot of different menu items.  Let's just say the food was awful. Not worth the price at all. The slices of chicken they give you to cook are large and misshapen, very hard to cook on an open flame, no knife to cut them up to make sure that each area of the chicken was fully cooked.  This would be fine if we were eating beef, but chicken is very dangerous to potentially eat raw. I found myself biting around areas of chicken to make sure it wasn't raw.   The side dishes that are already at your table when you arrive look like they've been sitting out all afternoon. And they don't remove the plates that your raw food comes on so you're basically sitting next to raw poultry juice all while eating your meal. The food that you can order that's already cooked clearly looks like it's been sitting out as well.  Also the restaurant is just generally filthy, bus tub (dish carts) everywhere. And food crumbs on the seat and floor.  I can honestly say I left feeling sick. Paid $40 to leave hungry and grossed out."}
{"text":"The food was very good .  The wait staff we had was amazing.  Raymond and Luke turned our experience around 180 degrees from when we first walked in the doors.  Sub par hostess staff almost had us walk out the door immediately.  Raymond and Luke with their amazing attitudes made our stay great and made us want to come Back again for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and our servers have been the best! Ask for Alan or Jessica when you go. Both are great and hard working. Aside from my preferences, all of the people in the restaurant are very friendly and laid back. Because of the service alone, I would visit again. The food is also fantastic although, the kimchi has had a funny taste to it. The beef bulgogi is very good and the meat seems to be marinated well. While the garlic calamari is good, it could have a bit more flavor. I also like that there are ready made options for picky eaters like my brother. They have chicken Katsu and fried calamari. Their japchae is pretty good as well. It's great for family and friend gatherings and there's plenty of room to accommodate a large family in a booth. If you request a certain game or channel to be put on the big screen, they will generally accommodate you. Lastly, I hate the tipping system! I requested that my tip go to a specific server and was told it couldn't be given that way because it's put into a pool. This makes no sense because my server may have worked hard to help my table but, the server serving the table next to me may not have been as helpful. Please change this policy because I intend for my tip to go to the person who actually worked to help me, not the person serving the table next to mine."}
{"text":"This place is great, I went when it first opened and loved it. I am not a huge fan of too much meat and you definitely eat a lot of meat but it is good. The waiters and waitress are nice and helpful. I definitely recommend coming her the pricing was not terrible for 2 people at dinner time, $50 ($25 each person) but 2 hours of getting whatever you want is really nice."}
{"text":"Genz was so good and I loved being able to cook everything! Also OZZY was the BOMB.COM! Great Server"}
{"text":"Love eating at this KBBQ place, I probably would leave 5 stars if it wasn't for the wait times we've encountered. They're so popular that you can expect a decently long wait most of the time during typical meal time hours. But the meats are fresh, their choices of sides and apps is fantastic and service is very good."}
{"text":"This place doesn't really live up to all the hype. The food is decent at best and unless you are seated in a booth prepare to be seated with strangers who are in close proximity and can overhear your conversation. Also be prepared to be bombarded by multiple servers all arriving within one to two minutes of each other and requesting the same information. When it comes to payment, I suggest bringing cash. If you go with a debit/credit card be prepared for a long wait until they can arrive at your table juggling a bulky iPad type device and mini printer while trying to figure out how to walk you through he payment process and print your receipt."}
{"text":"To begin this review, I will say I have no clue how this place has 4.5 stars.   I was genuinely dissapoointed with my experience here. If you are looking for traditional KBBQ restaurant, this is not your place.   The food was a huge dissapointment. The marinades lacked traditional flavor and meats did not seem to be of good quality. The combinations of side dishes were weak to say the least, as we were only given 5. They were even out of half of the sides of we asked for, unfortunately.   I understand wanting to cut down on wasteful eaters, but portions were miniature compared to traditional KBBQ places (example: they served my party of 4, 4 slices of galbi per each order... SLICES). However, if you are choosing to eat here I would not venture very far into their meat section...for example chicken with cheese sauce--absolutely bad."}
{"text":"???????3????? appetizer????????????? ????????????????? ?????????? ?????????????????????????????? ?????????? ??????????????????"}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go. The food comes out raw and you have to cook it.   It is time consuming but a good place to go for a date."}
{"text":"I have eaten at different Korean bbq  spots.  I have to say that this one has a very good menu selection and that the meats are quality cuts. Very good.   Waiter was very nice.   Only thing is that they don't have steamed eggs and rice paper wraps"}
{"text":"First time here, everyone's running around with their heads cut off. Our server, Luna, seemed the most confused and lost. We gave her our order and she repeated it back to us and yet she forgot our rice and getting a fork. She wasn't very tentative to our table when we wanted to order more food or even the people sitting around us.   The bartender is the only person who serves drinks, including sodas. Our server had asked the people sitting next to us if they wanted a refill of their Sprite. She had dropped of the cups at the bar and somehow there was some miscommunication and he thought they were dirty dishes. Luna was preoccupied with her other tables that 15 minutes had gone by until she finally noticed they didn't have drinks. She was apologetic every time she stopped at the table.   Even though this is a new restaurant, their servers definitely need a bit more training. I'm a frequent LA KBBQ eater so I know how the all you can eat thing works. The only credit I will give to this restaurant are the bussers. I didn't catch his name, but one of the busboys was frequently coming to collect our plates and ask for a grill change. You go busboy, holding down the fort!"}
{"text":"Family went here last night for my daughters' birthday.. We've all got severe food poisoning today.. Never again.."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers last week, and I'll give it 3 stars. Overall, the process is confusing when the server tries to explain it, but you figure it out once things get moving. There are several items on the menu, and you end up cooking most of them yourself at your table in a saucer-shaped grill. I wish I had known this going in because why the hell did I leave the office to take on all these additional responsibilities? No idea if that chicken I made was the reason my peer has been out of the office the past few days.  We did the all-you-can-eat lunch where you order, cook, eat, and repeat. It felt like a race, even though we had 2 hours. Before the food you ordered shows up, they bring you a plate of sauce/seasonings to dip your food in. Then they bring you around 8 little plates of randomness you didn't order...one of which was a tiny scoop of mashed potatoes. Very bizarre! Try eating those with chopsticks. Then you have the cooking utensils with tongs and giant scissors...just a lot going on in your space. I feel sorry for whoever has to clean all of those dishes. We had to have gone through at least 50 of them at our table alone.  I would recommend this place if you're looking for something different or on an awkward first date. Most of the food was good, but it's too involved if I had been drinking like I usually am."}
{"text":"This place is really not bad at all. I usually have Korean barbecue on the west coast. That is where I originally tried it out the first time years ago even though of course there are Korean BBQ places all over.   Las Vegas is a place I do not go to very often. But it was the second time I have been in the area and someone whom I know was kind enough to show me a great place he had already eaten twice at (within the span of two weeks ) previously.   The premise of Korean barbecue is that you basically pay to cook your own food. But it is the price and experience that being people to come back to places like this. The menu of meat is extensive at most restaurants. This was no different. There is a lunch special during the week for all you can eat but the price is different during the weekend.   The place has a good energy and modern fusion look in the decor. Many tables with booth style seating ( what we were offered ) or a large sit down bar area. The wait was not too long as there were five in our group. As soon as we were seated the hostess let us know that even though it was lunch time, the dinner price was what was available during the weekend. It was still a good deal for the amount of food we ended up ordering. The different in price was approximately $5 but there was a reason why our friends ate here at least twice ( which they normally would not ).   The banchan put out and our server let us know the special appetizers that were available. Popcorn chicken, Korean fried chicken ( which is touted as the new KFC ) spicy pork bulgogi, pork bulgogi, chadol, steak, chicken bulgogi and some bovine intestine (gobchang). The last dish everyone politely declined to try.   Dessert options. While waiting for a table at the beginning I noticed a large waist height display freezer full of macrons. But these were not regular dessert macrons. They were filled with ice cream. Four main flavors were available but I only ordered while another one in our party decided to try one. I decided to get the mango and chocolate flavor.    There is a good assortment of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I did not partake but they have both sake, soju, wine and different beers.   Overall service was excellent. They were attentive and even took time to explain that we were able to adjust the heat for cooking. This was important as some meats required more or less heat.   They accommodated babies but I did not like that the baby chair was on the outside of the booth. Customers and employees kept walking by and out of curiosity there were many attempts to grab the food as it was put on the table. But there were no issues and the employees were careful.   They separated the bill for each person which made my group happy. This is a spot I would not mind visiting again."}
{"text":"Delish! Meats were great. Loved their seafood salad. 5 stars too to our servers who were very solicitous. Thank you Lauren! They should give you a raise!"}
{"text":"Bisch! I'm hella about this place. I've been there four times because 1. it's in Tempe Marketplace and if you're going to see a movie or go shop it's somewhere to pop right into. 2. it's a fun experience to cook your own food much like the KBBQ places in Los Angeles. And 3. the servers are rad as hell.   Tips:   If you go during lunch it's probably like $10 less? And you get basically the exact same items.  Get the sauces on the side and figure out which of the side items you find compliments your food best.   Turn the grill down a little bit and avoid the center unless you're just looking for a sear on the meat, otherwise your grill will burn up and they're going to have to change it constantly.  Pretty gosh damn Delicious. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"great food! a lot of their options were missing tho; they kept saying \"they were new\" but not rlly. they didn't even have french fries! but everything i tried was super good."}
{"text":"The food was really good! The interior looked much better compared to all the other korean bbq places in Las Vegas. However, the dinner service was what I liked most about this place! Aladia was an awesome waitress. For being such a tiny person, she moved very quick and efficient. 10/10 would come back for the food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"The food was really good but it really difficult to enjoy because it's hot and humid in there. If you enjoy sitting in your sweat while eating, eat here!   The decor was very nice. Modern, clean, simple and the music was a Top 40, no KPop.   Our server Jessica was phenomenal! She made the experience worthwhile in this hot place.   Unfortunately, because of how hot it was here I am unable to give a 5 star review. It was uncomfortable for my party and I. I will recommend trying this place in the winter. For now 1 star until they lower their ceilings or install another ac unit or when I try this place in the winter."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at this place & it was great ! Ozzy was our server & he did an amazing job making sure we had everything we needed ! Loved it ! Their ice cream macaroons are the bomb !"}
{"text":"First the positives: not busy for a Sunday afternoon. Seated quickly. Very clean and they changed our grills in between meats. Which was nice. Our waiter was ok.   Now, For the negatives. This was our 1st time and they explained the menu very quickly.  We had to ask 2x for our noodles and steak and soy sauce.  The HUGE negative is my 12 year old son ordered the ALREADY COOKED Sesame Chicken and after eating most of it he offered me a piece..... it was RAW! We told the waiter. Who apologized. However, I'm sorry but u just fed my child RAW chicken. My son then didn't want anything else to eat.  When the cashier came with the bill she asked if everything was good.... Um no.  I explained to her what happened and all she said was sorry. I didn't expect all of our meals to be free. However, I did expect my sons to be. That would have been customer service.  I can think of better ways to spend 70 bucks and be just as full and not have to worry about food poisoning."}
{"text":"Not all Gen are created equal.  Not even all the locations in Southern California are either.    The types of meat, the quality and cuts of meats are pretty different here.  I'll give this Gen an extra star for having more choices of non-marinated meats.  However, the quality of meat is just not the same here.  It's definitely fattier than I remembered it to be, much slower service. Once happy hour hit, the kitchen stalled for an entire 20 minutes for some reason and ran out of rice.     The brisket and roast beef were okay and the most disappointing of it all is, they don't carry any variety of short ribs any longer.  I didn't see any pork cheeks either, plus they ran out of tofu soup and I guess they don't make it after they run out at 9 p,m for dinner.   We left not wanting to ever visit a Gen any longer.  We came, we tried, never again."}
{"text":"UPDATE: We were so excited for Galbi that we decided to drive all the way to the Henderson location. We hauled our 4 kids (7, 5, 3 and 3m) all the way across town to eat. As soon as we got there, you can feel their welcome. Totally different atmosphere! Thankfully, we only waited about 10 minutes for them to get a booth ready. As soon as we sat down, ordered drinks and the first round of food. Food was cooked and in our kids bellies within 10 minutes from the time we sat down. Waiters and hostesses were amazing!!! Made sure our kids were ok with everything.   Crappiest service ever!!!! Every where you turn, there was an employee. I think there were more employees than there were guests. All those employees, and they still couldnt get our business. Three groups were seated before us. Ok, they were smaller groups. Fine. A party of 3 seated at a table that we could've fit on? Wait, why? Ok, whatever, maybe there's a better location for us. I ask the manager how much longer and they said they're getting the table ready right now. But then, a bigger group gets seated before us? And they came in after us? Wtf?! That's when they knew they f***ed up. You can see it in their faces. The hostess started talking on her headset and looked around and started typing on her iPad. Yup, we left. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there until they figure out their flow. It's like no one knows what they're doing."}

Food was cooked and in our kids bellies within 10 minutes from the time we sat down. Waiters and hostesses were amazing!!! Made sure our kids were ok with everything. They brought out forks for them. Their drinks were in a paper cup with a lid on it. They always ask to help cook at home, so they had a lot of fun cooking. We ordered gyoza, brisket and galbi. Gyoza was good, but didn't come with sauce. Little did I know, the sauce was already provided on the table when they sat us. Lol. The brisket was dry, but just use that same sauce and it was good. Galbi.....to die for!!! We loooooove Galbi. That's all we kept ordering the rest of the night. We tried the macaroon ice cream for the first time. We tried the mango, vanilla, strawberry and coffee. All were amazing. A couple were frozen solid, but that's expected. It's ice cream. Lol. I've been to the Henderson location for a girls night out, a date with the husband and with our kids. All around amazing!!! They have never failed me."}
{"text":"The restaurant is wonderful! It was my first time eating at this place and the experience was great thanks to Eugene and the crew. The wait wasn't long, and Eugene was always on point with the orders, recommendations, and always checking up on our table. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I came in with a friend on a Monday night, around 10pm. We were seated in about 5 minutes. Everything is ayce except for drinks, which was a pleasant surprise. For appetizers we got the Korean fried chicken and gyoza. I basically ate all the KFC chicken myself, it was so flavorful! The hostess Kris and our server Ozzu also offered some of their recommendations, which was helpful.  I really enjoyed the marinated steak and and the bulgogi (#5). Wasn't too much a fan of the fatty brisket.  Ozzy was very attentive, stopping by our table often to ask if we needed anything more.  You have two hours to eat so take it easy. By the time I left I was stuffed and slept with a happy belly that night."}
{"text":"Really good Korean BBQ, nice sized grill enough to fit in 4 the 4 orders, staff is best during non-crowded hours as they take good care of customers and offer more choices for those who are new.  It does get pretty chilly if you are under one of the fans...  Spicy Bulgogi and Spicy Octopus are my mains ~"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about the grill your dinner situation but it turned out fine. This meal will take some time don't try and rush it.  Lots of good flavor in the 36 items. I did a lot of half orders because I wanted to try several items. Be careful not to over do it because they charge you $5 per plate for uneaten meat. Overall good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend Stephanie treated me out a day after Valentines to Gen BBQ.  Our server was Jay AR and he was an excellent server.  He had a unique way of expressing with his hands while speaking, clear about each portion.  He brought us the perfect mugs of green teas, waters, all our servings in a timely fashion and al ways asked if we needed anything else.  We needed a new plate to cook on and Jay AR added sesame oil onto our meat salt which came in useful for cooking."}
{"text":"Service was prompt & food tasted great! Chicken bulgogi marinade was the best & Kalbi was cut off bone for you! Kailin was friendly & attentive!!"}
{"text":"F that place waited for over 3 hours.    Not organized at all.  Left with a party of 8.    Went next door to kabuki."}
{"text":"The meet is so not fresh. As soon as it touches the meet separates. Meets have excessive fat. Chicken was bad that it tasted sour. The restaurant has a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean BBQ in all of Las Vegas! I've been to many and there are other good ones but Gen has become my favorite.   I've been to Gen about 5 times since it opened and it has the best service  and excellent quality of food.   It is all you can eat for 2 hours and has tasty hot food from the kitchen delivered which is nice to have while we cook your own meat. The staff always asks if we need anything and changes our grill top frequently.  We will absolutely be back at Gen time and time again!"}
{"text":"Jaenica is the best, came by to check if we were doing good and drink refills were quick. The place is amazingly good and the prices are great. Great place to have a meal with friends or a date."}
{"text":"It was nice they added a lot of the side dishes as part of there all you can eat menu, but it doesn't steer away from the fact that the meat cuts aren't that good. This place has a bunch of competition and they really need to step it up"}
{"text":"Excellent Korean BBQ place at a reasonable price. I was impressed with the service and food. The steak wasn't great, but the rest was good."}
{"text":"The search for the best KBBQ in LV continues.... After my friend heard about this place on NPR and seeing so many great reviews, my friends and I made the long trek out to Henderson in search of some great AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ.  Unfortunately, this did not end up being the mecca of KBBQ we had hoped it to be...  Firstly, the decor was weird! It was very modern and young, like it was trying to cater to KPOP teenage fans or something. It was also way too clean to be authentic...If I can't smell the BBQ, that's not a good sign!  Second, the BBQ was only OK. At least they had bulgogi/steak/pork belly/ spicy pork....but they didn't have galbi....like no marinated bone in short ribs in sight! What? Also, the portion sizes when they came out were kinda small....but I guess since it's AYCE, it doesn't really matter. I will say that the jap chae noodles were garlicky and delicious and I may have ordered like 3 plates of it :) Also, for $20/pp it's a good deal.    Finally, the service was HORRIBLE. I mean, who are you hiring, Gen? High schoolers? These kids had no idea what was going on, told really odd/weird/inappropriate jokes, forgot to bring us multiple items (sauces, ordered meats, water), and honestly didn't listen to us half the time when we asked about items on the menu. For example: -- Us: \"what is the difference between the premium pork and the regular pork?\" Waiter: **stares at us, then walks away** -- Um, you could have even just said I don't know, but don't just ignore us!  *shakes my head*  Get it together, Gen! It's like amateur hour here!"}
{"text":"5/5 KBBQ!  Never thought that would ever happen. Gen is the newest hot spot in town and man they aren't lying when they say premium quality! Not just the meat, but the rest of the food and service as well. Samuel was our server and he did an excellent job making sure we were taken care of. Yuhao was also awesome and super sweet!!! I'm a big fan of BBQ so this hit the spot.  Must haves: Brisket Bulgolgi Beef tongue Premium steak  I love how fast they are when it comes to service and bringing out the food and our requests. Even when we sat down everything (the sides and salad) was prepared already! Their Shirley temple is yummy and they constantly filled our drinks. Gonna try the bar drinks next time... Soju is on the menu heheh.  Awesome spot definitely will bring my boyfriend here!"}
{"text":"One of my top favs for KBBQ in Henderson. For a nice lunch special of 15.99. You can have all you can eat. Minus the drinks and desert. There are also some other options that are for dinner only menu but if you pay a little more you can have it. The beef brisket and beef bulgogi are one of my top faves for all you can eat. The atmosphere for the restaurant is really modern and laid back. The staff is really friendly and I checked the bathrooms. Very clean. I recommend this location if your craving KBBQ in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Gen is what I would consider the In &Out of the KBBQ category. Prior to these guys showing up in the Vegas valley all that you would ever hear from ex-Californians was \"OMG you have to try Gen\" \"Gen is the best KBBQ place ever!!\" Honestly to me it's the in-and-out nostalgia complex defined.   BUT I will say the following statements: The Gen product is consistent across their chains; the Vegas locations are on par with the Tustin, CA location.  Gen provides a environment that's comfortable and appealing to wehgukin/baeg-in. Meaning that the customer service what you expect from a standard restaurant in America (using Asian bias standard for all restaurants).   They provide a solid spread of Bon-Chon and are very prudent in ensuring that your little dishes never run empty.   The cooked dishes are OK however nothing to write in detail about. It's hard to write overflowing adjectives about the KFC and gyoza. Both are ok but not what you come here for. The main event here is the meat. First and foremost +1 star on the fact that they have Kalbi on their AYCE menu. Most KBBQ places either charge extra for Kalbi or limit it to one order.  The cuts of the meat are good quality the Chadol (brisket), Samgyubsal (pork belly) and Hangjungsal(pork jowls) are some of my standard favorites and were top notch.  The saucy meats: Beef Bulgogi, Kalbi and Spicy Pork were very good as well.  My suggestion is to starts with the unsauced meats and then do the saucy stuff; this way your taste buds are not killed from the Gochujang if you are not used to it.   For those who are just venturing into Korean foods, Gen is a good starting point to get introduced to the flavors w/o getting yelled at by an Ajima or getting blown away by the power of Gochujang.  Enjoy the wait for this place; it's worth it (as long its less than a 1/2 hour)."}
{"text":"Thanks Seong for your kind and quick service!!!! I loved how he asked us if we were sure we were done! Definitely ate my money's worth!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Definitely recommend for anyone who likes Korean BBQ! Fun atmosphere for dining with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Very good Korea BBQ at a very reasonable prices for both lunch and dinner. The only major drawback is the location, since it is located at the Galleria Mall (across the street from Sunset Station), which can be a rather long drive for anyone not working/living in this part of Las Vegas.  Gen Korean Barbecue House has just opened 2 weeks ago. Still in their soft opening phase and running their promotion (free AYCE dinner for first 50 guests starting at 3pm). I actually have been here twice during this promotion (the second time I didn't know the promotion is still active and was guest number 39 of 50 on Sept 1, 2015). And my coworker that I was meeting also arrived and received the same promo voucher.  There seems to be a lot servers/crew working on my first two visits. From what I have learned from casual interviews of the crew serving us, they have experienced managers and seasoned servers working here to train the new employees, so guest experiences can quickly improved to the level one can expect to received at their other established locations in California.  As is, the servers are all very friendly and tries to be as proactive about providing the best customer service as they can (almost never had to ask for beverage refills or grill change).   I prefer to have regular cooking oil brushed on the new grill (only happened twice without prompting), or they would squeeze sesame oil (low smoke point so it would completely burn off before the grill gets hot enough to grill properly) afterwards. But when I requested regular cooking oil, they did fill a bottle from the kitchen to accommodate my request. I guess some of their other guests does not want the extra oil, so it is by request.  Most guests that goes to this type of cook it yourself KBBQ knows and enjoy the interactive cooking experience. It is one of the best part of the meal in my opinion, but I am usual the designated grill master anyway. But if you can't cook or prefer the crew cook it for you, they will (but how well it turns out will vastly differ depending on their individual skills, as I doubt any of these kids have any formal culinary training). But seriously, it is not that hard to master once you learn to adjust the intensity of the flame while grilling your meats & seafood.  They have most of your typical KBBQ meats, seafood and vegetables. But menu offering varies slightly by locations, if you have had previous dining experience at other Gen KBBQ locations. To minimize waste, you can order up to 4 meat dishes a la carte, which servers bring to you already portioned on plates. My favorite here is their No.10 Gen Yangyum Galbisal (Marinated Premium Steak), which I literally orders at least one each round. Their Chicken Bulgogi is excellent, but you really have to know how to grill these extra thick pieces of chicken without undercooking them or burning the outside or cooking it to its excessively dried unappetizing death. Cutting it to thinner slices on medium flame is recommended. The Beef Brisket & Beef Tongue is good and cooks super fast (unfortunately no half orders if you want less, like when you go by yourself). Their Pork Belly is basically thick slabs of bacon (options of plain, miso or red wine marinated). Shrimps are good and cooks relatively quickly, but your hands will get dirty peeling them afterwards (or bring your Bae that will peel it for you. The things people do for love).  As far as appetizers, their salad is a must. Helps balance out the artery clogging yumminess of all the grilled meats. The Pork Cutlet is decent. The Fried Calamari is yum. Seaweed Salad is on par with sushi restaurants. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) was disappointing, at least for me, since it really just reminds me of their variation on boneless Orange Chicken. Truffle Fries looks interesting (but it was not available on my first visit). Spicy Korean Rice Cake has a nice crispiness to it, but I recommend sauce on the side for this one.  Even if AYCE is not worthwhile for you or you just don't feel like smashing your diet plans for half a week, they have Premium Box Lunch Specials ($7.95 to $9.95).  As far as desserts. Currently they don't have anything, unless you count their Potato Salad (will already be at the table when the hostess seats you). But Macaron Ice Cream Sandwhich(es) will be available after their soft opening phase. Can't wait to try that.  So if you are still with me after all those paragraphs, I  hope you find this review informative. Would I recommend it? Yes! Are there room for improvements? Of course, but they are already doing a bang up job so far and it should be even better in the months ahead. Price wise, it is very competitively priced. If they actually open a second Vegas location in a more centrally accessible venue, they will easily put major dents in their competitors gross sales and customer count.  In closing, keep up the good job Gen KBBQ House & welcome to Las Vegas!  *Use of iPad very helpful in checking orders."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in VEGAS! Great prices! We had the best server OZZY! He was very fast and attentive! Very nice!!!!Great and fast service with each order!  Definitely a great eating experience! I live on the opposite of town but worth the drive! Best all you can eat! I definitely recommend GEN!"}
{"text":"Alodia... It's lit!  she was one of the most friendliest servers that I have had in my entire life. Really easy to talk to and kept checking back consistently. The food was great along with the service! Love the atmosphere and the EDM in the background"}
{"text":"Modern take on a Korean BBQ restaurant. It's all you can eat and a very very large selection of options to choose from. Well worth the price. I suggest going with at least four people in your party so you can share the many different entrees and appetizers. They provide all of the little side dishes and condiments and refill if needed. It's a busy place and they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"we had a great server last night her name was alodia! everything was fun and awesome with delish  food cuz of her!! thanks alodia!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot every time love there menu we always go with  at  least 8-10 people service is usually always on top of filling drinks to taking endless orders down to bringing out those delicious macaroons,  hands down  GEN KOREAN BBQ is one of the best in Vegas ...!!!"}
{"text":"Came to this place after some suggestions from friends and I was familiar with this place after visiting the one in Racho Cucomunga. The service was the best part about the night as our server Blake was friendly and attentive, maybe too much so. The food was decent, they had ran out of many things we wanted to try. Favorite things were ordered were the Kalbi and the chadol, pretty standard choices at Korean BBQ. If they had soup options like the steamed egg or jjigae I might have given an extra star. Overall it's slightly above average, I'll give them a few months to iron out the kinks before I give them another try."}
{"text":"Super cool date night spot. It's a place for a great experience. The meats pretty good. They give you some pretty good portions and they'll bring it out as much as you want. It seems that some waiters start to get irritated when you continue to order but for the most part everyone is pretty cool. The salad is great as well. I love the dressing. If I was rating this after my first visit I would have given it 5 stars but after the second visit I had to lower it a little. Food came out slower and the waiter seemed irritated. Definitely go though."}
{"text":"Food was sub-par. Service was below average. I left a bottom part of my retainer there by accident on my napkin when I was finished eating, left and literally called back within 15 minutes and they said they didn't find anything. They more than likely threw it away in the garbage. And they act like they don't care. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. Never going back to a place that doesn't care about their paying customers."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. The food quality is a decent 4, but the service was a crappy 2-3 star. I decided to give it a 4 due to the cleanliness of the place and neat use of iPads for ordering/paying. This restaurant caught me by surprise as they had some technological equipment.  I went during dinner and for the price of $19.99, you can't really complain too much. This is dirt cheap (well, not as cheap as SoCal) and will definitely be a great place after a workout or if you're just feeling super hungry/hungover. For a party of two, we waited about 40 minutes. Instead of waiting at the restaurant, the hostess took our number information down and said we'd get a text message when our table was ready. Loved this concept. I forgot which platform they used, but great job!   The quality of meat was fairly decent for all the beef dishes. I hated cooking the shrimp, but that was me. There was a mix-up in the beginning and they delivered plates that weren't ours.  No worries.  Appetizers (included in the price): I tried their popcorn shrimp and it tasted kinda stale. The fried squid legs were OK. I was not a fan of the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) as it tasted like Panda Express's orange chicken that was left outside for hours. The edamame wasn't that great either (seriously, how can you mess that up?!)  Service was really slow and our waiter looked consistently overwhelmed. It was clear he couldn't manage the number of tables. Once a server comes to your table, they enter your orders into an iPad Mini and the order gets sent straight to the kitchen. Servers would then bring you your orders within minutes, which was awesome. It seemed super efficient at first, but that's only if you got your waiter's attention.  Pro-Tip: Order all your dishes in advance because the turnaround time for ordering dishes is unpredictable. They also replace your grills too periodically, which was good. I was slightly confused why they didn't pre-grease their grills as our meats got constantly stuck on there.   Overall, this place was a solid 4-star restaurant that I wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food is always great, but this time really stood out for me. I visited with my mom, who has Alzheimer's. She has been to places like this in the past but on this trip she just was not happy with the idea of this style of dining. Our server, Alodia, was just so kind and patient about the entire experience. A lot of establishments tend to make my mom uncomfortable in these types of situations but Alodia and Gen went out of their way to accommodate us and make sure we still had a great experience even during a stressful time. Even had the food been terrible, I would be back based of the service alone. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place multiple times and possibly about 5x this year. It is our family's favorite and go to AYCE Korean bbq. The servers are all amazing, fast service, great food and awesome restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time in California and loved it.  I was thrilled to find out that it was opening here in Arizona.  The place was fantastic until they stopped serving the rice paper.  It's a Gen staple but here in Arizona they stopped. Why?  Because it wasn't cost efficient?  I don't know but it's a deal breaker for me.  They have rice which is not the same, but I realize it makes us fuller faster therefore we aren't supposed to order as much meat.  But something about the rice paper wrapped around a piece of meat dipped in their green tea salt and whatever that liquid sauce is, is the bomb!!  Alas, not anymore.  I have gone back 3 other times in hopes that my mind and taste buds would tell me that it would be okay to eat the grilled meats without the rice paper, but I can't, which is why I voted this place 3 stars.  Bring back the rice paper and Gen would be a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Just come today, and the food is okay, but the down side is they take out a lot of appetizer, and now they just serve little appetizer only. And the price is going up for $1. But they take out a lot of my favorites appetizer.. Never go back again..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about this restaurant my server was nice but however we wasn't told there was a time limit it was a party of seven and they would only bring out 3 small trays of meat every 20 minutes and not only that we had to ask plenty of times to change our bbq grill we arrived around 4pm and it gets dark early now so the manager came to our table at 5:15pm and stop the meat that we ordered to come too our table we was embarrassed and honestly this was the worst gen Korean bbq i went to it wasn't a lot of choices of meats like California has. I personally won't be coming back to this location again. They should put a sign outside stating its not all you can eat meat and time is limited! Not only that we paid. $189 and we didn't even get enough of meat is it wasn't worth it!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced !!!! Jaenica was super helpful and was very attentive to our very annoying rowdy party lol the atmosphere is very comfortable casual . Love bring friends here for a good time. But Fer sure I'm requesting to be seated in Jaenica  section she took care of us :D"}
{"text":"Came here on their first day of opening and I'm glad Gen BBQ is finally here. I used to eat here all the time in Cali and now I don't have to drive 5 hrs to enjoy kbbq. Lunch price is only 15 for ayce. That's an awesome deal!!!!! Welcome to the Valley, Gen bbq."}
{"text":"Gen Korean BBQ  Two Words - FOOD COMA  New Korean BBQ that recently open at Tempe Market Place, we arrived on a Saturday at 11:45 am and was told about 20 minutes and when I went back after 25 minutes another person told me about 45 minutes, I asked why and told them what they initially said and they said they would get us in shortly.  We sat down and Amanda our waitress was there to explain our menu and options. She told us we had 2 hour limit and could order 4 items at a time.  We started with Gen Premium Steak, Garlic Calamari, Gen Beef Bulgogi and Mushrooms & Vegetables. Then continued and ordered Gen Chadol, Premium Pork Belly, Garlic Chicken, Mushrooms & Vegetables, Shrimp, Galbi and Gen Chadol Brisket.  Of all the items my favorite was the Gen Beef Bulgogi which has a nice marinated sauce that makes the beef outstanding.  The service was very good with Amanda taking care of our table with drinks and quickly bringing our orders of meats and other items on her tablet.  The seating portion was kind of a snafu, but after that everything else was pretty good.  The restaurant is located at Tempe Marketplace behind Barnes and Noble."}
{"text":"This place is definitely great for college hangout and for people who have never experience Korean BBQ. This place is beautifully decorated, cleaned, with comfort seats and played super loud music. Their ventilation system also works great. Prices are reasonable and affordable for college kids. However, even though I understand that it is ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ, the portion at each delivery was a bit small and tastes super salty. I wonder if it was done on purpose so that you would drink more soda to fill your stomach up. Since there are multiple Korean BBQ place that pops up everywhere in Mesa, I really think their food are not as authentic and/or as delicious as other places do. Overall, I think this place is just ok."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance, & service. First time at a Korean BBQ place and they did a great job at explaining everything and it all works. The staff was attentive in making sure we received our meats in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Amazing food and customer service, we came here for the tgif event and we're not disappointed, the ambience as well as the other diners were very nice."}
{"text":"Service here was a little slow at first with taking our initial order but after they more than made up for it as we progressed through the meal.   We had asked for two clean trays to place our cooked meats and they were so efficient that before we could even move them onto the table for use in the area we were needing them someone attempted to pick them up multiple times, assuming we were finished with them based on location on the table.   There is a 2 hour limit on your occupation time at the table, plenty of time since they were so efficient with delivering items with little to no delay.   There was a short line when we went because it is such a popular establishment around dinner so plan to wait a little especially with a larger party.  Well worth the wait however!"}
{"text":"Horrible fatty meat , Horrible service , even the female manager was horrible. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This is our second time at Gen and both experiences have been amazing!   Our server Terry was the funniest ever and saw to it we got everything we needed at lightning speed, seeing as Justin (manager) was nice enough to accommodate us even though we walked in a few minutes after they stopped seating new tables, so in other words we were turbo eating. Lol  Our favorite is the japjae and the red wine pork belly, but everything on the menu is absolutely delicious!   The atmosphere at Gen is also very nice, it's  probably the nicest Korean BBQ spot in the valley.   We love it and recommend it to all our friends. It's safe to say this is probably our new go to spot. Now, the goal is to get there on time to be seated!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed because we came in, 3 adults and a child. We fed the little one prior to because she won't eat Korean food. The hostess tells us that they will have to charge for her. We said she won't be eating and is already tired and will probably be resting. Sorry they explain if she sits she is charged to which we responded with walking out the door because we don't frequent or support businesses that would seek to charge us for food never consumed.  There are way too many Korean food places in the valley to eat at one that assumes you are going to cheat them."}
{"text":"The reason for the one star is the wait time issue. I called in ahead of time and they had mention that the wait time can range up to 3 hours. They do not take reservations, you have to actually come in and write your name down and wait. So my friends told me to get there 2 hours early, but when I arrived they said there is no wait time. So I asked if I can be called back 2 hours later, they said no. THEN when my party arrived they told us the wait time is 45 min. WHY ARE THERE NO RESERVATION?! It is very stressful and inconvenient.  Don't get me wrong the food is great. And the service is average.  The staff here are all lazy though! Our grill went black 3 times. The staff would glance at our table and ignore the fact that our grill is dirty."}
{"text":"Second time being and I'm not satisfied. I waited 20 minutes for my signature steak and have not received it. Horrible customer service!"}
