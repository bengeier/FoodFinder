{"text":"Organized a get together here for my husbands birthday. Emailed time capsule and corresponded with Igor to reserve an area and also requesst an earlier opening time for a sunday get together. Igor was very helpful and responded quickly via email. The location is great for us since we live in the east end, for ttc users its within walking distance from woodbine station. They have foose ball, pool, pingpong table, and many board games. I believe the owner mentioned they were going to set up karoake as well. I think this place is a great afternoon or night time meet up venue where they serve food, alcohol and cafe type drinks. The food menu is simple bar type food great for munching on while playing board games and having a few beers. To note food wise..... the gravy on the poutine was extremely salty and my friend ordered mild wings and it came with a mayo sauce which we thought didnt work (just a few suggestions on the kitchen front). Also a few in our group felt quite hot inside, it was a mild day in fall so this is probably rare occurence as winter is soon approaching not a huge deal just things to note. All in all we had a great time and everyone in or group had a great time. Thanks Dimitri and Igor!"}
{"text":"Time capsule- timeless jerks of GTA.   Time capsule proves to be a timeless prick again. Inspite of reserving 1 month in advance and confirming our reservation time and time and time and TIME again, time capsule on the day of the event canceled our booking for another group only just cause their group was bigger than ours. We agreed to pay the booking fee of $300 (to book the entire space) a month in advance to make the reservation but their staff insisted not to pay it then. Inspite of several phone confirmations and in person confirmation with their staff members, one being Igor, we were notified just four hours before our event that they had double booked. What more can I say about Igor from Noobville -the extremely ignorant and indifferent human being for whom I don't wish ill but must know that 'time' ma friend, time will settle accounts #karmabitch.  I genuinely believe that after all this, their professionalism when scaled, is smaller than the smallest suppository plug CAPSULE in the drug market and hope they amend their business acumen and attitude before it's too late. #timewaitsfornoone"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this newly opened café while strolling along the Danforth recently, and we decided to pop in yesterday for a little Wednesday date night. I'm glad we did!   THE GOOD: - To put it simply, this place is food meets fun. The area at the entrance has a pool table, and further inside you are greeted by shelves upon shelves of board games and a video game corner (PS3 or Wii, anyone?). Guests can opt for the dining tables by the window or shorter tables with futons and bean bag chairs. The decor is fun and funky - think lava lamps, abstract art and an exposed faux brick wall.  - We hashed out a couple games of Snakes and Ladders (a classic) and Exploding Kittens (new to us and extremely awesome). I was impressed with their board game selection. They have chess, playing cards, all of the classic board games you could hope for (Monopoly, Game of Life, etc.) and some others I have never heard of.  - Beers are $5 each. We enjoyed Steamwhistle and Mill Street Organic. There isn't a huge beer selection - I think 5 different beers tops - but what they did have was decent.  - I think this establishment will do well because it is versatile and can cater to different crowds. They manage to pull off different activities under one roof seamlessly. There were seniors in the corner visiting and sipping on cappuccinos, a younger crowd playing pool at the pool table, and another middle-aged couple playing a board game.  - I noticed that their music was top notch. During the hour-and-a-half we were there, I was rocking out to some classic Elton John and old school, upbeat Enrique Iglesias.  - The staff were really friendly and checked up on us. You can just feel that they are passionate about their business and genuinely want you to have a good time.   THE BAD: - Just a forewarning: the cost to sit and play games is $6/hour. Food and drinks are charged separately. As I mentioned before, we were there for just over an hour-and-a-half, and were charged for a full two hours of gaming ($12). My advice would be to just be mindful of the time when visiting - it's easy to get absorbed in your games and forget how much time has passed.  Overall, I'm thrilled to have a board game café in the neighbourhood and would definitely visit again. It's a nice change from the bar and a good way to get a little friendly competition going. I hope to update this review shortly with my thoughts on the food menu, which includes nachos, crêpes, chicken \"Thai bites\" and more.  EDIT (2.12.16): The owner has graciously clarified below that it's actually $6/person, not $6/hour. This means we can game away to our hearts' content. Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Time Capsule.  Nice to have a place like this close to home.  Could use a larger selection of games but they just opened so I'm sure it'll  grow. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very chill venue. Lots of tables and board games to choose from, video games and a pool table. Only $6/hr for adults. It's not at a crazy busy part of the Danforth, so parking was easy to find.   Food and drinks are reasonably priced, but I didn't have anything to eat or drink.   There was a great variety of board games, several I'd never seen before. Place was clean and the staff were friendly. I'd like to go back!"}
{"text":"The bartender had the audacity to tip himself 25% before I had the chance to choose my tip percentage. He then laughed it off when I called him out for it. I would have tipped him accordingly but it was unacceptable and absurd that he did that. He poured .75 for every shot and charged full price and they ran out of wine."}
{"text":"Our family all met to celebrate my nephews 17th birthday. We wanted to share some nachos and play a few games.  There was something for everyone and it was a clean space with lots to see and do.  We will definitely go to this place again.  The staff person seemed like he was cook, server, bartender and had no time to host and accommodate our small requests.  I will of course go back...great place with fun choices of finger foods, well suited to the theme and focus on games.  Ill be back...soon... time capsule...soon!"}
{"text":"Very similar to Snakes & Lattes, a board game cafe staple within the downtown area.  I went on a Tuesday night, not very busy. As we arrived, another group was finishing up, so we ultimately had the whole place to ourselves for the whole three hours we were there.  The food selection was not much to choose from, but after all it is a cafe.   Their selection of games is much more less than Snakes & Lattes, but if you're looking for a quick motive and don't want to travel all the way downtown, this is a great place."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute MUST for board game aficionados.  They have a varied selection of both the old and new, from Jenga to Settlers, there is no doubt that you will find something to play and enjoy.  They also have a pool/ping pong combo table, foosball and a PS3 and Wii with a number of different titles.  There truly is something for everyone here.  We originally planned to spend a few hours here for a friends BD night, but literally shut the place down.  With a selection $5 beers, wine and mixed drinks you can't go wrong.  The service was exceptional, friendly, professional, yet casual all at the same time.    We actually felt more like we were in a friends place than at an actual licensed establishment.  I should clarify this last statement, a really \"cool\" friends place, a really \"cool\" friend that loves games to be precise.  We had a party of about 10 and every last one of us was incredibly well taken care of throughout the night.  The food was also really good, they have a light menu, but it was all done well.  We had the poutine and the Thai bites, the latter being fried chicken breast tossed in sweet & spicy chili sauce Served with fries & peeled cucumber, which was super unique.  I know that we will be back, in fact I have taken a page from my friends' book and hope to plan my own BD party here, and know that we will have a blast!  The owners Dmitry and Igor, and waitress Jennifer should be commended for their casual professionalism and for creating a space that all can truly enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!!! The service is amazing and the staff is really friendly!! It's an awesome place and its suited for all ages! If you want a night out with your boo to grab a couple drinks and play some games or a family trivia night it's the place to be! Loads of options to choose from; Ping pong, pool, Xbox, PS4,WII, karaoke and a virtual reality game! I went when they had a comedy show and it was hilarious! Played some games and watched some funny comedy! who can go wrong?!! The food is delicious also, I highly recommend getting their nachos, it's a huge platter of nachos layered with lots of cheese and other yummy toppings! Easily feeds 4 people and for only $15!!! They have a variety of drinks as well; bubble tea, milkshakes, smoothies and lots of alcoholic beverages to choose from! Great prices, good food, awesome service and super friendly staff! $6 for an entry fee and you can play for as long as you want! Best board game place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Time Capsule seems to be a less busy, less stocked version of \"snakes n lattes.\" The place has a few selection of games but nothing to write home about. I found them all to be quite older from the board games I'm used to. Originally, I was excited to play with the old school game consoles however it seemed we couldn't get anything to even work. You can forget about anyone helping you either."}
{"text":"A much-needed fun space to liven up the dead of East Toronto. I spent a rainy afternoon here over the long weekend and it was refreshing to see kids and adults alike doing their own thing, having a good time. $6 for adults. $3 for kids. All day!  There's not the largest, but a good selection of popular & classic board games. PS3/Xbox/Wii at the TV station with a variety of party and sport video games. On the side, they have a foosball table, pool table and a pinball machine ($1/play). All in new & working condition.   The seating area is spacious and clean. You can comfortably have a table for four ranging to a party of ten. In fact, they offer booking the entire venue for parties, which would be pretty awesome. They have a licensed bar and a pretty wide selection of party food. During my visit, I had their poutine, onion rings and a milkshake - the food is decent, not bad for passing the time. Table service was prompt in cleaning up our play area. My only critique is that their washrooms can use a good makeover, but other than that the venue is very well done. A cool family-friendly place to hang out at and it's easily accessible. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I gotta say that it's not the food that led me to give this place a 5 starts. The food is a normal pub food but the environment, the servers being extremely nice and the variety of the board games et all made my night with my friends super fun!!! I will come back and I do recommend!"}
{"text":"Good spot. Unlike the expensive place we used to hit downtown the games seem  to have all their pieces. Staff is super nice and food is decent ."}
{"text":"This has a similar feel to \"snakes & lattes\". Very cool vibe. Jitz table, ping pong, couple arcade games, PS4 in the back.   TONS of board games. Bean bags, tables and chairs. $6 game fee each person is good till close. More than enough to play a ton of games.   The food was also pretty good for a bar. Best chicken bits I've ever had.   The cons of my evening: Nachos were a bit over priced and slacking!"}
{"text":"I bring my kid and his friends here. The owners are nice and the kids play while I have a glass of wine and a game of pinball. I wish they had more vegetarian options but perhaps that can change. We always have fun. The washrooms are clean."}
