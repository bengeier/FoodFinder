{"text":"I would leave less then one star if I could.

The place looks like a dump, and the bar tender looked like he should be working at a gay strip club in Apache Junction. 

Not that there is anything wrong with that.

I thought the whole white-trash/shitty service thing was over, but I guess they didn't get the memo.

They don't have change for a dollar either, so don't ask. 
They don't deal in large coins!"}
{"text":"located just around the corner from ASU, mamacita's is the perfect place to grab some cheap beer and cheap eats whether or not you're there to wind down after class or visting in town for the weekend (take a guess why i went...)

came here with the boy and had $2 corona's which is the weekend special. sit at the bar and if you're lucky enough to catch the beer cap that gets hit into the air by the bartenders then a corona is on the house... definitely a funner game the more beers you have in your system, trust me!!

this bar is strictly outdoors and perfect for arizona weather!! stop by when you're in the area and have a $2 corona for me :)"}
{"text":"They may as well have named this joint Dos-Gringos-lite, as it appears they've spent most of the budget on furniture from Sedona Patio and about a nickle on restaurant concept and theme.  Basically, this place is cashing in HUGELY on two things: 1) The mega-cache that Dos left behind in their old digs and 2) Proximity to the Liberal Arts portion of Arizona State U.  

Its not all that bad really, especially if you consider it as the footprint of Dos without all of the merkins polluting the scene, quoting Will Ferrell, and doing body shots off of their pledge brothers.  So, its got that going for them ... and on a early Saturday evening before sunset, it was almost quite pleasurable.  There is an interesting mix of townies mingling with bespectacled post-round golfers, who, in turn were mingling with 'my-very-first-bartending-gig' collegiates. 

The corny 'catch the bottle cap and its free'  theme was actually a new one for me, which is relatively surprising as I'm your typical late-20's barfly.  Food was coastal mexican (nod 'hey' to Dos again) and my fish tacos were pretty fresh, good battering, but rather dry -- and they did not provide something to dip in or squeeze over.  Cholula sauce had to suffice.  My gf got their trio of dips -- guac, queso, and bean dip.  They were all a notch above average, which, as cantina food is a step in the right direction.  I did notice that the two setups of silverware they provided were both 2g1c nasty, so mind them if ya decide to get some grub here.

Overall, there are worse places to end up on a day-drinking crawl so keep this place on the agenda as you drink through Tempe."}
{"text":"This is a great place that is close to everything on the Mill Ave District!  My Girlfriend and I always make sure to stop after going swimming at the ASU campus for the Tuesday and Thursday after 9 U-Call-It's!  The U-Call-It's include EVERYTHING unlike most bars who only do call drinks.  The only exception that I could find is that for Yager Bombers the Redbull is two dollars extra (still cheaper than your average bars bombers!)
It's a beautiful active bar with friendly and fun bartenders!  I work at one of the Radisson's in Phoenix and constantly send people to this bar and have never received a complaint!  This is by far one of the best hidden secret of the Mill District!"}
