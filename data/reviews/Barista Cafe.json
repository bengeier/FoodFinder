{"text":"It was fun. The food wasn't bad. Its a deli. The girls are all super cute. We went on bikini week. ;) It's a guy thing. Or a lesbo thing. All that was missing were the poles. I went in hungry, and left with a boner! Jk, I will definitely be going back. They said they will have beer, wine, and tvs soon."}
{"text":"Snap! Drove by BC yesterday and guess what? It was CLOSED down! Go figure!!!"}
{"text":"I moved right down the street from this place and wanted to try it.  They market themselves as \"healthful\" so i thought this place would be a perfect fit for a regular food stop for me.  Major fail!   From their site: \"There will be no fried food served at Barista Cafe, as the eatery wants to serve their customers healthful, nutritious meals\"  Theres not one \"healthful\" sandwich on this menu. Apparently \"14 pound hot dog with chili loaded how you want it\" or \"Two eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, cheddar cheese, with mayo\" is what they consider healthy... How about Heart Attack Cafe.  I will not be a customer here, ill stick with places that actually are healthy."}
{"text":"The news broadcast on 8/21/12 about the opening of Barista Café created a lot of buzz at work, as the café is located just down the street from our office building.  Always looking for a new place to have lunch a couple of co-workers and I decided to check out Barista Café on Friday and were completely disappointed in the service.....or lack thereof!  As we entered the café we were greeted by a girl sitting on a stool behind the register (no one was in line to pay or order food) she was just sitting there....and that pretty much sums up all the attention we received from the employees the entire time we were in the café.   After picking up a couple of menus by the register and seating ourselves we patiently waited about 10 min before one of my co-workers got up and asked the girl sitting on the stool if she could send a waitress over (she said yes but didn't get off the stool!).  After another 5 minutes went by without any type of acknowledgment from the staff, we decided to leave.  There were at least 6 employees (girls in spandex) in the café.....from the time we walked in to the time we walked out one was sitting on a stool behind the register, one conversating with a table of 4 guys, one trying to wait on two tables (she got confused and delivered food to the wrong table BUT I have to give her credit for being the hardest worker in the place during our visit), and the rest were standing behind the counter looking like lost/scared children.  There are only about 14 tables with seating for either 2 or 4 in the cafe and not every table was occupied so it's not as if the place is huge or that it was really busy at the time of our visit.   With places like The Tilted Kilt, Twin Peaks and El Santo Cantina within walking distance of Barista Cafe the owner needs to get her staff up to par on customer service or hire Gordon Ramsay as chef. There are plenty of places to eat in this area and scantily clad waitresses come a dime a dozen around here so no matter what she looks like or what she's wearing if she can't do her job correctly, on time and with a smile on her face she might as well be wearing a muumuu.    I might give this place another try down the road but for now I'm still upset that they made me waste 20 minutes of my Friday lunch hour !!!"}
{"text":"I think the issue with this place is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. The name would imply a coffee shop. The girls working there: a hooters style coffee shop?! The food, a lunch place. The hours, a pseudo bar. I'm sort of indifferent to the dress of the women but definitely felt strange ordering a \"d cup\". Can't speak for the food, but the coffee was decent."}
{"text":"Barista Cafe??????? Who came up with this idea anyway?  As the name implies, I thought this was a coffe shop. I did not expect to walk in and see half naked girls behind the counter! WHAT IS THIS????????? I am a mother of a 8 year old girl, and I really do care about Scottsdale being a family friendly town. There is no room for such outrageous business here at all. I dont care if your coffee, food, or whatever else is good or not.  Put some clothes on this girls and do business so, all of us can feel comfortable about it. Our town was much better place before you came along!"}
{"text":"Walked in this morning to get some bkfst to go for my wife and kids. Nothing that hasn't been said already.  Looks like the owner opened in August.  My only advice for him/her is to pay careful attention to the reviewers' comments, and adapt to the suggestions on their quality of food/service, interior decor, and figure out what you are trying to be FAST!! Sexy girls have their place, but they do not replace the need for good food, atmosphere, etc.  cuz your monthly revenues are not going to get better.  The girl who served me was nice but the vibe there is kind of like: hey ! Surprised to see scantily clad chicks in a coffee shop?!  Well you should be, since nothing on the exterior of the store suggests lingerie clad chicks (even the logo has a silhouette of a hottie club girl, but that doesn't make it obvious), now enjoy our limited menu, and Abercrombie and Fitch attitude (hint: it only works for them), and pay us too much for a sandwich. Suggestion: guys who go to strip clubs bring more money than they should, spend more than they have, and know EXACTLY what there going in hoping to see/experience... You need to define your mission, audience, value proposition FAST! And sexy girls, no liquor, hoping patrons tip 40% on a $10 bill instead of 20% normal tip just cuz their cute?  Not much payoff for a cute girl to have to wear lingerie to work in a strip mall.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"I agree that maybe this place does not know what it wants to be. I learned about this cafe on 12 news and was excited to try a coffee shop with pretty waitresses. Because I love coffee shops and love pretty waitresses barely clothed. I heard the food was good from the newscasters and there are healthy items, but I was there just for the coffee.  There is something about the decor and the feel of the place that seems out of place. It feels like a subway with cheap tables and green walls instead of yellow. I like starbucks because of the smell and atmosphere. I like a lot of local cafe's because of the comfy furniture and warm feeling inside. Same with the Tilted Kilt..nice women in a nice atmosphere. Barista did not have that. Sorry, but pretty women is not enough to make someone switch from their favorite coffee place. Eventhough my mocha was very good. It was 5:30 in the evening and probably should have been busier...I was the only one there. I got good service! I got a nice look at a nice girl's flat tummy! Now just repaint the walls and hire a better interior decorator and you might get people to stay."}
{"text":"It is what you think it is, cute girls with bad food. I had a fruit smoothie and breakfast burrito. The smoothie was a mix and not made with real fruit, all sugar, not as healthy as I was hoping for. The burrito, while big in size, tastes like a microwave burrito and the eggs are watery. My recommendation is stop in for a coffee and a view, but pass on the food!"}
