{"text":"I'm a sucker for top-notch pizza. By top-notch, I mean pizza that is served sizzling and fresh and made with high-quality ingredients. Pizza like that is true craftsmanship; pizza like that I could eat every day. In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.

Lil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.

When I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.

Lil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.

And the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.

Lil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.

Lil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.

The dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.

I head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza. Lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!"}
{"text":"A cosy restaurant with great atmosphere. Unfortunately, the meal and the service fell short of expectations. 

We ordered the Roasted Beet salad- to find it came with a pile of arugula and four beet slices. Upon inquiry, the chef said that while the salad was called \"Roasted Beets\", it didn't mean that the salad would come with all roasted beets. Great for a comedy hour, but surprisingly bad laughs for a $9 salad. 

The rest of the meal was good, but did not measure up to the almost $200 bill (for two entrees, three aps and a liter of house wine)."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch and found an overpriced, unpleasant atmosphere staffed by mostly disinterested loud servers.  Perhaps it is better during brunch hours but for lunch it was pretty bad.  There are quite a few options in the same strip so pick another spot."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment tonight. To think that I referred a friend to this place when she asked for Leslieville resto spot to take some friends this weekend. The food continues to meet expectations but the service was sub-standard. Why people? You were doing so well, what happened? Sigh. Won't be back for a looooooong time."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had the pleasure of eating at Lil Baci for brunch and could not have been happier with the food and in particular the service.

I had the truffled eggs and they were absolutely heavenly!! I would HIGHLY recommend them!!

I have to say I am very surprised at the negative reviews I have read about the food and service at Lil Baci on Yelp and in particular a recent review indicating that the manager was rude and bossy to staff and phony to patrons. Perhaps the manager or possibly the yelp reviewer, were having a bad day but our experience was completely the opposite. My husband and I are new to the Leslieville area and have been searching for great restaurants that can accommodate our needs for the last couple of months. My husband has a serious food allergy that unfortunately makes us extremely nervous when we choose to dine out. We choose to play it safe and always call new restaurants to establish a comfort level and ensure they can accommodate his needs. I called Lil Baci prior to coming in for brunch and was immediately directed to the manager. She was a very friendly, knowledgeable woman who really took the time to listen to me even though the restaurant was busy. She assured me Lil Baci could accommodate my husband's allergies asked our names and said she looked forward to meeting us. We arrived at the restaurant about an hour later.  After a short wait we were greeted by a woman who turned out to be the manager. When we introduced ourselves, she seated us and really took the time to go over the menu and ensure that we were comfortable with our order. We could not have been happier with the personal touch we received from the manager. She ensured that we will be back! 

The food was fantastic and we couldn't have been happier! We haven't been there for dinner yet but we are definitely looking forward to checking it out and we will definitely be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Found this gem during early Fall of 2014 and have visited this restaurant once a month since. I prefer visiting this location during patio season.

The service and food has always been great and consistent. The pizzas are fairly large and great to share between two people in addition to their pastas/apps."}
{"text":"This is a review for brunch at Lil'Baci. I've had a regular pizza meal on their patio before and it was a better experience than brunch.

To start, we had an awful experience just sitting down at the restaurant. When we arrived, no one acknowledged us for a few minutes. So we stood waiting for a table. While standing there, another couple came in and immediately sat down at the last window table by the front. I was SHOCKED! Do people really just walk in and sit down? Especially when someone is obviously ahead of them and waiting? Were we wrong to wait to be seated?

The server saw what happened, came over and said \"Oh no! I was just going to seat you there\" and then looked stunned and unsure what to do next. Luckily, there was another table at the back of the restaurant, so we sat there. 

Fine, OK, one incident due to a rude customer, which is not the restaurant's fault.
But the service IS the restaurant's fault. We waited over 20 minutes for coffee. Our water glasses sat empty until my SO eventually got up to signal for some. They weren't THAT busy, and at least someone could have checked on us. We felt ignored.

Food: I ordered the most breakfast-like pizza, with pancetta, arugula and a fried egg. The egg was over cooked, so it didn't have the anticipated \"gooey\" factor I was thinking would happen with a full egg on the pizza. My SO ordered the truffled scrambled eggs: nice that they were so generous with the truffle oil, but as you can guess, it was too much of a good thing. All you could taste was overpowering truffle. He didn't finish his meal.

Underwhelming food experience combined with an awful long wait and servers who pretty much ignored us: I'll eat somewhere else for brunch next time."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for brunch here but was not overly impressed. The 3 of us ordered eggs bene and had to order a side of hollandaise to share because there was hardly any on our meals. I found the side salad to be dry and bitter. The eggs were also served with roast potatoes that were really delicious (they were the highlight for me along with my latte).

Also on the plus side, the service was efficient and friendly and I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is decent only if you want a quick snack for over $30. Portions are so small, that i was looking for a restaurant after we finished our whole meal. I was starving. For the size you get, you also pay double that of any other place. For 2 entrees and 2 drinks and a shot of whiskey it was $100. I will not be returning. I pay to eat, not to snack. For the record, my spaghetti pomodoro did taste good."}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed this place. Lets break it down:
ATMOSPHERE:
Really adorable joint. Reminds me of Europe it its quaintness factor. Small tables, cute bar. I loved it.
SERVICE:
Good service....as we sat and ate we watched them accommodate lots of families with big strollers. I thought that was top notch of them. The service was casual, but we never felt ignored at all.
FOOD:
Aha! The reason we're all here. The food was awesome. We started with the grande misto which is basically meat, olives, cheese and tomatoes. So GOOD! I really enjoy this type of starter. Simple, salty, satisfying.
My husband had the MARCO pizza which was an adventure for our palates. With an Italian cream sauce base and toppings that kept your tongue guessing and a lovely crisp crust....how can we complain.
I had the gnocchi which you could tell was homemade. It melted in your mouth. My portion was a bit small which was my only complaint but thats ok, I had some of his pizza to make up for it ;)
Finally we had dessert. The lemon shortcake was cute and tart and the deconstructed napoleon (which I thought was gonna be a snorefest) was really yummy!

I would totally come back here. Loved it."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for Sunday Brunch. 

Walking along Queen Street this past weekend, my date and I decided to pick a brunch place as we went. The crowd outside Lady Marmalade was as insanely long as usual, which we stopped to look at - although had no intention of getting in. While pondering who waits that long for breakfast, I noticed that Lil' Baci had people inside, no line, open tables and a delicious looking brunch menu. 

Seated immediately, we ordered a french press to share - which yielded delicious rich coffee. The servers were prompt and brought us our coffee quickly and were back for our orders despite our delinquency several times at getting our orders in. 

I had trouble deciding between the french toast served with lemon ricotta and rosemary strawberries and the marscapone pancakes. I had pancakes, which were served with a side of blueberry compote, maple syrup and some delicious rosemary new potatoes on the side. The pancakes were truly Delicious - fluffy and flavourful and they absorbed the syrup in a good way (evenly and not too much). My date had there \"Benedetto\" which was eggs benedict of sorts, served on top of a crispy polenta with a salad and potatoes as a side. I don't eat eggs, so I couldn't try it - but he assured me it was rather delicious. Prices were reasonable with most items between $11-14. 

The crowd was varied - from a family with toddlers, to a large group of women having a baby shower, to young couples to older groups of friends. Lines formed at times, but in general people didn't seem to have to wait too long to get a table. I'd definitely recommend skipping the line a few doors down and give here a try. I'll be going back to try the french toast."}
{"text":"Get ready to give your dollars a big kiss goodbye at Lil' Baci. A few friends and I were seduced by the sexy look of this place - the high ceilings, the art on the walls, the mirrors, the nice bar up front. But as the saying goes beauty is only skin deep and you can't eat a table or chair. We started with the duck meatballs and the house salad. The meatballs were good and worked well with the cream sauce, but the salad was only meh. For me, the best part of the meal was the rustic bread that was served. 

The pizza however was a total train wreck. I ordered the fungi pizza and at $18 a pop I expected it to laden with all sorts of delicious mushrooms. Unfortunately it was a massive let down. I wouldn't even call it a pizza. The cremini mushrooms were soggy and lacked any real substance or flavour, and didn't work well with the tangy taleggio cheese or truffle oil. The pizza crust however was the real monstrosity. I wouldn't even honour it by calling it pizza. It was more like a puffed up pita. Totally lacking any texture, density or taste that you would expect from a normal pizza. It actually reminded me of the puffy pita bread they serve you at Paramount, which works well with Middle Eastern food, but not so much with Italian. I could barely choke it all down.

My friends were happy with their pasta and pizza dishes, but they're the type who are happy with pretty much anything put before them. They were kind enough to treat me to dinner, but I felt bad that they had to shell out $109 before taxes for pig slop."}
{"text":"Poorly trained server who didn't know the menu. Based our order on the information provided by the server which was incorrect. She didn't bother to apologize and my guess is that she  didn't even notice she made a mistake. The combination of food ordered made the meal rather unappealing. Seated at a table that was wobbly at first. We fiddled with the table trying to fix it. Our server was nearby but didn't provide any assistance. We moved to the next table which had a door open with an unpleasant view of a ratty basement. Overall poor experience."}
{"text":"I was here recently and I am changing my review.

Only good thing about our lunch was the weather on the patio.

The patio was busy, not surprising for a nice day. It took over 40 minutes before we had our orders. One special and a pizza. Other tables had been seated, served, ate and left in that amount of time. 

The food was lacking in flavour. The tomato sauce looked homemade but tasted straight out of the can. At least they didn't over cook the noodles."}
{"text":"Having ventured out for quiet meal.... I stumbled (sober) on this little hot spot.    

The Friendliest and genuinely nicest of welcomes had me relaxed in seconds.  

Sir Matthew shared menu options and got me settled in for a delightful dining experience.  (Pizza and salad and a raspberry wheat beer).  

Exactly what I needed this eve !"}
{"text":"I'd recommend going to Lil Baci for brunch over dinner any day. Their brunch menu is quite delicious, with old favourites like bennys, skillet dishes packed with flavour and some pasta fairings if you're so inclined. 

I had the eggplant skillet and it was loaded with sauce, cheese and eggplant deliciousness, served with toast for dipping up all that sauce and salad. Truly a great fill. And our server was fantastic even though she was slammed at their busy brunch hour.

Dinner was another story. We arrived around 8:30pm and there were several other tables around, but the staff seemed to be in a hurry to move us along and were more focused on closing duties than customer service.

Our waiter actually left to have a meal during our dinner, forgot to order one of our dishes, to which we flagged down the other waitress to correct the error - nothing like being the only one without an app at the table!

My zucchini soup was a good consistency, but lacked salt IMO. And the gnocchi pomodoro were fluffy, but the sauce was very bland and the dish was under seasoned. I had to flag down the waiter again, as there was zero attention given from the staff, and add some extras to doctor the gnocchi up so I could finally enjoy it. 

When my friend's app came - the mushroom crostini - it was so underwhelming. A piece of toast with a few mushrooms slapped on top. Zero finesse on that plate. Her second glass of wine that was ordered with her main dish was also missed by the staff, who were busy chatting at the bar and prepping to close.

I was offered a free dessert, which I took them up on, as it was a nice gesture. The broken Napoleon was ok - the fruit tasted more like jam, but I am a sucker for marscapone so I ate it up.

I'll be sticking to brunch here when I re-visit."}
{"text":"Found this place when Lady Marmalade had endless waiting time. Didn't regret the decision at all! Lil' Baci has it all for a sunny and casual Sunday brunch! Good coffee and very well cooked eggs! I've had their truffled scrambled eggs and my boyfriend had the baked mushroom eggs. Both were delicious in their own ways. Potatoes were ok. 

We didn't have to wait to be seated unlike other hot brunch spots. The service was nice. The atmosphere was cool and hip. Did I mention their cute little patio at the back?? I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious. This is an ol' standby for me whenever I just want some nicely done pasta and little vino."}
{"text":"I ate at Lil Baci for the first time last night.  I've eaten at there new joint on Yonge and Davisville and it was amazing.  Probably some of the best and most honest Italian food in Toronto.  On to Queen street.  Its a true pizzeria.  Rustic cool vibe, def' hipster central.  The food was great.  I had the fish stew, and my friends had spinach tagietelle with walnut sauce.  All perfect dishes.  We shared the crostino platter on there home made bread -- seriously the bread is so good, I'm blown away they are not up there as a world class bakery.  You will not find better italian bread.  If you haven't gone check it out the place is great.  be prepared to wait, and it is rammed packed, which we found pretty great, it had that New York vibe."}
{"text":"Lil' Baci was the destination choice of the evening when my sister could not stop singing such admiral praises of delight and amazement, of this diamond in the rough she had discovered. Frequented the establishment many times, she was pleasantly greeted by first name by the host, owner, and a number of servers.

We were seated quickly, upon which I was informed that our number one priority was to order our dessert, the cupcakes that were purchased from an external vendor, and extremely popular. My sis inquired immediately which varieties remained available, and quickly insisted to have two of her favorites put aside for us.

My sister couldn't decide on pizza or pasta, which she had had before and described both as amazing and remarkable. Since she couldn't decide, she chose both, this way she was sure not to be disappointed.

I myself, was stuck between a rock and a hard place, being lactose-intolerant and in an Italian restaurant. I chose the lemon gnocchi. It was ok, prepared well, but I sure did miss the tomato flavor and of course the cheese! I don't recommend this dish.

My sister ate all her pasta, I tried some and it was delish! And she ate half her pizza. But the grand finale was the cupcakes which were the most delicate and exquisite cupcakes I have ever tasted/no--experienced! Definately an experience!

The staff was friendly and helpful and courteous. The atmosphere was a cute quaint Italian cafe. It was very comfortable and non-intimidating.

I will definately return."}
{"text":"DH and I have been here twice now and plan to make it a regular event.  Finding a hip place in the neighbourhood that serves great food, has great service and isn't too stuck up to give all that to a couple with an infant is difficult, but L'il Baci YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened. I've never ordered anything but truffled eggs because they are so good I just can't deviate. I moved recently north but still come down to enjoy a breakfast. Today I brought my hard to please parents for brunch. All three of us ordered truffled eggs and we loved it."}
{"text":"Went for sunday brunch time.  Good food, nice patio, reasonably priced. 3.5 star. 

Waitress was a little rude, food was a tad too salty."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not very good. 
I used to eat here frequently and when I went back, it was way overpriced and to be honest, I can make better pasta at home.

I won't return."}
{"text":"My 24 year old niece was in town visiting so we wandered around the 'hood looking for a vegetarian option for her.   Lots of hamburgers, not a lot of veggies.   After reading a few menus on windows, we decided Lil' Baci looked warm and inviting and went in.

I'm so glad we did.   The food was tasty - I had pizza, she had spaghetti - and the atmosphere was just as it had looked - warm, inviting, cozy, fun.    It got a bit loud at the end of our dinner (around 9 pm) but I like loud.   It allows you to have intimate conversations about sex and breakups and boys and worries without the certainty that the quiet couple next to you is listening to every word.  

And yah, at the beginning of the night there were a lot of families with small children but there wasn't any shreaking or screaming or loud parent admonishments.  Instead, it seemed communal and lovely.

I've read a couple of reviews about the 'too friendly' service and I have to disagree.  Our server - Justin - helped make the night a great one for us by being engaging, flirty and fun.   If women can put on 'the shine' and spread compliments like hot butter on breakfast toast for tips, why not men?   Bring it on, Justin.  

Altogether, a great way to spend the night in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"As a parent, I can't say enough about how great this place was. We had plans to eat there in a large group for a celebration when I realized my 6 year old couldn't really eat anything on the menu due to gluten intolerance. I asked an extremely unorthodox favor - if I brought a box of GF pasta would they cook it for him? Sure enough, they accommodated us (they said it couldn't have been done at rush times but we were there for a very, very early dinner). Anyway, the food was superb, the staff were lovely, the kids (and adults) had a wonderful, memorable evening on their fabulous patio."}
{"text":"I'd say 3 stars in the winter months, and 4 stars during patio season (they have a large back deck with awnings that is quite green and nice for al fresco dining, when weather permits).

The food is casual/rustica Italian and the menu is good for sharing and sampling different things.  Most of it is very good, with the occasional miss.  The menu features a lot of specials which I rather like as it keeps things interesting/varied if you're a regular.  

The service is helpful and friendly.  It's an intimate space that is warm and dimly lit.  The prices are mid-range and very reasonable for the quality.   Overall it's a good meal!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian! I loved this place. Be warned on a hot and humid day is like sitting in a sauna. But a sauna that serves delicious fresh food and wine.... So it's all good. 

For starters we shared the Platter. Meat cheese olive and a bit of bread. Tasty but over priced. We also had the olives.... Covered in oil rosemary and orange they were great. We had the crostini. The goat ragu was one of the nicest things I've ever had. Also highly rate the blue cheese and walnut one. Mmmm. 

For mains I had the meatballs over polenta with a side of cauliflower. It was flavorful and creamy. The meatballs were succulent and well done. I tried  the pasta with peas and sausage. It was bursting with flavour and a generous portion. The sausage pizza was also tasty but nothing to write home to your mother about. 

All topped off with San pellegrino and a bottle of Nero. 52$ each. Not a bad price. I would recommend and will likely return. Maybe when it is a bit Cooler out. Service was friendly. Not particularly special. Enjoyable overall and well priced.would be a nice date place, pretty small and cosy dining area."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner.Everything we ordered was delicious! The Butternut squash gnocchi was probably my favourite dish of the evening though. The pizzas were simple but tasty. Nice ambiance - not too fancy but not too casual :)"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch.
Interesting and tasty selections, great coffee and excellent service."}
{"text":"I take this place for what it is: a casual restaurant I can rely on for week nights when I don't want to blow the budget  but still want quality ingredients and great food!  Have been here three times, the first time on the recommendation of a friend.  Each time, I order the Gorgonzola-Potato white pizza and every time I order it I am blown away! Recently had their Burrata Beet salad... Great quality cheese and the beets were a surprisingly delicious addition.  Have had a few of their salads and crostini specials...for drinks, I have opted for the house red, which is very light, \"drinkable\" ."}
{"text":"A good brunch and a pleasant dining experience with solid service. The ambience was nice, and I was surprised to see the number of children and larger groups coming in for brunch."}
{"text":"All hype and no homestyle.

Nice atmosphere but hectic and loud when crowded.  Good service, nice staff.

It's the food that sent my review plummeting.  The pizza is just ok.  I find the crust has an unpleasant bitter aftertaste but the toppings are decently apportioned.

The pasta is pretty terrible.  For instance, a dish of rigatoni with pork belly and tomate... Was shocked.  Don't charge me $16 at lunch for pasta out of the box.  And if the pasta on top of the plate is almost too al dente and that at the bottom is pablum-soft, that dish has been sitting in the window for WAY too long; should have been re-fired.  The pork belly was quite tough(!!) and tasteless.  

Head chef is not paying enough attention and kitchen staff are not doing a good job."}
{"text":"Came for the brunch. To say it was awesome, is an understatement. The service was great. I had the pizza which might be one of the best I've had. The girlfriend had eggs Florentine, and did nothing but raved about it. This is going to be one of our mainstay's now. Good job!"}
{"text":"Just finished a brunch. We only came here because the line at the place we were hoping to go was too long and this place was next door. 

Good coffee, good Caesars. The food however was a big disappointment. My mushroom baked eggs LOOKED great, but was so horribly over cooked that my egg yolks turned to powder. There was also barely any spinach or goat cheese. The potatoes were under seasoned and over cooked, and the toast wasn't buttered (which would have been ok if my yolks had been runny).

 Furthermore, the table beside us who ordered 10 minutes after us received their food at the same time as we did. Their eggs were runny, meaning the chefs let ours overcook in the oven just so all the plates could be served together. 

Two Caesars,  two coffees and two brunch meals cost us over $60. I would have been fine with that.... if the food had been worth eating. 

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Manager: \"If a customer orders a dish which we have run out of, let them order it anyway. Let them finish their bottle of wine on an empty stomach. Wait until they call you over and ask where their food is before informing them that they have run out of it. They will be drunk enough to not mind the fact that an hour has passed waiting for a salad. Don't offer any apology, just let the chef do it, he will probably give them a free desert in embarrassment. That way you get a bad tip, and the restaurant loses money.\"

Server: \"I love smiling\""}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I really want to enjoy but always disappoints.  It is literally a 2 minute walk from my house so I have gone 3 times even though I cannot say Ive enjoyed my meal once.  The pasta is always bland and the pizza is mearly mediocre.  It has a cool look and the servers are nice but they just cant seem to get their food together.  Ive heard they opened a back patio so Ill probably give it one more chance but Im not going in with high hopes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the food was excellent.  The service was good, though a little familiar if you get my meaning.  Most would like this, I didn't really, but if that's the worst thing you can say.  The crustini is very good.  Pricey for a small plate but quite good.  Had the special braised rabbit gnocchi last time and was excellent.  Great little Leslieville spot!"}
{"text":"Tonight we really enjoy our dinner at Lil Baci. The service was great / personalized and the food was quite tasty / fresh. The choices on the menu are limited (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza and specials) but you have something for everybody (meat or veggie lover). We sat on the terrace, the weather was great, and it was charming ... it's true that it was not too busy. We will come back."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot. We tried the Eggs Benettito, Baked Manzanata and Classic Baci balls. All eggs we perfectly poached and came with a generous portion of fresh greens and potatoes. Bottomless coffees were smooth full flavour blend. Great ambiance with music that was just loud enough to muffle others but we didn't have to shout at our table. We'll be back for sure.

{"text":"Amazing food every time. 

Whether you are going to brunch, lunch or dinner Lil Baci never disappoints. Always amazing food, great service and reasonable prices. This is our go-to place whenever we want a great meal."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. This place has a really nice atmosphere, great service and lots of choices on the brunch menu. I am giving it a 5 star to boost up their rating from a 3.5 star to a 4 because I think that's more true to the rating of this restaurant, for brunch at least."}
{"text":"Weak.

Food is pricey and below average. Service is fair. Overall value is poor. You're significantly better off at Libretto on the Danforth than Lil'Baci. In short, I won't be returning.

We had heard this place was kid friendly, but had to prompt our waiter to tell us what was on the kids menu. There was the usual 2 options - pizza and pasta, but unlike Libretto, a drink or dessert was not included. Despite the lack of options, the food took quite some time to arrive and during that time our water wasn't refilled. Certainly not the worst service I've had, but nothing to write home about either.

As for the adult food, we had the kale gnocchi - which was pretty good, but poor for a $20 portion. We also had the shaved brussel sprout salad, and it too was okay. 

Overall, a solid 'meh' on food and 'below average' on value. This is NOT a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews, I was excited to visit Lil' Baci for brunch this past Sunday. My friend and I got there around 11ish. Sat by the window and were happy with how cute the place was. The server was wonderful and the banter was great.

We both ordered the special: frittata with potatoes and a side of salad. Food took awhile but we were enjoying the coffee, conversation, and view of the street. When the food finally arrived, potatoes were cold and the frittata was luke warm and sitting in oil. Truly disappointed. The server was kind enough to try his best to do what he could to make up for things. 

After a reheat, the meal was still, so sorry to say this but, terrible.  
My friend then ordered the toast and Nutella; I had toast with honey. My toast arrived tiny, burnt and cold. I was so hungry I ate it.

With such great past reviews, I would go back but never again for brunch. I'd be willing to consider lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Decent food and friendly service, but way too slow.  We were without water or coffee for most of the meal. Award in the window said best family dining, so we chose lil'Baci out of the strip of popular brunch spots. Kids food came almost ten minutes after adult meals which meant ours were cold before we got to start. Also no kids menu or sides seems unacceptable in a family neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Lil' Baci was a lil bad. We ordered Lil Baci balls and eggs:
- Lamb 
- Turducken 

Lamb had a pesto thing going on and it tasted really bad. The combination was not good and I LOVE pesto. Turducken was a bit better, but not by much. The eggs had no seasoning what so ever, super bland.

Potatoes were ok, bread was hard. I was very disappointed with our meal. Would not return.

Patio is gorgeous and that was it."}
{"text":"Its a nice place. Loved their Truffled Eggs.
I would have loved to try other things on their menu but almost everything has pork, and I cant eat pork. They don't have the option to substitute pork with something else. so my options were limited."}
{"text":"I want to rate this place higher but I just can't. I love the atmosphere and this place is exactly what the area needed. However, if they just added a few more basic really good pasta selections that are not specials of the day and a really good caesar salad i'd give them 5 stars. I am a huge Terroni's fan and am hoping the place can offer a few basic items similar to the Terroni menu. I would really like to see this place succeed as I was so bummed when Kubo closed (same owner)."}
{"text":"We went to Lil' Baci tonight for dinner. There were four of us and we started by sharing the meat and cheese platter followed by two pizzas and two pasta dishes - overall we left happy and satisfied. Would recommend to others! Classic pizzas, homemade pasta in a comfortable casual setting"}
{"text":"Great patio. 
Pizza is good. 
Beet goat cheese and arugula salad is da bomb."}
{"text":"The service was terribly slow this morning. I'd expect a place like this to expect a Sunday brunch rush and prepare. The food was nothing to write home about. I was hungry and it got the job done. The presentation is nicer than the flavours."}
{"text":"Great food.  The pizzas are a perfect size, and tasty too.  The hidden patio out back is a nice little getaway."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful staff. I brought my 2.5 yr old and 16 month old for dinner and the staff were very helpful, food came quickly and the pizza was delicious. My only negative was that the gnocchi was a little bland. I'd definitely go back as a family."}
{"text":"I went here with a big-ish group, including three kids under the age of 7, and they were mostly accommodating. The food is tasty and prepared with fresh ingredients. The wine list is interesting and really well priced.

Just a small rant: what is so difficult about separating bills? Why is this request always greeted as though I had asked the server if they wanted to help me move a piano? Luckily a different server intervened and our request was granted."}
{"text":"Terroni of the east, but without the wait time. Great pizzas, ambiance and staff. Even some excellent craft beers."}
{"text":"Met up with friends here as a last minute alternative since we couldn't get reservations for a saturday evening anywhere in the city.  I am so glad my friend suggested this place - we loved it. It wasn't too difficult to get a table and the waitstaff was super attentive. My SO and I split the gnocchi and the fiama pizza. LOVED the pizza and the gnocchi was pretty good too. The dessert we had was dark chocolate mousse that was fantastic, whipped and airy. Great wine list as well - loved the reisling. 
Great food - great service. Just wish they had a few more pasta dishes but I am also a firm believer that if you do something well you don't need to do everything.And they do make great pizzas. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I like Lil Baci, it is great for a quick lunch or evening pizza. A bit expensive but the quality is high. I guess you get what you pay for. Not the best pizza but good food over all."}
{"text":"Amazing food for brunch, lunch and dinner. Pizza are wonderful and favourite brunch order is the mushroom and goat cheese baked eggs. Truffled scrambled eggs on toast are also incredible. This is a regular weekend brunch go-to place that never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love lil' baci. Like others have said, service is a little inconsistent, but the food more than makes up for the service. 
We've been for brunch numerous times and usually get the baked eggs with the eggplant. They bake the eggs in the same wonderful sauce that comes on the pizza. 
We've had tuna sandwiches at lunch which were awesome on that amazing crusty bread. 
Funny, the only thing I wasnt crazy about was the pizza. I guess I'm a Libretto pizza person."}
{"text":"Lil Baci is a great spot. The food has always been good, as is the wine. I've never had an issue with service, always friendly and attentive. The meatballs are a great pick, although at something around $18 I'm a little miffed, but heck you're getting some great atmosphere so I'll live with it. The pizzas are awesome too. Worth a look!"}
{"text":"Cute patio and good variety on the menu.  Service was prompt and friendly.

I had the pizza which was delicious and filling (thin crust, fresh, unique ingredients).  

My date had gnocchi ... As noted by several other reviewers, I'd avoid the pasta at all costs.  The portion was tiny and not nearly worth the $18 price tag.  If you're hankering for pasta, you're WAY better off going to Gerrard spaghetti and Pizza House or Libretto."}
{"text":"I've lived in this hood for many years, had dinner which was tasty but came for brunch this morning and it was fabulous!! The truffle scramble with cremini mushrooms was incredible. The baked eggs with sausage, tomatoes and smoked provolone was so good, the tomatoes in this dish exploded flavours! Both plates scraped clean! 

Sadly, this restaurant is rebranding... Same ownership but different concept and menu.

All I ask is please keep these two dishes for the new menu!! So good, I want to come back for these dishes!!"}
{"text":"This place has a solid brunch that I really enjoyed. I had a cocktail that was a lemonade-type sparkling drink and it was refreshing. I had the truffled scrambled eggs on toast and they were to die for. I was extremely happy about my selection and pleasantly surprised by this place. My friend enjoyed her meal as well and she had the baked eggs. 

Overall, I think that the food here is quality. The service was a bit slow but nothing I couldn't cope with. The drinks were good. They didn't rush us out. An overal pleasant experience. Way better than waiting in line for 10 years next door."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been three times now and very good every time. They have two locations (Queen East and near Yonge/Davisville). Pasta is homemade and everything is always super fresh. The service has always been friendly and the prices are very reasonable for what you are getting and relative to other restaurants. They are also kid friendly and have high-chairs. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today. Eggs Benny was pretty good. But it was on rye bread which was impossible to cut. Potatoes were days old and re-grilled. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said they were fresh. There's no way. I know what fresh potatos taste like as I cook and am a human, and these were definitely reheated. Another weird thing: the whole meal was served on a salad plate. There was no room to cut or move anything, or put down your cutlery on the plate. Things kept falling off the plate. And just to be clear, it wasn't just that there was a lot of food, we measured the plates. 

This was a very weird place with all these things. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had fun today at this cute little place in Leslieville neighbourhood.

The atmosphere is very hectic and fun, lots of people having conversations and the music is fun.

It was packed but they found us a spot right away and the beverages came fast enough and we order also pretty quickly.

I had the Eggs Florentine and my friend Eggs Benedicts. Both portion came quite fast and they were big enough to satisfy a brunch meal starvation.

The home potatoes were delicious and so was the salad.
The Eggs really were amazing, their sauce was to die for and I also ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice which was great!

The price also is good and the people working there are really nice and friendly.

Cappuccinos were good for a restaurant, I had another one later in a coffee place nearby and it was not as good as this one.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"One pizza, one plain child's size pizza, one calamari and no drinks $85. 'nuff said. Place looks nice enough, decent patio, not a lot of variety on menu. For pizza quality Queen Margherita a few blocks east blows this place away. For trendy casual hipster Descendants Detroit Pizza even closer is a better option."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch!!! There is one brunch item with an amazing mushroom tapenade on toast topped with eggs. To die for!!"}
{"text":"This is close to home and never disappoints. we share a pizza and salad and leave with a smile evey time. last time we where there we had a lovely snapper. There specials go fast so get your order in quick if you plan on having one of the specials. For me it's still one of the best spots in the hood that doesn't offer pub fair."}
{"text":"This is a brunch review. 

Stumbled upon Lil Baci. We happened to be in Leslieville trying to snag a table at Lady Marmalade...unfortunately for us, the line up was out the door and we were not in the mood to wait in the cold. Our closest option was lil baci. Neither of us had been so we decided to be adventurous and try a new spot.  

I ordered an espresso, paper plane, and buttered brioche. My wife ordered the french toast, coffee and raspberry lemonade mimosa. The waiter said they were out of the buttered brioche. After asking what vegetarian options, I was directed to the margherita pizza, mushroom pizza or eggplant sandwich....not the best options for brunch but who can turn down a pizza, right?!?

The service was good. The staff was attentive and checked in frequently. 

When our meal arrived, they both looked great. I just asked my wife what she thought about her french toast, she described it as \"the compote and fresh cream sweetened things up, but, the french toast lacked some more traditional flavors you'd expect (cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla...). As far as the mimosa, it tasted like mostly proseco with not much raspeberry lemonade.\" 

Now for my meal, I can't complain about the mushroom pizza. As I mentioned, I originally ordered the buttered brioche but when this was not available was directed to two pizza options and a sandwich. The server suggested the funghi was a little different. The crust was really crispy and it did taste good, but, more of a consolation choice for a vegetarian eating breakfast. I'd suggest another option for vegetarians....the paper plane was delicious. 

Ok meal for the sake of filling up....likely wouldn't return as it is not very vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying that Lil' Baci was not our first choice for brunch when we came here. We had initially planned to go to Lady Marmalade but the lines were horrendous and we were starving. This is how mistakes happen and unfortunately Lil' Baci was one such mistake.

First, the positives. Cool decor and a lovely patio. Definitely a fun spot for drinks on a warm sunny day. The turducken that I ordered (chicken/duck//turkey meatballs) was pretty good. Bread was delicious.

That's about it though, everything else was bland to terrible. The salad was just a few pieces of dry arugula and lettuce, no dressing or even oil and vinegar. Potatoes were more oil than starch. The eggs were flavorless - I may as well have been eating flour. My wife got the lamb meatballs, which were frankly, awful. The meat was rubbery and for some reason slathered in a vile pesto sauce. Just...not good. I ordered a raspberry lemonade, which was more like a glass of water with sugar mixed in. 

Just a very disappointing experience overall, not to mention expensive for the quality of food you get. Should've just waited 2 hours for Lady Marmalade."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the neighbourhood....they should really take a hard look at their limited choice of beers but the wine list is acceptable and food is consistently good!..."}
{"text":"Made a comment about not wanting gnocchi because it's too heavy, they recommend some sort of pasta log that was as dry, flavorless, dense and as close to inedible that I could imagine.  No sauce, just a few brussel sprout leaves???  One of the worst dishes I've ever paid for.  20$ at that."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. The website said they had Spelt Crust available for an extra charge on their pizza's. It took me almost an hour to look for a restuarant that is tasty fits with my diet restrictions.   We specially picked this one because of the spelt option. When we got there, it wasn't on the menu, and the guy tells me , sorry the website needs to be changed. 
What kind of crap is this?

Also, the service was terrible. We were in the beautiful patio at the back, but only one server, he rarely came to the back. I had to go get him a few times. We were there for 20 mins with the menu without ordering.

The food was quite good. $10 for lunch, soup/salad + pizza/panini good portions and quite tasty. I had to settle for a wheat crust pizza. I am not allergic, but I really wanted to not have wheat today. 
We would have gone somewhere else. 

I would like to come back to try their paninis."}
{"text":"We love brunch at lil Baci, i usually go for the eggs tomato in a skillet! so so good and tasty! They have friendly service and a comfortable atmosphere! Dont be afraid to head in there back patio, its a nice hidden spot!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this cute little place! It's small but AH-mazing! The service was great and the food (especially the pizza) was as true to Italian food as it gets. My girlfriend and I walked in for the first time without a reservation and our initial impression was 'Swiss Chalet family fun times' on a Sunday afternoon. Each table had at least one child eating some sort of finger food. It was cute but not what I expected to see. It smelt so good in there, we waited 20 mins for a table anyway. Note: If you don't typically like children at restaurants, don't go before 8:00pm on a Friday. Once the kiddies left, the lights were dimmed, candles were lit on the table and it was THE perfect atmosphere for a Friday night out. FOOD: Let me start off by saying they make their own bread there which is given upon seating with some olive oil and vinegar - OMG!! I can't even begin to tell you how fresh, crispy and divine this bread is. We shared a calamari salad to start which was alright. I'd probably never order it again. It was slightly tasteless and over salted. The pizza is a must! My person favorite was the Nonno! Overall, a quaint little place, fantastic food + service with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot because I got too hungry waiting in line as Lady Maramalade.  I had the Lil Baci Hero - Lamb. Lots of salad came with it. The burger meat (lamb) was flavourful and delicious but the bun became a bit much and I just ate the meat. The prices were okay, not a lot of items on the menu appealed to me but the service was friendly and we were seated quickly."}
{"text":"Until recently I had never tried truffle oil - or anything made with it. And I can now say it is officially amazing - and what is even more amazing is that Lil Baci which I accidentally stumbled upon had several brunch dishes made with truffle oil. It is OMG amazingness. I know, I have now said amazing 3 times...but really that's how wonderful this little brunch gem is!!! I was actually intending on going to Lady Marmalade's next door but the line was way too long and I was suddenly caught in a snow/rain storm on my way there pushing me into Lil Baci's. 

It was one of those happy accidents! Though, totally meant to be cause I have been searching high and low for a Brunch place that caters to foodie's!

Thankfully, I was able to sample a bit of everything when I was there - living my own 'Top Chef' experience...usually it only happens in my head.

I tried a DELECTABLE bit of truffled oil induced scrambled eggs....just drooling thinking about it!  

I personally had the Eggs Beneditto....which was a poached egg served on top of crispy layer of pancetta and crusted bread doused with a creamy lemony truffle hollandaise sauce...yummm

And my bf had baked eggs with basil, cheese, and tomato sauce....equally yummy. 

Anyways - i know Lady Marmalade seems to be the 'it' brunch local in the Leslieville neighborhood...but really...I think Lil Baci might be just the ticket to brunch heaven that I have been dying to find!!!

Check it out...no lines - and DELICIOUS FOOD!"}
{"text":"3/5
cute little trendy joint this is.  great atnosphere and good potential to be great.  the food was decent not incredible nor gourmet nor advamced for its calibur.  but good/okay. didnt blow me away pizza was salty and oily. beer was flat.
and to honest service was unenthused, lacking and seemed a little unattentive and careless."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch as was my couple of dinners long ago. Had duck Baci balls with poached eggs. All very yummy. Everything looked good on the menu and as much with what I saw the other diners having.
Service was fast, efficient, and friendly."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place accidentally but glad we did. Nice ambiance and amazing food as well as a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Papardelle with roasted duck, pork ,and cabbage. Enough said. Apparently they are known for their pizza here but I opted for pasta and it was good (although lacking a little something I can't put my finger on...some kind of spice?). Despite that, the overall experience was great. Our waiter was funny and polite, though he could have been slightly more attentive. The ambiance is very inviting - dimly lit, conversational but not too loud....and decent selection of bars in the hood for an after dinner night cap. Oh and a fantastic selection of reasonably priced wines.

I would like to see a little more \"jazz\" in the menu? I don't know, a little kick goes a long way. I've had better Italian elsewhere. Otherwise, OK spot for an OK dinner! Good date spot too."}
{"text":"Ok so I'll admit that my friend and I meant to have brunch at Lady Marmalade right next door to this place but there was a line out the door. Luckily, I had already noticed this place when we passed it and good thing the food the people sitting right by the large front windows were eating looked appetizing (or maybe I was famished from a morning of swimming at Jimmie Simpson) because that's when I said \"Ok, let's just go here!\".

I'm not usually one to crave or go out searching for Italian food, so I was curious what an Italian place (because how Italian is the name \"Lil' Baci\" even) had to offer for brunch. I go out for brunch quite often so I was hoping there was going to be something quite unique on this menu. While Eggs Benedict is my go-to, I decided to order their \"Baci Balls\" and Eggs. 

Food took a little on the long side to arrive but probably because of the busy Sunday morning brunch crowd. I'll let it slide since we just wandered in on a whim anyway. When it arrived, I was pleased with what I saw... I love places that give you both a salad and potatoes side! I liked the bread for our toast though I kind of wished there had been butter on it (or there had been some on the table). The Baci Balls themselves (I got the Classic) were like giant meatballs smothered in tomato (marinara?) sauce alongside poached eggs. I'm personally not the biggest tomato sauce fan but once I broke the egg yolk and swirled everything around and dipped my toast in it, it wasn't that big of a deal. I actually ended up wiping up every last drop with my toast.

If you're into spicy, they offer chili oil, which I appreciated on my potatoes."}
{"text":"Lamb meatballs,  garlic rapini and charred cauliflower do not disappoint. My daughter
 had the pizza Margeurite and mud pie for dessert, both of which she enjoyed. A friend had a pasta dish which looked lovely. They don't have gluten free pasta or pizza which is disappointing and I have found the red wine a little warm, but this place remains a go to favourite."}
{"text":"Had great brunch here on a Saturday morning, with no line-ups and great service.  Menu was short and choices all sounded delicious. 

I got the eggs benny and loved that all potatoes were cooked in duck fat, and soft on the inside but crispy outside."}
{"text":"What happened to L'il Bacci? Doesn't seem very long ago that it was a brand new addition to the Leslieville strip, and trying effortlessly to please. Last weeks lunch though, didn't please at all. The pizza was mediocre, service was spotty, and the music was obnoxious. To be fair, the soup was excellent, but didn't make up for the rest of the meal.

A dinner in the summer was equally uneven. We sat on the patio and were attended to by a friendly server. While the arugula salad was delightfully satisfying, the spaghetti al limone (at $17) was not. Overpriced, and under flavoured, it was a dry and disappointing execution of a simple dish that could have been delicious on a warm evening. 

Too bad, because from the outside, it's so pretty."}
{"text":"Was trying to go Fare Bistro but found out that they were closed due to some water main issue (no clue). So we wandered down to Lil' Baci. Boy was that a great decision or what. Had really great food and fantastic service.

Menu is relatively simple at only one page in length. There's plenty of wines and also a selection of Ontario microbreweries on tap. We selected the mezzo e mezzo (half cheese half smoke meat) and caprese salad to start. Then we had the pasta del giorno and one other pasta that was on the menu (name currently escapes me right now). The pastas were the good old fashioned kind, nothing crazy. Simple ingredients just like they do it Italy. The gelato's were eye-catching but we were already stuffed to the gills before the main courses arrived. 

The service was friendly and attentive. They all seemed to be quite cheerful as they were constantly humming along to the music that was playing over the music system. They also had a sense of humor and seemed to actually enjoy working together.

I've been to Mercatto, Terroni, and Lil' Baci and right now I have to say that this one reigns supreme."}
{"text":"I was here last night for dinner - scored a great seat on the back patio (yay!).  The pizza was tasty - I like that the pizza is super thin...even though the crust is thicker (I don't like eating crust anyway).  I ordered the Nonna - Delish!  I was surprisingly full, even though it didn't look big, it felt it!  I love this place for the atmosphere, the patio, it's a great neighbourhood joint, that has good food, and serves beer"}
{"text":"im kinda pissed.

45 minutes before its arrival: i said, \"okay, now, we have to (i have to) take pictures of these pizzas before we bite into them...for yelp\".

25 minutes before arrival:  pangs have begun;  me want food.

10 minutes before arrival:  house guest arrives, gab session starts.

time of arrival:  clear the kitchen table, willy nilly,  open three pizza boxes, couple salad containers, grab plates, forks, knives and a little wine.

GORGE.

45 minutes after time of arrival:  dammit.  forgot to take pictures.

so folks, no pictures of three pretty good pizzas we ordered.  we got one pizza that was called the margherita americana which was mozzarella, basil, tomato sauce.  the next was called the polpettino which was small meatballs the size of small gobstoppers or maltesers, some basil, mozzarella and tomato sauce.  finally, there was the funghi with crimini mushrooms, taleggio, sage and truffle oil.  

they were all very thin dough with great consistency which i love and simple.  the truffle oil was awesome.  the tomato sauce was quite tangy, the basil refreshing AND WE HAVE LEFTOVERS.  (nothing better than pizza for leftovers.)

the two salads we got were a caprese and an arugala with beets and goat cheese.  those were AWESOME, especially the bufala mozzarella in the caprese, so soft and fluffy.

overall i thought the food was quite tasty, but not necessarily worth spending the seventy dollars we spent on it.  at the same time, i was sated so perhaps the crux of it there and it was worth it.

so then hugs and little bacis to you lil' and thanks for the good ol italian home grub."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the city. My only complaint is that it gets a little chilly in the winter! The service is also good."}
{"text":"I've heard many great things about Lil' Baci's brunch menu, but decided to try it out for dinner.  We started with an order of burrata (burrata, cherry tomatoes, arugula, basil and olive oil).  I LOVE burrata, and I know it is typically a pricey cheese, but $19.95 seems a little steep for the amount of cheese that is served in this appetizer.  But it was delicious!

I ordered ricotta cavatelli for my main dish (ricotta cavatelli pasta with brussel sprouts, shallots, roast cherry tomatoes, butter, parsley and parmesan cheese).  You could definitely tell the pasta was house-made - it tasted fresh.  Definitely an interesting combination - I've never had brussel sprouts in pasta.  The dish was good, but not great.  And again, $19.95 seems a little steep for the portion served.

Our server was great; she was friendly and very helpful with my questions about the menu.  

I would definitely return to Lil' Baci to try the brunch menu, but I don't think I would return for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Walking into this space the vibes were great! A little casual, trendy and throw in some hipster aura. Out back in the minimalistic patios, it's quite nice even under the blistering afternoon sun. This was going to be a good one I felt. The menu just looks fantastic with interesting items and of course their own signature Lil' Baci dishes.

How can anyone resist gourmet meatballs? Especially one with their own name on it. With alluring flavours like truffles and turducken how can anyone possibly resist?

Two words would describe these balls; unfulfilled potential. Turducken in a ball sure sounds a lot tastier than it did. While the ball was tender it seriously lacked in the flavour and texture department. I wish they had used some herbs to elevate the flavours. The mish-mash of duck, chicken and turkey was difficult to decipher; what am I eating really? It all tasted like chicken in the end. Somehow, meatballs were void of any substantial meat flavours or that meaty texture. The cream sauce that it's bathed in is well...creamy. Void of much salt, herbs or any flavours for that matter. But perhaps the greatest disappointment of all came down to the duck fat potatoes. I could live or die by those words. The very thought of this stuff gets my pulse racing a bit and sweat coming out of my pores. Not these potatoes. Dried and void of any flavours is really the theme here. Last but not least, it was like salt on the wound to have my egg fully cooked; yes, a pan fried egg with a yolk solid as a snooker ball. I was confused and in a bit of disbelief but long behold my partner has her eggs the same way. Perhaps, I am just bringing drama but I haven't met anyone who would ask for their egg yolks well done in my life recently.

It saddens me a little that such a fantastic space with a cute name, great menu items and fantastic service would serve up mediocrity so well."}
{"text":"Lil' Baci is great. There are a number of restaurants in the same vicinity as Lil' Baci but this is one of the few that stands out. The pizza is delicious, they have a great drink menu and draft beer selection, a good atmosphere and a back patio!

My favourite pizza is the Funghi pizza. It has mushrooms and truffle oil, how can you go wrong with truffle oil? This is a white pizza so there is no tomato sauce. While I think it's the best tasting pizza I've had at Lil' Baci, I think it's best to go with someone else and order this pizza with another more traditional pizza so you get the best of both worlds. 

Other pizzas I've tired are the Fiamma and one with housemade meatballs on it (I believe it was the special that evening). Both were good traditional pizza. Nothing too adventurous just classic delicious pizza. 

Portion size is great. One pizza per person if you're hungry. Even when I'm starving I usually end up with one piece left which is always a treat the next day for lunch. Still it's best to partner up and order two so you get a variety. 

The only thing I've been somewhat disappointed with were the Crostini. We ordered the three for $8 and tried all three that they had on special that evening. One of them (beet and goat cheese) was particularly good, the other two were just \"meh\". All in all, I don't think they were worth the $8 and I'll probably just stick to ordering pizza in the future. 

Brownie points for having house made sparkling water available at no cost! Great added perk."}
{"text":"I've been for both brunch and dinner here. Brunch was definitely a better choice, with their great egg dishes and a selection of their classic Baci Balls or meatballs. Try the lamb meatballs, they're excellent. Dinner is a hit or miss, wouldn't say it's the greatest Italian food out there for the price, but generally still nice vibes."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza....better than the usual chain joints like Mamma's, Pizza Pizza. A small cut above Pizza Nova. Kind of like Pizzaiola. 

But not good enough to invade your daydreams.

Libretto is much much better."}
{"text":"The patio is truly gorgeous and the food is okay. I ordered the homemade brioche french toast ($13.95) and an OJ-less mimosa (they ran out).

The service is as slow as ever - our hostess forgot about us and it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive. On top of this, the restaurant wasn't packed and it was difficult to flag our server down. 

There are plenty of other great brunch spots around."}
{"text":"Ordered two meals,  waited an hour into it and they returned saying that they lost our orders. Said you will only wait another five to seven minutes,  been awhile..... Waitress and environment is nice though"}
{"text":"Lil' Baci is a wonderful Leslieville spot. We walked in and it was busy and when we left it was twice as busy. Not sure if they take reservations but there always seemed to be a line...and we were there on a Thursday night. The waiter was brilliant in our opinion, but others could find him overbearing. We enjoyed his playful banter. The food was perfect...litterally. I shared the gnocci and a pizza (veg), an appetizers of white bean bread thingys and a delicious beet salad. We are going back as soon as possible. Personally, I love the wine in the stubby glasses rather than \"traditional\" wine glasses...and these people do it right."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Sunday morning with a friend, just before the brunchtime rush. I ordered the spicy pork Baci balls with poached eggs. Balls were tasty with a good consistency (heh), and the eggs were nicely done as well. The duck-fat potatoes that came with the dish were lacking that extra something, though. Coffee was A-OK. The interior space has character and isn't too cramped, and the front of the house has a lot of natural light coming in. Service was friendly and reasonably quick on top of everything else. Wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"People have called this place a little inconsistent, especially at dinner, and I think that's on the true side. That being said, overall, this place is really a gem on the east side that will continue to get better with polish I hope.

Lunch and dinner are great, with good pizza and good pasta. Pasta prices may be a little high, but not crazily so. It's the brunch that really stands out here.

Over the past few months I've seen most of the menu eaten by one friend or another and everyone has really enjoyed themselves! Personally, I LOVE the eggs Malanzana...which are basically eggplant parmesean with baked eggs on top. Oh, and the rosemary potatoes are some of the best I've ever had. 

So far, everyone who we've taken for brunch here has loved it, and now we never have to suffer through another crappy lady marmalade experience again!"}
{"text":"Had brunch on a Sunday. The tables were wiped with a dirty cloth and I could smell the bacteria on the table. Tap water was served in nice wine bottles.

The brunch food was good quality with good presentation but the toast was paper thin and too well done.

The service was very good and the waiter was cheery.

The price was standard for brunch."}
{"text":"Admittedly, only stopped in for a beer but sometimes that's all it takes! 

The chalkboard is what sold me - I LOVE a good sidewalk chalkboard - and decided to stop in for a pint.  A small bar but plenty of dining room seats if you roll in post-lunch/pre-dinner. Craft beers on tap (had the Side Launch Dark - delicious) and the service was fantastic. 
Pretty sure her name was Molly (think I overheard that) and she was great in that she was real and genuine. That's all I ask for. 

Looking forward to trying out their menu and, as I've since read, their killer back patio!"}
{"text":"Nice place on queen st east. 
Great pasta and pizza selection. 
Enjoyed the beet salad. 
The duck pappardelle pasta was great. 
And the baci was amazing. 
The pizza was nice but I may have picked the wrong one, the Napoli was too salty, and the porchetta pizza was just ok. 
If I go back I'll try something different. 

Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night for dinner. Great service and a nice chill vibe with relatively loud music playing in the background! The guy who was taking care of us was very friendly. I chose the spaghetti with meatballs, and I was very happy with my choice. My partner ordered the potato pizza, and she also liked it."}
{"text":"Came close to giving it four stars! It's a nice environment with friendly staff. However, the pasta was incredibly salty, which is a shame because otherwise it tasted really good. I had a margherita pizza with a glass of Pinot Grigio and I thought they went really well together. A bit on the pricey side for what you get, but I'd splurge here again with friends or a date."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time recently a little hesitant after reading some mixed reviews of the place.  Fortunately, I came out with a rather favourable opinion of the place.  

When we walked in the door, I was immediately impressed by the cool and spacious interiors of the place, something I definitely did not expect from the outside. We were led through the restaurant to this great back patio that had some tree coverage and felt very cool despite the summer heat.

The service from beginning to end was excellent.  Our server was friendly and engaging but not to the point of being overly involved in our dinner.  He offered good suggestions while we browsed the menu, all which proved to be very beneficial in the end.  Something I definitely appreciated was his candor when we asked about certain dishes;  I always like when people are honest when something on the menu isn't the best.

The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars was the food itself.  We ordered the Nonna and Marcos pizzas to share.  While both were tasty, the toppings were a little sparse and one of the two was a little too burnt for our liking.  Despite that, we left satisfied, and would consider coming back another time to give it a second go.

While not as good as the higher end pizza places popping up in the neighborhood, Lil' Baci is a decent restaurant with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, good atmosphere and a great butternut squash salad. Our server was proactive about a mistake and quickly offered up an apology and a free dessert."}
{"text":"The food's quite alright and offers good value in terms of what you're getting for the price. Interesting flavours. I had the Cracked Napoleon dessert once and that was phenomenal. However, the service is really slow - it took about 15 minutes for someone to ask us for drink orders and a further 20 for the food to come during brunch hours. It's a good spot to take a date or to catch up with a small gaggle of women because you have the luxury of time and the atmosphere is casual yet still kinda fancy."}
{"text":"I was not crazy about Lil' Bacci when the patio club I participate in met there on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  

The good:
1. They have an excellent value-priced lunch combo here for $10.  For that ten dollars, you get your choice of soup or salad and your choice of a small (which is HUGE) personal pizza, a calzone or a pasta dish.  That is AWESOME value.  
2. They have good draught beers (which are not that cheap)
3. Their patio looks really cool but I haven't enjoyed any beverages out there yet.
4. Staff was good

The bad:
1. I didn't like my food.  I am torn between 2 or 3 stars here... because the lunch combo for $10 is SO good on paper.
2. I had a salad, which was mostly dandelion leaves.  It SAID dandelion in the menu, but I thought that that meant there would be a FEW yellow flowers in the salad, but really, it was a BIG plate (did I mention they have very generous portions?) of dandelion LEAVES, with olive oil and sea salt.  Sondra had soup instead of salad, and it looked REALLY good, and I should have had that.
3. Pizza - the pizza does not come cut into slices.  This was a huge WTF to me and it really pissed me off.  They had el-cheapo steak knives at the table which we all struggled to use to cut our pizzas.  My pizza was also pretty weak.  It was skimpy on the toppings and the prosciutto was in huge, whole piece slabs, that further frustrated my attempts at slicing the dang thing up.  Again, Sondra had gnocci and it looked stellar so maybe I just got the wrong thing.

Overall, I would go here on a sunny day and check out the patio for beers, but I probably wouldn't get food (even though at lunch it's very affordable)."}
{"text":"This is a solid neighbourhood pizza joint.  Sure they've got some pasta dishes and meatier entrees, but fundamentally, it's a pizza place, and it's reliably good at serving up tasty pizza.

We've been here four or five times.  Somebody ordered pasta once, which was kinda ok - not horrid, but not great.  Everybody's enjoyed their pizza though. They've got enough different options that you can find something you'll like.

Appetizers and salads are generally good, and the wine & beer list is pretty well matched to what they're serving.

And it's neighbourhood-y - the kind of place you're happy to drop into for no particular reason other than the desire to eat out.  Not fancy. Comfortable (though the benches can be hard on your butt after a while).  Loud (louder than I'd like, but loudness seems to be trendy).  

Service is generally good and friendly, though servers can be distracted and less than attentive at times.

One of the better places to eat in Leslieville, which is why we keep going back."}
{"text":"ADORE this place! I live in the West end but will definitely travel to make this my Italian standby.

I had a negroni for the first time and got the olives with it. It was so good. 
The burratta feature was burrata with corn, basil and red onions. It was very good.
I also had 2 desserts - the tiramisu was very good. The broken napolean was recommended but I was not a fan of it.

I am definitely going to go back. I could go back twice a month!"}
{"text":"To be honest, my boyfriend and I were trying to get into Lady Marmalade, but the line up was just too long for brunch. We walked by this place enroute to Bonjour Brioche to check out the line up there and were quite intrigued by the menu. The place was busy with lots of holiday parties going on and we thought  \"why not?\" 

We were greeted immediately by a really tall host, who we later found out was pulling triple duties as a server and the bartender as well. 

The atmosphere was friendly, however very loud. We realized it was because the music was way too loud, which caused everyone to have to yell over each other and the music to hear themselves.

Service was great despite there being only 2 people (including the host/bartender).

We order a pizza, meatballs and a kale salad.

I can't remember which pizza we ordered, but I believe it had spicy sausage on it. It was delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with ordering any of the other pizza's either. 

The meatballs were good considering I'm not a huge fan of meatballs, but my boyfriend loved them. 

The Kale salad was good. A very large portion with deep green kale leaves, unlike the chopped kale at grocery stores. Ask for the Pancetta and bread crumbs on the side if you're looking for something healthy. 

All in all, it was well priced fare and a good experience. 

3.5 overall."}
{"text":"Even though I really liked the interior and they apparently have a kick ass back patio (which sadly, was full when we arrived), the food here at Lil' Baci was really completely 3 star.

The menu is small-ish and consists of 5-6 pastas, 10 or so pizzas, a few salads and some typical Italian appetizers. They also have a chalk board wall with daily specials.

We tried 4 different pizzas. The pizzas came with paper-thin crust in the middle but the outer edge of crust was thicker and quite dry. The Nonna was probably the nicest one (eggplant, basil and goats cheese topping). The daily special was a white pizza (that means no tomato sauce) with pork belly and some other odd sounding ingredients. It was OK. The tomato sauce, basil and sausage pizza was not very good. 

Pizzas were priced from $12-$17.

Service got off to a slow start but once our server appeared he was friendly and speedy. They were awesome at bringing water to the table a zillion times and we never had to ask.

Overall, nice place inside - great interior - but food was really 3 star so I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"If you're in the heart of Leslieville and start craving pizza, I'd highly recommend Lil Baci! I've had almost every pizza on their menu and love the vibe of the location. It's always a great time when the owner of the restaurant is there, he's super casual and always good for a laugh. It's a great place for friends and family."}
{"text":"great food, beautiful place, amazing service would definitely come back for another brunch"}
{"text":"Lil' Baci is another random places that I followed a group of Yelpers here during our A night of drinking in Riverdale drinking crawl. 

I really want to sit at Lil's Baci back patio!! But it was packed.........and ended up have to sit near the washroom...........boo...... 

The interior is nicely decorated with dim lighting and a rustic feel. A little too dark for good looking food photos though. 

Pizza Pizza and more Pizza........ If you like eating pizza, you will find it A-OK. But if you not into pizza, you better go to other restaurants in the area.. 

The 4 pizzas that I tried none of them were outstanding. I have to agreed with my fellow dinner mates that the thick and doughy crust was really disappointing! I like the Pizza Margherita the best... simple, tasty and saucy... 

I don't mind coming to Lil' Baci to share some pizza with friends if I am in the area... or have the lunch specials... but definitely not going to make a special trip to eat here!"}
{"text":"THE MENU:  

90% pizza, 5% pasta, 5% salads (Note: This is a rough weighting.  Just in case someone decides to validate my math).  Lil' Baci is a pizza place through and through.  Oddly enough, there was only one pizza that caught my eye out of fifteen or so (it was the Nonna).  Just personal preference as I like my pizza the western way...loaded with toppings.  These were limited to just a few items, which might be your thang.   I also love the eclectic feel of chalkboards that double as menus in restaurants like this.  I dig it even more when the menu items they feature  on those chalkboards are accurate. 

After scanning the \"Antipasti\" menu board, I had my heart set on 2 items: rapini and squash.  That's when the waitress unapologetically stated, \"Those are wrong\".  [Um...I don't think Lil' Baci got the memo that chalkboards are meant to be erased and updated.]  She then looked irritated when I requested the real options and ignored those at the end of the table when they asked her to repeat them.
 
OUR ORDER: 

There were 8 entrees and 7 apps ordered, mostly duplicates. So I'll cover the ones that were closest to me. Note: not everything you see here is Paleo but I'm using the \"It's my birthday and I can eat whatever I want\" card.
 
*Beet Salad - Oh how I love the sweetness of roasted beets paired with salty, smooth goat cheese (my first bite of cheese since the 30-day Paleo challenge ended).  It was all served on a bed of arugula.  You know how I feel about arugula!  This salad hit the spot.  But Keith's basic salad was just that.  Basic.  Dressing wasn't that flavourful and there was nothing more than a pile of lettuce leaves on a plate for $7 or so.

*Chicken Leg Special - I was in a restaurant that clearly specialized in pizza, but I decided to go gluten-free and get their only non-pizza or pasta dish - the roasted chicken-leg special with grilled dandelions and lentils.   What an idiotic and amateur move for a foodie.  The chicken dish wasn't even on their printed menu so it likely wasn't something they make everyday nor had perfected.  That was clear when it arrived at the table.  I would use these words to describe my meal...dry, blah and blah.

 *Polpettina Pizza - According to Keith, his order was a dud.  Sparse toppings, low-profile flavour. BUT the crust was perfectly crusty.  Not so thin that the dough gets soggy.

*Nonna Pizza - If I wasn't trying to be \"good\" I would have been all over this - eggplant, onions, goat cheese and a mound of my new favourite leaf, arugula.  Instead, I convinced my father that this was the pizza for him.  I knew he would share the love (being the generous, selfless father that he is) if my dish was a flop.  Based on the above review, I took advantage of his offer with a couple bites.  Then, when he was full and distracted, I snuck a few more nibbles (enough to devour a whole slice). I learned later that those extra slices were intentional, and were supposed to be his lunch.  Oops.

*Tiramisu - Aah,  Tiramisu.  The Italian go-to dessert that CAN go wrong.   This version had just the right amount of mascarpone (if you love mascarpone) vs coffee-drenched biscuits (if you dislike coffee). It also turned out to be the only dessert menu item (out of 3 featured) that was available. Again...they didn't get the memo about the chalkboards.  Although, nice of them to serve it with candles while my family embarrased me singing Happy Birthday.  As good as the Tiramisu was, it didn't fit the bill as a \"birthday cake\".  So I ordered another dessert (the only other option).

*Ricotta Cake - We all jumped to conclusions when we heard ricotta.  Our minds went like this... Ricotta = cheese. Therefore Ricotta Cake = Cheesecake.  Wrong.  This was way more cake than it was cheesecake.  It had a few sparse blueberries tucked inside and was covered in whipped cream.  This was not worth the calories, insulin spike and Paleo-cheat.  No one seemed to be eating it so I kept picking away mindlessly.  At one point, I realized there were just a few bites left and stated \"I don't even like this, so why am I eating it all\".  I kept picking until it was gone.

{"text":"Lady Marmalade had such long line ups, so we tried this neighbouring joint instead. It was still very busy during prime brunch time, but we were lucky to be able to get seated quickly. No regrets at all! I decided to forgo the regular eggs benedict I crave for and ordered the French brioche toast with pancetta. The lightly sweetened eggy and puffy toast just paired so well with the salty crispy pancetta bacon. It just hit the spot! Such an indulgence to layer it together in each bite. 

I also tried a bit of the Turducken meatball and liked it. It was soaked in what seems like a mushroom soup sauce. I can appreciate the variety that dish offers such as some salad to balance the meal. 

Overall an enjoyable experience and the staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is great, decent prices, but server was very inattentive. I was seated on the patio at lunchtime on a Tuesday. Only a couple other tables were seated outside- there was not a lunch rush by any means. Server walked right past me at least three times as I sat there ready to order. I had to walk inside the restaurant to let them know I was still outside- ready to order.

When the food came it was great, I ordered the Tonno sandwich (Tuna) with olives, arugula and sundriedtomatoes. The salad was limp, bitter and a little too dressed for my taste. 

I ordered beer but the server had no idea what a lager was. She went inside to inquire about the bar menu. When she returned and took my order, she came back 10 minutes later to tell me they are out of the beer I ordered. I asked what else was on tap and she had to go back inside to find out (there are only 5 or 6 different beers on tap here)

When I was ready for the bill, the busboy came outside to cash me out.  Great location for patio dining- but it took me an hour to get one great sandwich, mediocre salad and a beer."}
{"text":"This is the coziest little restaurant on Queen East. I came for dinner so I can't speak to their brunch. 

We had reservations and ended up coming early and were seated promptly. Shared a half bottle of sparkling wine and we each ordered something different. 

I went w/ the lil baci balls (delicious) and a side of polenta. The serving of polenta as a side was quite large. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I took one star off as I feel some menu items were slightly overpriced. But all in all a great place!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the bread that comes before your meal.  Bread that's still free.  Bread that's warm.  Bread that is worth starting a street fight over.  With someone much much bigger.  Then roll from there and you can't go wrong.  The food is fast, simple, consistent and delicious.  There Is nothing on the menu that involves 'foam' (except the Peroni on draft) or that could be considered trendy.  Try the Papa pizza, my kids ask for it by name.  The baci balls are killer and the kale salad hits the spot when you are trying to be good.  In the summer the back patio is packed with families by 6 and the second shift of the kidless arrives by 7.  And yes, it is packed because they are super kid friendly - not in the crayon-and-kid- menu kind of way, but in the parents-want-to-go-too-and-some-kids-can-actually-handle-a-place-other-than-Boston-Pizza sort of way.  Come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland, outdated food with mean portions. Came here with a group of friends on a weekend evening and the atmosphere was cute enough. Our server was very friendly and gregarious, although another server who occasionally cleared our table and kept our drinks stocked was unbelievably rude. Food took over an hour to arrive at the table and was hardly worth the wait.

A communal order of meatballs yielded six meatballs (two pork, rabbit, and lamb - each pair in a different sauce). The meatballs were about the size of large gumballs, so we each got a few crumbs of meat. The sauce in which the meatballs were served, however, was delicious - particularly the lamb.

A charcuterie platter yielded a few slices of meat and cheese and some side dishes, and - like the meatballs - it was way overpriced for what arrived.

A friend's tomato and mozzarella salad was an embarrassment: a whole, small tomato cut into three or four slices, between which were shoved a few paltry morsels of cheese. $10 for that, folks.

The dandelion salad came Yelp recommended so I gave it a shot. A bunch of soggy, hideous leaves appeared in a bowl. I could see how the salad might've been nice but it was drenched in vinaigrette. Every forkful was dripping with it, and it killed the flavour of the dandelion itself, as well as the anchovies and the garlic.

The pizzas were a nice size and attractive, but my mushroom, gorgonzola, and truffle oil pizza tasted like something I'd make in my countertop mini-oven when I was hungover. It was just \"something to eat\", but it had no particular flavour. A pizza with those toppings should taste light but decadent. This tasted light but stingy and boring.

With the exception of the pizzas, which are quite large, the portion sizes are too small for what is offered and how it's presented. When I get teensy blobs of food, it had better offer complex tastes that demand contemplation rather than gorging. It should also be presented attractively, and call attention to its artfulness rather than just let you know that it's there and that you can eat it. Given the lack of care that went into my food and the food ordered by my friends, Lil' Baci should be serving up mountains of its boring, outdated, ugly food. Giving people a trendy handful of bland, lukewarm stuff isn't going to fool them into thinking that they're eating haute cuisine.

Definitely won't be coming back, although judging how rammed the place was, they won't be hurting from my absence. The high attendance makes me wonder what kind of Italian food all those patrons are used to eating."}
{"text":"The food at lil baci was great, but the service was quite disappointing. We made our reservation on open table about twenty mins before we got there. When we walked in, we were ignored for close to ten mins and when the hostess did finally come by, chastised us for not calling when we made our reservation. Umm, excuse me, if you use a reservation system like open table then I'm not required to call as an add on to my reservation. 

She reluctantly seated us, and once we were seated no one came by to ask about either drinks or food for close to twenty mins. The server that did finally show up was lovely but it took her ages to just bring a plate of bread to our table. 

The food however was amazing, so I'd go back, but this is just a note to watch out and not get on the hostess' bad side."}
{"text":"Lil' Baci is decidedly Italian, from the perfect pronunciation of the menu items to the beverage choices (Brio, Orangina, San Pellegrino). FYI they do not offer iced tea.

Our server, Justin, was cheerful and outgoing, bordering on overbearing at times. I suppose it's a nice change of pace from the snobbery one endures at other Italian restaurants in the city, but I couldn't but think that such a gregarious person might be better suited working in a children's restaurant, say Chuck E Cheese. He was so chatty he practically sat down with us and joined in on our meal. ***

I ordered the Quatro Formaggio pizza ($13.95) with gorgonzola, mozzarella, provolone, parmagiano and fresh basil. In the \"true Italian style\" your pizza does not come pre-sliced. You have to \"ask for help\" (am I a kid??) but luckily Justin was happy to oblige. I'm sure he would have hand-fed it to me had I asked. 

Skip the spinach and lemon gnocchi.

After dinner we had to indulge in two BabyCake cupcakes - Thumper's Odyssey (carrot cake w/ cream cheese frosting) and PB&B (peanut butter and banana). Both very tasty - cupcakes are made on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays so keep that in mind if you want the best selection and also the freshest batch.

$45 for two people.

*** Ironically when we wanted the bill he was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"One Saturday we decided to head to Leslieville for some ice cream/gelato but had to find a place for to eat first. We decided on LIL' BACI (@LilBaci) since I received a Strum reward for a free pizza. We pass by it many time and never thought of going in during the day since it always look empty....
The reason why it look so empty up front was because everyone was at the cute back patio....

Raspberry Lemonade $3.50 & Lil' Baci Bloody Caesar $7 

  Lil Baci Baked Eggs $12
~ two eggs, roasted tomato, smoked provolone, Italian sausage, basil
 ~ Love this; it was hot, warm, yummy and comforting. 
~ Def not your usual boring egg & sausage or poached eggs. 
~ All the flavor are just right without being too heavy or salty.

 Margherita Pizza $13
~ tomato, basil, mozzarella
~ Got this with my free Strum reward, love the crispy thin crust and the fresh basil on top that was put on after being bake. 
~ My only complain, the cheese was a bit on the salty side which cover up the yummy flavor of the tomato sauce.

Verdict :
Nice back patio for brunch
Love the Baked Eggs, def a must try
Giving 3-stars only because we only tried 2 things for brunch"}
{"text":"I had brunch here recently, and it was delicious and but not without some kinks.

It was a really busy sunny Sunday in Leslieville, so the place was packed and we ended up sitting at the bar, which was not so bad.

I had a caesar (nothing special, missing celery) and truffled eggs. The eggs were amazing but my toast was burnt, and they put the eggs on the toast... so it's like they purposefully hid their mistake. My cousin and buddy Rob was kind enough to switch with me, as he is okay with crispy toast. Or, just felt bad for me. Anyway, with the toast done properly the food was delicious. Can't go wrong with truffles!

There is also a brunch manager or owner woman who is kind of bossy and rude to the employees but phoney kind with patrons. This aways annoys me, and any customer sitting at the bar would have noticed. Be kind to your servers who are working their butts off, it's not their fault you're miserable.

I do want to return for the breakfast pizza. Dipping a nice crust in fried eggs? Sounds good!"}
{"text":"Planned to have brunch at Lady marmalade, however there was a line up, so we decided to go for alternative. Lil' Baci didn't disappoint. It was busy but no waiting. Got baked eggs with tomato sauce and eggplant, it was delicious; loved the strong tomato taste. The only complaint was the noise level was pretty high, I felt like I have to shout a bit."}
